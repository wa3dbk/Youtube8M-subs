weirdest<00:00:08.460> knife<00:00:09.059> mechanism<00:00:09.929> I've<00:00:10.050> ever<00:00:10.320> seen

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
weirdest knife mechanism I've ever seen

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.600 
weirdest knife mechanism I've ever seen
this<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.880> how<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.210> opens<00:00:12.650> there<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.889> go<00:00:14.099> weird

this is how it opens there you go weird

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.880 
this is how it opens there you go weird

design you have seen it now now you can

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.510 
design you have seen it now now you can
stop<00:00:17.310> watching<00:00:19.070> seriously<00:00:20.070> though<00:00:20.279> I

reviewed this knife a while ago mainly
for<00:00:23.609> my<00:00:23.699> subscribers<00:00:23.939> as<00:00:24.720> well<00:00:24.750> as<00:00:25.050> people<00:00:25.470> in

general who are interested in knives but
somehow<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.710> went<00:00:28.949> viral<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> lot<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
somehow it went viral and a lot of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.020 
somehow it went viral and a lot of
people<00:00:30.570> ended<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.289> watching<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.130> they

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
people ended up watching it and they

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.970 
people ended up watching it and they
complained<00:00:33.690> about<00:00:33.870> me<00:00:34.260> talking<00:00:34.500> too<00:00:34.739> much<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
complained about me talking too much and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.400 
complained about me talking too much and
not<00:00:35.309> showing<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> knife<00:00:36.000> enough<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.230> we

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
not showing the knife enough so here we

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.270 
not showing the knife enough so here we
go<00:00:37.649> very<00:00:38.250> slow<00:00:38.820> opening<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.870> closing<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.129> that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
go very slow opening and closing so that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.650 
go very slow opening and closing so that
everybody<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:41.910> see<00:00:42.239> how<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.780> works<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
everybody can see how this works and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.389 
everybody can see how this works and
some<00:00:45.660> close-ups<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.190> how<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
some close-ups here this is how the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.840 
some close-ups here this is how the
mechanism<00:00:48.030> snaps<00:00:48.450> into<00:00:48.719> place<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.820> it<00:00:50.820> also

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
mechanism snaps into place and it also

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.439 
mechanism snaps into place and it also
has<00:00:51.329> safety<00:00:52.230> right<00:00:52.739> there

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
has safety right there

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.299 
has safety right there
what<00:00:54.449> that's<00:00:54.629> supposed<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.680> when<00:00:56.129> it's

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
what that's supposed to do is when it's

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.290 
what that's supposed to do is when it's
closed<00:00:56.840> you<00:00:57.840> use<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.500> safety<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.370> basically

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
closed you use the safety to basically

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.340 
closed you use the safety to basically
just<00:01:00.570> lock<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.020> up<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.510> when<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.899> safety<00:01:04.140> is

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
just lock it up so when the safety is

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.170 
just lock it up so when the safety is
engaged<00:01:05.090> they<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.659> see<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:07.140> closed<00:01:08.180> not

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
engaged they you can see it's closed not

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.390 
engaged they you can see it's closed not
opening<00:01:09.600> although<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.470> safety<00:01:10.890> feels<00:01:11.130> kind

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
opening although the safety feels kind

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
opening although the safety feels kind
of<00:01:11.430> flimsy<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.180> who<00:01:12.360> knows<00:01:12.540> how<00:01:12.869> long<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
of flimsy so who knows how long that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.850 
of flimsy so who knows how long that
would<00:01:13.560> actually<00:01:14.280> work<00:01:14.780> but<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.320> knife<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
would actually work but this knife is

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.359 
would actually work but this knife is
actually<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.490> cheap<00:01:18.450> Chinese<00:01:18.500> ripoff<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:20.189> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
actually a cheap Chinese ripoff there is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
actually a cheap Chinese ripoff there is
a<00:01:20.400> custom<00:01:21.030> knife<00:01:21.210> maker<00:01:21.240> called<00:01:21.990> Scorpio

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
a custom knife maker called Scorpio

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.420 
a custom knife maker called Scorpio
design<00:01:23.130> who<00:01:23.790> makes<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.650> series<00:01:25.650> called<00:01:25.950> shape

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
design who makes a series called shape

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.569 
design who makes a series called shape
shifter<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.409> that<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.560> clearly<00:01:28.920> where<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
shifter and that is clearly where that

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.060 
shifter and that is clearly where that
design<00:01:29.909> was<00:01:30.090> taken<00:01:30.240> from<00:01:30.560> by<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.590> way<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:32.009> case

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
design was taken from by the way in case

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.800 
design was taken from by the way in case
you're<00:01:32.400> thinking<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.000> dangerous

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you're thinking this is dangerous

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.770 
you're thinking this is dangerous
nope<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.460> cannot<00:01:35.850> close<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.630> your

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
nope it is not it cannot close on your

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.270 
nope it is not it cannot close on your
hand<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.250> that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
hand if you have it in there like that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.649 
hand if you have it in there like that
the<00:01:39.240> opening<00:01:40.549> parts<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.030> grip<00:01:42.270> actually

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the opening parts of the grip actually

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.929 
the opening parts of the grip actually
push<00:01:42.990> against<00:01:43.409> your<00:01:43.530> palm<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.520> cannot

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
push against your palm so it cannot

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.450 
push against your palm so it cannot
close<00:01:45.210> any<00:01:45.509> further<00:01:45.810> than<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.310> is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
close any further than that so it is

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.240 
close any further than that so it is
actually<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.909> pretty<00:01:48.390> safe<00:01:48.750> design<00:01:49.250> overall

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
actually a pretty safe design overall

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.850 
actually a pretty safe design overall
but<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.390> problem<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.110> particular<00:01:52.470> one

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
but the problem with this particular one

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.270 
but the problem with this particular one
is<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.130> well<00:01:53.670> they<00:01:54.240> use<00:01:54.509> cheap<00:01:54.869> materials

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
is that well they use cheap materials

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.280 
is that well they use cheap materials
very<00:01:56.280> cheap<00:01:56.759> steel<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.450> barely<00:01:57.750> holds<00:01:58.200> an

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
very cheap steel that barely holds an

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.520 
very cheap steel that barely holds an
edge<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:59.390> the<00:02:00.390> overall<00:02:00.719> construction<00:02:01.020> is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
edge and the overall construction is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.300 
edge and the overall construction is
well<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.579> not<00:02:02.880> terrible<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> cheap<00:02:05.040> knife

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
well it's not terrible for a cheap knife

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.960 
well it's not terrible for a cheap knife
but<00:02:06.350> it's<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.619> course<00:02:07.860> not

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
but it's of course not

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.710 
but it's of course not
really

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
really

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.610 
really
what<00:02:10.290> I<00:02:10.320> would<00:02:10.560> call<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:11.190> sturdy<00:02:11.910> construction

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
what I would call a sturdy construction

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.920 
what I would call a sturdy construction
but<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.650> knife<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.190> very<00:02:14.700> cheap<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.480> can<00:02:15.720> get

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
but the knife is very cheap you can get

but the knife is very cheap you can get
it<00:02:16.050> for<00:02:16.290> less<00:02:16.620> than<00:02:16.890> $10<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.060> at<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.230> price

it for less than $10 and at that price
you<00:02:21.090> can't<00:02:21.510> really<00:02:21.750> expect<00:02:22.170> all<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.590> much

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800
