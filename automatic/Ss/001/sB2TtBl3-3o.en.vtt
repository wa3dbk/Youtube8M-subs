00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
leave all this at home as a way to keep

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.110 
leave all this at home as a way to keep
my<00:04:57.620> decks<00:04:57.860> nice<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:58.340> then<00:04:58.430> maybe<00:04:58.730> use<00:04:58.940> the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
my decks nice and then maybe use the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.690 
my decks nice and then maybe use the
smaller<00:04:59.419> version<00:04:59.900> for<00:05:00.650> just<00:05:00.860> going<00:05:01.010> SNM<00:05:01.550> or

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
smaller version for just going SNM or

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.340 
smaller version for just going SNM or
something<00:05:02.000> like<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.180> but<00:05:02.930> if<00:05:03.020> I<00:05:03.110> was<00:05:03.230> gonna

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
something like that but if I was gonna

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.190 
something like that but if I was gonna
cube<00:05:03.740> or<00:05:04.480> well<00:05:05.480> you<00:05:05.510> can<00:05:05.690> see<00:05:05.810> it's<00:05:05.930> actually

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
cube or well you can see it's actually

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.110 
cube or well you can see it's actually
the<00:05:06.350> top<00:05:06.560> doesn't<00:05:06.890> exactly<00:05:07.130> like<00:05:07.400> just<00:05:07.640> pull

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
the top doesn't exactly like just pull

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.780 
the top doesn't exactly like just pull
up<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.419> easily<00:05:08.930> I<00:05:09.110> mean<00:05:09.410> it's<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:10.400> does<00:05:10.550> keep

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
up and easily I mean it's it does keep

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.370 
up and easily I mean it's it does keep
itself<00:05:11.090> shut<00:05:11.540> under<00:05:11.900> its<00:05:12.050> own<00:05:12.110> weight<00:05:12.169> a

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
itself shut under its own weight a

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.890 
itself shut under its own weight a
little<00:05:12.530> bit<00:05:12.760> but<00:05:13.760> this<00:05:14.390> would<00:05:14.540> be<00:05:14.570> a<00:05:14.630> great<00:05:14.780> way

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
little bit but this would be a great way

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.630 
little bit but this would be a great way
to<00:05:14.930> kind<00:05:15.140> of<00:05:15.290> store<00:05:15.590> maybe<00:05:16.040> a<00:05:16.160> cube<00:05:16.490> or

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
to kind of store maybe a cube or

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.500 
to kind of store maybe a cube or
something<00:05:16.970> like<00:05:17.060> that<00:05:17.300> but<00:05:17.960> also<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:20.210> small

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
something like that but also the small

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.760 
something like that but also the small
version<00:05:20.660> will<00:05:20.900> be<00:05:20.930> kind<00:05:21.230> of<00:05:21.260> a<00:05:21.350> cool<00:05:21.500> thing<00:05:21.560> to

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
version will be kind of a cool thing to

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.040
