00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
to go 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.950 
to go 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1
2<00:03:13.740> 3<00:03:14.280> 4<00:03:14.730> 1<00:03:15.000> 2<00:03:15.210> 3<00:03:15.510> 4<00:03:16.430> ok<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.880> it's<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.210> minor<00:03:18.420> 4<00:03:18.630> 1<00:03:18.750> bar

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
2 3 4 1 2 3 4 ok so it's a minor 4 1 bar

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.510 
2 3 4 1 2 3 4 ok so it's a minor 4 1 bar
1<00:03:19.290> 2<00:03:19.680> 3<00:03:20.070> 4<00:03:20.610> F<00:03:20.910> 2<00:03:21.330> 3<00:03:21.870> 4<00:03:22.320> C<00:03:22.740> 2<00:03:22.770> 3<00:03:23.550> 4<00:03:24.000> 1<00:03:24.450> 2<00:03:24.720> 3<00:03:24.840> 4<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> F

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
1 2 3 4 F 2 3 4 C 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so the F

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.240 
1 2 3 4 F 2 3 4 C 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so the F
actually<00:03:27.240> and<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.110> C<00:03:28.320> has<00:03:28.590> two<00:03:29.010> bars

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
actually and so the C has two bars

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.680 
actually and so the C has two bars
