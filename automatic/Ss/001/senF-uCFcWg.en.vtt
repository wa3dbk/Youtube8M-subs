00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
but if this island is that remote

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.289 
but if this island is that remote
they're<00:01:19.770> probably<00:01:20.100> shouldn't<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.820> any<00:01:20.939> 18

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
they're probably shouldn't be any 18
