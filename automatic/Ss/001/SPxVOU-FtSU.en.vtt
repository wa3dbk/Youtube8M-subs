there on the right you'll go right and I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.510 
there on the right you'll go right and I
think<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:49.770> really<00:00:49.950> cool<00:00:50.190> because<00:00:50.280> that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
think that's really cool because that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.900 
think that's really cool because that
makes<00:00:50.730> no<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.739> guess<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.250> put<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.760> you

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
makes no I guess if you put it if you

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.660 
makes no I guess if you put it if you
push<00:00:54.239> them<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.420> sync<00:00:54.690> maybe<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.340> go<00:00:56.340> along

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
push them in sync maybe you go along

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.830 
push them in sync maybe you go along
like<00:00:56.730> how<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.180> would<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.539> you're<00:00:57.690> actually

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
like how you would if you're actually

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.270 
like how you would if you're actually
paddling<00:00:58.350> or<00:00:58.440> maybe<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.859> hold<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.129> both

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
paddling or maybe if you hold on both

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.830 
paddling or maybe if you hold on both
down<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.640> go<00:00:59.760> for<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.030> i'm<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.270> quite<00:01:00.809> sure

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
down you go for it i'm not quite sure

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.510 
down you go for it i'm not quite sure
allottees<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.859> i<00:01:02.039> think<00:01:02.129> that's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
allottees but it's just i think that's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.640 
allottees but it's just i think that's
really<00:01:02.609> cool<00:01:02.879> because<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.780> exclusive<00:01:04.470> on

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
really cool because it's exclusive on

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.899 
really cool because it's exclusive on
the<00:01:04.799> PE<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.400> what<00:01:05.519> makes<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.790> special

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the PE and that's what makes it special

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.990 
the PE and that's what makes it special

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.770 
would say four months okay and this came
out<00:05:34.780> in<00:05:34.840> December<00:05:35.319> I<00:05:35.979> mean<00:05:36.520> I'm<00:05:36.789> I'm<00:05:37.120> gonna

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
out in December I mean I'm I'm gonna

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.170 
out in December I mean I'm I'm gonna
predict<00:05:38.229> probably<00:05:38.650> in<00:05:38.740> April<00:05:39.009> guys<00:05:39.190> um<00:05:39.550> maybe

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
predict probably in April guys um maybe

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.010 
predict probably in April guys um maybe
middle<00:05:40.900> mid<00:05:41.199> to<00:05:41.469> late<00:05:41.680> March<00:05:42.400> that's<00:05:43.240> pushing

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
middle mid to late March that's pushing

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.070 
middle mid to late March that's pushing
it<00:05:44.110> but<00:05:44.889> I'm<00:05:45.460> think<00:05:45.699> it'll<00:05:45.880> be<00:05:45.909> released<00:05:46.900> in

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
it but I'm think it'll be released in

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.339 
it but I'm think it'll be released in
April<00:05:47.469> around<00:05:48.039> April<00:05:48.630> second<00:05:49.630> maybe<00:05:50.110> around

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
April around April second maybe around

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.719 
April around April second maybe around
their<00:05:50.529> fish<00:05:50.740> stick<00:05:50.949> to<00:05:51.099> that<00:05:51.219> exact<00:05:51.520> four

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
their fish stick to that exact four

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.870 
their fish stick to that exact four
months<00:05:51.940> um<00:05:52.620> so<00:05:53.620> that's<00:05:53.800> all<00:05:53.919> speculation<00:05:54.069> I

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
months um so that's all speculation I

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.879 
months um so that's all speculation I
believe<00:05:55.210> will<00:05:55.389> come<00:05:55.690> out<00:05:55.810> in<00:05:55.840> April<00:05:56.319> and<00:05:56.469> I

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
believe will come out in April and I

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.260 
believe will come out in April and I
mean<00:05:57.039> I<00:05:57.099> hope<00:05:57.310> it<00:05:57.430> comes<00:05:57.550> out<00:05:57.699> sooner<00:05:57.969> but

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
mean I hope it comes out sooner but

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.990 
mean I hope it comes out sooner but
that's<00:05:58.900> just<00:05:59.050> my<00:05:59.259> guess<00:05:59.699> so<00:06:00.699> that's<00:06:00.849> basically

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
that's just my guess so that's basically

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.820 
that's just my guess so that's basically
