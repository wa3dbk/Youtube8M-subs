00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.599
 did stay with me so we start 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.289
 with drawing 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.050
 folds of upper eyelid blush atma 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.400

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.900
 that is, we align yes that's it 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.550
 the strip between the eye and the nose do everything 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.950
 solid so that we have been beautiful 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 face sculpture and by the way how 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.370
 apply a tonal tool like me 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.840
 I applied and by what means 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 you could use concealers 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.980
 see in my video about correction 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.390
 I won't repeat faces every time 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.149
 so if you are interested to see 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.230
 separate video next i take my shadow 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.300
 favorite from mac 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.690
 and menger up that called and 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.760
 I am bringing the lower eyelid completely slightly 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.910
 leaving in such an arrow in order to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.590
 mark the border of our shadow pattern 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.690
 I take my favorite pigment from inglot 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.760
 I will write the number under the video 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.729
 brown sand matte 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.080
 saturated pigment and draw our drawing 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.140
 eye shadow with a small eye shadow brush 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.880
 I draw the outer corner dim corner 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.299
 I leave the upper fold of the century and century and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.380
 Of course it dries and blends everything 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.880
 just after dye brush 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.009
 every action necessarily all 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.960
 shade it carefully my slogan 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.329
 success of any makeup is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.729
 careful shading so how 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.240
 should all be feathery 2 them our common 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.240
 picture 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.619
 now with a black pencil we are bringing 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.600
 ciliary edge a little bit go 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.950
 inner corner and mucous up 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:03.229
 the middle we will now bring the lower 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.289
 mucous with grated I mean with me 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.729
 simple black pencil from flyual 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.239
 medium density not too fat not 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.239
 too hard 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.950
 Now this whole thing is shading 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.049
 thin brush 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.660
 I usually have code color 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.579
 shading a black pencil out of that 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.329
 to make the line softer 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.329
 muted 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.950
 a little bit painted on the shadow drawing again 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.960
 the same pigment to all 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:52.720
 merge together and put out a little more 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:54.880
 black shadows our arrow and of course 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.290
 all the same shade again in that show in 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.300
 overall picture now choose bright 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.870
 bronze tint from the company palette 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.730
 with alex set bright bright so yellow 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.020
 bronze and stressed internal 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:14.520
 corner of the eye and here is the space between 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.520
 folds of the upper eyelid and cilia 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.180
 adding on top of golds such an alliance 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.700
 alliance perfect shadows from loreal such 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.160
 bright golden shadows that give a little 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.680
 in silver and of course still 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.870
 feather again outline the contour 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.670
 ciliated in order to remove everything here 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.670
 some of them showered on our drawing 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.490
 slightly lower black eyelid 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.830
 pencil and now I take any light 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.020
 pearl shadows I have a donkey and in 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.090
 pallets m no show, and put the internal 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.090
 eye corner and under eyebrow 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.350
 Further naturally I apply voluminous mascara 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.500
 I have my favorite mascara from 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.600

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.630
 good bulk ink we paint over 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.250
 carefully all the cilia is important 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.530
 Absolutely in any makeup it doesn't matter 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.450
 afternoon or evening as it should 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.980
 push off from the root of the mysik law 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.930
 paint over all the cilia such 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.020
 brush a little from side to 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.570
 side to zigzag we enter by 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.820
 cilia end up with long 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.470
 cilia but I'm still naturally added 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.790
 false eyelashes to give 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:43.240

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.180
 give extra extra 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.090
 volume and brighten the color turning it into 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.210

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.430
 eyelashes still with black pencil in order 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.330
