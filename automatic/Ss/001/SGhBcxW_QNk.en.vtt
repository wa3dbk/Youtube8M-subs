00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.339
 ok hello boys section why 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.389
 of this site 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.719
 we wanted to insert this video for 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.880
 greet you and tell you to summarize your reason 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.390
 of the creation of this space that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 net was the desire to transfer the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.240
 our motion networks for what not 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.279
 there was so much of this discipline 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.199
 we are three as complex as satisfying 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.579
 athletes within the year 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.180
 we have always believed in this 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.309
 philosophy and we want to tell you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.000
 we will do a lot of simplicity over time 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.809
 those that are the cornerstones of work that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.539
 we have been carrying on for some time and we hope 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.379
 you can still plan them for a long time 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.989
 time 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.350
 accuparsi to go to but I'm 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.070
 mauro pelini and as already mentioned by a 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.960
 precisely this space 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.199
 wants to be a little government help 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.020
 with people who are not convinced of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.150
 can actually do it can divide into 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.510
 natural is a real style of 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.490
 life and this very important thing 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.640
 experiencing means little means 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.200
 so much good indeterminate way to eat 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.680
 train so much to rest the moments 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.420
 right and try to set everything up 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.730
 trying to do it naturally in 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.520
 better ways 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.680
 very well the doctor of does not tell us 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.860
 I will do this we are the ones we want to do 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.020
 out of passion because we understood that i 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.950
 results can be obtained 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.950
 get great results 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.580
 however, sacrifice must be sacrificed e 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.630
 patience great desire so much to 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.160
 alpha and you need to find a moment too 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.100
 the right people to be able to 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.480
 share this stability 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.050
 precisely these experiences have me 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.450
 shared stimulating a little motivating 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.240
 whether it is possible to progress and 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.580
 this is a really important thing 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.350
 in football this speech because mm in 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.670
 that moment was complete 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:17.540
 someone follows us many people there 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.000
 they ask what group this is like do as 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.710
 you did so very much please 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.010
 alessandro card a ras 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.370
 one of these that initially 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.800
 intrigued by the performances such tenders 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.730
 made from the results obtained started 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.830
 to approach and to us with ponies and 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.500
 sinking does with a little bit of time 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.370
 got under and keep in mind 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.660
 precisely the Chaldean blood can be seen 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.790
 they will talk excessively about it 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.100
 they think of this thing and we are pleased 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.950
 that someone point hoping someone 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.080
 we can listen to this and that 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.130
 message is important for those instead 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:03.330
 I don't think so, thank you 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.210
 their first talks them for a year 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.900
 this part I changed my style 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.570
 of life 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.510
 so changed the power I have 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:16.020
 changed what I do 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:21.750
 daily so maybe I don't 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:25.320
 the more it will be for me before I leave the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.850
 life is younger than us and excuse this 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.470
 brackets marco 648 marco 41 years 38 e 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.450
 half he a little in prison has 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.030
 a long way ahead, however, it is already 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.340
 set well we like as much as like 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.980
 the young one in fact take what they are 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.440
 saying I changed my party 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.210
 so my lifestyle following 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.130
 correct feeding seven days on 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:56.670
 seven a very intense workout 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:02.900
 how much 50 74 50 week of course I have 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.900
 made a 3 or in 45 people 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:12.219
 and I have to tell you that the results are visible 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.200
 they have changed and we have changed fish 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:17.139
 great potential will give us satisfaction 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.630
 among many 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.509
 therefore I close this short space 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.259
 saying once again who does not believe 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:29.160
 of being able to do it to get under 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:31.570
 believe firmly instead of your own 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.190
 potentiality agi miranshah association 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:40.990
 there are no other ways than to sacrifice oneself 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.090
 have patience so much suffering and 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.720
 then these themselves are transformed i 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.139
 pleasures therefore also being able to deprive of 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.720
 you look at a particular food in the end 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.039
 he says yes but I'm fine in this too 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.440
 so I can do without it 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.330
 the world will also be taken for that 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.669
 usually eat our pizza 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.410
 built riches have the same though in 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.960
 a different way from with a state model 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.789
 doing 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.370
 just this is a short message that 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.970
 we wanted them to arrive soon 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.970
 Hello
