00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
answer the first question shells were

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.150 
answer the first question shells were
mated<00:00:26.039> early<00:00:26.400> as<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> mid-1500s<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.890> fresh

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
mated early as the mid-1500s the fresh

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.299 
mated early as the mid-1500s the fresh
snow<00:00:29.279> maker<00:00:29.609> was<00:00:29.849> Andrea<00:00:30.510> Monte<00:00:31.099> but<00:00:32.099> only

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
snow maker was Andrea Monte but only

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.590 
snow maker was Andrea Monte but only
thinks<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:32.820> shells<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.270> known<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.570> exist

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
thinks that if shells are known to exist

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.520 
thinks that if shells are known to exist
today<00:00:33.989> Thea<00:00:34.920> cellos<00:00:35.430> back<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.630> 1500s<00:00:37.140> were

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
today Thea cellos back in the 1500s were

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.560 
today Thea cellos back in the 1500s were
bigger<00:00:37.770> than<00:00:37.890> today's<00:00:38.370> celli<00:00:38.730> about<00:00:39.270> an<00:00:39.390> inch

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
bigger than today's celli about an inch

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.010 
bigger than today's celli about an inch
figure<00:00:39.930> today<00:00:40.920> they're<00:00:41.219> smaller<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> they

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
figure today they're smaller so they

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.630 
figure today they're smaller so they
would<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.260> easier<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.770> play<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.190> there'd<00:00:44.640> be

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
would be easier to play and there'd be

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.900 
would be easier to play and there'd be
less<00:00:44.969> tension<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> left<00:00:45.930> hand<00:00:46.910> when

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
less tension in the left hand when

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.580 
less tension in the left hand when

a<00:00:59.039> notable<00:00:59.579> cello<00:00:59.820> maker<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.980> think<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
a notable cello maker so we think of

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.130 
a notable cello maker so we think of
immense<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.699> violin<00:01:03.180> guys<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.629> actually<00:01:03.989> he

many of the great Shalom acres was

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
actually Italian this smaller cello

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.679 
actually Italian this smaller cello
based<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.270> an<00:01:12.390> Italian<00:01:12.840> maker<00:01:14.360> Ruggieri<00:01:15.360> was

based on an Italian maker Ruggieri was

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.649 
based on an Italian maker Ruggieri was
originally<00:01:16.140> created<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> 1690s<00:01:17.540> but<00:01:18.540> it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
originally created in the 1690s but it

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.590 
originally created in the 1690s but it
wasn't<00:01:18.960> until<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.290> early<00:01:19.320> 1700s<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.729> most

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
wasn't until the early 1700s that most

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.719 
wasn't until the early 1700s that most
of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.320> makers<00:01:22.650> began<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.100> use<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.430> cutter

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
of the makers began to use this cutter

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.109 
of the makers began to use this cutter
the<00:01:24.000> smaller<00:01:24.330> pattern<00:01:25.580> I'll<00:01:26.580> show<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> how<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
the smaller pattern I'll show you how to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:40.040 
the smaller pattern I'll show you how to
show<00:01:27.420> us<00:01:27.570> out

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:02:19.230 

Oh

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.340 

and<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.950> small<00:02:21.280> shallow<00:02:21.610> again<00:02:21.850> is<00:02:22.350> easier

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
and this small shallow again is easier

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.490 
and this small shallow again is easier
to<00:02:23.410> play<00:02:23.680> because<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.220> has<00:02:24.400> smaller<00:02:25.500> intervals

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
to play because it has smaller intervals

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.650 
to play because it has smaller intervals
to<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.770> left<00:02:26.950> hand<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.330> answer<00:02:28.360> the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
to the left hand so the answer the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.980 
to the left hand so the answer the
second<00:02:29.020> question<00:02:30.240> how<00:02:31.240> much<00:02:31.450> does<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.750> cello

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
second question how much does the cello

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.620 
second question how much does the cello
cost<00:02:32.320> you<00:02:32.710> can<00:02:32.890> rent<00:02:33.130> one<00:02:33.220> for<00:02:33.730> about

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
cost you can rent one for about

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.120 
cost you can rent one for about
twenty-five<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.290> thirty-five<00:02:35.590> dollars<00:02:35.920> a
