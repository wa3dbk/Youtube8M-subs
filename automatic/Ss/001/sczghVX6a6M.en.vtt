00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
whole piece and then you fit to the size

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.720 
whole piece and then you fit to the size
of<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.689> board<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:32.120> you<00:00:33.710> it's<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.309> these

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
of a board and you it's not it's these

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.459 
of a board and you it's not it's these
things<00:00:36.030> aren't<00:00:36.300> perfectly<00:00:36.719> flat<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.320> have

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
things aren't perfectly flat so you have

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.170 
things aren't perfectly flat so you have
to<00:00:37.620> jump<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.280> piece<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.550> wood<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.910> between

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
to jump like a piece of wood in between

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.840 
to jump like a piece of wood in between
there<00:00:39.590> but<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:41.040> long<00:00:41.160> as<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.700> long

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
there but it's long as you have as long

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.250 
there but it's long as you have as long
as<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> fits<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:42.480> nice<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.690> snug<00:00:43.079> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
as it fits in there nice and snug you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.150 
as it fits in there nice and snug you
won't<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> problem<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
won't really have a problem with the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.310 
won't really have a problem with the
breaking<00:00:44.399> or<00:00:44.610> anything<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.149> then<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
breaking or anything and then for the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
breaking or anything and then for the
top<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.039> put<00:00:47.280> some<00:00:47.489> sandpaper<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.270> his

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
top I just put some sandpaper on his

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.630 
top I just put some sandpaper on his
grip<00:00:48.690> tape<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.110> tried<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.649> spray<00:00:50.340> paint<00:00:50.399> on

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
grip tape and tried to spray paint on

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.220 
grip tape and tried to spray paint on
the<00:00:50.760> free<00:00:50.879> logo<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> comes<00:00:52.020> out

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the free logo but it kind of comes out

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.200 
the free logo but it kind of comes out
when<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.440> gets<00:00:52.469> wet<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
when it gets wet so it's not really the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.810 
when it gets wet so it's not really the
point<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.449> doing<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:55.399> compared<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
point of doing that compared to the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.270 
point of doing that compared to the
normal<00:00:57.780> freelance<00:00:58.199> Kate<00:00:58.469> they're<00:00:58.739> quite<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
normal freelance Kate they're quite a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.729 
normal freelance Kate they're quite a
bit<00:00:59.430> bigger<00:00:59.670> but<00:01:00.480> normally<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:01.109> you're<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
bit bigger but normally if you're on a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.750 
bit bigger but normally if you're on a
lake<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.070> something<00:01:02.280> you're<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> have

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
lake or something you're going to have

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.719 
lake or something you're going to have
boots<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.239> or<00:01:03.390> something<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.700> good<00:01:05.700> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
boots on or something so it's good to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
boots on or something so it's good to
have<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.909> bigger<00:01:06.090> surface<00:01:06.360> area<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.960> was

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
have a bigger surface area I was

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.020 
have a bigger surface area I was
actually<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.159> doubtful<00:01:08.760> about<00:01:08.880> whether

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
actually really doubtful about whether

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030 
actually really doubtful about whether
or<00:01:09.299> not<00:01:09.420> they<00:01:09.600> work<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> ended<00:01:10.950> up

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
or not they work but the ended up

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.730 
or not they work but the ended up
working<00:01:11.159> perfectly<00:01:11.670> fine<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:13.350> far<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
working perfectly fine and as far as the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.929 
working perfectly fine and as far as the
Anglos<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.549> how<00:01:15.150> far<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.840> adjust<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.549> blade<00:01:17.549> on

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
Anglos on how far to adjust the blade on

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.880 
Anglos on how far to adjust the blade on
the<00:01:18.030> bottom<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.390> thing<00:01:18.659> basically<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.860> just

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the bottom of thing basically you just

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.330 
the bottom of thing basically you just
take<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.689> normal<00:01:21.689> skate<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.500> hold<00:01:23.280> it

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
take a normal skate and just hold it

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.190 
take a normal skate and just hold it
against<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.909> adjust<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.659> tilt

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
against it and adjust it to the tilt

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.510 
against it and adjust it to the tilt
just<00:01:25.530> looks<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.070> about<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.430> right

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
just looks like it's about the right

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280 
just looks like it's about the right
amount<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:27.720> often<00:01:28.020> won't<00:01:28.170> really

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
amount it's a little often won't really

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.730 
amount it's a little often won't really
matter<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.659> got<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> chance<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> try

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
matter but so I I got a chance to try

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.219 
matter but so I I got a chance to try
them<00:01:31.860> out<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> blades<00:01:33.270> weren't<00:01:33.540> sharp<00:01:33.780> so

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
them out but the blades weren't sharp so

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.600 
them out but the blades weren't sharp so
they<00:01:34.350> slit<00:01:34.619> all<00:01:34.740> over<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> place<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.460> they

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
they slit all over the place but they

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.090 
they slit all over the place but they
still<00:01:35.790> worked<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.470> went<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.860> got<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
still worked and so I went and got the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.830 
still worked and so I went and got the
blade<00:01:38.280> sharpened<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.450> get<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> blade

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
blade sharpened and to get the blade

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840 
blade sharpened and to get the blade
sharpened<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.009> whole<00:01:41.220> board<00:01:41.520> can't

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
sharpened they this whole board can't

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.899 
sharpened they this whole board can't
fit<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> machine<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.840> sharpens<00:01:43.229> them<00:01:43.909> so

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
fit on the machine that sharpens them so

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.789 
fit on the machine that sharpens them so
you<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> take<00:01:45.840> off<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.619> these

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
you have to take off this all these

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.039 
you have to take off this all these
unscrewed<00:01:47.430> under<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> screws<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.479> market

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
unscrewed under the screws like market

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.240 
unscrewed under the screws like market
left<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.860> right<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.220> these<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.860> then

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
left and right of these and so and then

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.520 
left and right of these and so and then
they<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.700> fasten<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.810> part<00:01:55.020> onto<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
they can fasten just this part onto the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.060 
they can fasten just this part onto the
machine<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:58.140> once<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.649> gotta<00:01:58.829> sharpen

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
machine and so once I gotta sharpen

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.420 
machine and so once I gotta sharpen
though<00:01:59.399> I'm<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.719> go<00:02:00.990> next<00:02:01.619> day<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.219> go

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
though I'm going to go next day to go

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.060 
though I'm going to go next day to go
try<00:02:02.939> them<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.630> course<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.110> broke<00:02:04.950> my

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
try them out but of course I broke my

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.399 
try them out but of course I broke my
wrist<00:02:05.219> snowboarding<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.930> didn't<00:02:07.290> get<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
wrist snowboarding so I didn't get a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.869 
wrist snowboarding so I didn't get a
chance<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.740> try<00:02:07.920> them<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.160> after<00:02:08.759> that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
chance to try them out and after that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.249 
chance to try them out and after that
the<00:02:09.119> weather<00:02:09.300> didn't<00:02:09.599> really<00:02:09.750> cooperate<00:02:09.869> so

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the weather didn't really cooperate so

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.130 
the weather didn't really cooperate so
now<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.530> ice<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.770> too<00:02:11.099> thin<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.870> really<00:02:12.870> go

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
now the ice is too thin to really go

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.430 
now the ice is too thin to really go
and<00:02:13.260> dry<00:02:13.860> mouth<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.540> yeah<00:02:16.140> that's

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
and dry mouth and so yeah that's

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.309 
and dry mouth and so yeah that's
basically<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.430> how<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.640> make<00:02:17.790> them<00:02:18.110> Jeff<00:02:19.110> if

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
basically just how you make them Jeff if

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.960 
basically just how you make them Jeff if
you<00:02:19.440> want<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> go<00:02:19.800> ahead<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.069> try<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.220> up<00:02:22.970> also

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
you want to go ahead and try it up also

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.430 
you want to go ahead and try it up also
another<00:02:24.240> thing<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.900> do<00:02:25.170> is

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
another thing that you have to do is

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.910 
another thing that you have to do is
make<00:02:25.740> sure<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> left<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.890> right

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
make sure you have a left and a right

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.680 
make sure you have a left and a right
one<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:30.030> left<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.690> right<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:32.480> didn't<00:02:33.480> mark

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
one to left and right and I didn't mark

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.870 
one to left and right and I didn't mark
mine<00:02:33.990> left<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.470> right<00:02:34.620> because<00:02:34.890> since<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.700> ride

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
mine left and right because since I ride

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.190 
mine left and right because since I ride
the<00:02:35.910> normal<00:02:36.240> free<00:02:36.360> lines<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.690> can<00:02:36.840> just<00:02:36.990> tell<00:02:37.140> by

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the normal free lines I can just tell by

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.960 
the normal free lines I can just tell by
standing<00:02:37.680> at<00:02:37.800> him<00:02:37.890> standing<00:02:38.370> on<00:02:38.610> over<00:02:38.730> looking

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
standing at him standing on over looking

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.320 
standing at him standing on over looking
at<00:02:39.090> him<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:40.890> one<00:02:41.130> its<00:02:41.700> angles<00:02:42.180> a

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
at him but this one its angles a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.229 
at him but this one its angles a
different<00:02:42.660> way<00:02:42.870> then<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:44.010> one<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.970> if<00:02:45.000> you

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
different way then this one so if you

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.850 
different way then this one so if you
you<00:02:45.540> can't<00:02:45.780> just<00:02:45.840> use<00:02:46.050> one<00:02:46.260> scheme<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.650> mark

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
you can't just use one scheme to mark

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.380 
you can't just use one scheme to mark
them<00:02:47.010> because<00:02:47.250> then<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.520> boat<00:02:47.730> it'll<00:02:48.360> just

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
them because then the boat it'll just

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.970 
them because then the boat it'll just
feel<00:02:48.720> really<00:02:48.900> awkward<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.530> won't<00:02:49.680> work<00:02:49.770> as

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
feel really awkward and it won't work as

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.280 
feel really awkward and it won't work as
well<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.790> make<00:02:51.030> sure<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.510> specifically<00:02:52.019> use

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
well so make sure you specifically use

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.780 
well so make sure you specifically use
both<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.800> left<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.220> right<00:02:53.430> free

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
both the left and the right free

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.000 
both the left and the right free
landscape<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.900> get<00:02:55.019> these<00:02:55.200> ones<00:02:55.410> marked

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010
