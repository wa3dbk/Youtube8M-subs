basically the Hornets had better
attendance<00:01:51.219> them<00:01:51.460> both<00:01:51.759> teams<00:01:52.119> they<00:01:53.049> had

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
attendance them both teams they had

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.419 
attendance them both teams they had
better<00:01:53.289> attendance<00:01:53.649> in<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.859> kings<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.369> they

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
better attendance in the kings and they

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:55.919 
better attendance in the kings and they
had<00:01:54.549> better<00:01:54.759> attendance<00:01:55.240> then<00:01:55.719> the

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
had better attendance then the

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.590 
had better attendance then the
SuperSonics<00:01:56.649> when<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.820> SuperSonics<00:01:58.390> moved

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
SuperSonics when the SuperSonics moved

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.139 
SuperSonics when the SuperSonics moved
to<00:01:58.840> Oklahoma<00:01:59.319> City<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:01.329> I<00:02:02.429> don't<00:02:03.429> understand

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
to Oklahoma City now I don't understand

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.240 
to Oklahoma City now I don't understand
because<00:02:04.689> I<00:02:04.899> thought<00:02:05.049> Seattle<00:02:05.530> was<00:02:05.619> always<00:02:05.979> up

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
because I thought Seattle was always up

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.190 
because I thought Seattle was always up
top<00:02:06.459> I<00:02:06.610> just<00:02:06.850> think<00:02:07.149> they're<00:02:07.630> in<00:02:07.750> that<00:02:07.780> stretch

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
top I just think they're in that stretch

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.690 
top I just think they're in that stretch
you<00:02:08.440> know<00:02:08.530> there<00:02:08.709> are<00:02:08.799> bad<00:02:08.979> team<00:02:09.310> bad<00:02:09.340> team

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
you know there are bad team bad team

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.119 
you know there are bad team bad team
have<00:02:10.239> bad<00:02:10.450> attendance<00:02:10.959> normally<00:02:11.410> so<00:02:12.040> you

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
have bad attendance normally so you

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.250 
have bad attendance normally so you
can't<00:02:12.459> really<00:02:12.580> be<00:02:13.090> mad<00:02:13.390> at<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.930> City<00:02:14.170> of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
can't really be mad at the City of

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.800 
can't really be mad at the City of
Seattle<00:02:14.620> for<00:02:15.099> that<00:02:15.250> happening<00:02:15.730> but<00:02:16.629> once

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
Seattle for that happening but once

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.509 
Seattle for that happening but once
again<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:17.110> am<00:02:17.349> biased<00:02:17.769> towards<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.129> subject

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
again I am biased towards the subject

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.589 
again I am biased towards the subject
but<00:02:18.579> I<00:02:18.640> still<00:02:18.880> don't<00:02:19.060> think<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.390> know<00:02:19.540> you

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
but I still don't think you know you

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.900 
but I still don't think you know you
move<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.049> team<00:02:20.290> it's<00:02:20.530> only<00:02:20.739> been<00:02:20.890> there<00:02:21.130> ten

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
move a team it's only been there ten

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.000 
move a team it's only been there ten
years<00:02:22.239> anyway<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:23.500> know<00:02:24.360> but<00:02:25.360> once<00:02:25.569> again<00:02:25.720> I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
years anyway you know but once again I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.559 
years anyway you know but once again I
probably<00:02:27.010> show<00:02:27.250> buyers<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.880> subject<00:02:28.120> but

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
probably show buyers to that subject but

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.759 
probably show buyers to that subject but
this<00:02:28.810> isn't<00:02:29.140> about<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.500> cornices<00:02:30.150> about

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769
