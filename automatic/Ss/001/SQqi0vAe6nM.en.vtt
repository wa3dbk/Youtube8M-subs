00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.940
There is a screening of your film ''Dimensions of dialogue'' here in Karlovy Vary. This film is more than 30 years old 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.960
and opened you the way to the world. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.860
Do you think that the movie got old among all those years?

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.020
My work is based on imaginative films, not realistic.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.800
Realistiv films tend to get old because after some time they become documentaries of era.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.440
These films and their storylines solve problems of some epoch. The time they were made.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.620
Therefore they were more appreciated than the imaginative films.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.340
Imaginative films seemed as pointless and not devoting to any topic. However they never aged.  

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.400
Because they go into the deep. They are never addressed to everyday life. Therefore they remain.

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:11.674
It is the same with paintings. For instance Hieronym Bosch.

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:17.194
 His paintings are still actual and inspiring young people and artists.

00:01:17.194 --> 00:01:25.214
Whereas Rembrandt, his paintings became only documentaries of certain period for people nowadays

00:01:25.214 --> 00:01:27.614
And it is the same with movies.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.120
Do you follow the progress of animation and contemporary animators? 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.760
Is there anyone specific that you like?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.680
No, I do not follow that.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:07.460
I never considered myself as a director of animated films nor that I would prefer animation. I do not even consider myself as a director of films at all. 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
Because I think, it does not matter what you do and how it is titled.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.920
 Poetry is the only one. And I think we can express ourselves in many ways. So I do more stuff. 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:30.820
Installations, paintings, design, ceramics. I consider film as one the expression devices.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.860
We always hear that the visual culture get rid of the human ability to imagine. Do you agree with that?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:52.760
Indeed. The eye is injured. It is attacked by television, commercials. and other visual devices. 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:03.200
That is also why I started to be interested in touch. Experimental. I think that touch, from all of our senses,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:20.580
 touch is less apathetic unpoilt and pure. Also not very commonly used in terms of culture.There is not much of it in here.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:30.420
And from 1974 when I was not doing films for 7 years, I started to be concerned with touch.
