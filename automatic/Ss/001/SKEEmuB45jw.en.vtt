00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.920
 hello youtube friends here let's see 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.440
 the following list of the games of the 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.450
 week 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.490
 this is a very constructive game is a 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.709
 game in 3d is like a memorama type 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.779
 where everyone who accommodate the piece does not 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.789
 we believe the figure of the face of 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.070
 a snail could be said if it is a 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.939
 snail 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.000
 I almost did not leave him because he did not 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.000
 there is 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.090
 this 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.390
 and drums are the drums 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.480
 we have to find a way to believe 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.890
 these squares have that form to 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.890
 she almost got it 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.760
 and I have not lost 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.760
 first of all one more time faster 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.860
 I want to thank a 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.590
 unknown subscriber 1,472 that happened to me 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.090
 a series of his favorites lists the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.580
 price all very good indeed very 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.580
 well there is no growth to it 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.979
 and they tell us how the game is going 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.539
 in the first three the three but more 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.860
 image gives us a chance afterwards we no longer 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.860
 we feel leave on our part 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.780
 how fast I am 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.780
 a message 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.840
 ready 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.840
 very good game 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.460
 ok here we have our feel game is 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.770
 a platform game about all that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.390
 give him create a kind of bridge where 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.390
 the changos have to cross to the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.460
 other part 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.740
 without them falling down and we all have to 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.960
 as 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.460
 in picking up other types of objects like 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.750
 these bananas could say 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.550
 so let's make a little bridge 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.960
 where they can cross it without 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.760
 no problem 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.060
 it's a construction game this since 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.060
 this 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.189
 to see there his subjects 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.270
 we are achieving it is not common factor 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.270
 try 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.310
 and here we have our next game 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.080
 that is a game of airplanes airplanes the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.720
 War store when we are guiding 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.420
 our plane to the tanks of 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.220
 combat then those who destroy them 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.930
 we have to try to avoid getting there 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.040
 to the other path 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.040
 how I soil because I put 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.000
 version 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.060
 as you can see a little more resistant 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.060
 others will be a bit more difficult 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.720
 to 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.319
 how 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.549
 do not 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.920
 and finally that I have with a super 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.920
 very zombie game 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.910
 we are running and they are chasing us 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.950
 the zombies and we have different types of 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.480
 weapons 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.139
 moving forward we are getting new 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.420
 new weapons missions 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.760
 but more difficult all 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.060
 and try to come out safe and sound from 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.060
 Health 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.069
 the games rooms 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.660
 but who has liked to forget if you 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:52.660
 liked little hand up subscribe
