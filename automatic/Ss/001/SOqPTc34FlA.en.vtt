same way that my deadlifts went last
week<00:03:25.300> where<00:03:25.600> my<00:03:26.200> back<00:03:26.410> was<00:03:26.620> kind<00:03:26.830> of<00:03:26.890> feeling

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
week where my back was kind of feeling

week where my back was kind of feeling
weird<00:03:27.400> until<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:27.850> actually<00:03:28.200> finished<00:03:29.200> up<00:03:29.560> and

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
weird until I actually finished up and

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.440 
weird until I actually finished up and
it<00:03:29.830> almost<00:03:30.070> fixed<00:03:30.430> itself<00:03:30.820> which<00:03:31.120> isn't

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
it almost fixed itself which isn't

it almost fixed itself which isn't
something<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:31.840> think<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.170> can<00:03:32.320> always<00:03:32.530> rely<00:03:32.770> on

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
something I think you can always rely on

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.090 
something I think you can always rely on
but<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.870> know<00:03:34.930> sometimes<00:03:35.200> movement<00:03:35.860> and

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
but you know sometimes movement and

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.040 
but you know sometimes movement and
mobility<00:03:36.660> encourages<00:03:37.660> healing<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:38.890> who<00:03:39.640> knows

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
mobility encourages healing so who knows

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
mobility encourages healing so who knows
certainly<00:03:41.050> not<00:03:41.170> me<00:03:41.230> not<00:03:41.590> all<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:41.860> time<00:03:42.010> anyway

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070

I try my best to figure things out after

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
my main work just to get the volume up

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.440 
my main work just to get the volume up
because<00:03:55.990> doubles<00:03:56.500> tend<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.670> be<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:57.880> pretty<00:03:58.180> low

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
because doubles tend to be a pretty low

because doubles tend to be a pretty low
volume<00:03:58.840> week<00:03:59.020> for<00:03:59.230> me<00:03:59.320> unless<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.709> do<00:03:59.770> more<00:04:00.190> back

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
volume week for me unless I do more back

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.890 
volume week for me unless I do more back
off<00:04:00.580> work<00:04:00.820> so<00:04:01.090> adding<00:04:02.050> in<00:04:02.230> eight<00:04:02.980> reps<00:04:03.280> here<00:04:03.670> I

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
off work so adding in eight reps here I

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.840 
off work so adding in eight reps here I
think<00:04:04.900> really<00:04:05.380> padded<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.860> volume<00:04:06.130> total<00:04:06.490> to

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
think really padded the volume total to

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.210 
think really padded the volume total to
make<00:04:07.060> it<00:04:07.240> a<00:04:07.330> little<00:04:07.450> less<00:04:08.190> dramatic<00:04:09.190> than

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
make it a little less dramatic than

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.190 
make it a little less dramatic than
dropping<00:04:09.610> from<00:04:09.910> fives<00:04:10.209> two<00:04:10.630> threes<00:04:10.900> two

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
dropping from fives two threes two

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.720 
dropping from fives two threes two
doubles<00:04:11.530> especially<00:04:12.040> when<00:04:12.160> i<00:04:12.190> have<00:04:12.250> my<00:04:12.520> three

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730

phone home about it just you know doing
work<00:04:24.010> sometimes<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:25.300> it's<00:04:25.570> not<00:04:25.780> always<00:04:25.930> the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
work sometimes and it's not always the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.850 
work sometimes and it's not always the
most<00:04:26.260> fun

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
most fun

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.860

afterwards<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.610> did<00:04:27.819> do<00:04:27.939> my<00:04:28.060> front<00:04:28.360> squats<00:04:28.629> I

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
afterwards I did do my front squats I

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.719 
afterwards I did do my front squats I
think<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.259> was<00:04:29.409> a<00:04:29.439> big<00:04:29.710> factor<00:04:29.979> in<00:04:30.189> helping

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
think that was a big factor in helping

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.629 
think that was a big factor in helping
the<00:04:30.939> knees<00:04:31.180> kind<00:04:31.689> of<00:04:31.780> feel<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.960> little<00:04:32.110> better

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
the knees kind of feel a little better

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.339 
the knees kind of feel a little better
and<00:04:33.639> after<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.120> i<00:04:34.180> had<00:04:34.569> my<00:04:34.719> been<00:04:34.930> Ching<00:04:35.169> I

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
and after that i had my been Ching I

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.879 
and after that i had my been Ching I
will<00:04:35.590> say<00:04:35.889> that<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.960> did<00:04:38.169> not<00:04:38.199> go<00:04:38.620> super

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
will say that it did not go super

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.570 
will say that it did not go super
awesome<00:04:39.550> amazingly<00:04:40.509> well<00:04:40.949> I've<00:04:41.949> had<00:04:42.189> some

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
pretty high expectations I've been

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.540 
pretty high expectations I've been
pushing<00:04:44.349> the<00:04:44.500> progression<00:04:44.979> pretty<00:04:45.219> hard<00:04:45.460> on

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
pushing the progression pretty hard on

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.830 
pushing the progression pretty hard on
the<00:04:45.669> bench<00:04:45.849> pressing<00:04:46.240> these<00:04:46.360> last<00:04:46.599> few<00:04:46.750> weeks

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
the bench pressing these last few weeks

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.219 
the bench pressing these last few weeks
with<00:04:47.289> that<00:04:47.319> very<00:04:47.919> aggressive<00:04:48.729> mentality<00:04:49.599> on

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
with that very aggressive mentality on

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.839 
with that very aggressive mentality on
the<00:04:50.830> press<00:04:51.039> and<00:04:52.229> I<00:04:53.229> just<00:04:54.039> don't<00:04:54.400> think<00:04:54.669> that<00:04:54.819> I

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
the press and I just don't think that I

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.879 
the press and I just don't think that I
did<00:04:55.270> enough<00:04:55.539> last<00:04:55.870> week<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.289> really<00:04:56.590> cause

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
did enough last week to really cause

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.450 
did enough last week to really cause
enough<00:04:57.490> of<00:04:57.639> an<00:04:57.729> adaptation<00:04:57.909> for<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:59.590> whole<00:05:00.219> lot

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
enough of an adaptation for a whole lot

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.990 
enough of an adaptation for a whole lot
of<00:05:00.699> improvement<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:02.490> like<00:05:03.490> I<00:05:03.639> was<00:05:03.759> saying

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
of improvement and like I was saying

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.580 
of improvement and like I was saying
earlier<00:05:04.120> if<00:05:04.330> somebody's<00:05:04.689> is<00:05:04.810> just<00:05:05.020> stuff<00:05:05.199> some

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
earlier if somebody's is just stuff some

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.230 
earlier if somebody's is just stuff some
days<00:05:05.800> you<00:05:06.129> know<00:05:06.340> there<00:05:06.490> isn't<00:05:06.759> really<00:05:06.879> reason

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
days you know there isn't really reason

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.399 
days you know there isn't really reason
you<00:05:07.300> could<00:05:07.449> do<00:05:07.509> everything<00:05:07.629> right<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.319> it

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
you could do everything right and it

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.640 
you could do everything right and it
still<00:05:08.620> doesn't<00:05:08.800> feel<00:05:09.569> the<00:05:10.569> best<00:05:11.050> some<00:05:11.500> days

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
still doesn't feel the best some days

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.939 
still doesn't feel the best some days
the<00:05:12.039> way<00:05:12.159> just<00:05:12.340> feels<00:05:12.580> heavier<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.949> knowing

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
the way just feels heavier and knowing

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.089 
the way just feels heavier and knowing
me<00:05:15.129> and<00:05:15.550> most<00:05:15.909> people<00:05:16.379> there<00:05:17.379> usually<00:05:17.770> is

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
me and most people there usually is

me and most people there usually is
reason<00:05:18.580> because<00:05:19.060> doing<00:05:19.509> everything<00:05:19.750> right

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
reason because doing everything right

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.719 
reason because doing everything right
all<00:05:20.319> the<00:05:20.529> time<00:05:20.560> is<00:05:21.039> very<00:05:21.310> unlikely<00:05:21.699> so<00:05:23.159> I'm<00:05:24.159> I'm

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
all the time is very unlikely so I'm I'm

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.219 
all the time is very unlikely so I'm I'm
honestly<00:05:25.270> excited<00:05:25.779> that<00:05:25.900> there's<00:05:26.050> other

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
things I can fix and things that I can

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.490 
things I can fix and things that I can
improve<00:05:28.240> to<00:05:28.509> be<00:05:28.659> better<00:05:28.840> prepared<00:05:29.020> for<00:05:29.409> next

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
improve to be better prepared for next

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.339 
improve to be better prepared for next
time<00:05:29.710> but<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:31.029> situation<00:05:31.599> we<00:05:31.719> have<00:05:31.900> is<00:05:32.169> what

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
time but the situation we have is what

time but the situation we have is what
we<00:05:32.379> do<00:05:32.589> and<00:05:33.210> there<00:05:34.210> it<00:05:34.330> is<00:05:34.449> so<00:05:34.750> I<00:05:34.779> hit<00:05:35.020> a<00:05:35.050> 365

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
we do and there it is so I hit a 365

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.869 
we do and there it is so I hit a 365
beer<00:05:36.909> moved<00:05:37.479> up<00:05:37.690> my<00:05:37.839> final<00:05:38.199> set<00:05:38.879> 385

got cleanly last week i'm still not
super<00:05:44.830> pleased<00:05:45.069> with<00:05:45.279> it<00:05:45.310> it<00:05:45.610> was<00:05:45.729> a<00:05:45.759> little

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
super pleased with it it was a little

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.820 
super pleased with it it was a little
bit<00:05:46.060> uneven<00:05:46.479> and<00:05:46.779> there<00:05:47.199> was<00:05:47.409> still<00:05:47.620> a<00:05:47.680> little

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
bit uneven and there was still a little

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.709 
bit uneven and there was still a little
bit<00:05:48.190> more<00:05:48.400> movement<00:05:48.639> i<00:05:49.000> was<00:05:49.180> able<00:05:49.360> to<00:05:49.479> keep<00:05:49.569> my

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
bit more movement i was able to keep my

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.619 
bit more movement i was able to keep my
butt<00:05:49.900> down<00:05:50.050> this<00:05:50.229> time<00:05:50.469> but<00:05:51.190> barely<00:05:51.520> so<00:05:51.940> i

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629 
butt down this time but barely so i

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:54.600 
butt down this time but barely so i
definitely<00:05:53.440> think<00:05:53.740> i<00:05:53.889> can<00:05:54.099> make<00:05:54.250> it<00:05:54.430> a<00:05:54.460> little

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
definitely think i can make it a little

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.959 
definitely think i can make it a little
more<00:05:54.699> convincing<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:56.460> do<00:05:57.460> that<00:05:57.699> with<00:05:57.939> a

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
more convincing and do that with a

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.050 
more convincing and do that with a
little<00:05:58.120> less<00:05:58.389> leg<00:05:58.629> Drive<00:05:58.900> if<00:05:59.199> i<00:05:59.500> was<00:05:59.819> just<00:06:00.819> in<00:06:00.939> a

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
little less leg Drive if i was just in a

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.420 
little less leg Drive if i was just in a
better<00:06:01.240> spot<00:06:01.569> in<00:06:01.779> this<00:06:01.990> session<00:06:02.279> the<00:06:03.279> real

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
better spot in this session the real

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.269 
better spot in this session the real
issue<00:06:03.460> came<00:06:03.939> afterwards<00:06:04.750> i<00:06:05.050> was<00:06:05.979> doing<00:06:06.250> my

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:09.089 
back off doubles and for some reason I

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:12.450 
back off doubles and for some reason I
just<00:06:10.229> didn't<00:06:11.229> feel<00:06:11.469> like<00:06:11.500> I<00:06:11.800> really<00:06:11.949> had<00:06:12.250> much

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
just didn't feel like I really had much

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.749 
just didn't feel like I really had much
today<00:06:12.909> um<00:06:13.330> I<00:06:14.039> had<00:06:15.039> to<00:06:15.189> change<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.520> weight

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
today um I had to change the weight

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.320 
today um I had to change the weight
quite<00:06:16.000> a<00:06:16.029> few<00:06:16.240> times<00:06:16.389> I<00:06:16.810> did<00:06:17.080> a<00:06:17.770> few<00:06:18.250> doubles<00:06:19.029> at

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
quite a few times I did a few doubles at

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.540 
quite a few times I did a few doubles at
355<00:06:20.110> that<00:06:20.560> was<00:06:20.710> getting<00:06:20.949> rough<00:06:21.189> I<00:06:21.430> was

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
355 that was getting rough I was

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.070 
355 that was getting rough I was
starting<00:06:21.669> to<00:06:21.849> get<00:06:21.969> sloppy<00:06:22.240> so<00:06:22.629> I<00:06:22.659> went<00:06:22.870> down<00:06:22.930> to

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
starting to get sloppy so I went down to

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.659 
starting to get sloppy so I went down to
350<00:06:23.379> those<00:06:23.860> started<00:06:24.189> getting<00:06:24.370> rough<00:06:24.520> and

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
350 those started getting rough and

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:30.059 
350 those started getting rough and
sloppy<00:06:25.000> and<00:06:25.300> so<00:06:27.150> eventually<00:06:28.150> I<00:06:28.810> think<00:06:29.199> I<00:06:29.560> did<00:06:29.800> a

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:30.069 
sloppy and so eventually I think I did a

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.140 
sloppy and so eventually I think I did a
single<00:06:30.460> at<00:06:31.029> 355<00:06:31.930> and<00:06:32.439> was<00:06:33.400> so<00:06:33.520> crushing<00:06:33.909> sad

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
single at 355 and was so crushing sad

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.750 
single at 355 and was so crushing sad
