00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
back up now as that's a very noisy

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.040 
back up now as that's a very noisy
takedown<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.270> glide<00:04:50.420> think<00:04:50.720> it's<00:04:50.810> going<00:04:50.990> to

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
takedown the glide think it's going to

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.020 
takedown the glide think it's going to
attract<00:04:51.290> people<00:04:51.320> very<00:04:51.890> quickly<00:04:52.190> to<00:04:52.520> it<00:04:52.670> so<00:04:52.940> it

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
attract people very quickly to it so it

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.610 
attract people very quickly to it so it
is<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.120> dangerous<00:04:53.540> tactic<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.080> use<00:04:54.110> but<00:04:54.500> it's

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
is a dangerous tactic to use but it's

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.220 
is a dangerous tactic to use but it's
also<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:54.890> very<00:04:55.070> effective<00:04:55.580> tactic<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.150> use<00:04:59.230> so

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
also a very effective tactic to use so

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.480 
also a very effective tactic to use so
now<00:05:00.380> we're<00:05:00.530> down<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.860> just<00:05:00.890> a<00:05:01.100> couple<00:05:01.130> of

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
that you'll see their behavior starts to

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.150 
that you'll see their behavior starts to
change<00:05:05.870> as<00:05:06.140> well<00:05:06.290> as<00:05:06.470> they<00:05:06.620> become<00:05:06.920> more<00:05:07.100> and

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
they start to become more and more

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.240 
they start to become more and more
nervous<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.420> follow<00:05:14.600> his<00:05:14.780> orders<00:05:15.250> the

him and this again is not something

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.780 
him and this again is not something
that's<00:05:21.230> always<00:05:21.410> predictable<00:05:22.160> but<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.670> way

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
that's always predictable but the way
