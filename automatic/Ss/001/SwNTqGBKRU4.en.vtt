00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.220
 How are you saying hello to Jose? 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.460
 Miguel tree from Lima Peru and today 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.259
 I want to talk to you about money is a 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.540
 problem the money so you can 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.820
 enter a business or for your 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.010
 prospect between a business 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.470
 throughout the 90-day plan that 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.900
 work since December of last year 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.460
 until March and actually the current plan 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.279
 that we are working on my team and I 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.939
 within those plans you find everything 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.559
 kind of people but it's one is a 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.309
 recurrent obsession the theme of the 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.309
 silver money 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.710
 what do they have to see how they get it? 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.360
 They do not know if they will be able to filter well 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.250
 It is difficult for a person with 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.720
 that pressure until the final meeting 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.060
 with you I'll probably stay before 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.550
 but what I want to show you now is 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.130
 what my idea point is to make money 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.610
 it's a real problem I started a 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:01.010
 business of 1200 dollars 600 or 1800 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.690
 say 1200 is a problem 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.119
 it's not the same as it costs you 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.549
 buy a laptop and you have it 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.619
 that's probably not what it costs you 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.780
 buy a led TV with a bluray 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.880
 a home theater and you have them 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.330
 that's probably not what it costs you 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.670
 buy an ipad and an iphone 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.040
 that's not what you have in clothes shoes 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.780
 suitcases suits ties in your wardrobe 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.119
 closet or closet 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.710
 so what I want to give you to see with 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.659
 this is your problem is not the money 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.480
 Because if your problem was money, 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.490
 you would have these things in your house 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.770
 you have a refrigerator you have a 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.080
 washing machine or salts or costs I do not say no 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.180
 it is important proposal 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.710
 and you did not break your head at the time 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.290
 saying how are you going to get back the money 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.440
 the washing machine or the television or the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.160
 wallets 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.530
 of the ornaments is something that you put on 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.900
 wash clothes of neighbors paying you or 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.310
 that you get to charge your friends every 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.909
 time it was a good movie in your 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.590
 bluray 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.720
 or every time they watch TV on your 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.600
 huge led TV 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.360
 you buy something and that something is yours and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.710
 the same thing happens with a business 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.160
 you buy a product or a service and 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.380
 study to use it and be able to offer it or 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.150
 consume it if your product is consumable 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.130
 other services usable because eye that 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.540
 it's also important there are companies that 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.640
 they have more products and services 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.310
 strange and bizarre and that are not a 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.890
 sabers for nothing and that clear the only 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.290
 motivation is to recruit but there is no 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.410
 service so cost or service clear or 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.100
 Tangible product that I can use 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.600
 regardless of the fact of recruiting 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.270
 for me that's not a multi-level business 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.110
 legitimate my opinion I do not want to clash with 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.970
 nobody but it is my opinion 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.970
 but today he returned to the subject of money 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.030
 If your problem was the video, 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.640
 you really could not have bought 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.409
 none of these things as well as neither 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.180
 It has generated a problem of conscience 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.790
 I have not recovered the money from you 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.390
 TV or your washing machine or your 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.609
 laptop or your ipod or ipad grandson iphone ni 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.319
 anything else or your camera 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.909
 have not recovered the money from 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.470
 this why why did not you think that 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.890
 was to recover something was simply 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.569
 a taste that you wanted to give then 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.099
 because you can put an objection to 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.599
 money for a business that costs what 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.680
 same as an artifact that you already have and 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.230
 that you use and that maybe not even 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.150
 you use if your human what you have 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.190
 bought in things toys artifacts 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.540
 clothes in your room or in your house 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.620
 you have 1020 times that amount of money 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.849
 of what I want to give you to understand with 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.310
 this is that the problem is not money 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.870
 but it's your attitude when you realize 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.489
 that is a business issue and that the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.409
 business depends on me because here I do not 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.389
 they're going to vote but it's up to me 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.519
 so if I do not have a result already 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.810
 I can not blame the boss who 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.030
 I limit or I did not pay enough 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.560
 He told me to leave or he did not give me the 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.150
 resources that I needed as no longer 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.610
 you can do that that scares you 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.030
 then of course it's about buying a 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.760
 laptop 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.000
 I give him a card no matter mind 236 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.460
 months does not matter business 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.530
 no no it's not that I have to think about it and see 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.360
 and do numbers and see if I get 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.870
 brothers want to make money you do not want 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.730
 make money 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.720
 that money you're going to spend on another 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.460
 thing but you're going to be on a trip not 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.930
 appliance in an artifact 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.470
 technology for your home in a 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.329
 playstation in an xbox on your mac in a 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.370
 pc 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.789
 you put the name you want, you go 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.860
 to end up spending then between 1200 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.110
 dollars that does not produce you in money 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.270
 versus $ 1200 that if they produce you 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.379
 an income is not smarter to put it 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.210
 in something that produces an income 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.610
 also with a type of business in which 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.650
 do not pay salaries do not pay light water 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.319
 rent phone and where the product or 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.969
 already created by someone else because 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.919
 let's say if everything is forming a team 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:46.199
 of people in the employment world you have 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.520
 to pay a salary to cano here 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.469
 accountant who buys in the same package 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.940
 that you contrast products they 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.849
 become part of your team you do not have 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.590
 you pay you get paid the company 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.690
 so if you are someone who has received 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.520
 this video because you have been presented with 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.139
 business has put the money issue you 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.849
 I want to help reflect simply 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.039
 why money really is not a 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.620
 problem if you really want to do 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.060
 this because maybe in your house has already 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.069
 many things that cost what it costs 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.479
 enter that business and you did not put a single 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.849
 only objection you just wanted 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.699
 have fun 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.319
 you passed the card then if you really 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.080
 you want to do this does not have to be a 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.879
 problem and if you are a person who is 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.879
 beginning working a time in 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:28.159
 multilevel use this what I tell you as a 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.629
 way to help the person that you 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.249
 you present the business to understand why 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.379
 money is not a problem 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:35.330
 and I say help because it's always going to do 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:37.879
 that's about helping to reflect 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.740
 never try to convince because believe me 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:41.899
 that a person who becomes twenty thousand 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.270
 worlds for a subject like money is not going 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:46.789
 to be a good partner for you simply 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.379
 my job is to help that person there 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.849
 have to reflect because really the 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.679
 Money is not a problem so now what 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.569
 wants to do because that same money already 

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:55.849
 I spend it on other things that I do not even 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.139
 they give him an income and over which he is not 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.969
 worried when he retrieves the money 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.189
 I simply buy them and use them 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.769
 enjoy and that same money is going to 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:05.599
 use in something else then helps the 

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:06.830
 people to reflect and understand when 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:08.839
 there is a desire for truth and attitude 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.320
 entrepreneur the money is never a 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:14.780
 problem attitude is everything 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.010
 and does the exercise add things and you 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.450
 you saved from I want heart with an example 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.860
 a while ago he had an interview for 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.760
 skype with a person who wanted to apply 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.620
 the team I presented in my business you 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.200
 I talked about the whole subject and in the end it gave 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.640
 ready good that is ready to begin 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.200
 yes, I want to do this as much as 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.569
 before because when we started let me 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.449
 see how I do with the money theme 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:37.759
 and the mouse if you do not listen very 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:42.770
 well what I speak is because my ipad does not 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:43.999
 It has a very good signal when it does not 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.330
 they have video to start the 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:46.330
 deal 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.920
 when I sew for 800 dollars 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.750
 they realize 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.850
 he is not thinking about when he recovers 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.080
 the money the ipad bought it but when 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.940
 your business has to think like what 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.690
 get and probably what he did with the 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.700
 ipad pass card but that ipad not 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.680
 gives you an income in exchange for a business 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.420
 multilevel if you can give it to you then 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.120
 the problem is not the money problem is 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.530
 the mentality I hope from the heart that this 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.840
 video and that all the information that you 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.460
 I share you useful, I ask you how 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.140
 always please help another 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.300
 people to also receive this message 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.680
 to clean and raise the level in 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.140
 our profession and understand that this is 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.030
