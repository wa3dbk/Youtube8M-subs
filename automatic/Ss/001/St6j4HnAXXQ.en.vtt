00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.950
 My name still does not matter 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.549
 and our crusade is far from over 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.589
 at the end 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.080
 we made it almost fifa out of the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.269
 To bring shops gta 5 is practically out 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.619
 the sale and now we have 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.910
 the next evil picked up namely 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.520
 luigi's mansion 2 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.210
 And this is one of them 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.070
 games that are absolutely forbidden and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.930
 that we carry on so that me 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.390
 continue to have that too 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.790
 comments under my videos quite 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.030
 confirmed I quote from 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.520
 old age shut up 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.399
 or I think you had none 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.910
 good childhood or just easy 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.710
 embarrassing video clip you hatcher tkip 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.710
 only real with a small k 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.449
 by the way, that's music for me 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.699
 my ears and just motivates me 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.100
 to produce more followings so 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.250
 further on further comments writes 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.090
 yes there you see the mission continues 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.049
 and why luigi's mansion 2 for the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.290
 Nintendo 3Ds a game that is absolutely 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.380
 prohibited hear that we now see much 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.630
 fun again starts everything quite harmless 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.119
 here we see the plumber luccin and 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.040
 his employer ulf meyer already here 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.229
 you can critically question 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.970
 So far, the gentleman is his 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.009
 italian workers the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.020
 defeats at football tournaments 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.600
 last years due to inappropriate 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.360
 to feel activities in the truest sense 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.710
 he breaks down here in 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.420
 his items 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.460
 in itself already one 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.390
 Bodily injury is in the legal 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.680
 probably not effective 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.500
 can be consented 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.860
 Well, it should have been here 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.810
 Do not go aim of this game is it 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.020
 to haunt ghosts and then hunt 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.780
 to suck in a vacuum cleaner 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:03.010
 hello's still not heard shot 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.960
 ghost lonely i think it likes to hackt 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.299
 all be drawn cute 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.740
 and great fun is how it is 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.630
 this clearly around 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.300
 assault to the sense of the day 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.989
 223 criminal code and order 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.420
 liberty feet of the cards 239 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.250
 of the criminal code but I hear yes 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.770
 again the defenders of such 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.040
 games that are only through windows 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.930
 they are not people at all 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.910
 it is true that the mentioned paragraphs 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.550
 of people and people talk but yes 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.959
 what are ghosts wikipedia says 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.730
 These are mostly around physical often with 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.620
 equipped with supernatural abilities 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.459
 but at the same time with human 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.200
 properties have been provided around 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.080
 physicality would of course be the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.060
 but rule out bodily injury mostly 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.350
 liberal former human are not 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.580
 are not dead right 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.940
 the commentary literature is about death 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.530
 away death or brain death bundle altogether 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.980
 clearly those who see me think 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.630
 given ghosts definitely still 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.200
 Brain death does not seem to let go and 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.750
 if there is still a heart in doubt 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.610
 just for the ghost regarding the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.700
 By the way, freedom is robbed 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.570
 according to the Federal Court in 32 bands 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.570
 page 187 also to the fact that the 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.760
 in the natural sense, those concerned 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.950
 ability has to be arbitrary 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.340
 change stay 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.290
 you can see that is going on here 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.930
 but clearly even if you have this 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.900
 would always reject laws 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.079
 still the top model personality right 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.959
 grab and suck in a dead one 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.690
 is clearly very active and so 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.730
 offensive and certainly it is then 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.870
 a disturbance of the dead rest in the sense of 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.630
 Section 168 of the Criminal Code is sufficient 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.160
 namely the custody of the body 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.819
 to bring a dead one respectively 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.180
 to be mischievous 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.099
 here is probably definitely the case this 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.349
 Incidentally, the player also uncritically 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.410
 so presents no can 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.310
 Broken window moon as an excuse 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.459
 be valid 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.789
 the one with jÃ¼rgens yard in the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.099
 criminal code 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.289
 At best, maybe I would still courage 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.660
 whoever let money last has vinci 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.699
 We then no longer possible the room 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.580
 to leave without the ghosts 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.139
 to suck in accordingly 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.120
 why did he go in that ? 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.099
 should have felt there since he was 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.470
 simply take time off times and then 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:42.539
 the thing would have been eaten so here 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.740
 really cutting that right now 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.979
 to be able to apply this way 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.050
 I would be quite critical and 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.570
 this is the result of who in 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.699
 Videogame ghost he sucks 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.400
 even in reality not before that 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.919
 to shy away and to abuse the dead 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.590
 bad 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.720
 ohso , luigi is human 211 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.259
 the best and funniest games on the 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.300
 nintendo 3ds that I only know why 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.340
 it really banned me mine 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.289
 By the way, the remaining eight is not 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.050
 memory function within a mission 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:20.280
 gives the to the 5 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.500
 and probably more often 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.100
 But I do not have to play at all 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.660
 but otherwise I sleep restless or 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.870
 someone forbids the game then i would be 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.870
 redeemed 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.610
 that the video industry this little 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.229
 video series has quite noticed that 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.599
 shows that she seems everything 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.729
 after sharp back then shoots 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.860
 against us lawyers we just try 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.770
 the people out there will enlighten 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.639
 now very hard with very hard bandages 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.590
 fought 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.620
 namely the successor of this game 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.800
 of phoenix wright ace attorney shows 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.300
 a whole terrifying world of 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.819
 Lawyers, of course, even the reality 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.349
 has nothing to do and only serves us 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.680
 Poor lawyers pee against the leg 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.060
 not nice 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.089
 and there I will defend myself in the 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:12.370
 next episode of play the absolutely 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:12.370
 banned until then bye
