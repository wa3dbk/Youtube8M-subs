 mister frank welcome back to this new one 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.010
 video and we conclude ours here 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.570
 experience on exor zombies for how much 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.609
 regards easter egg is indeed in this 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.349
 video I will show you how to conclude lists 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.539
 bears what you have to do is itself 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.039
 simply once having acquired 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.380
 all four badges as you have 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.480
 shown in the last video you will have to 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.529
 just keep killing 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.570
 zombies until the number indicating i 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.120
 Belgian owned by your player not 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.600
 will arrive at 49 in fact killing the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.190
 zombie in a rather casual way 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.140
 these will leave you dead once a 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.710
 badges that you can collect by passing by 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.399
 over it 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.809
 when you get to 49 coming back to the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:55.840
 computer where you inserted the battery 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:59.010
 you will hear this sentence to complete 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.690
 then the step will be enough to go to 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.120
 then log in let's say 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.070
 just find your reader 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.560
 fingerprints that I say right 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.390
 because precisely there are four each 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.400
 specific to each character 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.740
 as for cannes we find the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.840
 his fingerprint reader in the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.500
 area next to the area of 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.500
 decontamination 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.700
 as for his decker instead 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.210
 fingerprint reader is located 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.900
 in the lateral staircase in the hall of the dl 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.900
 of the actions 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.620
 today instead it has its reader of 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.340
 fingerprints in the same room 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.030
 where is exo health or the jack for 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.910
 who wants to use the ancient wording between 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.370
 quotes and finally lilith has his 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.040
 fingerprint reader in the room 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.580
 above the station 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.580
 of the ex 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.920
 in this case, being the IT, I am 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.410
 went to this fingerprint reader 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.310
 digital and subsequently for 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.770
 complete easter egg you will have to come back 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.770
 in the former hall and buy a 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.630
 new ex in quotes by pressing hicks 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.050
 on the former or in fact will tell me 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.360
 the writing you already have will appear 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.400
 an ex o and then once purchased 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.400
 the former you will find yourself facing this 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.450
 once completed it will remain for the boys 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.549
 you will also unlock the 50g game trophy 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.019
 over which unfortunately you could not 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.060
 see on the screen because they have 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.500
 disabled notifications so it is not 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.739
 appeared but fat what 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.840
 unlocked and once completed 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.959
 of easter egg in the action room 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.569
 you will find a new one new station 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.700
 to upgrade the weapons it will allow to 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.750
 strengthen the weapons precisely up to a 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:40.220
 maximum of 25 times 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.790
 the weapon that is upgraded up to 25 to one 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.190
 camouflage 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.379
 obviously in addition to the increased damage 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.200
 etc. will have a diamond camouflage 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.239
 that's very pretty 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.459
 boys for this easter egg course 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.200
 as you have seen it done in single 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.659
 but can also be performed in 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.819
 cooperative just that everyone respects 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.450
 let's say the peculiarities of one's own 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.269
 character 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.829
 for the rest I hope I was the 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.450
 as clear and comprehensive as possible if 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.120
 you have any kind of doubt 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.040
