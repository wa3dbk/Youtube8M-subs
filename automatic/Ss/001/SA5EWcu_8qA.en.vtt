at<00:04:28.650> all<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.100> maybe<00:04:29.880> in<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.240> way<00:04:31.130> it's<00:04:32.130> kind<00:04:32.310> of

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
at all and maybe in a way it's kind of

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.560 
at all and maybe in a way it's kind of
necessary<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:34.560> have<00:04:35.100> this<00:04:35.700> episode<00:04:36.270> be

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
necessary to have this episode be

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.529 
necessary to have this episode be
annoying<00:04:37.410> maybe<00:04:38.099> they<00:04:38.370> did<00:04:38.580> go<00:04:38.789> a<00:04:38.820> little<00:04:39.330> too

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
annoying maybe they did go a little too

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.839 
annoying maybe they did go a little too
over-the-top<00:04:39.750> with<00:04:40.229> the<00:04:40.409> unknowing<00:04:41.130> moments

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
over-the-top with the unknowing moments

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.189 
over-the-top with the unknowing moments
but<00:04:42.419> I<00:04:42.720> think

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
but I think

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.679 
but I think
honestly<00:04:43.800> neither<00:04:44.099> because<00:04:44.669> if<00:04:45.029> we<00:04:45.449> didn't

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:45.689 
honestly neither because if we didn't

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.379 
honestly neither because if we didn't
have<00:04:45.990> those<00:04:46.349> annoying<00:04:46.860> moments<00:04:47.400> we<00:04:48.029> wouldn't

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
have those annoying moments we wouldn't

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.230 
have those annoying moments we wouldn't
have<00:04:48.719> this<00:04:48.900> episode<00:04:49.379> and<00:04:49.889> we<00:04:50.099> wouldn't<00:04:50.400> have<00:04:50.460> a

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
have this episode and we wouldn't have a

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.749 
have this episode and we wouldn't have a
creative<00:04:51.960> storyline<00:04:52.499> I<00:04:52.860> hope<00:04:53.430> that<00:04:53.580> makes

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
creative storyline I hope that makes

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.129

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
sense to some of you guys but that's

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.619 
sense to some of you guys but that's
