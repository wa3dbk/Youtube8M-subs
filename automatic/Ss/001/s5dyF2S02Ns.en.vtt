Chevrolet Corvette as you can see here
we<00:00:06.990> actually<00:00:07.109> have<00:00:07.290> ones<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.770> mufflers<00:00:08.280> take

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
we actually have ones of mufflers take

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.400 
we actually have ones of mufflers take
them<00:00:08.670> down<00:00:08.849> already<00:00:09.120> basically<00:00:09.990> we<00:00:10.139> did<00:00:10.290> that

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
them down already basically we did that

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.540 
them down already basically we did that
to<00:00:10.500> be<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.620> better<00:00:10.769> view<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.040> Frank<00:00:11.400> because

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
to be a better view of Frank because

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.190 
to be a better view of Frank because
such<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> tight<00:00:12.090> working<00:00:12.360> area<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.780> begin<00:00:12.900> with

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
such a tight working area to begin with

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.079 
such a tight working area to begin with
the<00:00:13.889> instructions<00:00:14.400> say<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.580> don't<00:00:14.820> have<00:00:15.059> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
the instructions say you don't have to

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.210 
the instructions say you don't have to
do<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:16.470> overall<00:00:16.770> it'd<00:00:16.949> be<00:00:17.070> worth

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
do it but I think overall it'd be worth

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.500 
do it but I think overall it'd be worth
the<00:00:17.400> effort<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.760> go<00:00:17.850> ahead<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.090> take<00:00:18.210> down<00:00:18.390> two

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the effort to go ahead and take down two

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.750 
the effort to go ahead and take down two
mufflers<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.109> get<00:00:19.920> your<00:00:20.039> work<00:00:20.189> done<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.460> put

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
mufflers and get your work done and put

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.189 
mufflers and get your work done and put
them<00:00:20.850> up<00:00:20.939> when<00:00:21.090> you're<00:00:21.210> done<00:00:21.330> what's<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.170> to
