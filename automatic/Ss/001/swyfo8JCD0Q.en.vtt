00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.790
 in the comments because they are very good 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.030
 it's good because the day I bring 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.530
 the review of episode number 14 of 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.810
 follow and equine that today in Kiev a 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.110
 very interesting episode although there was 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.520
 a lot of talk if I go to talk was a 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.400
 very interesting episode because we were going to 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.860
 new characters and then to the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.050
 personalities of levy that already some are 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.390
 waiting for us well then the first thing that 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.370
 we all write a new paragraph and a 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.079
 new ending which I think exceeds in 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.910
 very much in animation to the previous but 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.829
 a lot is a lot because the animation in 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.590
 this time it was spectacular it seems a 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.930
 movie but in musicality I think that 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.670
 the previous one wins what does not and 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.040
 humiliated this time in 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.510
 musicality but I'm going to put in I prefer 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.190
 the musicality so I think I like it 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.320
 a little more than the previous one but the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.420
 This animation was great for what 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.280
 character nial and then what happens is that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.800
 this one when I started I thought it was a 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.960
 national anthem and I like that good 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.670
 since but now we do start with the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.130
 review of the episode the first thing that 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.829
 we should already start the chapter is that 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.280
 good eren is practically closed 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.380
 as 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.540
 rich in both hands 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.460
 practically as if it was a pity 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.650
 of death was practically true 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.900
 a new character appears who is called 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.720
 there's a sergeant who practically 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.580
 that investigates the Titans is from the group 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.740
 of recognition and well she says good 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.659
 will go to court we will see what 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.220
 happens with you if you die or you stay 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.740
 with us the recognition group 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.659
 as you know the sergeant smith and 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.360
 levi are saying they would do what 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.190
 possible for it to survive that we what 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.960
 they will send and so that they want with it is 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.259
 true then because something like that was what 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.060
 He passed 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.009
 we see that the sending to the court and 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.720
 all eyes are on him 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.840
 obviously but with a look of 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.890
 contempt of the great does not look and everything 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.440
 the world is watching with 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.330
 great disdain and well as if 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.659
 was the worst criminal and so good 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.630
 start as the action or in the 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.759
 court true the trial and then they were see 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.789
 to my house and harbin but they gave it 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.760
 as witnesses to testify that 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.800
 it turns out to be true obviously after that 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.840
 the judge look for is one of the hard ones the 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.120
 practically the captain 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.190
 of the three divisions and I like that 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.069
 we see that the trial begins and 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.780
 put to start the military police to 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.760
 speak true I think it is that they are called 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.379
 well and they start to say us 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.180
 we want to know to investigate the new 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.459
 kill him because that could cause a lot 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.110
 promotion and humanity could bring 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.100
 civil wars and things like that for the 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.840
 style while the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.060
 the strength of recognition is no longer 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.680
 we want it for us to 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.080
 make it a weapon for humanity and 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.790
 to be able to win like this the titans and thus thus 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.380
 it was a clash between all the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.410
 people who are in court all 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.260
 the world is like a little hot 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.940
 true they are well well brave something like that 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.700
 like that and then there are shocks 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.430
 between people and then nothing after 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.600
 of that we see that the big sergeant 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.750
 ask eren hey you are willing to 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.370
 control your strong titan and help the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.780
 human if he says yes obviously clear 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.420
 Well, that question, I think it was a 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.220
 bit stupid true and then after there 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.640
 comes the military police I think that I already 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.230
 the german those guys and they said no 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.700
 because there are indications that when he 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.570
 it made him take away the ambition of 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.850
 pixies he attacked my house plant with my 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.400
 house and then there people are like 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.800
 oh god and if so was the sergeant 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.240
 greater that hard told him my house 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.240
 I ask my house if it was true he 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.160
 He said yes and then nothing after that 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.530
 we see and she says no but it does not matter 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.930
 because on two previous occasions 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.300
 I like it after the whole court 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.670
 he's still hot and they say what he touches 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.950
 is to kill him because well they can 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.380
 happen weird things or that would serve to 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.110
 rebuild the wall Mary and it will help 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.350
 to serve the walls because he said that 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.640
 not wanting would be note not because it 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.190
 apply for humanity and all the 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.030
 good world is very hot if it is 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.560
 hot after that everyone says that 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.180
 Care also with my house they started to 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.300
 say that in my house I can go to do a 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.370
 titan see air that exploded exploded and 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.170
 being good to me can be our 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.810
 but to me with my house do not mess and I 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.750
 I'm still in my house do not mess with 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.150
 my house do not mess he said and then to the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.340
 people know that I'm not true because 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.960
 they were started as da steam and 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.120
 Well, that's how it becomes 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.130
 titan and by people like it recedes 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.020
 a bit and that's where we see sergeant 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.270
 law that was going to give him a beating I think that 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.430
 is in a little bit which is acting 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.500
 as for what you were to imply to 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.120
 people that do not attack eren 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.640
 because you can also become a 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.140
 titan can kill them because the 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.740
 people ask you to saw him already 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.740
 quiet 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.900
 weak and others because that what 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.210
 you are doing what you are attacking 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.370
 they arrived osasuna 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.229
 and that's when we see that it returns 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.020
 acting but I think it happens a little 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.840
 because the trial would win for him 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.979
 finally won that was very good and entered the 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.039
 recognition group 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.599
 after that we saw the family wing 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.310
 I practically think it's familiar or 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.560
 relative of the potato girl show I think 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.389
 which is called and then the beginning 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.970
 flex and then after I opened the 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.110
 mouth and already had the tooth to 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.610
 practically rebuilt because 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.289
 had had a tooth removed when the 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.699
 has come back and then there he already had the 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.770
 tooth either shadow bile under the 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.599
 and he began the new chapter in that link 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.360
 I liked the previous one more, yes 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.130
 totally liked everything and practically 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.259
 that's how the episode ends was an episode 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.080
 we have many new things 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:49.030
 many new characters where we saw that 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.539
 the military police are children of 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.699
 bitch and where we saw how good you can go 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.830
 entering the recognition group and 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.180
 who knows what will happen next true 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.560
