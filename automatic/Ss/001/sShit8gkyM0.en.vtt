00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.490
 good evening from luca nerazzurro this is the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.610
 video post qarabagh inter that reports it 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.929
 0 0 of our say second team 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.289
 with osvaldo as a tip thinks it went 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.850
 well i did some good ho movement 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.750
 put minutes in the legs that are useful 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.869
 and a draw for a game he doesn't have 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.739
 given great emotions or maybe they are 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.370
 were also benefited by the regular goal 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.290
 canceled to the opponents at the end and go 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.340
 admitted when it is allowed when there 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.210
 please be told when it is not in favor and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:53.300
 just accept as the game of 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.000
 football shows up and I wanted anyway 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.039
 thank you for the growth in the channel 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.329
 for visualizations and we think 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.860
 together 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:11.010
 let's create this project together hopefully 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.000
 the results arrive always come from 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:20.759
 the more the better we hope the inter already 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.590
 from Monday put your head on and 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.409
 frames a serious goal for one 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.509
 time we hope to be able to take 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.600
 these three points to the tree even though 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.820
 there I feel uncomfortable to say one 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.270
 let's hope 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.000
 let's take three points to Verona 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:43.649
 which I could say four years ago 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.100
 we hope not to draw against Rome 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:52.049
 Rome four years ago I could think of 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.250
 we hope not to not suffer goals 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.920
 instead now I find myself saying hopefully 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:03.649
 to win in Verona to go up a 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.960
 minimum we trust in the draws on Monday 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:10.560
 at 1pm why 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.610
 did not know the Italians have passed 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.810
 the torino won the napoli sta 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:22.290
 winning the already qualified Florentine 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.860
 we hope not to meet immediately 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.860
 some difficult teams for the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.209
 competition this any opponent 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.910
 will present itself 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.330
 and just face it with the eldest 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.330
 seriousness 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.370
 obviously this draw this 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.720
 let's say this moment does not come 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.550
 raised by a non-qualification 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.950
 will be raised in the chased by one 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.989
 perhaps presumed victory in Verona that 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.810
 what all of us all referred to 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.690
 we need 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.640
 we hope as left-handed says to see of 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.380
 new big wins those that 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.580
 also with him we were used to 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.800
 to see 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.870
 I am finally happy to have gods 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.549
 young boys run bite the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.610
 ankles of the opponents put us gritty 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.590
 to earn that area I am 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.220
 really proud of a lot 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:30.110
 bonazzoli in the field from the first minute of 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.480
 a baldini himself I enjoyed seeing again 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.640
 Campagnano even though I honestly don't 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.220
 I see him as an inter by osvaldo fanatic 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.170
 which I am glad to have returned 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:51.000
 with the team and nothing the moment is not 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.420
 of the best always expects this 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.160
 Monday game a head but I do 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.140
 I have it because I want redemption 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.170
 We have the players on the team 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.859
 the qualities also the coach when with 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.160
 the balls 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.739
 there is therefore we say that we have good people 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.269
 resolutions for a disability 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.870
 the three points we lost against 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.329
 Udine in the home thinks with interests 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.840
 we still have almost the stomach has 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:27.010
 lived a week not the best 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:29.930
 however, this is a love story 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.850
 love stories are not just made of 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.169
 good times are made of good times 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.960
 bad times, joys and sorrows, however, it is 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:43.220
 we know when inter wins wins well 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:47.720
 when he loses dinner he makes you feel right 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.030
 humans we are connected to this team 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.940
 I think I'm talking on behalf of 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.830
 all the fans of the inter is not there 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.340
 precise moment in which one of 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.060
 Interim collapse it is 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.370
 yes it is you can become it after you do not 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:09.039
 can find out later how everything though 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:13.250
 inside one feels it lives I wanted it 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.870
 again I thank you for that 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.039

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.110

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.280
 different opinions are still enough 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:48.400
 embarrassed but I will improve at that time vi 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.400
