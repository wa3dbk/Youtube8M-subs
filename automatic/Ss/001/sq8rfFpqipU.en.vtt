the<00:00:29.910> future<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.300> very<00:00:30.330> bright<00:00:30.539> form<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.260> we're

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the future is very bright form so we're

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.260 
the future is very bright form so we're
excited<00:00:32.160> when<00:00:32.460> our<00:00:32.550> scouts<00:00:32.820> are<00:00:33.000> ecstatic

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
excited when our scouts are ecstatic

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.420 
excited when our scouts are ecstatic
think<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.020> had<00:00:34.200> he<00:00:34.320> been<00:00:34.440> healthy<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.829> year<00:00:34.950> I

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
think it had he been healthy all year I

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.860 
think it had he been healthy all year I
think<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> teams<00:00:36.270> would<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.480> picked<00:00:36.719> them

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
think the teams would have picked them

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.080 
think the teams would have picked them
behind<00:00:37.200> well<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.399> injury<00:00:38.550> set<00:00:38.969> him

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
behind well I think the injury set him

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.119 
behind well I think the injury set him
back<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.510> some<00:00:39.750> teams<00:00:40.020> list<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.559> go<00:00:40.890> back<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
back on some teams list I go back to

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.850 
back on some teams list I go back to
back<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.850> Keith<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.270> Chuck's<00:00:42.510> year<00:00:42.770> after<00:00:43.770> he

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
back to Keith to Chuck's year after he

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.760 
back to Keith to Chuck's year after he
broke<00:00:44.040> his<00:00:44.219> ankle<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.620> Winnipeg<00:00:46.620> were

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
broke his ankle and and Winnipeg were

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.110 
broke his ankle and and Winnipeg were
able<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> much<00:00:47.430> later<00:00:47.670> than<00:00:47.789> they<00:00:47.969> would

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
able to get a much later than they would

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.880 
able to get a much later than they would
have<00:00:48.149> been<00:00:48.300> otherwise<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.930> i<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.800> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
have been otherwise so i think it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.590 
have been otherwise so i think it
probably<00:00:49.920> set<00:00:50.430> him<00:00:50.550> back<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.879> some<00:00:51.120> teams<00:00:51.329> list

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
probably set him back on some teams list

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.660 
probably set him back on some teams list
we've<00:00:52.469> checked<00:00:52.739> out<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> injury<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.550> we're

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
we've checked out the injury and we're

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.880 
we've checked out the injury and we're
not<00:00:53.820> concerned<00:00:54.480> about<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.930> juice<00:00:55.530> or<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
not concerned about it juice or the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.830 
not concerned about it juice or the
possibility<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.460> moving<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.879> at<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.660> get

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
possibility of moving up at all to get

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.119 
possibility of moving up at all to get
him<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.140> did<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.350> he'd<00:00:58.649> followed<00:00:59.010> over

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
him or did you think he'd followed over

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.880 
him or did you think he'd followed over
the<00:00:59.340> word<00:00:59.489> well<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.719> felt<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.199> he'd<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.680> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the word well we felt that he'd get to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
the word well we felt that he'd get to
us<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.399> there<00:01:02.730> were<00:01:02.789> other<00:01:02.910> players<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.390> we

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
us and there were other players that we

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.149 
us and there were other players that we
liked<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.140> weren't<00:01:04.290> able<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.680> did<00:01:05.010> look

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
liked if we weren't able to I did look

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.380 
liked if we weren't able to I did look
into<00:01:05.400> moving<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:05.970> didn't<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
into moving up but I didn't like the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.679 
into moving up but I didn't like the
price<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.020> was<00:01:07.909> it<00:01:08.909> would<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.119> cost<00:01:09.299> us<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
price I was it would have cost us a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.600 
price I was it would have cost us a
fortune<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:10.290> move<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.040> couple<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.430> deals

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
fortune to move up a couple of deals

fast<00:01:34.829> track<00:01:35.130> because<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> way<00:01:35.670> comes<00:01:35.970> but

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
fast track because the way comes but

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.940 
fast track because the way comes but
we're<00:01:36.780> certainly<00:01:37.020> not<00:01:37.229> expecting<00:01:37.799> him<00:01:37.890> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
we're certainly not expecting him to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.950 
we're certainly not expecting him to
play<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.310> year<00:01:38.490> seems<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.479> very<00:01:39.509> good<00:01:39.900> in

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
play this year seems to be very good in

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.289 
play this year seems to be very good in
his<00:01:40.229> own<00:01:40.380> zone<00:01:40.409> doesn't<00:01:41.280> panic<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> puck

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
his own zone doesn't panic with the puck

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.480 
his own zone doesn't panic with the puck
and<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.990> jump<00:01:43.229> into<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> rush<00:01:43.649> quite<00:01:44.340> easily

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and can jump into the rush quite easily

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.050 
and can jump into the rush quite easily
yeah<00:01:45.290> judiciously<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> good<00:01:47.490> skater<00:01:47.820> so

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
yeah judiciously to was a good skater so

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.639 
yeah judiciously to was a good skater so
he<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.390> join<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.780> rush<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.290> feel<00:01:49.500> he's

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
he can join the rush but we feel he's

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.480 
he can join the rush but we feel he's
not<00:01:49.829> reckless<00:01:51.320> mature<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.890> terms<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.340> his

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
not reckless mature in terms of his

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.190 
not reckless mature in terms of his
decision<00:01:53.909> making<00:01:54.240> for<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.479> kid<00:01:54.750> his<00:01:54.840> age<00:01:55.020> he

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
decision making for a kid his age he

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.030 
decision making for a kid his age he
makes<00:01:55.700> wise<00:01:56.700> decisions<00:01:57.360> he's<00:01:57.509> not<00:01:57.659> a

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
makes wise decisions he's not a

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.280 
makes wise decisions he's not a
impetuous<00:01:59.040> player
