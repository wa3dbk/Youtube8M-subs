00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
muscle make it harder because when you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.040 
muscle make it harder because when you
go<00:00:43.620> heavy<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.160> actually<00:00:44.820> breaks<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.539> muscle

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
go heavy it actually breaks the muscle

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.760 
go heavy it actually breaks the muscle
fibers<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.700> regrows<00:00:48.510> next<00:00:49.230> time<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
fibers and then it regrows next time and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.130 
fibers and then it regrows next time and
it<00:00:50.190> becomes<00:00:50.399> harder<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.809> little<00:00:51.840> bit

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
it becomes harder and a little bit

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.660 
it becomes harder and a little bit
bigger<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.739> right<00:00:52.860> if<00:00:52.980> trying<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.309> gain<00:00:53.430> size
