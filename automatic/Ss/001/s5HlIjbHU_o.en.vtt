00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
those customizations and I think you'll

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.770 
those customizations and I think you'll
like<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.420> oh<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:33.380> forgot<00:05:33.650> this<00:05:34.090> I'm<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.420> camera

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
like it oh I forgot this I'm the camera

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.130 
like it oh I forgot this I'm the camera
so<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.830> camera<00:05:37.220> with<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.060> aokp<00:05:38.690> roms<00:05:38.900> you

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
so the camera with the aokp roms you

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.950 
so the camera with the aokp roms you
usually<00:05:39.350> lose<00:05:40.010> on<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:41.150> continuous<00:05:41.750> shooting

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
usually lose on the continuous shooting

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.560 
usually lose on the continuous shooting
mode<00:05:42.140> so<00:05:42.890> we<00:05:43.010> can<00:05:43.190> do<00:05:43.340> is<00:05:43.490> set<00:05:43.760> focus<00:05:44.030> mode<00:05:44.390> to

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
mode so we can do is set focus mode to

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.040 
mode so we can do is set focus mode to
continuous<00:05:45.170> and<00:05:45.910> also<00:05:46.910> burst<00:05:47.300> mode<00:05:47.540> to<00:05:47.840> five

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
continuous and also burst mode to five

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.350

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
go so it's kind of a different way of

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.400 
go so it's kind of a different way of
doing<00:06:17.259> it<00:06:17.710> but<00:06:17.949> it<00:06:18.069> does<00:06:18.250> work<00:06:18.870> so<00:06:19.870> this<00:06:20.380> is

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
doing it but it does work so this is

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.170 
doing it but it does work so this is
like<00:06:20.650> an<00:06:20.800> alternative<00:06:21.430> to<00:06:21.639> the<00:06:21.789> census
