00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.250 
fine and dandy and then I had to take it

gonna<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.760> modify<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.390> little<00:00:30.420> bit

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
gonna have to modify it a little bit

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.000 
gonna have to modify it a little bit
that's<00:00:32.430> how<00:00:32.790> much<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.329> had<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.570> take<00:00:33.840> off<00:00:34.050> using

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
that's how much I had to take off using

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.180 
that's how much I had to take off using
just<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.579> regular<00:00:35.910> razor<00:00:36.180> knife<00:00:36.620> and<00:00:37.620> then

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
just a regular razor knife and then

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
just a regular razor knife and then
because<00:00:38.610> when<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.879> plug<00:00:39.090> your<00:00:39.510> headset

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
because when you plug your headset

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.619 
because when you plug your headset
adapter<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.340> doesn't<00:00:41.730> seed<00:00:42.000> properly

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
adapter in it doesn't seed properly

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.690 
adapter in it doesn't seed properly
because<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.230> lip<00:00:43.469> right<00:00:43.680> here<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:44.520> you'll

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
because this lip right here if you'll

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.420 
because this lip right here if you'll
notice<00:00:45.110> you<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.230> there's<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.710> extra<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
notice you know there's that extra and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.750 
notice you know there's that extra and
then<00:00:47.579> right<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> sides<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:50.730> doesn't

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
then right here on the sides it doesn't

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
then right here on the sides it doesn't
see<00:00:51.239> properly<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.440> won't<00:00:52.590> recognize<00:00:53.039> your

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
see properly so it won't recognize your

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.360 
see properly so it won't recognize your
headset<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.920> what<00:00:56.010> you'll<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
this over it and then you'll have to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.380 
this over it and then you'll have to
overlap<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.369> bit<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.579> stuff<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> overlap

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
overlap a little bit I stuff to overlap

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.460 
overlap a little bit I stuff to overlap
it<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> front<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.400> but<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.290> not

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it on the front here but but it's not

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.450 
it on the front here but but it's not
too<00:01:44.189> bad

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
too bad

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.280 
too bad
I<00:01:44.610> didn't<00:01:44.820> want<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.060> take<00:01:45.360> from<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.960> part

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
I didn't want to take from this part

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.280 
I didn't want to take from this part
because<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.890> would<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:48.030> look<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.450> an

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
because then it would just look like an

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.770 
because then it would just look like an
Asian<00:01:49.680> baby<00:01:49.890> made<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.700> I'm<00:01:51.390> not<00:01:51.509> trying<00:01:51.689> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
Asian baby made it and I'm not trying to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.069 
Asian baby made it and I'm not trying to
go<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.310> I'm<00:01:53.310> sorry

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
go for that I'm sorry

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.870 
go for that I'm sorry
plug<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.070> know<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.490> got<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
plug it in and then you know just got a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.270 
plug it in and then you know just got a
little<00:01:57.570> overlap<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.770> think<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.130> looks

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
little overlap but I think it looks

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.090 
little overlap but I think it looks
alright<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> overlap<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:01.020> um<00:02:01.439> other

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
alright with the overlap but um other

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.060 
alright with the overlap but um other
than<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:03.119> actually<00:02:03.450> not<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.630> bad<00:02:04.070> you

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
than that it's actually not that bad you

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.230 
than that it's actually not that bad you
