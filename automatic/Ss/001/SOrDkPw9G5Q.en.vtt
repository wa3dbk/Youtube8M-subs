00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.899
 you are welcome 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.620
 and 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.879
 because luis enrique 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.950
 because he is a coach who knows 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.630
 our way of playing knows our 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.500
 playing philosophy because he has shown 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.990
 its competitive level the ability to 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.310
 be at the high level and compete in 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.710
 that high level because we know each other 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.329
 obviously since the time of 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.739
 barça see but if it were because we 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.570
 we have known for many years that we 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.899
 we know some goal has gotten me 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.840
 so much I do not know if that adds or subtracts in the 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.090
 process but because it has the ability 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.930
 because we believe that it is fully 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.070
 trained to direct football 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.380
 barcelona to attend to the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.600
 responsibility d 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.600
 be up to this challenge 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.510
 I would say because Luis is one of those people 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.969
 who dares with difficult challenges and 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.790
 knowing this house knows that the one of the 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:08.659
 next season is a level challenge 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.759
 is one and that needs convinced people 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.580
 of people full of hope and the 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.140
 necessary energy to assume that 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.360
 challenge against the difficulties that it has 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.740
 to take them together because this is not 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.479
 a challenge of Luis Enrique is a challenge 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.490
 I feel from Barcelona 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.460
 point of view the first person in charge of 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.600
 that of that task and together we're going to 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.570
 walk in that in that process 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.280
 because it's someone who knows our 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.770
 way of working because he knows our 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.960
 way to train because he knows 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.210
 our grassroots football to the players of the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.810
 barça see why sometimes often called 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.670
 the drop down he knows them almost better 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.159
 that I because he has had them in addition in his 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.479
 team therefore do not have to explain in 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.990
 that point of view must be explained 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.690
 few things because his work team 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.580
 attends to our concept of a 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.990
 compact group that can cater to all 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.350
 the needs that a great club has 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.840
 like his crazy Barcelona and from there 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.229
 Well, we also have old acquaintances 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.569
 that we have shared many moments with 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.980
 juan carlos with robert a rafael what 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.870
 we know a little less joaquin 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.489
 I have known him for a long time since 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.739
 times where where I dedicated myself to other 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.450
 activities other than football and 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.970
 because from that point of view we believe 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.970
 that we are there in the best hands 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.680
 to get the best performance at 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.390
 the template that we are 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.040
 capable of making the best 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.380
 we are able to make in this 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.420
 in this period of 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.450
 between seasons to say it a 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.150
 way and put at your disposal the best 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.030
 so we can be at the best level and 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.610
 we are at the level that the fc is required 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.010
 barcelona as I suppose you want to go up 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.870
 that mass to louis first let's give it 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.890
 in a video and from there we started 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.890
 with the questions then 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.930
 in fact 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.930
 all right 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.340
 do you have 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.020
 enrique first team coach 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.330
 for the next two seasons 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.129
 we give the floor 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.129
 you hear if one day 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.700
 well I liked it a lot 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.560
 I congratulate those who have also made 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.360
 has seen some other goal with what 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.500
 which my little daughter of four years who 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.630
 he always tells me that because he did not mark 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.330
 goals look that from time to time some 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.240
 some mark goes that is very grateful 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.290
 those who have done the video and a little 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.900
 more seriously in the first place I would like 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.880
 thank the president to Mr. Bartoméu and 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.070
 andoni zubizarreta and the whole board 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.680
 directive 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:32.310
 your decision your support and your confidence in 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.830
 me and in the coaching staff that we arrived 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.520
 today for me today is a very very day 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.570
 exciting is a very special day is a 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.430
 day when I think we started 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.770
 build 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.630
 a new barça a barça that can 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:50.700
 delude a barça that picks up again 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.830
 all interests and get all 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.780
 the results we are looking for today is a 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.940
 very special day because I had already had 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.880
 said when I left the boat sees that 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.190
 it was a see you later and you could shortly 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.740
 be around here they have kept their word to 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.800
 despite the difficulty that I knew that 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:10.260
 I had that message but for me today is a 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.450
 day that marks everything what 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.580
 can a coach aspire not only for 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.610
 the fact that this is the club that 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.310
 first I trust in me when I still do not 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.510
 had a journey like no no 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.550
 coach or did not have any 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.720
 I coaching experience 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.670
 They offered the police to stop the barça 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.630
 from him I did it for three years I learned 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:32.840
 very much I think it improves in that process 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.850
 of experience that every coach 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.520
 need at that time I value it from 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.260
 a very clear way from there I 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.240
 I left because it's also true that 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.400
 I never thought or never aimed 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.320
 enter the first team of the club and 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.760
 I explain a little because this 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.350
 because I think they are that kind of 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.020
 such wonderful things that you as the 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:55.020
 Plantes do not appear better to do your 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.270
 way to do it the greatest possible merit 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.430
 so that if one day he considers it appropriate 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.110
 is present today is that day and that's why 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.780
 I can only be here happy 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.660
 smiling I hope to give the club everything 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.520
 what I need, I hope to remain faithful to 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.990
 what I am as a person as a coach 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.850
 when he speaks in the first person I speak 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.270
 of course also from my group of 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:18.420
 I work and nothing starts a season today 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:21.180
 same already this afternoon we already started to 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:24.690
 what is deciding things more or less 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:27.570
 important things that I hope attract with 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.490
 with a great season of the 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.400
 responsibility and I know the difficulty that 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.960
 he has the project but 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.490
 I'm looking forward to hearing again the 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.699
 anthem of the barça al camp nou and listen to it 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.830
 this time not as partners but as how 

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:42.380
 a coach and enjoy process it 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.669
 try I hope to enjoy a lot nothing 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.350
 more I hope I have not forgotten anything 

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:47.350
 important and many thanks to all
