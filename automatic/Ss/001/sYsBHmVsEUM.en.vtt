Alvarez from back in September of 2013
I'm<00:00:04.589> gonna<00:00:04.740> focus<00:00:04.920> on<00:00:05.100> what<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.370> think<00:00:05.790> are<00:00:05.910> the

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
I'm gonna focus on what I think are the

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.490 
I'm gonna focus on what I think are the
three<00:00:06.270> top<00:00:06.450> takeaways<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:06.990> each<00:00:07.170> fighter

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
three top takeaways of each fighter

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.140 
three top takeaways of each fighter
starting<00:00:07.950> off<00:00:08.040> with<00:00:08.160> Canelo<00:00:08.550> Alvarez<00:00:08.849> who<00:00:09.120> I

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
starting off with Canelo Alvarez who I

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.509 
starting off with Canelo Alvarez who I
feel<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.990> bad<00:00:10.200> strategy<00:00:10.530> from<00:00:10.950> start<00:00:11.309> and

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
feel that a bad strategy from start and

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.249 
feel that a bad strategy from start and
failed<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.940> change<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.420> strategy<00:00:12.719> later<00:00:13.110> in

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
failed to change that strategy later in

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.049 
failed to change that strategy later in
the<00:00:13.320> fight<00:00:13.530> first<00:00:14.340> thing<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.639> think<00:00:14.700> he<00:00:14.880> did

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
the fight first thing I think he did

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.400 
the fight first thing I think he did
wrong<00:00:15.240> was<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.509> he<00:00:15.660> tried<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> box<00:00:16.199> of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
wrong was that he tried a box of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.040 
wrong was that he tried a box of
superior<00:00:16.890> boxer<00:00:17.369> I've<00:00:18.090> always<00:00:18.420> felt<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.840> if

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
here's a good rule of thumb for you guys

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.459 
here's a good rule of thumb for you guys
if<00:01:59.610> your<00:01:59.820> heads<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.119> moving<00:02:00.509> move<00:02:00.990> your<00:02:01.110> feet

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
if your heads not moving move your feet

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.289 
if your heads not moving move your feet
if<00:02:01.740> feet<00:02:02.100> aren't<00:02:02.280> moving<00:02:02.759> move<00:02:03.060> your<00:02:03.180> head

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
if feet aren't moving move your head

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.270 
if feet aren't moving move your head
that's<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.140> good<00:02:04.290> way<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.409> keep<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.890> from

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
that's a good way to keep this from

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:19.740 
that's a good way to keep this from
happening

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.750

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
elusive that nobody's really figured it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.800 
elusive that nobody's really figured it
out<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.310> could<00:02:28.970> spend<00:02:29.150> an<00:02:29.299> entire<00:02:29.420> video

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
out I could spend an entire video

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.509 
out I could spend an entire video
talking<00:02:30.230> about<00:02:30.379> how<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.709> attack<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.220> shoulder

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519

roll but I'm gonna show you a couple
Clips<00:02:32.989> where<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.200> think<00:02:33.260> Canelo<00:02:33.680> did<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.010> right

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
Clips where I think Canelo did the right

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.009 
Clips where I think Canelo did the right
thing<00:02:34.430> just<00:02:34.790> not<00:02:34.970> enough<00:02:35.269> of<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.510> threat<00:02:35.750> but

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
thing just not enough of the threat but

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.530 
thing just not enough of the threat but
essentially<00:02:36.980> he's<00:02:37.159> using<00:02:37.549> his<00:02:37.760> power<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.420> go

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
essentially he's using his power to go

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.839 
essentially he's using his power to go
low<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.989> go<00:02:39.349> high<00:02:39.379> on<00:02:39.769> may<00:02:40.010> with<00:02:45.730> all<00:02:46.730> right

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
low and go high on may with all right

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:47.740 
low and go high on may with all right

plain and simple he did intelligent

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.580 
plain and simple he did intelligent
boxing<00:02:49.640> throughout<00:02:49.849> the<00:02:49.970> entire<00:02:50.299> fight<00:02:50.590> he's

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
boxing throughout the entire fight he's

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.890 
boxing throughout the entire fight he's
sticking<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.250> moving<00:02:52.280> he's<00:02:53.209> getting<00:02:53.660> in<00:02:53.750> he's

sticking and moving he's getting in he's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.110 
sticking and moving he's getting in he's

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
getting out of there he's jabbing he's

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.660 
getting out of there he's jabbing he's
moving<00:02:56.480> around<00:02:56.569> on<00:02:56.870> his<00:02:56.989> food<00:02:57.260> he's<00:02:58.129> doing<00:02:58.519> his

moving around on his food he's doing his
thing

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
thing

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.759 
thing
the<00:02:59.359> problem<00:02:59.720> was<00:02:59.810> Canelo<00:03:00.140> tried<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.530> do<00:03:00.650> it

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
the problem was Canelo tried to do it

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.979 
the problem was Canelo tried to do it
back<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.700> he<00:03:01.790> just<00:03:01.819> can't<00:03:02.239> beat<00:03:02.569> Mayweather

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
back and he just can't beat Mayweather

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:03.970 
back and he just can't beat Mayweather
at<00:03:03.170> his<00:03:03.260> own<00:03:03.409> game

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
at his own game

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:14.780 
at his own game
he's<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.790> best<00:03:05.030> boxer<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.629> the<00:03:05.659> world

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.089 

now<00:03:15.780> another<00:03:15.989> reason<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.439> think<00:03:16.500> Mayweather<00:03:16.950> is

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
now another reason I think Mayweather is

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.440 
now another reason I think Mayweather is
able<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.400> win<00:03:17.549> this<00:03:17.670> fight<00:03:17.879> was<00:03:18.060> because<00:03:18.330> of

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
able to win this fight was because of

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.240 
able to win this fight was because of
his<00:03:18.540> excellent<00:03:18.810> counter<00:03:19.200> punching<00:03:19.560> you're

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
his excellent counter punching you're

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.649 
his excellent counter punching you're
gonna<00:03:20.340> see<00:03:20.579> an<00:03:20.670> awesome<00:03:20.790> counter<00:03:21.329> left<00:03:21.510> hook

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.819 

there<00:03:24.659> might<00:03:24.810> not<00:03:24.930> be<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.079> lot<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.379> power<00:03:25.590> on

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
there might not be a lot of power on

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.149 
there might not be a lot of power on
this<00:03:26.900> but<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.019> counts<00:03:28.319> as<00:03:28.409> a<00:03:28.500> punch<00:03:28.739> landed

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
this but it counts as a punch landed

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.199

Mayweather<00:03:30.510> does<00:03:30.720> he<00:03:30.870> does<00:03:31.019> this<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.290> lot<00:03:31.319> he

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
Mayweather does he does this a lot he

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.470 
Mayweather does he does this a lot he
leans<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.159> and<00:03:32.190> puts<00:03:32.400> his<00:03:32.519> hands<00:03:32.700> up<00:03:32.849> high<00:03:33.000> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
leans in and puts his hands up high the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.850 
leans in and puts his hands up high the
reason<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.900> because<00:03:34.019> he's<00:03:34.319> creating<00:03:34.769> an

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
reason is because he's creating an

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.170 
reason is because he's creating an
illusion<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.220> he's<00:03:35.400> closer<00:03:35.640> than<00:03:35.849> he<00:03:35.940> really

illusion that he's closer than he really

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.649 
illusion that he's closer than he really
is<00:03:36.239> then<00:03:36.720> he<00:03:36.810> leans<00:03:37.019> back<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.379> first<00:03:37.530> counter

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
is then he leans back and first counter

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.699 
is then he leans back and first counter
when<00:03:39.659> he<00:03:39.750> does<00:03:39.930> this<00:03:40.110> he's<00:03:40.319> looking<00:03:40.620> at

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
when he does this he's looking at

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:47.300 
when he does this he's looking at
counter<00:03:41.209> here's<00:03:42.209> another<00:03:42.450> example<00:03:42.629> of<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:46.310> now
