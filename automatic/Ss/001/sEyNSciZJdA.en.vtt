between 50 Cal and shock let me go over

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.120 
between 50 Cal and shock let me go over
the<00:00:06.839> map<00:00:07.109> positions<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.799> map<00:00:07.980> itself

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
the map positions and the map itself

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.040 
the map positions and the map itself
because<00:00:08.490> it's<00:00:08.610> kind<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.820> crazy<00:00:09.030> really<00:00:09.719> fast

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
because it's kind of crazy really fast

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.240 
because it's kind of crazy really fast
here<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:10.380> we<00:00:10.440> have<00:00:10.559> blades<00:00:10.860> start<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.160> the

the<00:00:21.630> upper<00:00:21.840> right<00:00:21.960> corner<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:22.949> go<00:00:23.550> me<00:00:23.699> as

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the upper right corner we have go me as

the upper right corner we have go me as
the<00:00:24.600> white<00:00:24.869> Protoss<00:00:25.439> let<00:00:25.859> me<00:00:25.949> reveal<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.400> map

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the white Protoss let me reveal the map

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.490 
the white Protoss let me reveal the map
because<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.150> think<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.140> chariots<00:00:28.439> of

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
because this I think this is chariots of

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.650 
because this I think this is chariots of
fire<00:00:29.000> but<00:00:30.000> basically<00:00:30.179> going

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
fire but basically going

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.280 
fire but basically going
counterclockwise<00:00:31.340> you<00:00:32.340> run<00:00:32.550> into<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.420> wall<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
counterclockwise you run into a wall to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.580 
counterclockwise you run into a wall to
whatever<00:00:35.010> opponent<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:36.000> your<00:00:36.930> left<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
whatever opponent is to your left I

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.170 
whatever opponent is to your left I
guess<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> good<00:00:38.129> way<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.399> saying<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.120> you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
guess is a good way of saying it so you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.360 
guess is a good way of saying it so you
I'll<00:00:39.930> kind<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.260> give<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> description<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.280> you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
I'll kind of give a description as you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.069 
I'll kind of give a description as you
can<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:42.000> going<00:00:42.300> across<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.750> here's<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
can see is going across so here's the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.619 
can see is going across so here's the
mineral<00:00:43.350> wall<00:00:43.500> separating<00:00:44.399> go<00:00:44.700> me<00:00:44.879> from<00:00:45.360> blade

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
mineral wall separating go me from blade

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.779 
mineral wall separating go me from blade
the<00:00:46.289> blade<00:00:46.320> has<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> mineral<00:00:47.129> wall<00:00:47.280> separating

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the blade has a mineral wall separating

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.290 
the blade has a mineral wall separating
him<00:00:48.270> from<00:00:49.129> from<00:00:50.129> mu<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.579> then<00:00:50.670> mu<00:00:50.820> has<00:00:51.030> emitter

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
him from from mu and then mu has emitter

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.720 
him from from mu and then mu has emitter
wall<00:00:51.510> separating<00:00:51.960> him<00:00:52.320> from<00:00:52.399> sick<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.640> then

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
wall separating him from sick and then

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.220 
wall separating him from sick and then
of<00:00:53.820> course<00:00:53.850> sick<00:00:54.210> has<00:00:54.360> inner<00:00:54.629> wall<00:00:54.809> separating

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
of course sick has inner wall separating

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
of course sick has inner wall separating
across<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> board<00:00:56.160> there<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:56.850> uh

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
across the board there but uh

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.729 
across the board there but uh
interestingly<00:00:57.510> enough<00:00:57.899> feet<00:00:58.170> there's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> lot

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
interestingly enough feet there's a lot

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.619 
interestingly enough feet there's a lot
of<00:00:58.770> room<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.100> between<00:00:59.430> otherwise<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.539> can

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
of room in between otherwise as you can

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.229 
of room in between otherwise as you can
see<00:01:00.750> he<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.020> approach<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:02.039> example<00:01:02.430> sick<00:01:02.699> can

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
see he can approach for example sick can

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.270 
see he can approach for example sick can
go<00:01:03.449> all<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> way<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.930> moose<00:01:04.199> front<00:01:04.920> door<00:01:05.070> maybe

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
go all the way to moose front door maybe

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.429 
go all the way to moose front door maybe
mind<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.700> out<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> lot<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.689> area<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.320> in

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
mind this out but a lot of area here in

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.960 
mind this out but a lot of area here in
between<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.979> also<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> middle<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> map<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
between and also the middle of the map I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.310 
between and also the middle of the map I
think<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.390> very<00:01:09.600> key<00:01:09.810> because<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.200> can

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
think can be very key because if you can

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
think can be very key because if you can
get<00:01:10.409> units<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.520> deny<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.939> lot<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
get units up here you can deny a lot of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.520 
get units up here you can deny a lot of
the<00:01:12.390> secondaries<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:13.049> basically<00:01:13.320> have

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the secondaries they basically have

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.140 
the secondaries they basically have
access<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.010> all<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.369> secondaries<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> map

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
access to all the secondaries on the map

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.780 
access to all the secondaries on the map
so<00:01:15.659> oftentimes<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> fight<00:01:17.549> for

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
so oftentimes this can be a fight for

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.340 
so oftentimes this can be a fight for
mobility<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.900> cheese

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
mobility and that can be cheese

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.810 
mobility and that can be cheese
otherwise<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.920> fact<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> looks<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.580> speaking

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
otherwise in fact it looks like speaking

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.399 
otherwise in fact it looks like speaking
of<00:01:20.970> cheese<00:01:21.150> looks<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.900> he's<00:01:22.259> already

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
of cheese looks like he's already

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.749 
of cheese looks like he's already
managed<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> probe<00:01:23.189> outside<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.670> his

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
managed to get a probe outside of his

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.070 
managed to get a probe outside of his
base<00:01:23.939> looks<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.630> he's<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> do

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
base looks like he's going to do

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.480 
base looks like he's going to do
something<00:01:25.110> cheesy<00:01:25.680> here<00:01:25.979> maybe<00:01:26.189> he's<00:01:26.340> going

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
something cheesy here maybe he's going

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.249 
something cheesy here maybe he's going
to<00:01:26.549> set<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.880> forge<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.540> looks<00:01:28.020> more

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
to set up a forge here but it looks more

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.859 
to set up a forge here but it looks more

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
like he's going to go for a to gateway

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
rush here on blade blade isn't going to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.490 
rush here on blade blade isn't going to

be able to scattered out because his
overlords<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.340> across<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.610> section

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
overlords not going across that section

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.679 
overlords not going across that section
of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> map<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.990> we'll<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.470> what<00:01:37.530> he's<00:01:37.740> doing

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
of the map so we'll see what he's doing

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.969 
of the map so we'll see what he's doing
unfortunately<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> looks<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:40.049> he's<00:01:40.380> gone

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
unfortunately it looks like he's gone

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.550 
unfortunately it looks like he's gone
for<00:01:41.280> some<00:01:41.460> sort<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> 12<00:01:41.970> hatch<00:01:42.180> not<00:01:43.140> going<00:01:43.409> for

for some sort of 12 hatch not going for

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.990 
for some sort of 12 hatch not going for
a<00:01:43.590> 12<00:01:43.770> bully<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> 12<00:01:44.850> hatch

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
a 12 bully is going to go for a 12 hatch

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.580 
a 12 bully is going to go for a 12 hatch
and<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.420> absolutely<00:01:45.780> disastrous<00:01:46.110> here

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and this is absolutely disastrous here

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.190 
and this is absolutely disastrous here
for<00:01:46.740> blade<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.210> Sivas<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.840> circling

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
is going to come down or I'm sorry this

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.609 
is going to come down or I'm sorry this
drones<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> come<00:01:51.180> down<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.619> there's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
drones going to come down and there's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.310 
drones going to come down and there's
that<00:01:52.829> second<00:01:53.189> hatchery<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.899> as

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
that second hatchery right here and as

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.410 
that second hatchery right here and as
you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.560> those<00:01:55.860> gateways<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.729> gummies

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
you can see those gateways of gummies

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.969 
you can see those gateways of gummies
are<00:01:57.450> actually<00:01:57.990> closer<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.619> second

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
are actually closer to that second

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.789 
are actually closer to that second
hatchery<00:01:59.369> then<00:02:00.060> blades<00:02:00.509> initial<00:02:01.290> hatchery<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
hatchery then blades initial hatchery is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.050 
hatchery then blades initial hatchery is
so<00:02:01.979> he's<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> very<00:02:02.759> hard<00:02:02.939> time

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
so he's going to have a very hard time

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.179 
so he's going to have a very hard time
fighting<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.689> off<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.200> at<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> very<00:02:05.009> least

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
fighting this off is at the very least

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.499 
fighting this off is at the very least
going<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> lose<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.610> second<00:02:06.030> hatchery<00:02:06.360> we'll

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
going to lose that second hatchery we'll

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.059 
going to lose that second hatchery we'll
see<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.930> put<00:02:07.079> up<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.290> solid<00:02:07.710> defense

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
see if you can put up a solid defense

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.040 
see if you can put up a solid defense
otherwise<00:02:08.429> also<00:02:08.819> 12<00:02:09.360> hats<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.720> opposite

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
otherwise also 12 hats on the opposite

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.999 
otherwise also 12 hats on the opposite
side<00:02:10.259> from<00:02:10.289> mu<00:02:10.590> though

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
side from mu though

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.320 
side from mu though
putting<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> hatchery<00:02:11.670> close<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.030> his<00:02:12.150> base

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
putting the hatchery close to his base

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.170 
putting the hatchery close to his base
getting<00:02:12.900> down<00:02:13.019> that<00:02:13.200> spawning<00:02:13.470> pool<00:02:13.709> now

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
getting down that spawning pool now

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.240 
getting down that spawning pool now
looks<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.450> sick<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.500> kind<00:02:16.799> of<00:02:16.860> blocking<00:02:17.189> in

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
looks like a sick is kind of blocking in

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.920 
looks like a sick is kind of blocking in
front<00:02:17.489> door<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.849> little<00:02:18.060> bit<00:02:18.209> at<00:02:18.599> least<00:02:18.780> he

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
front door in a little bit at least he

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.149 
front door in a little bit at least he
wants<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.200> limit<00:02:19.379> troop<00:02:19.650> movement<00:02:20.010> through

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
wants to limit troop movement through

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.789 
wants to limit troop movement through
that<00:02:20.280> little<00:02:20.430> gap<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.409> yeah<00:02:22.590> things

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799

that little gap so and so yeah things
not<00:02:23.040> looking<00:02:23.310> good<00:02:23.459> 50<00:02:24.060> Cal<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.269> don't<00:02:24.540> think

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
not looking good 50 Cal I don't think

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.910 
not looking good 50 Cal I don't think
has<00:02:24.810> dropped<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.110> game<00:02:25.290> yet<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.530> kind<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.769> want

has dropped the game yet I kind of want
to<00:02:25.980> mention<00:02:26.129> that<00:02:26.310> shocks<00:02:27.000> has<00:02:27.840> been<00:02:28.049> it's<00:02:28.590> 20

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
to mention that shocks has been it's 20

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.649 
to mention that shocks has been it's 20
at<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.549> point<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.090> game<00:02:30.299> would<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.540> a

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
at this point so this game would be a

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.449 
at this point so this game would be a
victory<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.079> 50<00:02:31.319> Cal<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.590> take<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.829> down<00:02:31.860> but

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
victory of 50 Cal can take it down but

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.680 
victory of 50 Cal can take it down but
yeah<00:02:32.579> they<00:02:32.730> haven't<00:02:32.970> lost<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.239> single<00:02:33.360> game

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
yeah they haven't lost a single game

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.180 
yeah they haven't lost a single game
across<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.260> board<00:02:34.470> these<00:02:34.620> two<00:02:34.829> salts<00:02:35.069> going

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
across the board these two salts going

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.069 
across the board these two salts going
to<00:02:35.250> be<00:02:35.340> produced<00:02:35.670> momentarily<00:02:36.629> looks<00:02:36.959> like

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
to be produced momentarily looks like

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.149 
to be produced momentarily looks like
that<00:02:37.230> second<00:02:37.590> i'm<00:02:37.709> looking<00:02:37.950> for<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
that second i'm looking for the

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.890 
that second i'm looking for the
additional<00:02:38.400> pylon<00:02:38.940> actually<00:02:39.569> there's<00:02:39.750> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
additional pylon actually there's the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.699 
additional pylon actually there's the
additional<00:02:40.170> panel<00:02:40.409> in<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.530> base

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
additional panel in the base

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.069 
additional panel in the base
interestingly<00:02:41.189> enough<00:02:41.720> surprised<00:02:42.720> even<00:02:42.870> put

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
interestingly enough surprised even put

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.240 
interestingly enough surprised even put
it<00:02:43.170> down<00:02:43.290> with<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> two<00:02:43.709> gateways<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.069> mean

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250

he's all in otherwise might as well put
it<00:02:45.780> up<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.049> there<00:02:46.230> anyway<00:02:46.739> second<00:02:47.459> hatchery<00:02:47.730> is

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
it up in there anyway second hatchery is

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.430 
it up in there anyway second hatchery is
now<00:02:48.030> going<00:02:48.239> up<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.599> unfortunately<00:02:49.170> looks

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
now going up and unfortunately looks

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.199 
now going up and unfortunately looks
like<00:02:49.620> there's<00:02:49.799> a<00:02:49.859> spawning<00:02:50.159> pool<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.670> there's

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
like there's a spawning pool and there's

with it more zealots turning to stream
out<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.660> meantime<00:03:33.900> looks<00:03:34.079> like<00:03:34.169> a<00:03:34.199> zealot<00:03:34.500> has

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
out the meantime looks like a zealot has

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
managed to go into Moo's line so it

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.180 
managed to go into Moo's line so it
looks<00:03:36.780> like<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.139> going<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.859> be<00:03:37.919> kind<00:03:38.099> of

looks like it's going to be kind of

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.159 
looks like it's going to be kind of
whether<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.730> Zerg<00:03:38.940> can<00:03:39.150> survive<00:03:39.449> or<00:03:39.660> not<00:03:39.690> he's

whether the Zerg can survive or not he's

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.210 
whether the Zerg can survive or not he's
in<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.349> much<00:03:40.440> better<00:03:40.500> position<00:03:40.799> looks<00:03:41.099> like

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
in a much better position looks like

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.319 
in a much better position looks like
he's<00:03:41.340> going<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.549> fight<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:41.970> able<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.180> fight

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
he's going to fight be able to fight

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.599

easily<00:03:44.819> by<00:03:45.090> gathering<00:03:45.359> up<00:03:45.569> his<00:03:45.599> drones<00:03:46.049> and

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
easily by gathering up his drones and

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.189 
easily by gathering up his drones and
not<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.069> lot<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.329> zealot<00:03:48.329> dedication<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.019> that

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
not a lot of zealot dedication in that

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.170 
not a lot of zealot dedication in that
direction<00:03:49.500> he<00:03:49.709> set<00:03:49.889> up<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.069> third<00:03:50.250> hatchery<00:03:50.609> his

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
direction he set up a third hatchery his

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.059 
direction he set up a third hatchery his
secondary<00:03:51.540> as<00:03:51.690> well<00:03:51.840> as<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:51.989> can<00:03:52.079> see<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:53.010> in

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
secondary as well as you can see but in

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.979 
secondary as well as you can see but in
the<00:03:53.160> meantime<00:03:53.340> yeah<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:54.090> zealots<00:03:54.449> going

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
the meantime yeah the zealots going

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.390 
the meantime yeah the zealots going
after<00:03:55.169> that<00:03:55.290> spawning<00:03:55.590> pool<00:03:55.859> spawning<00:03:56.159> pool

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
after that spawning pool spawning pool

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.369 
after that spawning pool spawning pool
is<00:03:56.579> down<00:03:56.849> I<00:03:57.120> think<00:03:57.599> that's<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.900> for<00:03:57.930> blade<00:03:58.199> all

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
is down I think that's it for blade all

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.220 
is down I think that's it for blade all
you<00:03:58.500> can<00:03:58.650> really<00:03:58.739> do<00:03:58.980> now<00:03:59.159> is<00:03:59.400> produce<00:04:00.230> is

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
you can really do now is produce is

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.259 
you can really do now is produce is
produced<00:04:01.739> drones<00:04:02.159> and<00:04:02.430> drones<00:04:02.669> do<00:04:02.879> not<00:04:03.060> are

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
that spawning pool went down but

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:15.920 
that spawning pool went down but
otherwise<00:04:14.819> yeah<00:04:15.060> it's<00:04:15.209> just<00:04:15.359> trounce<00:04:15.629> on

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
otherwise yeah it's just trounce on

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.020 
otherwise yeah it's just trounce on
zealots<00:04:16.349> at<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:16.590> point<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:16.979> still<00:04:17.250> more

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
zealots at this point and still more

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.099 
zealots at this point and still more
results<00:04:18.389> being<00:04:18.570> produced<00:04:18.780> out<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.019> those

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
results being produced out of those

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.300 
results being produced out of those
gateways<00:04:19.349> and<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.680> looks<00:04:19.829> like<00:04:19.889> actually

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
gateways and it looks like actually

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.920 
gateways and it looks like actually
blade<00:04:20.549> being<00:04:20.820> clever<00:04:21.060> here<00:04:21.329> he's<00:04:21.690> going<00:04:21.870> to

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
blade being clever here he's going to

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.300 
blade being clever here he's going to
bring<00:04:22.049> all<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.289> his<00:04:22.409> drones<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:22.830> those<00:04:22.950> organs

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
bring all of his drones in those organs

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.350 
bring all of his drones in those organs
up<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.580> going<00:04:23.700> to<00:04:23.760> try<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:23.940> take<00:04:24.090> out<00:04:24.210> that

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
up and going to try to take out that

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.950 
up and going to try to take out that
pylon

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
pylon

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.210 
pylon
so<00:04:25.259> he's<00:04:25.380> not<00:04:25.500> going<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.710> be<00:04:25.770> facing<00:04:25.919> any

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
so he's not going to be facing any

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.529 
so he's not going to be facing any
additional<00:04:26.639> zealot<00:04:26.910> production<00:04:27.270> alongside

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
additional zealot production alongside

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.830 
additional zealot production alongside
in<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.560> back<00:04:28.740> ouch<00:04:29.180> that<00:04:30.180> still<00:04:30.569> though<00:04:30.690> he's

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
in the back ouch that still though he's

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.379 
in the back ouch that still though he's
facing<00:04:31.050> against<00:04:31.530> about<00:04:32.009> 50<00:04:32.729> otherwise<00:04:33.090> so<00:04:33.300> we

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
facing against about 50 otherwise so we

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.490 
facing against about 50 otherwise so we
will<00:04:33.569> be<00:04:33.660> able<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.810> get<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:34.020> pylon<00:04:34.259> down

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
will be able to get that pylon down

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.600 
will be able to get that pylon down
which<00:04:34.620> will<00:04:34.740> by<00:04:34.830> in<00:04:34.979> a<00:04:35.039> little<00:04:35.160> bit<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.370> time

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
which will by in a little bit of time

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.219 
which will by in a little bit of time
but<00:04:36.180> ultimately<00:04:36.569> I<00:04:36.660> don't<00:04:36.840> think<00:04:36.990> it's<00:04:37.080> going

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
but ultimately I don't think it's going

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.420 
but ultimately I don't think it's going
to<00:04:37.319> save<00:04:37.470> him<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:37.770> is<00:04:37.889> going<00:04:38.039> to<00:04:38.099> buy<00:04:38.220> time

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
to save him that is going to buy time

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.040 
to save him that is going to buy time
however<00:04:38.639> for<00:04:39.000> sick<00:04:39.240> sick<00:04:39.690> of<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.870> meantime

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
however for sick sick of the meantime

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.689 
however for sick sick of the meantime
getting<00:04:40.289> robotics<00:04:40.650> facility<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:41.190> a<00:04:41.220> Stargate

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
getting robotics facility in a Stargate

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.029 
getting robotics facility in a Stargate
down<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.690> as<00:04:43.289> you<00:04:43.410> can<00:04:43.500> see<00:04:43.530> that<00:04:43.620> Overlord

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
down and as you can see that Overlord

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.770 
down and as you can see that Overlord
actually<00:04:44.460> scouting<00:04:44.880> in<00:04:44.970> there<00:04:45.150> too<00:04:45.360> as<00:04:45.509> well

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
actually scouting in there too as well

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.150 
actually scouting in there too as well
so<00:04:46.050> that's<00:04:46.169> somewhat<00:04:46.530> helpful<00:04:46.650> hydrolysed

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
so that's somewhat helpful hydrolysed

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.320 
so that's somewhat helpful hydrolysed
and<00:04:47.310> those<00:04:47.430> whose<00:04:47.639> probably<00:04:47.910> end<00:04:48.000> up<00:04:48.030> losing

and those whose probably end up losing

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.490 
and those whose probably end up losing
it<00:04:48.449> doesn't<00:04:48.960> really<00:04:49.080> make<00:04:49.199> a<00:04:49.259> difference

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
it doesn't really make a difference

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.749 
it doesn't really make a difference

though at this point taking the layer

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.150 
though at this point taking the layer
because<00:04:51.419> well<00:04:51.630> third<00:04:51.840> hatchery<00:04:52.169> is<00:04:52.289> up<00:04:52.500> also

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
because well third hatchery is up also

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.790 
because well third hatchery is up also
some<00:04:53.400> zerglings<00:04:53.759> to<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.060> north<00:04:54.240> surprisingly

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
some zerglings to the north surprisingly

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.860 
some zerglings to the north surprisingly
and<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.949> looks<00:04:56.099> like<00:04:56.130> this<00:04:56.479> looks<00:04:57.479> like<00:04:57.660> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
and it looks like this looks like the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.390 
and it looks like this looks like the
the<00:04:58.169> mineral<00:04:58.620> wall<00:04:58.770> being<00:04:59.009> mined<00:04:59.190> out<00:04:59.370> a

the mineral wall being mined out a
little<00:04:59.580> bit<00:04:59.759> here<00:05:00.030> by<00:05:00.509> six<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.139> it<00:05:01.259> looks<00:05:01.410> like

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
little bit here by six so it looks like

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.719 
little bit here by six so it looks like

he's going to try to open up maybe he

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.610 
he's going to try to open up maybe he

you're into v2 it's really hard to take
two<00:06:04.289> opponents<00:06:04.500> down<00:06:04.740> so<00:06:05.219> coursera<00:06:05.639> being

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
two opponents down so coursera being

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.430
