00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
alright guys today we're going to talk

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.160 
alright guys today we're going to talk
about<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.580> pros<00:00:02.820> and<00:00:02.850> cons<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.689> having

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
about the pros and cons of having

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.909 
about the pros and cons of having
floating<00:00:04.830> plants<00:00:05.220> on<00:00:05.370> your<00:00:05.520> tank<00:00:06.649> if<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.799> get

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
floating plants on your tank if you get

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.150 
floating plants on your tank if you get
close<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.189> here<00:00:09.260> you<00:00:10.260> can<00:00:10.410> see<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.620> have<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> lot

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
close to here you can see I have a lot

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.890 
close to here you can see I have a lot
of<00:00:11.190> duck<00:00:11.490> weed<00:00:11.780> and<00:00:13.730> some<00:00:14.730> Amazon<00:00:15.210> frog<00:00:15.509> bit<00:00:15.780> as

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
of duck weed and some Amazon frog bit as

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.599 
of duck weed and some Amazon frog bit as
well<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:18.660> Amazon<00:00:19.260> Frog<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.010> larger<00:00:20.310> stuff

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
well the Amazon Frog is the larger stuff

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.019 
well the Amazon Frog is the larger stuff
here

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
here

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.230 
here
and<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.689> personally<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> lot<00:00:22.769> better

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
and I personally like that a lot better

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.310 
and I personally like that a lot better
just<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> think<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.960> looks<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.230> lot

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
just because I think it looks a lot

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.800 
just because I think it looks a lot
better<00:00:25.380> than<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.310> duck<00:00:26.580> weed<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.660> also

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
better than the duck weed and it also

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.630 
better than the duck weed and it also
seems<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.230> stay<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.590> place<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> little

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
seems to stay in place it's a little

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.780 
seems to stay in place it's a little
less<00:00:29.820> messy<00:00:31.219> that's<00:00:32.219> probably<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
less messy that's probably a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.750 
less messy that's probably a
disadvantage<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> floating<00:00:34.350> plants<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.579> they

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
disadvantage of floating plants so they

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.790 
disadvantage of floating plants so they
can<00:00:35.940> get<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.090> little<00:00:36.239> messy<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.110> like

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
can get a little messy if you have like

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.590 
can get a little messy if you have like
a<00:00:37.829> hang<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> back<00:00:38.430> filter<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
a hang on the back filter like this and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.209 
a hang on the back filter like this and
that's<00:00:40.500> why<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.040> little

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
that's why I have this little

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.060 
that's why I have this little
contraption<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.120> made<00:00:42.270> today<00:00:43.070> using

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
contraption I just made today using

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
contraption I just made today using
three<00:00:44.789> different<00:00:44.910> straws<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:47.030> made<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.510> keep

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
three different straws I made it to keep

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.110 
three different straws I made it to keep
out<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.930> duck<00:00:49.260> weed<00:00:49.550> from<00:00:50.550> getting<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
out the duck weed from getting in the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.150 
out the duck weed from getting in the
flow<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> filter<00:00:51.989> because<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.010> was

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
flow of the filter because it was

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
flow of the filter because it was
getting<00:00:53.550> knocked<00:00:53.730> down<00:00:54.000> by<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.390> filter<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
getting knocked down by the filter and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.400 
getting knocked down by the filter and
then<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:57.180> would<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.420> stuck<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
then it would get stuck in like the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.520 
then it would get stuck in like the
carpet<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> there'd<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.930> ton<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
carpet here so there'd be a ton of it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.450 
carpet here so there'd be a ton of it
packed<00:01:01.770> into<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.949> it<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.010> really

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
packed into this and it just really

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.080 
packed into this and it just really
wasn't<00:01:05.670> pleasing<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.640> made<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.850> little

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
wasn't pleasing so I made this little

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.980 
wasn't pleasing so I made this little
thing<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.670> I'll<00:01:11.670> probably<00:01:11.970> redo<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:12.960> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
thing and I'll probably redo this with a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.310 
thing and I'll probably redo this with a
clear<00:01:13.320> straw<00:01:14.299> ones<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.479> once<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.990> find<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
clear straw ones like once I find a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.230 
clear straw ones like once I find a
clear<00:01:16.530> straw<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.430> wanted<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> try<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
clear straw but I just wanted to try it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.620 
clear straw but I just wanted to try it
out<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.780> been<00:01:18.990> working<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.320> well<00:01:20.630> um

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
out and it's been working really well um

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.140 
out and it's been working really well um
other<00:01:22.140> than<00:01:22.290> being<00:01:22.530> messy<00:01:23.009> duck<00:01:23.729> weed<00:01:23.939> and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
other than being messy duck weed and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
other than being messy duck weed and
other<00:01:24.330> floating<00:01:24.750> plants<00:01:25.200> there's<00:01:26.040> really<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
other floating plants there's really a

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.899 
other floating plants there's really a
lot<00:01:26.820> more<00:01:27.030> benefits<00:01:27.509> than<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:27.930> are

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
lot more benefits than there are

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.980 
lot more benefits than there are
disadvantages<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.450> guess<00:01:31.700> another<00:01:32.990> benefit

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
disadvantages I guess another benefit

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.289 
disadvantages I guess another benefit
would<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.920> effective<00:01:35.490> blocks<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
would be that the effective blocks out a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.920 
would be that the effective blocks out a
lot<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.540> light<00:01:37.759> you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.880> see<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> fish<00:01:39.420> really

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
lot of light you can see the fish really

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.350 
lot of light you can see the fish really
like<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.829> fact<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.250> there's<00:01:41.759> subdued

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
like the fact that there's subdued

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.590 
like the fact that there's subdued
lighting<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.079> corner<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.619> tank<00:01:44.600> they

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
lighting in this corner of the tank they

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.120 
lighting in this corner of the tank they
seem<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:45.990> hanging<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:47.060> more<00:01:48.060> often

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
seem to be hanging out here more often

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.620 
seem to be hanging out here more often
compared<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> brighter<00:01:50.850> areas<00:01:51.299> over

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
compared to like the brighter areas over

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.749 
compared to like the brighter areas over
here<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:53.460> some<00:01:54.420> fish<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:55.189> almost<00:01:56.189> required

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
here so some fish really almost required

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.730 
here so some fish really almost required
floating<00:01:57.240> plants<00:01:57.689> and<00:02:00.290> also<00:02:01.290> they're<00:02:01.710> really

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
floating plants and also they're really

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.950 
floating plants and also they're really
good<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.490> absorbing<00:02:02.939> excess<00:02:03.390> nutrients<00:02:03.899> from

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
good for absorbing excess nutrients from

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.170 
good for absorbing excess nutrients from
the<00:02:04.110> water<00:02:04.290> column<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.729> problems

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the water column if you have problems

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.169 
the water column if you have problems
with<00:02:06.360> algae<00:02:06.810> from<00:02:07.160> either<00:02:08.160> excess<00:02:08.640> nutrients

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
with algae from either excess nutrients

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.130 
with algae from either excess nutrients
or<00:02:09.420> too<00:02:09.869> much<00:02:10.050> light<00:02:10.700> it's<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> achieve

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
or too much light it's going to achieve

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.510 
or too much light it's going to achieve
or<00:02:13.380> it's<00:02:13.500> going<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> help<00:02:13.830> with<00:02:14.040> both<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.430> those

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
or it's going to help with both of those

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.660 
or it's going to help with both of those
issues<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:16.710> also<00:02:16.860> looks<00:02:17.190> pretty<00:02:17.430> cool

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
issues and it also looks pretty cool

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.030 
issues and it also looks pretty cool
with<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.510> roots<00:02:18.720> hanging<00:02:19.620> down<00:02:19.770> from<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
with the roots hanging down from the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.610 
with the roots hanging down from the
surface<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:23.610> shrimp<00:02:23.880> seem<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.300> like

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
surface and the shrimp seem to like

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.810 
surface and the shrimp seem to like
crawling<00:02:25.620> on<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.950> duckweed<00:02:26.280> upside<00:02:26.670> down

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
crawling on the duckweed upside down

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.390 
crawling on the duckweed upside down
which<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.180> sort<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.660> cool<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.920> also<00:02:32.070> looks

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
which is sort of cool it also looks

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.530 
which is sort of cool it also looks
really<00:02:32.700> nice<00:02:33.090> if<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.540> an<00:02:33.630> open<00:02:33.840> top<00:02:34.110> tank

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
really nice if you have an open top tank

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.880 
really nice if you have an open top tank
it's<00:02:36.540> just<00:02:36.720> something<00:02:37.020> else<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.290> look<00:02:37.500> at<00:02:37.680> from

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
it's just something else to look at from

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.690 
it's just something else to look at from
above<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.870> gives<00:02:39.870> your<00:02:39.990> tank<00:02:40.260> another

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
above and gives your tank another

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.030 
above and gives your tank another
another<00:02:41.700> dimension<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.390> guess<00:02:42.980> but<00:02:43.980> I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
another dimension I guess but I

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.160 
another dimension I guess but I
definitely<00:02:44.700> recommend<00:02:44.970> having<00:02:45.270> floating

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
definitely recommend having floating

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.199 
definitely recommend having floating
plants<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:47.570> planet<00:02:48.570> tank<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:49.880> think<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.000> keeps

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
plants on planet tank I think it keeps

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.750 
plants on planet tank I think it keeps
everything<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.780> balance<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:52.500> lot<00:02:53.190> better<00:02:53.459> and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
everything in balance a lot better and

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.449 
everything in balance a lot better and
you're<00:02:54.600> less<00:02:54.780> likely<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.260> have<00:02:55.709> problems<00:02:56.010> with

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
you're less likely to have problems with

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.500 
you're less likely to have problems with
your<00:02:56.610> water<00:02:56.880> quality

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
your water quality

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.110 
your water quality
I<00:02:57.680> think<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.800> floating<00:02:59.160> plants<00:02:59.520> almost<00:02:59.940> like<00:03:00.090> a

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
I think of floating plants almost like a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.460 
I think of floating plants almost like a
safety<00:03:00.600> net<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:00.810> your<00:03:01.080> tank<00:03:01.760> but<00:03:03.230> it's<00:03:04.230> really

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
safety net for your tank but it's really

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.800 
safety net for your tank but it's really
going<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.860> prevent<00:03:05.160> from<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.790> lot<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.360> big

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
going to prevent from a lot of a big

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.970 
going to prevent from a lot of a big
problem<00:03:07.340> with<00:03:08.340> anything<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.900> it'll<00:03:10.830> probably

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
problem with anything and it'll probably

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.830 
problem with anything and it'll probably
let<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.489> go<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.970> little<00:03:12.090> longer<00:03:12.420> without<00:03:12.780> water

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
let you go a little longer without water

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.910 
let you go a little longer without water
changes<00:03:13.530> as<00:03:13.680> well

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.890 

now<00:03:16.920> another<00:03:17.430> disadvantage<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:18.299> floating

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
now another disadvantage of floating

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.660 
now another disadvantage of floating
plants<00:03:19.290> might<00:03:19.500> be<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> fact<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.489> it

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
plants might be that the fact that it

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.490 
plants might be that the fact that it
grows<00:03:20.910> they<00:03:21.239> grow<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:21.660> fast<00:03:21.690> they<00:03:22.230> spread

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
grows they grow so fast they spread

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.970 
grows they grow so fast they spread
quickly<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:24.180> lot<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.230> these<00:03:25.320> plants<00:03:25.620> are

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
quickly a lot of these plants are

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.729 
quickly a lot of these plants are
considered<00:03:26.430> invasive<00:03:26.700> species<00:03:27.739> so

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
considered invasive species so

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.949 
considered invasive species so
definitely<00:03:29.130> dispose<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.060> them<00:03:30.360> properly

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
definitely dispose of them properly

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.740 
definitely dispose of them properly
don't<00:03:31.890> just<00:03:32.100> stump<00:03:32.370> them<00:03:32.519> in<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.670> local<00:03:33.209> pond<00:03:33.480> or

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
don't just stump them in a local pond or

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.610 
don't just stump them in a local pond or
something<00:03:34.140> but<00:03:34.680> uh<00:03:35.959> you're<00:03:36.959> probably<00:03:37.230> going

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
something but uh you're probably going

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.009 
something but uh you're probably going
to<00:03:37.680> have<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.890> be<00:03:38.100> taking<00:03:38.720> scoops<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.900> this

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
to have to be taking scoops of this

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.160 
to have to be taking scoops of this
stuff<00:03:40.260> out<00:03:40.489> after<00:03:41.489> you<00:03:42.450> know<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.600> month<00:03:42.870> or<00:03:43.019> two

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
stuff out after you know a month or two

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.460 
stuff out after you know a month or two
of<00:03:43.380> having<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:43.890> in<00:03:44.130> your<00:03:44.160> tank<00:03:44.489> and

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
of having this in your tank and

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.560 
of having this in your tank and
specifically<00:03:46.470> duckweed<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:48.150> really<00:03:48.390> hard

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
specifically duckweed it's really hard

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.030 
specifically duckweed it's really hard
to<00:03:48.660> get<00:03:48.780> rid<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:48.959> once<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.470> have<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.830> in<00:03:49.920> your

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
to get rid of once you have it in your

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.479 
to get rid of once you have it in your
tank<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.840> try<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.900> remove<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.350> all<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.739> couple

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
tank I try to remove it all a couple

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.979 
tank I try to remove it all a couple
months<00:03:53.640> ago<00:03:53.850> just<00:03:54.239> because<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.600> was<00:03:54.690> eating<00:03:54.930> a

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
months ago just because it was eating a

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.850 
months ago just because it was eating a
little<00:03:55.140> messy<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:57.350> don't<00:03:58.350> know<00:03:58.500> for<00:03:58.709> some

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
little messy and I don't know for some

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.820 
little messy and I don't know for some
reason<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.190> just<00:03:59.370> wanted<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.700> get<00:03:59.820> rid<00:03:59.940> of<00:03:59.970> it

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
reason I just wanted to get rid of it

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.780 
reason I just wanted to get rid of it
but<00:04:01.830> now<00:04:01.950> I've<00:04:02.070> been<00:04:02.190> letting<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.610> grow<00:04:02.700> out

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
but now I've been letting it grow out

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.940 
but now I've been letting it grow out
again<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.900> really<00:04:04.170> I<00:04:04.290> didn't<00:04:04.530> even<00:04:04.650> have<00:04:04.769> to

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
again and I really I didn't even have to

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.650 
again and I really I didn't even have to
reintroduce<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.760> into<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.060> tank<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.480> just

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
reintroduce it into the tank it just

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.780 
reintroduce it into the tank it just
sort<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.930> started<00:04:07.709> up<00:04:07.830> again<00:04:08.070> on<00:04:08.220> its<00:04:08.370> own<00:04:08.519> I

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
sort of started up again on its own I

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.940 
sort of started up again on its own I
thought<00:04:09.239> I<00:04:09.299> had<00:04:09.510> removed<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.930> all<00:04:10.079> but<00:04:10.799> it's

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
thought I had removed it all but it's

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.640 
thought I had removed it all but it's
almost<00:04:11.100> impossible<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.820> get<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.030> all<00:04:12.150> out<00:04:12.650> frog

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
almost impossible to get it all out frog

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.750 
almost impossible to get it all out frog
bit<00:04:13.860> or<00:04:14.100> bigger<00:04:14.720> floating<00:04:15.720> plants<00:04:16.019> in<00:04:16.109> general

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
bit or bigger floating plants in general

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.700 
bit or bigger floating plants in general
would<00:04:17.760> be<00:04:17.940> much<00:04:18.120> easier<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.780> remove

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.820 

robbing<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.830> also<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.160> really<00:04:23.430> fast<00:04:23.639> grower<00:04:24.830> but

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
robbing is also a really fast grower but

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.779 
robbing is also a really fast grower but
not<00:04:26.009> as<00:04:26.130> much<00:04:26.340> as<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:27.060> duckweed<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:29.460> reason

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
not as much as the duckweed the reason

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.350 
not as much as the duckweed the reason
why<00:04:30.000> phony<00:04:30.360> plants<00:04:30.750> are<00:04:30.870> fast<00:04:31.169> growing<00:04:31.289> is

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
why phony plants are fast growing is

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.080 
why phony plants are fast growing is
they<00:04:33.360> have<00:04:33.599> access<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:35.280> co2<00:04:35.729> in<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
they have access to the co2 in the

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.559 
they have access to the co2 in the
atmosphere<00:04:37.340> which<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:39.150> they<00:04:39.270> have<00:04:39.389> like<00:04:39.509> no

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
atmosphere which so they have like no

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.120 
atmosphere which so they have like no
limiting<00:04:40.080> factors<00:04:40.560> they<00:04:40.740> have<00:04:40.860> all<00:04:41.009> the

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
limiting factors they have all the

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.520 
limiting factors they have all the
nutrients<00:04:41.550> they<00:04:41.699> need<00:04:41.729> in<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.180> water<00:04:42.530> they

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
nutrients they need in the water they

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.749 
nutrients they need in the water they
have<00:04:43.680> really<00:04:43.949> bright<00:04:44.130> light<00:04:44.190> because<00:04:44.639> they're

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
have really bright light because they're

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.600 
have really bright light because they're
really<00:04:44.970> close<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:45.479> your<00:04:45.630> light<00:04:45.900> source<00:04:46.139> and

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
really close to your light source and

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.059 
really close to your light source and
they<00:04:47.610> have<00:04:47.849> all<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.020> co2<00:04:49.229> they<00:04:49.650> need<00:04:49.830> in<00:04:49.979> the

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
they have all the co2 they need in the

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.610 
they have all the co2 they need in the
atmosphere<00:04:50.580> or<00:04:50.789> in<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.660> air<00:04:51.840> that<00:04:51.990> we<00:04:52.110> breathe

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
atmosphere or in the air that we breathe

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.450 
atmosphere or in the air that we breathe
so<00:04:54.169> yeah<00:04:55.169> they<00:04:55.320> have<00:04:55.470> all<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.220> three

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
so yeah they have all the the three

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.379 
so yeah they have all the the three
things<00:04:56.639> you<00:04:56.820> need<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.060> grow<00:04:57.419> plants<00:04:57.960> and

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
things you need to grow plants and

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.110 
things you need to grow plants and
that's<00:05:00.389> why<00:05:00.660> they're<00:05:00.870> really<00:05:01.080> nice<00:05:01.229> to<00:05:01.440> have

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
that's why they're really nice to have

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.960 
that's why they're really nice to have
