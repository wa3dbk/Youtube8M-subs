00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
the heat when the state goes inside a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.000 
the heat when the state goes inside a
thin<00:00:44.030> panel<00:00:44.390> cool<00:00:44.600> down<00:00:44.810> and<00:00:45.470> your<00:00:45.590> steak<00:00:45.830> will

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
thin panel cool down and your steak will

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.980 
thin panel cool down and your steak will
just<00:00:46.220> stick<00:00:46.370> to<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.640> bottom<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.540> you<00:00:47.660> can<00:00:47.810> see

we have a nice loose steak and we can

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.090 
we have a nice loose steak and we can
let<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:50.210> sit<00:00:50.420> for<00:00:50.450> a<00:00:50.600> minute<00:00:50.810> to<00:00:51.770> start<00:00:51.980> our

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
against the cutting board that drives

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:16.450 
against the cutting board that drives
the<00:01:12.409> stem<00:01:13.009> up<00:01:14.289> and<00:01:15.289> you<00:01:15.679> can<00:01:15.799> just<00:01:16.009> easily

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
the stem up and you can just easily

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.289 
the stem up and you can just easily
remove<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:18.200> florets<00:01:18.939> probably<00:01:19.939> about<00:01:20.030> two

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
remove the florets probably about two

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.319 
remove the florets probably about two
two<00:01:20.869> cups<00:01:21.109> of<00:01:21.259> cauliflower<00:01:21.469> florets<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.429> a

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
two cups of cauliflower florets and a

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.899 
two cups of cauliflower florets and a
cup<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:23.630> cream<00:01:23.890> plus<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:24.920> teaspoon<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.789> salt

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
cup of cream plus a teaspoon of salt

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.059 
cup of cream plus a teaspoon of salt
teaspoon<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.689> pepper<00:01:26.869> cooked<00:01:27.649> it<00:01:27.740> down<00:01:27.829> for

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
teaspoon of pepper cooked it down for

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.609 
teaspoon of pepper cooked it down for
about<00:01:28.159> 20<00:01:28.549> minutes<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.060> then<00:01:29.630> put<00:01:30.079> it<00:01:30.229> into<00:01:30.350> my

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
about 20 minutes and then put it into my

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.609 
about 20 minutes and then put it into my
blender<00:01:31.429> and<00:01:32.119> for<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:32.899> size<00:01:33.139> of<00:01:33.289> cauliflower

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
blender and for that size of cauliflower

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:34.899 
blender and for that size of cauliflower
I'm<00:01:33.829> guessing<00:01:34.130> it'll<00:01:34.249> take<00:01:34.399> two<00:01:34.609> to<00:01:34.729> three

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
I'm guessing it'll take two to three

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.889 
I'm guessing it'll take two to three
minutes<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:36.170> get<00:01:36.289> a<00:01:36.319> nice<00:01:36.909> texture<00:01:37.909> without<00:01:38.600> it

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
minutes to get a nice texture without it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:39.879 
minutes to get a nice texture without it
being<00:01:39.020> overcooked

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
being overcooked

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:42.550 
being overcooked
looks<00:01:40.310> like<00:01:40.460> our<00:01:40.609> cauliflower<00:01:40.969> about<00:01:41.509> done<00:01:41.780> so

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
looks like our cauliflower about done so

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.859 
looks like our cauliflower about done so
to<00:01:43.549> give<00:01:43.700> them<00:01:43.819> a<00:01:43.850> little<00:01:43.999> extra<00:01:44.149> flavor<00:01:44.479> and

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
to give them a little extra flavor and

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.449 
to give them a little extra flavor and
so<00:01:45.139> that<00:01:45.289> we<00:01:45.350> don't<00:01:45.499> waste<00:01:45.679> those<00:01:45.950> nice<00:01:46.159> pan

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
so that we don't waste those nice pan

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:48.399 
so that we don't waste those nice pan
juices<00:01:46.759> I'm<00:01:47.329> gonna<00:01:47.539> transfer<00:01:47.749> it<00:01:48.020> into<00:01:48.319> the

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
juices I'm gonna transfer it into the

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.870 
juices I'm gonna transfer it into the
pan<00:01:48.590> that's<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.859> roasting<00:01:49.219> filet

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
pan that's the roasting filet

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.520 
pan that's the roasting filet
