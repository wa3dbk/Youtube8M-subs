so<00:01:57.400> I<00:01:57.430> found<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:58.060> circuit<00:01:58.690> that<00:01:58.780> fit<00:01:59.050> in<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.290> old

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
so I found a circuit that fit in the old

so I found a circuit that fit in the old
zerk<00:02:01.510> drawer<00:02:03.510> so<00:02:04.510> wood<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:05.050> send<00:02:05.590> them<00:02:05.680> all

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.800 

you<00:02:09.850> don't<00:02:09.940> need<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.180> go<00:02:10.270> too<00:02:10.420> tight<00:02:10.600> with

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
you don't need to go too tight with

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.240 
you don't need to go too tight with
those<00:02:10.990> you<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:11.650> see<00:02:11.800> it's<00:02:11.920> actually<00:02:11.980> not

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
those you can see it's actually not

change so before the boy wrote it the
first<00:02:36.340> thing<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.519> do<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.790> close<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.239> valve

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
first thing I do is I close this valve

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.600 
first thing I do is I close this valve
and<00:02:38.440> they<00:02:39.160> take<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.459> cap<00:02:39.700> off<00:02:39.910> my<00:02:40.299> tea<00:02:40.360> here

and they take the cap off my tea here
you<00:02:42.610> can<00:02:42.730> see<00:02:42.910> all<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.090> coolant<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:43.599> there

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
you can see all the coolant in there

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.210 
you can see all the coolant in there
it's<00:02:45.370> not<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.549> whole<00:02:45.790> lot<00:02:46.000> push<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.049> out<00:02:47.230> there

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.500 

keep<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.730> holes<00:02:51.910> up<00:02:52.090> for<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:54.390> turn<00:02:55.390> on<00:02:55.450> the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
keep the holes up for the turn on the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.730 
keep the holes up for the turn on the
water<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.020> a<00:02:56.050> little<00:02:56.230> fire<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.440> up

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
water and a little fire it up

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.770 
water and a little fire it up
I<00:02:56.800> had<00:02:57.490> two<00:02:57.580> hoses<00:02:57.760> on<00:02:58.120> get<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.420> good<00:02:58.540> flow

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
I had two hoses on get a good flow

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.450 
I had two hoses on get a good flow
coming<00:02:59.020> out<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.200> bolts<00:02:59.380> exhaust<00:02:59.770> manifolds

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
coming out of bolts exhaust manifolds

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.610 
coming out of bolts exhaust manifolds
and<00:03:00.610> then<00:03:01.420> go<00:03:01.600> ahead<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.900> pump<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.410> curve

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
and then go ahead and pump the curve

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.960 
and then go ahead and pump the curve
those<00:03:02.860> times<00:03:03.190> didn't<00:03:03.550> get<00:03:03.640> this<00:03:03.730> thing<00:03:03.880> to

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
those times didn't get this thing to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:04:08.240 
those times didn't get this thing to
start<00:03:04.180> off<00:03:04.300> has<00:03:04.900> been<00:03:04.930> started<00:03:05.560> since<00:03:05.760> 2011

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.499 

it's<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.550> first<00:04:08.790> open<00:04:09.210> hearth

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.029 

so<00:04:16.509> that<00:04:16.660> fell<00:04:16.900> there<00:04:17.169> is<00:04:17.320> basically<00:04:17.680> plumbing

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
so that fell there is basically plumbing

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.629 
so that fell there is basically plumbing
to<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.239> back<00:04:19.389> of<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.660> pan<00:04:19.900> and

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
to the to the back of the pan and

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.409 
to the to the back of the pan and
temporarily<00:04:21.639> we<00:04:21.759> have<00:04:21.850> another<00:04:21.970> holes<00:04:22.240> going

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
temporarily we have another holes going

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.110 
temporarily we have another holes going
on<00:04:22.509> the<00:04:22.630> transom<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:23.729> we're<00:04:24.729> draining<00:04:24.880> out

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
on the transom and we're draining out

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.129 
on the transom and we're draining out
the<00:04:25.240> oil<00:04:26.070> every<00:04:27.070> screen<00:04:27.310> time<00:04:27.460> without<00:04:27.580> fail<00:04:27.880> I

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
the oil every screen time without fail I

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.540 
the oil every screen time without fail I
repack<00:04:29.139> my<00:04:29.350> bearings<00:04:29.770> cuz<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.250> don't<00:04:30.370> want<00:04:30.490> to

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
repack my bearings cuz I don't want to

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:49.520 
repack my bearings cuz I don't want to
be<00:04:30.610> that<00:04:30.759> guy<00:04:30.910> in<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.120> side<00:04:31.330> of<00:04:31.419> the<00:04:31.509> freeway

00:04:49.530 --> 00:05:02.970 

is<00:04:50.530> there<00:04:50.650> any<00:04:50.770> water<00:04:50.919> in<00:04:51.099> there

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.540 

and<00:05:03.070> inside<00:05:03.850> variant<00:05:04.240> seal<00:05:05.040> so<00:05:06.040> here<00:05:06.190> to<00:05:06.310> drive

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
and inside variant seal so here to drive

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.640 
and inside variant seal so here to drive
out<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.510> inner<00:05:07.660> bearing<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.380> seal

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
out the the inner bearing and the seal

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.920 
out the the inner bearing and the seal
I'm<00:05:08.860> just<00:05:09.040> using<00:05:09.220> a<00:05:09.460> bushing<00:05:10.090> driver<00:05:10.330> with

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
I'm just using a bushing driver with

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.260 
I'm just using a bushing driver with
tash<00:05:11.290> mounts<00:05:11.770> its<00:05:11.920> fits<00:05:12.610> on<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.850> inside<00:05:13.120> of

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
tash mounts its fits on the inside of

tash mounts its fits on the inside of
the<00:05:13.330> bearing

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.200 

and<00:05:28.139> there<00:05:28.530> we<00:05:28.620> have<00:05:28.770> it<00:05:28.979> so<00:05:29.520> let's<00:05:29.970> say<00:05:30.030> we<00:05:30.150> get

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
and there we have it so let's say we get

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.240 
and there we have it so let's say we get
out<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.449> bearing<00:05:30.780> and<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.740> seal<00:05:32.069> without

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
out the bearing and the seal without

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.059 
out the bearing and the seal without
damaging<00:05:32.880> them<00:05:33.319> go<00:05:34.319> ahead<00:05:34.470> and<00:05:34.560> repack<00:05:34.830> these

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
damaging them go ahead and repack these

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.820 
damaging them go ahead and repack these
and<00:05:35.400> get<00:05:36.060> back<00:05:36.210> together<00:05:36.360> so<00:05:36.750> I<00:05:37.289> went<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.620> all

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
and get back together so I went to all

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.850 
and get back together so I went to all
the<00:05:37.979> old<00:05:38.310> creats<00:05:38.639> inside<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.210> hall<00:05:39.650> went<00:05:40.650> off

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
the old creats inside the hall went off

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.540 
the old creats inside the hall went off
