00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.670
 hello to this goalie lesson 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.379
 craftsmanship 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.209
 you are well today I am a van song 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.270
 some simple rules regarding 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:22.110
 soccer goalie outfits 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.240
 I will touch on the topic of great football after all 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.100
 futsal 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.690
 First of all I would like to explain 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.430
 bro goalie gloves as this 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:37.079
 the most important piece of equipment goalkeeper 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.890
 means goalkeeper gloves but in this 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.380
 case gloves Mike Roesch brand must 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.250
 they must be tight 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:52.200
 fit hands and latex gloves 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:56.040
 must be qualitative means not enough 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.680
 important care for goalkeeper gloves 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.910
 after each game or each workout 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:08.430
 as this will extend your service 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.250
 glove further I explained about 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.860
 goalie gloves in big now in 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.580
 futsal means futsal 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.420
 preferably goalkeeper to stand without gloves 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.909
 because grip is not so important 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.340
 in mini-football catch the ball tightly 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.880
 but important in a very accurate label 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.460
 throw away pay into the game and therefore 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.270
 goalkeeper gloves can be in 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.210
 futsal unnecessarily but in futsal 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.840
 well suited adhesive tape which you 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.170
 wind up your fingers to avoid 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.400
 bruises and sprains mushroom mean by 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.040
 about gloves and he told everything 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.100
 Now looking for now I would like to tell 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.370
 about training equipment 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.130
 goalkeeper in big football 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:04.000
 mean every goalkeeper prefers 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.190
 operations equip to your liking and 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.460
 how is everybody different my 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.100
 Preferences I prefer 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.310
 thermo T-shirts with long sleeves to 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.850
 protect your hands from scratching if you 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.920
 especially train on synthetics and 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.550
 also leggings that will also protect 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.330
 your feet directly from scratching on 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.290
 synthetics many goalies also wear 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.200
 firms jersey because when you fall 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.770
 the main shirt lifts up 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.450
 Eterna Mike protects the whole body like this 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.370
 from scratches 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.519
 mean about equipment in 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.019
 futsal 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:53.700
 I personally prefer the long goalkeeper 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:57.819
 pants with special knee protection and 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.349
 if you prefer these shorts then 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.400
 you must wear 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:07.209
 kneecaps because because your 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.730
 knees will be injured now 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.250
 I wanted to tell you about the position but you 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.070
 know blitz 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.240
 but as for the goalkeeper is not very important 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.570
 so 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.490
 principle can win on your which 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.620
 you like more on external 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.610
 characteristics and of course 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.230
 for convenience, thank you for your attention with you 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.780
 Kondratyev was Dmitry 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.780
 and this lessons catch it well
