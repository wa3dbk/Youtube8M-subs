00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.250
 hello how about friends of android good at 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:13.969
 this video tutorial I will show you how 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:17.760
 have a very very much requested effect 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.680
 for many I was slow to find it 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.620
 but finally I found it 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.180
 for that they have to be the root user more 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.820
 I will tell you later what is the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.340
 effect since many had not asked for it 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.860
 and I had looked for it a lot for this 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.260
 we are going to need the foundry installer 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.920
 The first thing we are going to do is enter 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.790
 at least we have to have a version 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:48.520
 android 4.0 or higher we are going to go to 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.520
 state expo 7 once installed 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.480
 I stopped looking for it 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.109
 I like it 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.910
 once they are to the installer exposÃ© we go 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.910
 if we go to the description of download 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:10.620
 and we are going to look for the module that is called 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.620
 screen of animation 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.960
 I do not know if it was just updated today 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:30.260
 or yesterday but I'm looking for it 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.340
 download and I was checking I think it 's 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.049
 we updated well 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.090
 and I came across this we're going to give in 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.690
 download you as you know we are going to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.610
 install 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.610
 when we install with a normal plate 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.780
 and we go to the module section one 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.620
 once in direct-based modules 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.170
 activated that we are going to activate excuse 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.300
 we are going to activate let's go for the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.730
 phone and we will learn once 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.500
 on we went back to 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.510
 need to be exposed we go to the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.290
 selection of modules 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.180
 let's open the application and here we 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.670
 will come so what we should do is 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.220
 give a click and if they will not turn on 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.870
 good the animation that I come to bring 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:25.319
 what I told you is the crt effects for 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.870
 our is the 5x appeal it by trying 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.180
 this device I do not know if it works in 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.110
 another let's see in selecting the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.380
 animation and as we see it comes to make you 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.370
 vertical horizontal let's try it 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.370
 I only want 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.870
 good ya 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.459
 block and as they saw us this served us 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.830
 is for speed if we want that 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.640
 go faster slower and as they saw 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.850
 The slowest 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.060
 and I can I want it with the can block 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.319
 with the button 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.319
 of ignition 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.060
 and as you have already seen we have to know 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.840
 program also comes the effect 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.840
 this effect 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.739
 and other effects we have to but 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.620
 good 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.060
 this section is useful for the eyesight 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.060
 previous 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.130
 the only thing we are going to do is 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.850
 select the animation 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.620
 and a home button is all that 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.670
 we would have to do as they saw 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.330
 studies in the lock button 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.440
 Y 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.500
 and that would already be activated in the effect 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.050
 crt 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.600
