sequester cuts a little over one percent
of<00:01:06.100> government<00:01:06.550> spending<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:07.180> this<00:01:07.420> is<00:01:07.540> a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
of government spending and this is a

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.060 
of government spending and this is a
government<00:01:07.780> that's<00:01:08.080> grown<00:01:08.410> by<00:01:08.620> one<00:01:08.890> hundred

percent since 2000 and in fact if the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.510 
percent since 2000 and in fact if the
sequester<00:01:13.000> happens<00:01:13.780> in<00:01:14.200> 2013<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.220> federal

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
sequester happens in 2013 the federal

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.130 
sequester happens in 2013 the federal
government<00:01:15.940> will<00:01:16.090> still<00:01:16.330> spend<00:01:16.480> more<00:01:16.930> money

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
government will still spend more money

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.530 
government will still spend more money
than<00:01:17.590> it<00:01:17.740> did<00:01:17.830> in<00:01:17.890> 2012<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:19.030> here's<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.360> thing

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
than it did in 2012 so here's the thing

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.090 
than it did in 2012 so here's the thing
the<00:01:19.720> problem<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.200> they're<00:01:20.380> not<00:01:20.500> designed<00:01:20.890> very

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
the problem is they're not designed very

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.860 
the problem is they're not designed very
well<00:01:21.310> yeah<00:01:21.760> and<00:01:22.000> it's<00:01:22.090> true<00:01:22.510> that<00:01:22.660> there

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
well yeah and it's true that there

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.870 
well yeah and it's true that there
across<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.200> board<00:01:23.590> in<00:01:23.770> ways<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:23.980> could<00:01:24.730> be

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
across the board in ways that could be

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.840 
across the board in ways that could be
disruptive<00:01:25.450> so<00:01:26.040> Senator<00:01:27.040> Jim<00:01:27.220> Inhofe<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.700> I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
disruptive so Senator Jim Inhofe and I

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.820 
disruptive so Senator Jim Inhofe and I
have<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.060> bill<00:01:28.330> that<00:01:28.870> simply<00:01:29.320> say<00:01:29.500> we're<00:01:29.710> going

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
have a bill that simply say we're going

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.320 
have a bill that simply say we're going
to<00:01:29.890> do<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.160> cuts<00:01:30.400> but<00:01:30.730> we'll<00:01:31.030> let<00:01:31.180> the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
to do the cuts but we'll let the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.900 
to do the cuts but we'll let the
president<00:01:31.590> find<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.770> least<00:01:32.950> disruptive<00:01:33.490> ways

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
president find the least disruptive ways

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.030 
president find the least disruptive ways
the<00:01:34.210> most<00:01:34.330> sensible<00:01:34.750> ways<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.650> make<00:01:35.830> these

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
the most sensible ways to make these

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.920 
the most sensible ways to make these
cuts<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.730> can<00:01:36.820> go<00:01:36.940> after<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.450> waste<00:01:37.660> and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
cuts so you can go after the waste and

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.050 
cuts so you can go after the waste and
duplication<00:01:38.190> rather<00:01:39.190> than<00:01:39.430> laying<00:01:39.700> off<00:01:39.880> air

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
duplication rather than laying off air

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.510 
duplication rather than laying off air
traffic<00:01:40.450> controllers<00:01:40.930> so<00:01:41.560> I<00:01:41.830> think<00:01:42.310> there's<00:01:42.460> a

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
traffic controllers so I think there's a

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.830 
traffic controllers so I think there's a
more<00:01:42.670> sensible<00:01:43.000> way<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.240> do<00:01:43.450> it<00:01:43.570> and<00:01:43.660> that's

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
more sensible way to do it and that's

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.020 
more sensible way to do it and that's
what<00:01:43.900> we're<00:01:44.050> gonna<00:01:44.140> offer<00:01:44.410> so<00:01:44.860> but<00:01:45.010> tom<00:01:45.640> brokaw

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.880 
what we're gonna offer so but tom brokaw
jump<00:01:46.330> in<00:01:46.480> because<00:01:46.660> my<00:01:47.050> understanding<00:01:47.650> is<00:01:47.770> the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
jump in because my understanding is the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.560 
jump in because my understanding is the
President<00:01:48.310> does<00:01:48.460> have<00:01:48.520> some<00:01:48.940> cuts<00:01:49.180> on<00:01:49.360> the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
President does have some cuts on the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.230 
President does have some cuts on the
table<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:50.320> maybe<00:01:51.040> this<00:01:51.310> could<00:01:51.490> work<00:01:51.550> if<00:01:52.060> the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
table so maybe this could work if the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.420 
table so maybe this could work if the
Republicans<00:01:52.810> would<00:01:52.960> actually<00:01:53.410> be<00:01:53.920> okay<00:01:54.220> with

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
that senator let me take it to the next

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.630 
that senator let me take it to the next
level<00:01:56.170> what<00:01:56.560> would<00:01:56.680> happen<00:01:57.010> if<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.190> president

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
level what would happen if the president

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.280 
level what would happen if the president

there<00:04:00.180> would<00:04:00.989> allow<00:04:01.290> us<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.590> avoid<00:04:01.889> more

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
there would allow us to avoid more

difficult<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.239> painful<00:04:03.419> cuts<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.169> I<00:04:04.379> think<00:04:04.650> we

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
difficult and painful cuts so I think we

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.530 
difficult and painful cuts so I think we
just<00:04:04.950> do<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:05.489> in<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.790> more<00:04:05.910> sensible<00:04:06.299> fashion

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
just do this in a more sensible fashion

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.150 
just do this in a more sensible fashion
senator<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.230> White<00:04:07.379> House<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.739> guess<00:04:07.950> would

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
senator the White House I guess would

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.770 
senator the White House I guess would
tell<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.639> they<00:04:08.790> do<00:04:08.849> have<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.150> plan<00:04:09.510> on<00:04:09.750> the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
tell you that they do have a plan on the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.050 
tell you that they do have a plan on the
table<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.620> involves<00:04:11.310> closing<00:04:11.699> loopholes

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
table and it involves closing loopholes

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.729 
table and it involves closing loopholes
but<00:04:12.180> also<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:13.019> think<00:04:13.199> about<00:04:13.530> nine<00:04:13.709> hundred

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
but also I think about nine hundred

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.830 
but also I think about nine hundred

billion dollars in cuts chained CPI as
well<00:04:16.169> as<00:04:16.289> Medicare<00:04:16.769> why<00:04:17.340> not<00:04:17.519> just<00:04:17.729> take<00:04:17.880> that

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
well as Medicare why not just take that

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.849 
well as Medicare why not just take that
plan<00:04:18.359> since<00:04:18.690> there<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:18.989> well

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
plan since there is well

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
at the end of the year just eight weeks

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.450 
at the end of the year just eight weeks
ago<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.289> president<00:04:37.710> got<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.860> huge<00:04:38.099> tax

spending<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:43.229> think<00:04:43.740> we<00:04:43.830> need<00:04:43.949> a<00:04:44.009> little<00:04:44.099> less

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
spending I think we need a little less

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.580 
spending I think we need a little less
spending<00:04:44.699> and<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.509> we've<00:04:45.900> got<00:04:46.110> this<00:04:46.289> law<00:04:46.530> in

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
spending and so we've got this law in
