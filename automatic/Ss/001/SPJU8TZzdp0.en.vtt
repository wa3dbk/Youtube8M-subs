00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.160 
just the default iron sights and I do
notice<00:01:04.030> if<00:01:04.299> you<00:01:04.329> look<00:01:04.389> pretty<00:01:04.719> hard<00:01:04.959> they<00:01:05.109> do

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:09.989 
have an engraving at the end of the gun
and<00:01:07.539> it<00:01:08.289> is<00:01:08.439> longer<00:01:08.740> than<00:01:09.039> five<00:01:09.340> letters<00:01:09.789> I'm

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:09.999 
and it is longer than five letters I'm

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:11.190 
and it is longer than five letters I'm
not<00:01:10.149> sure<00:01:10.329> if<00:01:10.420> this<00:01:10.539> means<00:01:10.810> that<00:01:10.899> you'll<00:01:11.109> be

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
not sure if this means that you'll be

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.340 
not sure if this means that you'll be
able<00:01:11.289> to<00:01:11.409> engrave<00:01:12.149> sentences<00:01:13.149> on<00:01:13.389> your<00:01:13.779> gun<00:01:14.079> or

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
able to engrave sentences on your gun or

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.469 
able to engrave sentences on your gun or
whatnot<00:01:15.100> because<00:01:15.399> I<00:01:15.579> know<00:01:15.639> in<00:01:15.789> black<00:01:15.969> ops<00:01:16.179> you

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
whatnot because I know in black ops you

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.080 
whatnot because I know in black ops you
can<00:01:16.630> just<00:01:16.829> engrave<00:01:17.829> five<00:01:18.130> letters<00:01:18.609> onto<00:01:18.849> your

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
can just engrave five letters onto your

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.609 
can just engrave five letters onto your
gun<00:01:19.299> I<00:01:19.509> think<00:01:19.810> it'd<00:01:19.899> be<00:01:19.929> really<00:01:20.139> cool<00:01:20.380> if<00:01:20.439> you

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
gun I think it'd be really cool if you

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.279 
gun I think it'd be really cool if you
could<00:01:20.799> engrave<00:01:21.099> a<00:01:21.249> little<00:01:21.670> bit<00:01:21.819> longer<00:01:22.289> okay

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
could engrave a little bit longer okay

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.379 
could engrave a little bit longer okay
up<00:01:23.499> next<00:01:23.529> we<00:01:23.950> have<00:01:24.069> the<00:01:24.130> Remington<00:01:24.759> semi-auto

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:25.389 
up next we have the Remington semi-auto

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:28.139 
up next we have the Remington semi-auto
sniper<00:01:25.990> system<00:01:26.590> which<00:01:27.310> this<00:01:27.579> gun<00:01:27.789> here<00:01:28.029> is

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
sniper system which this gun here is

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.760 
sniper system which this gun here is
brand<00:01:28.509> new<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.749> the<00:01:29.049> series<00:01:29.259> I<00:01:29.469> don't<00:01:29.619> think

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
brand new to the series I don't think

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.379 
brand new to the series I don't think
it's<00:01:29.889> been<00:01:30.039> in<00:01:30.130> any<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.579> call<00:01:30.789> duty<00:01:31.029> games

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:31.389 
it's been in any of the call duty games

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:33.719 
it's been in any of the call duty games
before<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.799> looks<00:01:32.979> like<00:01:33.130> kind<00:01:33.310> of<00:01:33.399> similar<00:01:33.579> to

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
before it looks like kind of similar to

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.929 
before it looks like kind of similar to
an<00:01:33.880> m21<00:01:34.359> in<00:01:34.719> the<00:01:34.840> sense<00:01:35.139> that<00:01:35.259> it's<00:01:35.529> just<00:01:35.679> a

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
an m21 in the sense that it's just a

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.159 
an m21 in the sense that it's just a
semi-auto<00:01:36.939> I<00:01:37.090> think<00:01:37.419> people<00:01:37.689> will<00:01:37.840> kind<00:01:38.079> of

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:38.169 
semi-auto I think people will kind of

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:39.629 
semi-auto I think people will kind of
spam<00:01:38.439> it<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.679> little<00:01:38.829> bit<00:01:39.069> just<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.490> get

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
spam it a little bit just to get

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:42.989

new tube of silencer and a site so I

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.259 
new tube of silencer and a site so I
don't<00:04:12.410> know<00:04:12.500> possibly<00:04:12.739> three<00:04:13.519> three

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
but uh I don't know it could be cool I

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.469 
but uh I don't know it could be cool I
don't<00:04:19.280> know<00:04:19.340> we<00:04:20.000> will<00:04:20.239> see<00:04:22.060> okay<00:04:23.060> coming<00:04:23.330> up

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
don't know we will see okay coming up

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.839 
don't know we will see okay coming up
last<00:04:23.810> we<00:04:24.110> have<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.500> import<00:04:25.130> with<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.550> dual

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
last we have the import with the dual

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.230 
last we have the import with the dual
scope

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
scope

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.490 
scope
and<00:04:27.360> from<00:04:27.660> my<00:04:27.780> understanding<00:04:27.810> on<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.319> dual

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
and from my understanding on the dual

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.110 
and from my understanding on the dual
scope<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:28.889> think<00:04:29.099> it<00:04:29.220> basically<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:29.880> can

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
scope I think it basically you can

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.700 
scope I think it basically you can
change<00:04:30.419> from<00:04:30.599> one<00:04:30.690> scope<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.199> the<00:04:31.289> other<00:04:31.440> and

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
change from one scope to the other and

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.650 
change from one scope to the other and
one<00:04:32.069> is<00:04:32.250> just<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.639> red<00:04:32.970> dot<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.360> other<00:04:33.479> one

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
one is just a red dot and the other one

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.990 
one is just a red dot and the other one
has<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.870> little<00:04:34.199> bit<00:04:34.410> of<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.680> is<00:04:34.889> an<00:04:35.280> acog<00:04:35.729> with

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
has a little bit of a is an acog with

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.839 
has a little bit of a is an acog with
magnification<00:04:37.039> I'm<00:04:38.039> pretty<00:04:38.520> sure<00:04:38.669> that's

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
magnification I'm pretty sure that's

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.100 
magnification I'm pretty sure that's
what<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.240> I'm<00:04:39.509> not<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.750> hundred<00:04:39.900> percent

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
what it is I'm not a hundred percent

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.570 
what it is I'm not a hundred percent
