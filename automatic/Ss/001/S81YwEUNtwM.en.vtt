hey guys Bubba shooters here and today
I'm<00:00:02.190> doing<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.580> tutorial<00:00:02.610> on<00:00:03.179> how<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.300> make<00:00:03.449> an

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
I'm doing a tutorial on how to make an

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.329 
I'm doing a tutorial on how to make an
egg<00:00:03.870> spawn<00:00:04.380> I've<00:00:04.560> gone<00:00:04.740> ahead<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.040> called

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
egg spawn I've gone ahead and called

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.220 
egg spawn I've gone ahead and called
mine<00:00:05.520> exporter<00:00:06.150> 5000<00:00:06.690> because<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:06.930> name<00:00:07.080> is

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
mine exporter 5000 because that name is

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.680 
mine exporter 5000 because that name is
amazing<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:07.970> this<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.179> basically<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
amazing and this is basically the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.749 
amazing and this is basically the
outside<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.320> what<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.920> does<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.400> trapped

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
outside of it what it does is it trapped

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.079 
outside of it what it does is it trapped
chickens<00:00:12.300> inside<00:00:12.960> like<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:13.920> they<00:00:14.820> will<00:00:14.969> go

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
chickens inside like this they will go

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.029 
chickens inside like this they will go
ahead<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.630> float<00:00:16.080> around<00:00:16.260> with<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.710> signs

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
ahead and float around with the signs

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.010 
ahead and float around with the signs
stopping<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.609> water<00:00:17.760> from<00:00:17.940> coming<00:00:18.300> down<00:00:18.359> but

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
stopping the water from coming down but

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.660 
stopping the water from coming down but
not<00:00:19.140> allowing<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.619> chickens<00:00:20.010> themselves<00:00:20.520> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
not allowing the chickens themselves to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.519 
not allowing the chickens themselves to
come<00:00:20.789> down<00:00:21.000> because<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> water<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.140> water

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
come down because of the water the water

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.470 
come down because of the water the water
basic<00:00:22.949> keeps<00:00:23.130> them<00:00:23.279> up<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.580> they<00:00:23.730> they<00:00:24.330> pretty

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
basic keeps them up and they they pretty

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.420 
basic keeps them up and they they pretty
much<00:00:24.570> never<00:00:24.840> sink<00:00:25.199> through<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.769> they<00:00:26.279> when

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
much never sink through it and they when

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.980 
much never sink through it and they when
they're<00:00:26.550> laying<00:00:26.760> egg<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.180> won't<00:00:27.420> go<00:00:27.570> ahead<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
they're laying egg it won't go ahead and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.660 
they're laying egg it won't go ahead and
falls<00:00:28.320> through<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> water<00:00:28.920> falls<00:00:29.400> through

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
falls through the water falls through

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.859 
falls through the water falls through
the<00:00:29.760> sign<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.119> will<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.359> fall<00:00:30.510> onto<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the sign it will just fall onto the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.990 
the sign it will just fall onto the
floor<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.500> now<00:00:32.309> while<00:00:32.550> what<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.880> is

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
floor like this now while what you do is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.639 
floor like this now while what you do is
I'll<00:00:33.450> go<00:00:33.630> ahead<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.930> show<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.230> I'll<00:00:34.469> show<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649

I'll go ahead and show you I'll show you
how<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.800> make<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.309> second<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.540> go<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.780> on

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
how to make it in a second and go up on

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.660 
how to make it in a second and go up on
the<00:00:36.960> roof<00:00:37.140> here<00:00:38.899> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.020> basically<00:00:40.489> light<00:00:41.489> up

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the roof here you can basically light up

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.760 
the roof here you can basically light up
this<00:00:42.059> area<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:43.440> ahead<00:00:43.559> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
this area here and you go ahead and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.560 
this area here and you go ahead and
throw<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:44.219> eggs<00:00:44.430> down<00:00:44.700> into<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:45.270> if

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
throw your eggs down into there if

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.700 
throw your eggs down into there if
you're<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> pre-releases

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
you can go ahead and load them in here

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.619 
you can go ahead and load them in here
with<00:00:50.219> wheats<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> don't<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.270> any

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
with wheats but if you don't have any

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.479 
with wheats but if you don't have any
wheats<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.469> can't<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.370> go

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
wheats or you can't do that you can go

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.830 
wheats or you can't do that you can go
ahead<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.789> throw<00:00:53.969> eggs<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.539> until

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
ahead and throw eggs in here until

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.139 
ahead and throw eggs in here until
you're<00:00:54.930> lucky<00:00:55.170> enough<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.530> spawn<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.820> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you're lucky enough to spawn in here and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
you're lucky enough to spawn in here and
basically<00:00:57.510> once<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> tract<00:00:59.250> in

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
basically once the in here the tract in

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.740 
basically once the in here the tract in
here<00:00:59.550> now<00:00:59.670> they'll<00:00:59.820> be<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.969> there<00:01:00.180> forever<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
here now they'll be in there forever and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.850 
here now they'll be in there forever and
they<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:02.039> come<00:01:02.430> out<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.650> if<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.739> come

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
they will not come out so if you come

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.830 
they will not come out so if you come
down<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.549> signs<00:01:06.000> stop<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> water<00:01:06.540> from

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
down here the signs stop the water from

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.780 
down here the signs stop the water from
coming<00:01:06.930> down<00:01:07.350> I've<00:01:07.560> already<00:01:07.770> said<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
coming down I've already said and that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.250 
coming down I've already said and that
this<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.030> kind<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> area<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.170> go

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
this is kind of the area there you go

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.960 
this is kind of the area there you go
the<00:01:10.439> ones<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.770> dropped<00:01:11.430> an<00:01:11.580> egg<00:01:11.729> there

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the ones just dropped an egg there

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.030 
the ones just dropped an egg there
that's<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.750> very<00:01:12.930> slow<00:01:13.200> process<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:13.920> them

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
that's a very slow process to get them

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.830 
that's a very slow process to get them
but<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.280> does<00:01:14.490> speed<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.820> getting<00:01:15.119> eggs<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.450> lot

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
but it does speed up getting eggs a lot

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.719 
but it does speed up getting eggs a lot
so<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.409> cake<00:01:16.680> things<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.220> very

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so if you like cake things that's very

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.390 
so if you like cake things that's very
useful<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.450> how<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> build<00:01:19.439> very<00:01:19.860> simple<00:01:20.310> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
useful so how to build very simple you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.740 
useful so how to build very simple you
can<00:01:20.549> pretty<00:01:20.670> much<00:01:20.759> use<00:01:20.970> any<00:01:21.150> building<00:01:21.540> block

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
can pretty much use any building block

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.830 
can pretty much use any building block
you<00:01:21.990> did<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:23.549> I'll<00:01:23.970> go<00:01:24.210> ahead<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.600> build

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
you did you like I'll go ahead and build

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.819 
you did you like I'll go ahead and build
a<00:01:25.220> design<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.729> quickly

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
a design here quickly

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.460 
a design here quickly
what's<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:28.979> all<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.220> FPS<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.180> crazy

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
what's for all my FPS it's going crazy

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.569 
what's for all my FPS it's going crazy
you<00:01:31.470> don't<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.040> creative<00:01:32.369> mode<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
you don't have to be on creative mode to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
you don't have to be on creative mode to
do<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.090> again<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.570> haven't<00:01:34.229> said<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
do this but as again I haven't said that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.249 
do this but as again I haven't said that
yet<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> much<00:01:36.390> easier<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.049> build

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
yet but it is a much easier to build

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.620 
yet but it is a much easier to build
this<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.790> creative<00:01:38.790> mode<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.479> just

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
this on creative mode but you can just

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.359 
this on creative mode but you can just
go<00:01:39.840> ahead<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.079> build<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.470> now<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> can

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
go ahead and build at this now you can

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.670 
go ahead and build at this now you can
make<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.549> any<00:01:41.700> size<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.270> want<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:43.110> doesn't

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
make this any size you want it doesn't

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.990 
make this any size you want it doesn't
have<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> certain<00:01:44.490> size<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:44.939> just

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
have to be a certain size but I'm just

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.460 
have to be a certain size but I'm just
go<00:01:45.180> ahead<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.930> mine<00:01:46.430> that's<00:01:47.630> let's<00:01:48.630> say<00:01:48.720> 6

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
go ahead and do mine that's let's say 6

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:01.730 
go ahead and do mine that's let's say 6
by<00:01:49.710> 6<00:01:50.070> 2<00:01:51.170> 3<00:01:52.170> 4<00:01:52.799> 5<00:01:53.340> 6<00:01:53.880> 1<00:01:56.119> 2<00:01:57.119> 3<00:01:57.360> 4<00:01:57.840> 5<00:01:59.450> 6<00:02:00.450> now<00:02:01.079> this

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
by 6 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 now this

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.300 
by 6 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 now this
design<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.460> was<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:03.869> kind<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.350> copied

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
design for this was I'm kind of copied

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.859 
design for this was I'm kind of copied
you<00:02:05.460> could<00:02:05.610> say<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.939> someone<00:02:06.149> else<00:02:06.390> they<00:02:06.600> used

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
you could say of someone else they used

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.300 
you could say of someone else they used
they<00:02:07.020> had<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> design<00:02:07.469> very<00:02:07.770> similar<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.220> this

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
they had a design very similar to this

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
they had a design very similar to this
but<00:02:08.369> I've<00:02:08.550> tweaked<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> most

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
but I've tweaked it to be the most

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.440 
but I've tweaked it to be the most
effective<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.940> don't<00:02:12.300> know

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
effective and that that I don't know

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.670 
effective and that that I don't know
what<00:02:12.569> their<00:02:12.720> name<00:02:12.900> is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
what their name is

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.319 
what their name is

description where you can have credit so

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.020 
description where you can have credit so
now<00:02:21.930> once<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.709> have<00:02:22.769> your<00:02:22.950> basic<00:02:23.069> design<00:02:23.879> out

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
now once you have your basic design out

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.059 
now once you have your basic design out
this<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.390> how<00:02:24.510> big<00:02:24.689> it's<00:02:24.840> gonna<00:02:24.930> be<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.920> bigger

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
this is how big it's gonna be the bigger

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.369 
this is how big it's gonna be the bigger
it<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.610> doesn't<00:02:27.120> really<00:02:27.239> matter<00:02:27.450> because<00:02:27.930> it's

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
it is doesn't really matter because it's

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.380 
it is doesn't really matter because it's
my<00:02:28.500> chickens<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.069> really<00:02:29.250> matter<00:02:29.430> I'm<00:02:30.239> going

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
my chickens that really matter I'm going

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.830 
my chickens that really matter I'm going
to<00:02:30.450> go<00:02:30.510> ahead<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:30.780> do<00:02:30.840> your<00:02:30.989> roof<00:02:32.120> two<00:02:33.120> three

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
to go ahead and do your roof two three

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.550 
to go ahead and do your roof two three
four<00:02:34.879> how<00:02:35.879> high<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.150> should<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.569> it

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
four how high you should have it

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.030 
four how high you should have it
fours<00:02:38.280> good<00:02:38.489> actually<00:02:38.670> for<00:02:38.939> should<00:02:39.359> work<00:02:40.040> it

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
fours good actually for should work it

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.589 
fours good actually for should work it
was<00:02:41.189> add-on<00:02:41.519> if<00:02:41.640> we<00:02:41.760> don't<00:02:41.939> have<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.239> like<00:02:42.359> if

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
was add-on if we don't have it like if

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.699 
was add-on if we don't have it like if
this<00:02:42.810> isn't<00:02:43.019> big<00:02:43.260> enough

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
this isn't big enough

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.349 
this isn't big enough
who's<00:02:44.189> any<00:02:44.370> building<00:02:44.730> block<00:02:44.909> and<00:02:45.060> she<00:02:45.180> didn't

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
who's any building block and she didn't

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.330 
who's any building block and she didn't
cobblestone<00:02:45.810> because<00:02:46.139> that's<00:02:46.319> what<00:02:46.560> it's

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
cobblestone because that's what it's

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.449 
cobblestone because that's what it's
really<00:02:47.609> a<00:02:47.639> very<00:02:47.760> easy<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.829> block<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:50.010> get<00:02:50.159> in

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
really a very easy the block to get in

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.550 
really a very easy the block to get in
your<00:02:50.670> single<00:02:51.060> player<00:02:51.239> why<00:02:52.019> am<00:02:52.079> i<00:02:52.170> building<00:02:52.319> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
your single player why am i building the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.190 
your single player why am i building the
outside<00:02:52.889> I<00:02:52.920> don't<00:02:53.159> do<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.870> I'm<00:02:54.870> pretty<00:02:55.019> sure

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
outside I don't do that I'm pretty sure

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.020 
outside I don't do that I'm pretty sure
you<00:02:55.290> can<00:02:55.379> put<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> roof<00:02:55.799> on<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.129> top<00:02:56.159> but<00:02:56.670> um<00:02:56.849> I

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
you can put a roof on the top but um I

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.309 
you can put a roof on the top but um I
don't<00:02:57.090> do<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.420> because<00:02:57.659> I'm<00:02:57.720> not<00:02:57.750> sure<00:02:58.170> if<00:02:58.290> that

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
don't do it because I'm not sure if that

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.530 
don't do it because I'm not sure if that
stops<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.549> chickens<00:02:59.939> from<00:03:00.090> actually

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
stops the chickens from actually

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.809 
stops the chickens from actually
spawning<00:03:00.930> eggs<00:03:01.500> maybe<00:03:02.069> they<00:03:02.220> need<00:03:02.370> daylight

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
spawning eggs maybe they need daylight

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.460 
spawning eggs maybe they need daylight
things<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.359> I've<00:03:03.900> laid<00:03:04.170> out<00:03:04.319> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
things like that I've laid out the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.229 
things like that I've laid out the
torches<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.189> it's<00:03:05.549> fine<00:03:05.790> if<00:03:05.939> the<00:03:06.030> roofs

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
torches so it's fine if the roofs

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.629 
torches so it's fine if the roofs
covered<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:06.900> isn't<00:03:07.889> covered<00:03:08.129> up<00:03:08.250> doesn't

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
covered up isn't covered up doesn't

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.940 
covered up isn't covered up doesn't

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
going crazy I really apologize about

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.750 
going crazy I really apologize about
that<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:15.480> can<00:03:15.599> need<00:03:16.159> quite<00:03:17.159> a<00:03:17.189> bit<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.459> water

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
that you can need quite a bit of water

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.069 
that you can need quite a bit of water
to<00:03:17.879> do<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.209> actually<00:03:18.599> it's<00:03:18.720> quite<00:03:18.810> annoying

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
to do this actually it's quite annoying

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.500 
to do this actually it's quite annoying
that<00:03:19.379> I<00:03:19.410> get<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.680> do<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.849> it's<00:03:20.970> effective

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
that I get to do it but it's effective

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.050 
that I get to do it but it's effective
so<00:03:21.780> doesn't<00:03:22.379> really<00:03:22.650> matter<00:03:22.919> what<00:03:23.609> it<00:03:23.639> easy<00:03:23.910> to

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
so doesn't really matter what it easy to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.030 
so doesn't really matter what it easy to
get<00:03:24.150> anyway<00:03:24.419> you<00:03:24.480> can<00:03:24.569> just<00:03:24.599> make<00:03:25.040> infinity

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
get anyway you can just make infinity

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.009 
get anyway you can just make infinity
saucer<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.760> only<00:03:27.209> have<00:03:27.359> to<00:03:27.449> have<00:03:27.510> one<00:03:27.599> bucket

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
saucer you only have to have one bucket

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.589 
saucer you only have to have one bucket
do<00:03:28.230> this<00:03:28.349> anyway<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.970> does<00:03:30.180> not<00:03:30.299> matter

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
do this anyway so that does not matter

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.809 
do this anyway so that does not matter
but<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.470> eggs<00:03:31.859> are<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.129> main<00:03:32.280> hard<00:03:32.609> thing

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
but the the eggs are the main hard thing

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.490 
but the the eggs are the main hard thing
to<00:03:32.849> get<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.690> course<00:03:33.780> if<00:03:34.109> you're<00:03:34.230> too<00:03:34.319> freely

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
to get of course if you're too freely

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.379 
to get of course if you're too freely
she<00:03:34.739> can<00:03:34.919> lure<00:03:35.190> them<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:35.669> that's<00:03:35.849> I<00:03:36.209> don't

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
she can lure them in but that's I don't

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.149 
she can lure them in but that's I don't
really<00:03:36.599> do<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.169> found<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.859> bit<00:03:37.889> hard

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
really do that I found that a bit hard

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.939 
really do that I found that a bit hard
when<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.340> did<00:03:38.519> try<00:03:38.669> to<00:03:38.760> do<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.590> okay<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:40.650> now

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
when I did try to do that okay so now

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.399 
when I did try to do that okay so now
once<00:03:41.159> you<00:03:41.250> built<00:03:41.489> your<00:03:41.699> your<00:03:42.419> trap<00:03:42.810> place<00:03:43.229> you

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
once you built your your trap place you

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.949 
once you built your your trap place you
want<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.590> go<00:03:43.650> ahead<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.829> put<00:03:44.040> sign<00:03:44.540> all<00:03:45.540> across

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
want to go ahead and put sign all across

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.670 
want to go ahead and put sign all across
here<00:03:46.260> like<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.879> crap<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.659> then<00:03:49.500> you

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
want to basically place a sign on top of

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.250 
want to basically place a sign on top of
those<00:03:52.769> signs<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.519> make<00:03:53.699> it<00:03:53.940> how<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.269> have<00:03:54.629> its<00:03:54.959> in

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
the chicken spawn of 5000 over there go

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.899 
the chicken spawn of 5000 over there go
ahead<00:03:58.349> and<00:03:58.470> keep<00:03:58.620> placing<00:03:59.099> signs<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.579> here<00:03:59.760> do

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
ahead and keep placing signs on here do

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.569 
ahead and keep placing signs on here do
I<00:03:59.940> have<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.120> write<00:04:00.299> anything<00:04:00.449> on<00:04:00.690> them<00:04:01.579> now

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
I have to write anything on them now

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.670 
I have to write anything on them now
quite<00:04:02.849> a<00:04:02.879> lot<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.060> time<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.419> do<00:04:03.569> this<00:04:03.750> make<00:04:04.650> sure

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
quite a lot of time to do this make sure

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.589 
quite a lot of time to do this make sure
you<00:04:04.889> don't<00:04:04.979> place<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.430> on<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.669> row<00:04:06.180> above<00:04:06.419> or

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
you don't place it on the row above or

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.330 
you don't place it on the row above or
anything<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:06.870> has<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.349> just<00:04:07.470> be<00:04:07.650> on<00:04:07.859> this<00:04:08.069> row

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
anything that has to just be on this row

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.229 
anything that has to just be on this row
down<00:04:08.909> here<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:10.069> this<00:04:11.069> basically<00:04:11.489> allows<00:04:11.909> the

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
down here and this basically allows the

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.990 
down here and this basically allows the
water<00:04:12.389> not<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:13.139> come<00:04:13.349> through<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.069> the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
water not to come through and the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.550 
water not to come through and the
chickens<00:04:15.389> do<00:04:15.720> not<00:04:15.870> come<00:04:16.049> through<00:04:16.289> because<00:04:16.409> of

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
chickens do not come through because of

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.640 
chickens do not come through because of
the<00:04:16.680> water<00:04:16.919> they<00:04:17.849> hate<00:04:18.090> water<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.810> they<00:04:19.139> just

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
the water they hate water and they just

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.289 
the water they hate water and they just
basically<00:04:19.859> just<00:04:20.070> they<00:04:20.310> just<00:04:20.489> try<00:04:20.669> not<00:04:20.909> to<00:04:21.090> get

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
basically just they just try not to get

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.339 
basically just they just try not to get
in<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.449> water<00:04:21.570> all<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.900> time<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.229> they're

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
in the water all the time so they're

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.800 
in the water all the time so they're
just<00:04:22.409> constantly<00:04:22.950> flying<00:04:23.460> up<00:04:23.729> which<00:04:24.419> allows

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
just constantly flying up which allows

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.870 
just constantly flying up which allows
them<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.080> not<00:04:25.320> fall<00:04:25.590> through<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.889> water

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
them to not fall through the water

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.400 
them to not fall through the water
and<00:04:27.000> they<00:04:27.240> still<00:04:27.600> spawn<00:04:27.900> eggs<00:04:28.110> which<00:04:28.290> is

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
and they still spawn eggs which is

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.640 
and they still spawn eggs which is
awesome<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.400> now<00:04:29.550> what<00:04:29.850> you<00:04:30.000> build<00:04:30.210> this<00:04:30.650> you

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
awesome so now what you build this you

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.010 
awesome so now what you build this you
can<00:04:31.770> go<00:04:31.890> ahead<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.430> put<00:04:32.580> your<00:04:32.610> water<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.330> go

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
can go ahead and put your water so go

can go ahead and put your water so go
ahead<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.380> stop<00:04:34.710> putting<00:04:34.920> it<00:04:35.070> in<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.220> corners

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
ahead and stop putting it in the corners

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.960 
ahead and stop putting it in the corners
like<00:04:36.630> this<00:04:37.160> now<00:04:38.160> of<00:04:38.250> course<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.550> can<00:04:38.670> have<00:04:38.820> it

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
like this now of course you can have it

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.340 
like this now of course you can have it
sucking<00:04:39.390> through<00:04:39.510> like<00:04:39.780> this<00:04:39.870> but<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.140> like<00:04:40.170> to

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
have to use lots of buckets of water my

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.450 
have to use lots of buckets of water my
way<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.440> there<00:04:46.440> we<00:04:46.530> are<00:04:46.560> all<00:04:46.920> still<00:04:47.250> like<00:04:47.430> that

that's the next step done go ahead and

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.950 
that's the next step done go ahead and
light<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.070> up<00:04:50.310> like<00:04:51.180> this<00:04:51.390> as<00:04:51.540> many<00:04:51.720> torches

hard to do I found a bit hard but if
you're<00:05:14.040> on<00:05:14.100> a<00:05:14.190> an<00:05:14.640> edge<00:05:15.300> like<00:05:15.630> this<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.560> can

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
you're on a an edge like this you can

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.920 
you're on a an edge like this you can
make<00:05:16.860> just<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.520> small<00:05:17.640> ramp<00:05:18.030> of<00:05:18.210> an<00:05:18.300> opening

make just a small ramp of an opening
there<00:05:19.110> where<00:05:19.260> they<00:05:19.350> can<00:05:19.380> walk<00:05:19.680> in<00:05:19.920> but<00:05:20.850> so

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
there where they can walk in but so

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
de-spawn because now in the game at I'm

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.440 
de-spawn because now in the game at I'm
not<00:06:26.700> sure<00:06:26.820> if<00:06:26.910> it<00:06:26.970> works<00:06:27.150> at<00:06:27.270> one<00:06:27.330> point

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
not sure if it works at one point

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.180 
not sure if it works at one point
actually<00:06:27.720> but<00:06:28.440> in<00:06:28.560> the<00:06:28.680> one<00:06:28.830> point<00:06:29.070> nine

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
actually but in the one point nine

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.550 
actually but in the one point nine
definitely<00:06:29.880> mobs<00:06:30.420> do<00:06:30.600> not<00:06:30.750> de-spawn<00:06:31.260> so<00:06:31.470> they

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
definitely mobs do not de-spawn so they

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.220 
definitely mobs do not de-spawn so they
maybe<00:06:31.770> spawn<00:06:32.130> in<00:06:32.280> one<00:06:32.400> point<00:06:32.550> eight<00:06:32.750> but<00:06:33.750> there

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
maybe spawn in one point eight but there

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.570 
maybe spawn in one point eight but there
definitely<00:06:34.410> won't<00:06:34.770> spawn<00:06:35.010> in<00:06:35.250> one<00:06:35.370> point

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
definitely won't spawn in one point

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.790 
definitely won't spawn in one point
