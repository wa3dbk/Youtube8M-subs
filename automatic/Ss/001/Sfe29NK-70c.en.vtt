00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
think there's a lot more skill involved

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.440 
think there's a lot more skill involved
so<00:03:18.829> but<00:03:19.829> honestly<00:03:20.160> if<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.340> want<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.609> Mobe<00:03:20.970> stick

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
so but honestly if you want a Mobe stick

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.509 
so but honestly if you want a Mobe stick
to<00:03:21.690> something<00:03:22.500> like<00:03:22.709> domination<00:03:23.250> because<00:03:23.430> it

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
to something like domination because it

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.949 
to something like domination because it
gives<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> lot<00:03:23.910> longer<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.239> get<00:03:24.450> them<00:03:24.600> where

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
gives you a lot longer to get them where

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.129 
gives you a lot longer to get them where
is<00:03:25.079> this<00:03:25.230> as<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.739> say<00:03:25.889> time<00:03:26.190> runs<00:03:26.400> out<00:03:27.139> sometimes

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
is this as I say time runs out sometimes

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.750 
is this as I say time runs out sometimes

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
shit to start off with I think you need

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.440 
shit to start off with I think you need
damage<00:04:38.500> or<00:04:38.710> range<00:04:38.980> on<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.610> then<00:04:40.330> it

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
damage or range on it and then it

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.900 
damage or range on it and then it
obviously<00:04:40.690> picks<00:04:40.930> up<00:04:41.139> so<00:04:41.770> I<00:04:41.800> can't<00:04:42.280> be<00:04:42.430> asked

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
obviously picks up so I can't be asked

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.390 
obviously picks up so I can't be asked
because<00:04:43.570> you<00:04:43.810> unlock<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:44.350> sparse<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:44.830> then

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
because you unlock the sparse and then

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.820 
because you unlock the sparse and then
it<00:04:45.970> will<00:04:46.120> ruin<00:04:46.300> like<00:04:46.750> KD<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.290> stuff<00:04:47.470> I<00:04:47.560> want<00:04:47.740> to
