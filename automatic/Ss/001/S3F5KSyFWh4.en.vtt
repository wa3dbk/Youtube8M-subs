00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.039
 Hello dear subscribers and 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.199
 youtube viewers today I will add 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.259
 For the form but I will say right away I do not 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.800
 professional rinaldin do so 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:33.160
 my father taught me my grandfather and my family and so 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.039
 will i have exactly 45 liters here 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.550
 future wine original content 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:42.519
 sugar was about 100 grams per liter 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.920
 if interest I have four days 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.670
 violently played and most likely already withdrew 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.460
 now you need to add your sugar 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.339
 extra but separates the horn maxim 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.429
 can get a fortress of wine 12 13 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:00.969
 percent and again about the fortress 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:04.960
 but whether 45 percent alcohol per liter 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:07.869
 as I know two grams of sugar is 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.329
 one gram of alcohol that is possible 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.930
 calculate in this way how much we 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:15.060
 need in the total mass of sugar for 1 Victor 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.710
 Suslov 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.049
 comes out to get a wreath of fortress 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.460
 12 13 percent need us a gram 240 250 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.000
 sugar per liter 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.930
 wort given from the fact that there is a 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.619
 I already have 100 grams of sugar per liter 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.060
 art we take away from this 250 item 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.909
 comes out about 150 grams well plus or minus 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.399
 need to add per liter of finished wort 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.670
 for the most efficient fermentation on 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.119
 wild yeast total sugar 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.409
 should not exceed 10 15 percent 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.460
 accordingly with sugar and we will 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:01.780
 add in parts fractional first time i 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.810
 add 100 grams of sugar to 1 liter of wort 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.100
 it comes out to me 145 liters of it 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.690
 four and a half kilograms of sugar 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.530
 all proportions of course about because 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.990
 what to consider 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.510
 always different facts and how raw 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.450
 you have ripened like it is not ripe 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.140
 whatever year is fruitful barren 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.200
 warm not warm like this 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:32.790
 need to try what we get we 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:36.880
 We waited for such a Duma on impurities 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.770
 once hidden not only slightly sweet 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.300
 that is, sugar is not so much soap to be 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.870
 more because it happened in this water 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.410
 more sugar is added 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.350
 OK 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.780
 thoroughly at least 150 km per liter it 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.190
 already here just here well, respectively, 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.810
 Now I will be growing sugar 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.900
 grape juice 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.560
 how do i dilute sugar i take sugar 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.100
 in the pot where about not 3 6 7 of this 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.600
 fermenting juice is a little warmer 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.489
 gradually dissolves well give it not 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.810
 much good yes actually 40 maximum 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.720
 so here and then this whole juice which 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.660
 already with sugar, I pour into the general chat in 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.579
 total will be well here I am gradually 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:29.019
 pour in and stir constantly so 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:31.390
 there was a little bit like that 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:39.420
 more you fail well here adds 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.420
 about 2 on our syrup will be careful 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.090
 on well there what the breeze is alive and 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.659
 seething 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.659
 as an organism
