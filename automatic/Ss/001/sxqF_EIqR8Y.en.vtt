00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.830
 in matter of the clothing of the material 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.170
 sports we use are usually 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.550
 materials that now is actually like 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.450
 a little bit like playing football is 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.430
 It is a material that takes a lot of sweat 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.680
 you no longer have the classic shirt 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.320
 soaked shirt that looks like it weighs 5 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.940
 kilos more 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.710
 they are materials the truth that they have 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.110
 greatly improved in truth 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.150
 It is that not to play with the clothes 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.850
 professionals that you normally like 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.920
 but usually there are already some houses 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.030
 There are some husbands where in those who 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.260
 they sign you and well, you're different 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.500
 brands like you can already know 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.059
 as nike adidas et cetera there is no or no 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.070
 there is no style of clothing that is 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.470
 different or better than other in general 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.089
 they're all pretty good just makes 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.339
 lack that you feel more or less comfortable 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.140
 the three-quarters slippers of what 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.640
 same do not have to be our matÃ­as 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.219
 They are not the same as the shoes 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.590
 run that are usually a little bit more than 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.449
 the lightest these have to be 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.090
 apart from being not too heavy 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.970
 they have to carry some reinforcements on 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.300
 everything in the heel and that they are especially 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.300
 of 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.470
 of leather so that the foot fits you 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.270
 well well grabbed because this is a 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.220
 sport in which he is very aggressive you do 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.750
 many changes of rhythm the ankle suffers 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.850
 a lot and the shoe has to be 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.759
 hold your foot very well if outside 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.040
 fabric as before then what it does is 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.409
 the ankle dances too much and then 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.659
 you can see the kinks is very 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.950
 important to wear a strong shoe and 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.930
 very well tied 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.119
 in question of the sole are 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.610
 practically the only difference that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.200
 there is between the soles is that in the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.700
 google tracks or for example on grass 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.030
 They have some taquitos in which you 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.710
 lets you grab a little more in the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.659
 rest what is earth and fast usually 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.659
 be the ones who usually have the same drawing 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.340
