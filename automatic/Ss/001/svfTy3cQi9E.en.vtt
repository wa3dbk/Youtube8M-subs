00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
here's how that works it's not that I

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.719 
here's how that works it's not that I
want<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.079> spam<00:01:31.439> bullets<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.009> fat<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.460> many

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729

bullets<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.180> fast<00:01:33.420> as<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.860> with<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> mk14

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
bullets as fast as I can with the mk14

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.460 
bullets as fast as I can with the mk14
and<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.240> that's<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:36.990> i<00:01:37.020> use<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and really that's not what i use the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.200 
and really that's not what i use the
rapid<00:01:37.799> fire<00:01:37.979> attachment<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.640> reason<00:01:39.150> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
rapid fire attachment for the reason I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.640 
rapid fire attachment for the reason I
use<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.479> rapid<00:01:39.810> fire<00:01:39.960> attachment<00:01:40.439> with<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
use the rapid fire attachment with this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.109 
use the rapid fire attachment with this
gun<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.329> because<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.540> rev<00:01:42.899> limiter<00:01:43.439> stops<00:01:44.119> any

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
gun is because the rev limiter stops any

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.429 
gun is because the rev limiter stops any
two<00:01:45.689> bullets<00:01:46.259> from<00:01:47.240> firing<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.750> succession

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
two bullets from firing in succession

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.240 
two bullets from firing in succession
that<00:01:50.430> would<00:01:50.640> create<00:01:51.000> an<00:01:51.450> RPM<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.649> you

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that would create an RPM that it's you

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.569 
that would create an RPM that it's you
know<00:01:53.310> limited<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.420> let's<00:01:55.380> say<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.280> if
