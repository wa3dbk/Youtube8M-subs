00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
looked a lot like a doorframe to me but

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200 
looked a lot like a doorframe to me but
I<00:01:43.350> mean<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.650> found<00:01:43.920> many<00:01:44.280> others<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.880> smacked

them<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.630> nothing<00:01:45.750> happened<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.260> it<00:01:46.380> was

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
them and nothing happened but it was

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.160 
them and nothing happened but it was
just<00:01:46.620> like<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.250> right<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
just like this one right here and I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.580 
just like this one right here and I
smacked<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:51.360> slowly<00:01:51.870> vanished<00:01:52.230> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
smacked it and it slowly vanished it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.370 
smacked it and it slowly vanished it
wasn't<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.040> obvious<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:54.120> it<00:01:54.690> wasn't<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.200> souls

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
wasn't as obvious as it wasn't the souls

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.450 
wasn't as obvious as it wasn't the souls
games<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.680> didn't<00:01:55.830> make<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> really<00:01:56.160> loud

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
games I didn't make that really loud

games I didn't make that really loud
noise<00:01:56.760> it<00:01:57.000> did<00:01:57.120> make<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.300> tone<00:01:57.660> but<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> actually

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
noise it did make a tone but I actually

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.160 
noise it did make a tone but I actually
started<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.980> walk<00:01:59.280> away<00:01:59.490> as<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.090> saw<00:02:00.330> before<00:02:01.110> I
