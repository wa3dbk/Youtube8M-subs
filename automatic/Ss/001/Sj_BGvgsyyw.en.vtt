00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello to you all the rails and I 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.930
 today i would like to talk to you about 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.830
 the band boxes I mentioned 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.900
 There was a previously recorded video but here 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.820
 but if you already have a clue and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.670
 representations in general what it is I 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.029
 I think you should not watch this video 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.699
 boxes would be of two types this 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.300
 warmly holding them there thermos 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.510
 and one more one more one kind that is 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.759
 just ordinary plastic in general so 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.000
 say boxes also they come in 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.350
 various very different colors and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.640
 Forms in general, choose what your heart desires 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.980
 so let's start with the usual type here 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.200
 such that it is not a warm one that makes 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.059
 ordinary box it is divided into two 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.260
 compartment that is here it opens and 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.050
 pretty deep seems to me that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.510
 it is more suitable for soups 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.220
 something ipod for the Japanese is very 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.229
 love zashirut this japanese soup here 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.170
 it opens so much here 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.549
 small that is you can see that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.869
 I think this approach 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.330
 something for appetizers something so easy 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.340
 That's what it looks like, but I'm not taking advantage 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.710
 I gave her a release from the Japanese 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.130
 I donâ€™t use schools because I donâ€™t 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.130
 li 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.110
 i love eating hot food also i dont 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.930
 like her round shape is very difficult 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.360
 pick up her bag in which she would 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.909
 did not roll out of which 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.930
 nothing came out of it in general hooves 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.770
 I don't like her that much either. 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.890
 there is another she warmly holding 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.079
 but it is not quite a thermos it can be so 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.130
 say half ther for that is like 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.869
 see he without a cap 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.670
 like that and in spite of her 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.409
 You can say not very impressive view 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.149
 she's pretty good at holding 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.159
 the heat here so here opens here 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.470
 is shaping up in general 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.489
 food food and close everything and she 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.530
 holds about pretty good 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:18.349
 for 5 hours there will be a total hot lo 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.400
 really hot i was buying it 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:27.410
 Set to her was such a handbag color 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.220
 it is very convenient for her 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.910
 here are such 2 heat bumps too 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.420
 they are still shallow here 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.180
 put 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.440
 I climb usually salad if I have 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.129
 time and desire so let's say and also in 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.900
 Included were sticks that do not eat there 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.900
 portions of chopsticks 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:58.910
 pretty short show you 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.090
 ordinary sticks can see that they 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.370
 pretty short even though 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:11.660
 it is their principle that it is convenient to eat 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:14.299
 in Japanese it is also called 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.810
 days when I carry something with me 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:21.829
 that with chopsticks is impossible this too 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.910
 buckwheat, too, let's say the same 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.980
 Korea is Japanese and ask for hazel that is 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.510
 that with chopsticks is impossible i take with 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.220
 here is such a set 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.599
 I don't like him very much either 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.549
 gave the stage I use it here 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.079
 like that opens up and inside you see 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.530
 how would sprat 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:47.239
 sets of pigs spoons and fingers that is 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.940
 that's how it is going to be very simple 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.030
 the use question once collected and 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:00.620
 ready all use the plug is very convenient 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:02.510
 very comfortable all all the length I have with 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.710
 dinner is pretty simple i'm not 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.390
 I like something fancy dr. 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.670
 there is no time to decorate it 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.160
 something but the Japanese relate to this 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.870
 enough 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.550
 scrupulously they love it somehow 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.740
 embellish it need it should be 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.620
 necessarily beautiful appetizing that is 

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.800
 make you want to eat what you 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.380
 cooked they use all sorts of such 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.940
 different becoming me but this is nothing 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.670
 no because I don't care these 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.920
 I use these here so they usually 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:36.330
 say something like that japanese 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.270
 pickles that I do not like here is well 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.630
 the last time of course especially those who 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.980
 live alone they do not cook themselves they 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.390
 prefer to buy this one 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.850
 you save time 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:57.620
 Well, not konami waiting for her such are the cases 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.550
 that today, in principle, this is all 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.910
 if you have any questions 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:07.230
 please ask me as dunks 10 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.260
 I will answer them all thank you all 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.260
 until
