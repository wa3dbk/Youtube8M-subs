00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:18.410
 section after there is repeated 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:21.750
 basically the same no more than without him 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.140
 without the double do I'm going to touch the two 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.140
 parts 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:44.240

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:50.000
 starts like there is under we are starting 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.670
 same with the do network we no longer touch the me 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.460
 we go straight to the fa and here we see the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.460
 Sun to the 8th fret of the second 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:12.480
 we return to the sun the network 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:29.590
 as always our point of support 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:29.590
 it's re we repeat the same part 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.840
 now if we use the step mic 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.170
 we want to network 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.090
 the net 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.090
 or not 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.349
 gay 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.760
 then that last part what's up 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:19.109
 we repeat the same figure but in another 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:23.610
 rhythmic there we are doing the arpeggio 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:27.540
 of we want less in the fifth that is 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:32.280
 the same eighth fingers from where 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:37.740
 we started after we do the same but 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:40.260

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:47.190
