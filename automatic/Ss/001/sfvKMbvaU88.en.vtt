00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.440
 playing chess 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.559
 but not dark and cold night 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.220
 danielle drank coffee sitting in a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.460
 favorite armchair in the living room of your home your 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.480
 family slept and he pondered so many 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.899
 things that lost the notion of time 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.329
 it was three in the morning he took his cup 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:33.660
 empty dishwasher and opened the refrigerator 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.880
 to prepare a snack when 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.800
 He closed the door and saw a 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.780
 well-known figure 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.239
 but nothing appreciated 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.969
 Regarding the image, the 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.470
 dream in an instant and stared at him 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:53.420
 and he said in a faint voice 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.990
 well you know that I have come 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.620
 he nodded and said 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.559
 yes i know it's time 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.220
 the confused death asked his 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.670
 victim you will not cry 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.510
 all do they kneel and beg 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:17.480
 they swear they will be better pray for a 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.760
 opportunity you why not 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.080
 fearful still and with a knot in the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.720
 throat 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.810
 danielle replied 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.170
 what is your use to me, you will never give me one 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.020
 opportunity you just do your job 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.360
 true just with my work I can 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.940
 say goodbye to my family questioned or 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.370
 danielle with the slight hope of 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.100
 receive one if you said that I only do 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.880
 my work I do not decide the time nor the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.340
 place much less the details I'm sorry 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.680
 you do not have to apologize for a few people 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.540
 think about your family in life but at 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.930
 now get all ask the same 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.180
 I do not understand, said Nadine Angel with 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.790
 reproach tone I lost my father 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.130
 when I was 15 years old and my suffering 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.390
 it was big but my youngest daughter has only 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:15.410
 four years let me tell you that I love her 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.660
 you had four years to say zero 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.540
 you had many birthday parties and 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.670
 moments when you love him because only 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.700
 you thought of your daughter 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.340
 my oldest son would not believe my wife 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.370
 I do not think it interests her if I love her 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.980
 we have not distanced much but my 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.020
 girl there is no day that I enter the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.490
 door and is not there to receive me with 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.410
 a kiss stops talking it's getting late 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.170
 it's okay 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.290
 you know this moment makes a lot of people 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.620
 make your life awareness pity 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.410
 it's too late they both went out to 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.680
 patio a strange train waited in the 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.860
 street and they boarded it not everything is boring 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.840
 in death I can not tell you what 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.000
 It will happen on arrival but I propose that 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.220
 let's play chess to kill a time 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.760
 with a smile and a tear 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.460
 daryl said how funny I thought you had 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.070
 sense of humor 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.010
 the game started Daniel did not calm down 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.980
 although he started winning he got a 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.370
 end or a horse but it was obvious that 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.450
 I was not happy about death I ask 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.310
 what do you do in life, I mean, was 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.760
 a simple employee in a factory 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.580
 worker's footwear did not work in the 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.530
 administration and I suppose that you 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.310
 I was in charge of seeing if something was missing in 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.030
 product or money if it was partly like that 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.550
 I understand that you do not understand that because 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.490
 you having so many things to do 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.010
 they lock themselves in at work they forget 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.890
 feelings do not care about 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.860
 others become selfish and violent 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.730
 so that when I visit them I will show you 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.720
 tenderness humility when I arrive 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.720
 nothing they can do 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.239
 I do not know, instead I'm like a simple 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.030
 pawn doing what I have to do and nothing 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.720
 more while you own your 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.690
 own life capable of deciding what they will do 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.580
 with her and so if her worst decision 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.810
 it's wasting your life 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.650
 I thought you more cruel said Daniel nothing is 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.650
 it seems 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.649
 but silence reigned for a moment 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.929
 while Daniel put in check the 

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:45.809
 death tell me what you thought when you 

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:47.369
 I thought you were happy was to form a 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:51.810
 nice family to be part of the 

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:54.030
 society and you achieved it jokingly true 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.010
 you found me alone in my kitchen during 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.530
 early in the morning and I asked you to say goodbye to me 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.910
 daughter it 's obvious that I did not 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.740
 If I had shown more love to me 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.729
 family the farewell would not have been 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.889
 required 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.469
 already the tears had dried off 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.360
 Angel's trail and suddenly exclaimed 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:15.240
 gently checkmate 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.479
 the death smiled and said congratulations 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.910
 sigh Daniel answered is a pity that 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.240
 It did not help, I did not care about winning 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.180
 Anyway, I'm already here a simple 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.000
 Chess game does not take my mind away from me 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.680
 family of my children and my post the 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.419
 Tear sprouted again in the face 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.060
 Daniel who covered his face with 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.900
 both hands and as the sun dared the 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.569
 death exclaimed 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.190
 We arrived Daniel tried to calm down 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.039
 open his eyes he was back in his 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:47.990
 old armchair dried the tears were 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.990
 6 and 45 in the morning 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:56.280
 instead of screaming I'm alive as I would 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:58.730
 anyone else went out into the yard and said with 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.730
 soft voice 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.700
 and I finish back home between the 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.350
 her daughter 's room takes her arm 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.390
 if it was where his son slept he did 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.640
 tickling feet and said son 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:14.030

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.100
 when you woke up today 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.850
 walk where your children are and you have 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.850
 said the masters
