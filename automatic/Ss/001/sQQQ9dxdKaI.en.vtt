 combing my hair I divide the hair on 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.050
 2 parts 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.510
 no matter what my parting 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.120
 or what university prague 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.280
 Immediately one side of the rezinochku start with 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.710
 on the left side I will land so that the good will not 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.500
 bothers, too, divide by 2 and tie too 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.289
 We will now rezinochku twist 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.160
 hair as if spinning inside so 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.750
 so how do we do back hair 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.160
 1 very extreme strand and not too 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.449
 thick not reflex camera 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.040
 the same iron from the top down twist inward 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.369
 keep finishing up and pull down 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.170
 simultaneously twisting in advance with you 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.439
 warn you if you just started 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.689
 learn how to use vouchers like a 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.180
 I will tell you 1 time will be very convenient for you 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.090
 especially keep as was top down and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.860
 it turns out the hands will just hurt 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.259
 need to fill and hands so that they are accustomed 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.360
 twist and pull at the same time or 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.040
 keep the tip well in general you have everything 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.040
 get a pro takes the usual time 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.790
 before proceeding next 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.120
 the participation of the hall kira this part and I will give up 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.120
 backwards 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.450
 naprjagi fate of my other equipment 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.560
 because curls will spin outside 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.500
 so it is much easier to previous 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.720
 grab utjuzhkom strand turning throw 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.070
 spin back hold the tip so as not to 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.070
 example and pull down 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.050
 so let's grab the strand again 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.150
 I turn tossing back the tip and pull 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.160
 down and at the end a little bit hold that 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.160
 the tip is normally over 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.810
 the middle 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.050
 Well, so and completed the left side 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.760
 and of course don't forget hairspray i 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.590
 until my hair touches my teeth 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.510
 just tie a rezinochku on not only 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.960
 so as not to interfere when I was doing right 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.990
 parts now let's get down to the right 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.700
 parts of course started combing ideally 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.080
 also at 2 and starting from the back 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.210
 really saying twist right side 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.310
 my hair is much easier for me to twist 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.450
 maybe this is due to the fact that there is little hair 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.230
 or i right handed i don't know the technique principle 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.180
 the same 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.240
 and I remember when I just started to turn 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.610
 hair can everlasting hair tangled and 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.550
 not that the hair is out of the hand too 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.360
 got tangled so poor my iron 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.060
 my gesture was very old and maine 6 years 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.550
 he is turning the course and see he spun 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.090
 that I had to knit him so 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.700
 here I need to buy a new iron first 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.010
 I tried to turn for 23 years 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.780
 back and a year ago I learned one 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.600
 british blogger i don't remember which 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.120
 on add-ons found her video started so 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.790
 do not seem to start something like that 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.970
 easy to twist very easy i have this thing to us 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.190
 then won the iron on the magician my poor 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:43.100
 hands woes my fingers are the same 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.100
 time we became hands i keep kapets 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.729
 don't forget to jump off and lacquer 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.210
 paint and start back the same 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.210
 technique 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.610
 almost all almost all 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:52.139
 Well, the completion is once again sprinkled 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:55.110
 spray varnish and we seem all of course 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:58.800
 I let go of all the hair and try to describe 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.830
 them so there was a lush and slightly volume 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.419
 lift out from under the roots 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.380
 vodka is not heard very strangely shorter 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:10.650
