video test which was actually a little
bit<00:00:45.210> blurry<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.660> mean<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.080> definitely<00:00:46.200> had<00:00:46.710> her

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
bit blurry I mean it definitely had her

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
bit blurry I mean it definitely had her
to<00:00:47.070> make<00:00:47.220> a<00:00:47.250> pixels<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.480> want<00:00:48.630> to<00:00:48.690> make

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.760 
sure that the quality on I babies
version<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.940> still<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.270> same<00:00:51.300> alright<00:00:52.290> so<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
version is still the same alright so it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.710 
version is still the same alright so it
took<00:00:52.920> about<00:00:53.070> five<00:00:53.520> days<00:00:53.700> to<00:00:53.940> arrive<00:00:54.150> I<00:00:54.450> got<00:00:54.600> it

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
can see all the way around it looks just

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.529

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969 
here the Ainu v3 is almost the same

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:43.940 
here the Ainu v3 is almost the same
except<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.110> headphone<00:04:43.440> jacks<00:04:43.710> are

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
except that the headphone jacks are

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.860 
except that the headphone jacks are
actually<00:04:44.430> located<00:04:44.550> on<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.150> opposite<00:04:45.630> side

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
actually located on the opposite side

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.530 
actually located on the opposite side
but<00:04:46.169> there<00:04:46.289> are

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
but there are

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.570 
but there are
very<00:04:46.840> similar<00:04:47.200> as<00:04:47.410> you<00:04:47.590> can<00:04:47.740> see<00:04:47.980> body<00:04:48.280> wise

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
very similar as you can see body wise

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.750 
very similar as you can see body wise
they<00:04:49.390> look<00:04:49.570> almost<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.990> same<00:04:50.080> but<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:51.550> only

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
they look almost the same but the only

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.250 
they look almost the same but the only
things<00:04:51.940> that<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.240> dodgy<00:04:52.420> looks<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.870> little<00:04:53.050> bit

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
things that the dodgy looks a little bit

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.440 
things that the dodgy looks a little bit
thinner<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:54.370> think<00:04:54.610> it<00:04:54.760> is<00:04:54.910> but<00:04:55.120> it's<00:04:55.300> not

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
thinner and I think it is but it's not

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.350 
thinner and I think it is but it's not
by<00:04:55.630> much<00:04:55.840> okay<00:04:56.880> now<00:04:57.880> let's<00:04:57.910> go<00:04:58.120> ahead<00:04:58.270> and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
by much okay now let's go ahead and

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.510 
by much okay now let's go ahead and
check<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:59.020> see<00:04:59.200> if<00:04:59.440> it<00:04:59.620> has<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.950> battery<00:05:00.340> I

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
check and see if it has the battery I

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.550 
check and see if it has the battery I
think<00:05:00.850> it<00:05:00.970> does<00:05:01.150> because<00:05:01.180> I<00:05:01.750> can<00:05:02.230> already<00:05:02.380> feel

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
think it does because I can already feel

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.090 
think it does because I can already feel
that<00:05:03.010> it<00:05:03.640> is<00:05:03.670> kind<00:05:04.000> of<00:05:04.060> heavy<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:04.950> here<00:05:05.950> we<00:05:06.070> have

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
that it is kind of heavy so here we have

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.710 
that it is kind of heavy so here we have
the<00:05:06.400> battery<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:06.940> I<00:05:07.150> think<00:05:07.360> it's<00:05:07.480> going<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.630> be

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
the battery and I think it's going to be

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.410 
the battery and I think it's going to be
the<00:05:07.900> same<00:05:08.640> milliamps<00:05:09.640> let<00:05:09.850> me<00:05:09.940> see<00:05:10.120> it's<00:05:10.360> going

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
the same milliamps let me see it's going

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.180 
the same milliamps let me see it's going
to<00:05:10.510> be<00:05:10.630> seventeen<00:05:11.170> hundred<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:11.620> 50<00:05:11.920> milliamps

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
to be seventeen hundred and 50 milliamps

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.500 
to be seventeen hundred and 50 milliamps
so<00:05:12.520> let's<00:05:12.700> go<00:05:12.820> ahead<00:05:12.850> and<00:05:13.000> remove<00:05:13.180> this

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
so let's go ahead and remove this

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.070 
so let's go ahead and remove this
sticker<00:05:13.890> that<00:05:14.890> came<00:05:15.820> with<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.240> with<00:05:17.050> the

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
sticker that came with the with the

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.710 
sticker that came with the with the
battery<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:17.740> I<00:05:18.280> think<00:05:18.550> this<00:05:18.760> is<00:05:18.970> put<00:05:19.420> on<00:05:19.540> here

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
battery and I think this is put on here

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.950 
battery and I think this is put on here
guys<00:05:19.900> for<00:05:20.560> customs<00:05:21.340> I<00:05:21.580> think<00:05:21.820> there's<00:05:22.060> a<00:05:22.120> semi

carriers<00:05:23.560> out<00:05:23.770> there<00:05:24.040> that<00:05:24.370> don't<00:05:24.640> let<00:05:25.180> the

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
carriers out there that don't let the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.600 
carriers out there that don't let the
Chinese<00:05:26.260> ship<00:05:26.650> it<00:05:26.800> with<00:05:26.920> batteries<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:27.580> I

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
Chinese ship it with batteries so I

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.280 
Chinese ship it with batteries so I
think<00:05:27.790> that's<00:05:28.030> why<00:05:28.210> they<00:05:28.390> do<00:05:28.450> that<00:05:28.570> I<00:05:28.780> guess<00:05:29.140> is

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
think that's why they do that I guess is

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.550 
think that's why they do that I guess is
a<00:05:29.320> nice<00:05:30.070> little<00:05:30.310> trick<00:05:30.640> and<00:05:30.910> then<00:05:31.570> this<00:05:32.230> device

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
a nice little trick and then this device

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.860 
a nice little trick and then this device
is<00:05:32.740> also<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.190> dual<00:05:33.580> sim<00:05:33.850> dual<00:05:34.060> standby<00:05:34.090> so

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
is also the dual sim dual standby so

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.450 
is also the dual sim dual standby so
that's<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.140> same<00:05:35.320> as<00:05:35.350> the<00:05:35.590> previous<00:05:35.770> one<00:05:36.220> and

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
that's the same as the previous one and

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.630 
that's the same as the previous one and
then<00:05:37.060> also<00:05:37.450> supports<00:05:37.960> a<00:05:38.020> TF<00:05:38.560> cards<00:05:39.010> and<00:05:39.250> the

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
then also supports a TF cards and the

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.070 
then also supports a TF cards and the
build<00:05:39.820> quality<00:05:39.940> feels<00:05:40.390> just<00:05:40.630> like<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.960> other

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
build quality feels just like the other

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.250 
build quality feels just like the other
one<00:05:41.260> so<00:05:41.560> not<00:05:42.460> many<00:05:42.790> changes<00:05:43.330> here<00:05:43.660> so<00:05:43.990> let's<00:05:44.200> go

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
one so not many changes here so let's go

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:53.070
