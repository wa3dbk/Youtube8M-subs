00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello everyone with weight and today I want 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 show you how to use your 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.790
 simple gamepad which is not 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.469
 determined by the games in these same 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.990
 games for this we need 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.870
 xbox 360 emulator controller under 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.100
 name x360 cs you can download from 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.210
 my site will leave a link under the video and 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:27.330
 download before download it and open 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.990
 we see such a window x360 sit . and him 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.380
 foodfound 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.600
 and click yes it will create a new file and this 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.690
 also press childhood loading will create and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.329
 he is also very important 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.850
 we create everything so it opens 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.250
 new window over her device detector herbie 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.879
 gamepad is mine 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.890
 defender rs3 scorpion the most common 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.010
 gamepad which is no different from 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.670
 any other we need to use 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.489
 its like her xbox ovsky so we 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.260
 we downloaded this particular program now 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.600
 Click this one here this box 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.900
 let's imagine the internet here this one 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.909
 check box and next and wait for now 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.880
 here these two ticks will appear further 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.320
 finish and turn on your gamepad and try 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.470
 I have it wireless so now 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.490
 he will find mine 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.200
 this as a translator here he connected to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.700
 computer we all see what stacks 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.920
 work as it should that is when you click 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.890
 right it is pressed right when pressed 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.180
 left same left up down here also 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.900
 all the buttons that is all you need in the game 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.020
 everything is 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.119
 further tune the dead zone if necessary 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.100
 that is, here here is the f3 gilded zone 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.920
 have triggers here essentially no 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.869
 triggers so click zero percent 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.110
 here the left stick dead zone setting 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.290
 x is right-left y is up down 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.439
 also who then ford feedback that is 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.090
 vibration to which the gamepad in my driver 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.369
 I think it's not worth it now on my gamepad 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.930
 so no need to vibration 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.630
 put the driver then get out 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.520
 appears you can choose the type and vibration 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.920
 that is, and 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.959
 which are continuously vibrating there 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.019
 which is jerky 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.239
 something like a body kit and then debug 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.430
 the window also look at the position of the sticks 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.760
 is if here equals there if 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.720
 such is the very middle so that they are 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.760
 in the middle 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.830
 on exactly the other way you have to tune 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.730
 dead zone or calibrate the device 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.720
 straight windows well click safe further 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.030
 close the window and what we have 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.760
 we have the same executable that 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.650
 we downloaded two new files 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.430
 x360 priced . and not and 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.569
 x input 1 dash you . divider exactly 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.390
 we need them and these two files we take and 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.720
 for example i want to install 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:01.430
 use my gamepad for far cry 3 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.760
 open in the position of the game open 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.769
 root folder of the game and that's it for her 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.290
 it is required just for this emulator 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.350
 files are required 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.720
 it is in the folder with the game launcher elephant 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.780
 black games for example this one 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:23.540
 this one but I already have an emulator 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:30.910
 but I will delete okay, and here they are throwing off these two 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.910
 file them so seconds we copy 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.330
 this file is almost not there 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.220
 you need it only to configure 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.980
 of our emulator but for convenience we can and 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.780
 we can run it all ready 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.430
 game and test and will not run because 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.800
 what do you know but I am one hundred percent all 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:55.110
 It works as it should be just today with 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.700
 am played on gamepad and for some 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.430
 games will need to connect exactly 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.930
 enable gamepad recognition well this 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.480
 made very easy going into 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.459
 settings further controls for example too 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.270
 sniffing and mouse control type and 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.150
 keyboard 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:13.230
 we change to a gamepad and everything is with us 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.630
 works for example in f1 you can do 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.859
 deeper settings exactly not 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.560
 gamepad and steering 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:24.240
 for example we can set this 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.600
 emulator on the steering wheel i.e. assign as 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.180
 to the steering axis here on this here on the x-y 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.280
 left stick exactly what we are right 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.070
 is usually she herself will find everything 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.669
 settings if your steering wheel for example is not 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.720
 some 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.760
 she herself is a prefab for example because well 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.100
 if there is such a device at all somewhere 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.729
 usually that configuration is sold to it 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.110
 here they appear almost immediately 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:53.190
 the mine loads the users themselves of these 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.180
 most rudders gamepads and everything else but 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.940
 additionally 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.760
 I will say that if you are for and enter the game 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.830
 and not setting up a pre 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.260
 the parameter then the game will determine you 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.419
 storming what gamepad that stick will be 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.060
 define you as a gamepad and how 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:13.169
 make sure the game saw definitely 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.660
 either stick or steering or gamepad well 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.400
 let's do it on our tab 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:22.010
 the controller that we need and click 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.690
 Advanced button and select the device type 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.820
 she wo n't even see what 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.200
 This is for the device and the default 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.360
 expose either a gamepad or in general 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.430
 unknown device and work it 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.320
 unlikely to be 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:38.070
 we can choose a gamepad that's for 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:41.130
 gamepad will is the steering wheel 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.780
 that is, when installing the emulator on 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.080
 the steering wheel we put exactly 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.410
 will next arcade stick with step dance 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.290
 pad guitar even drum kit is or 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.210
 alternet guitars or big bottom along the bottom I 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.890
 I do not know what kind of device they are on but 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.280
 apparently on the x-box they are under 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.800
 windows are also supported 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.900
 because there are such a device here 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.130
 but I do n't need this in general 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.650
 only here these are the three types 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.680
 more precisely, even two types of gamepad and will 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:14.460
 I have a steering wheel and a gamepad 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:18.600
 and the whole setup I think nothing complicated 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:22.280
 it is not there and in general to all who looked 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.620
 to whom i helped everyone thanks for watching 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.260
 of those who helped like a video and 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.710
 subscription to all who did not help, sorry 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.460
 explained how could generally good luck to all 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.460
 settings to all
