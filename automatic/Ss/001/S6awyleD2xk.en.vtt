00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.259 
take those guys out now let's just all
here<00:03:04.379> with<00:03:04.469> our<00:03:04.709> lon<00:03:04.889> he<00:03:05.459> does<00:03:05.609> have<00:03:05.730> only<00:03:05.909> four

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
here with our lon he does have only four

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.390 
here with our lon he does have only four
hits<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.230> doesn't<00:03:07.769> really<00:03:07.829> take<00:03:08.159> that<00:03:08.189> long

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
hits so it doesn't really take that long

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.689 
hits so it doesn't really take that long
I<00:03:09.329> mean<00:03:10.319> you<00:03:10.620> can<00:03:10.769> stall<00:03:11.010> for<00:03:11.040> quite<00:03:11.609> a<00:03:11.639> long

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:11.699 
I mean you can stall for quite a long

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.250 
I mean you can stall for quite a long
time<00:03:11.819> with<00:03:12.180> our<00:03:12.329> little<00:03:12.480> because<00:03:12.810> these

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
time with our little because these

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.259 
time with our little because these
turtles<00:03:13.590> have<00:03:13.680> 20<00:03:13.949> hp<00:03:14.340> meaning<00:03:14.969> that<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.239> can

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
turtles have 20 hp meaning that you can

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.129 
turtles have 20 hp meaning that you can
use<00:03:15.870> 5<00:03:16.560> for<00:03:17.069> hits<00:03:17.280> on<00:03:18.239> one<00:03:18.569> total<00:03:18.930> which<00:03:19.019> is

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
use 5 for hits on one total which is

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.099 
use 5 for hits on one total which is
absolutely<00:03:19.859> crazy<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:21.509> should<00:03:21.780> just<00:03:21.810> be

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
absolutely crazy so we should just be

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.780 
absolutely crazy so we should just be

this<00:06:27.560> is<00:06:27.620> actually<00:06:28.069> really<00:06:28.099> difficult<00:06:28.550> she

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:28.909 
this is actually really difficult she

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:33.850 
this is actually really difficult she
has<00:06:29.029> a<00:06:29.180> lot<00:06:29.659> of<00:06:29.690> help<00:06:30.080> a<00:06:30.289> lot<00:06:31.069> of<00:06:31.400> help<00:06:32.289> so<00:06:33.289> this

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
has a lot of help a lot of help so this

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.639 
has a lot of help a lot of help so this
might<00:06:34.520> be<00:06:34.580> a<00:06:34.729> bit<00:06:35.300> of<00:06:35.330> a<00:06:35.479> challenge<00:06:35.719> but<00:06:36.589> I

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:36.649 
might be a bit of a challenge but I

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:38.230 
might be a bit of a challenge but I
believe<00:06:36.919> that<00:06:36.979> we<00:06:37.219> can<00:06:37.250> still<00:06:37.610> do<00:06:37.729> it

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
believe that we can still do it

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.370 
believe that we can still do it
look<00:06:39.240> unfortunately<00:06:39.810> for<00:06:39.990> us<00:06:40.050> we're<00:06:40.260> actually

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
look unfortunately for us we're actually

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.050 
look unfortunately for us we're actually
getting<00:06:40.560> really<00:06:41.130> bad<00:06:41.280> luck<00:06:41.550> without<00:06:41.730> walls

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
getting really bad luck without walls

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.180 
getting really bad luck without walls
right<00:06:42.240> now<00:06:42.420> I<00:06:43.170> would<00:06:43.620> be<00:06:43.740> better<00:06:43.890> for<00:06:44.040> me<00:06:44.070> on<00:06:44.160> a

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
right now I would be better for me on a

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.910 
right now I would be better for me on a
couple<00:06:44.520> more<00:06:44.610> decks<00:06:44.940> orbs<00:06:45.390> for<00:06:46.320> me<00:06:46.500> hawk<00:06:46.710> and

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920 
couple more decks orbs for me hawk and

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.010 
couple more decks orbs for me hawk and
Zora<00:06:47.190> however<00:06:47.970> I<00:06:48.120> think<00:06:48.420> this<00:06:48.510> will<00:06:48.660> do<00:06:48.810> fine

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
Zora however I think this will do fine

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.900 
Zora however I think this will do fine
as<00:06:49.230> you<00:06:49.320> can<00:06:49.440> see<00:06:49.680> she's<00:06:50.160> got<00:06:50.310> two<00:06:50.520> turns<00:06:50.790> left

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
as you can see she's got two turns left

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.870 
as you can see she's got two turns left
to<00:06:51.120> attack<00:06:51.420> and<00:06:51.660> we've<00:06:51.840> got<00:06:52.020> plenty<00:06:52.530> of<00:06:52.890> damage

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
to attack and we've got plenty of damage

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.210 
to attack and we've got plenty of damage
still<00:06:54.330> the<00:06:54.450> output<00:06:54.870> so<00:06:55.230> I<00:06:55.500> think<00:06:55.770> we'll<00:06:56.160> be

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
still the output so I think we'll be

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:02.530 
still the output so I think we'll be
just<00:06:56.460> about<00:06:56.640> fine<00:07:00.740> and<00:07:01.740> this<00:07:02.040> should<00:07:02.130> be<00:07:02.280> it
