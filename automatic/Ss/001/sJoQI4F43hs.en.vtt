00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.480
 hello everyone because today 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.639
 bring a new tutorial not true 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.799
 I have had my same problem but 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.320
 I always get my collars and 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.580
 I have broken a lot and at least 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.250
 I want to put it because it took a lot 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.920
 separating them so for this I was 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.810
 an idea happened what we are going to do is 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.380
 with a wooden hook 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.949
 with a hook 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.079
 put nails and then we're going to 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.730
 hang up so we do not have this 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.120
 problem of getting stuck and we 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.120
 tangle 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.719
 what we are going to use apart from the hook 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:50.200
 the colors misses what you 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:54.090
 want a pencil or color whatever 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.090
 a tape to measure 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.730
 nails about one inch 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.830
 a hammer 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.830
 and then schoolchildren who want to brew 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.110
 2 and they get tangled 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.140
 because by the procedure what we are going to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.140
 to do is measure our hook 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.610
 mine measures 23 centimeters and that's what 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.700
 let's divide between the nails that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.650
 We want to use more one I want to use 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.060
 six nails so I divide it between 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.700
 seven and I came out of 3.2 so what 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.530
 let's do is mark our hook 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.530
 every 3.2 centimeters 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.180
 Now what we are going to do is nail 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.530
 our klaus 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.110
 we take one we hold it firmly 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.860
 watch your fingers 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 and they start to nail slowly but 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.490
 firmly 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.330
 Now what we are going to do is paint 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.330
 our hook 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.510
 Well well that way it can be put what 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.420
 that you want dots or strips 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.650
 what you want 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.709
 and then I, apart from varnish, decorate it with 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.720
 prints, that's how it looks, I hope that 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.930
 they liked that they do it and that they 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.930
 be useful
