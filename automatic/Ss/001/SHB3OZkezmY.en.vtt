currently missing they might add it into
the<00:00:48.899> PlayStation<00:00:49.800> Store<00:00:49.920> or<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:51.030> just

at<00:00:54.480> three-point<00:00:55.020> 30<00:00:57.620> but<00:00:58.910> that's<00:00:59.910> not

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
at three-point 30 but that's not

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.399 
at three-point 30 but that's not
necessarily<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:01.230> bad<00:01:01.590> thing<00:01:02.660> as<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.229> I

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
necessarily a bad thing as you can see I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.380 
necessarily a bad thing as you can see I
can<00:01:04.470> still<00:01:04.920> run<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> Vita<00:01:05.549> half<00:01:05.760> by<00:01:05.939> loader<00:01:06.150> on

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
can still run the Vita half by loader on

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.780 
can still run the Vita half by loader on
3.35<00:01:11.659> at<00:01:12.659> first<00:01:13.080> pretty<00:01:13.650> simple<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.580> see

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
3.35 at first pretty simple you can see

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.249 
3.35 at first pretty simple you can see
I've<00:01:14.970> got<00:01:15.000> more<00:01:15.330> than<00:01:15.390> 20<00:01:15.900> mb<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:17.570> free<00:01:18.570> ram<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
I've got more than 20 mb of free ram and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.460 
I've got more than 20 mb of free ram and
the<00:01:19.650> CPU<00:01:20.130> clock<00:01:20.430> frequency<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.720> basically<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the CPU clock frequency so basically the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.210 
the CPU clock frequency so basically the
speed<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:23.009> which<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.520> emulator<00:01:24.000> runs<00:01:24.740> is<00:01:25.740> also

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
speed at which the emulator runs is also

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.100 
speed at which the emulator runs is also
the<00:01:26.340> maximum<00:01:26.820> which<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.270> 333<00:01:28.820> m<00:01:29.820> three<00:01:30.320> and

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
the maximum which is 333 m three and

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.340 
the maximum which is 333 m three and
just<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.290> record<00:01:34.470> i<00:01:35.360> can<00:01:36.360> run<00:01:36.570> numbers

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
just for the record i can run numbers

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.039 
just for the record i can run numbers
still<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.280> 3.35<00:01:39.470> for<00:01:40.470> example<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.899> game<00:01:42.899> boy

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
still at 3.35 for example this game boy

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.740 
still at 3.35 for example this game boy
color<00:01:43.079> emulator<00:01:44.329> it<00:01:45.329> also<00:01:45.689> runs<00:01:45.990> classic<00:01:46.740> old

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
color emulator it also runs classic old

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.050 
color emulator it also runs classic old
gameboy<00:01:48.750> games<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.470> tetris<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
gameboy games like tetris like the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:29.230 
gameboy games like tetris like the
classic<00:01:51.689> Gameboy<00:01:52.170> game

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.010 

and<00:02:30.240> so<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:32.820> can<00:02:33.000> also<00:02:33.150> run<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.690> our<00:02:33.720> games

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
and so on you can also run all our games

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.400 
and so on you can also run all our games

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:43.680 

supernus<00:03:09.610> Enders<00:03:10.000> also<00:03:10.540> fully<00:03:11.110> playable

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.510 

but<00:03:44.690> this<00:03:44.930> game<00:03:45.170> has<00:03:45.230> some<00:03:45.710> serious<00:03:45.980> levels

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
but this game has some serious levels

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.000 
but this game has some serious levels
and<00:03:49.520> i'm<00:03:49.670> not<00:03:49.850> sure<00:03:50.120> what<00:03:50.360> key<00:03:51.200> is<00:03:51.440> gasps<00:03:52.100> key

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
and i'm not sure what key is gasps key

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.440 
and i'm not sure what key is gasps key
as<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.070> can<00:03:55.310> see<00:03:55.490> in<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:55.730> game<00:03:55.910> as<00:03:56.090> serious

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
as you can see in this game as serious

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.980 
as you can see in this game as serious
low<00:03:56.660> tones<00:03:56.950> so<00:03:57.950> it<00:03:58.240> depends<00:03:59.240> from<00:03:59.690> game<00:03:59.960> to

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
low tones so it depends from game to

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.800 
low tones so it depends from game to
game<00:04:00.170> which<00:04:00.680> one<00:04:00.890> is<00:04:01.180> fully<00:04:02.180> playable<00:04:02.510> and
