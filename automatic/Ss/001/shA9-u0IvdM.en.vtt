00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello to all the old ones and rules and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.410
 we are with nine of the back we are 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.320
 with my friend the urban little lamb for 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.009
 show you how there is april in the title a 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.090
 cannon of arrows as you can see is a 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.530
 point penis novelty store 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.670
 and it's a let's say it's a prototype worth 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.490
 we will leave with the description and 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.710
 and if you want, you can improve it 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.810
 I do not tell you because the comments are not 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.210
 they go every one also go I know that a 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.000
 poop you saw a year ago in fact but it 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.350
 I forgot to re-teach orbital 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.680
 so I bring it now that the cons 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.879
 the other day and basically basically in them 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.350
 it's a ballet arrows truck is a 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.010
 normal dynamite cannon common project 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.010
 it's dynamite 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.170
 and basically he explained as the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.880
 quickly operating the room 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.500
 white the first thing that will happen is that 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.250
 this piston here is going to generate 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.250
 how have you been here 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.390
 of vÃ­ctor disable then this 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.990
 infinite current circuit like me 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.840
 I call him as I just called him 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.480
 will start to activate this dispenser and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.420
 clarify the key the date here in 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.210
 this piston then after then not 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.760
 had gone through all repeat the signal 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.690
 activate these tendencies will activate 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.690
 it will explode when they stay there 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.259
 and then they will be the one who repeats the arrival 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.840
 around here and the piston will come out all the 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.220
 nail chip will fall 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.680
 unfairly good times here in the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.350
 air will more or less explode the dynamite and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.150
 will throw double fault dates is not very 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.310
 does not have a lot of aim and is very 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.950
 optimized but good I know that sure 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.760
 you can do something there handsome 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.760
 so good you are going to try 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 yes 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.399
 and how 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.670
 basically its operation 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.900
 As I said, you have it in the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.810
 description so you can 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.980
 download it and improve it is much more 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.230
 efficient and much better than this 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.209
 and good and time post you can make him 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.310
 put more arrows so you have more 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.740
 arrows if you put more duration both 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.420
 things 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.150
 and well I do not think I'll hold a tutorial 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.230
 to say how you have to do it worth 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.600
 I was just here with the repeats 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.580
 putting them in plan so that I had half 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.590
 hour in plan calculating so that it fell 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.990
 just when the dynamite exploded and 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.230
 talent of that so it's a matter of 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.500
 get on the plan without bread so nothing 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:54.010
 I'm just going to teach it 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.010
 this has been everything so see you later
