I am making I have have put my wiring
harness<00:00:15.760> I<00:00:15.910> cleaned<00:00:16.270> my<00:00:16.390> wiring<00:00:16.810> harness<00:00:17.380> up

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
harness I cleaned my wiring harness up

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.929 
harness I cleaned my wiring harness up
and<00:00:17.859> put<00:00:18.070> it<00:00:18.160> in<00:00:18.310> this<00:00:18.490> conduit<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:21.279> protect<00:00:21.699> it

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
and put it in this conduit to protect it

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.859 
and put it in this conduit to protect it
it<00:00:22.119> just<00:00:22.150> looks<00:00:22.660> a<00:00:22.779> lot<00:00:22.960> nicer<00:00:27.240> now<00:00:28.240> those<00:00:28.539> two

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
it just looks a lot nicer now those two

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.249 
it just looks a lot nicer now those two
heavy<00:00:29.199> red<00:00:29.529> wires<00:00:30.359> are<00:00:31.359> going<00:00:31.570> to<00:00:31.630> be<00:00:31.749> going<00:00:31.929> to

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
heavy red wires are going to be going to

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.150 
heavy red wires are going to be going to
both<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.739> alternator<00:00:33.310> in<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.640> starter<00:00:35.160> for

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
both the alternator in the starter for

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.200 
both the alternator in the starter for
the<00:00:36.910> ammeter<00:00:37.450> I'm<00:00:38.020> putting<00:00:38.440> in<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:39.970> dash

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
the ammeter I'm putting in and the dash

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.690 
the ammeter I'm putting in and the dash
so<00:00:41.200> I<00:00:41.230> don't<00:00:41.470> just<00:00:41.620> have<00:00:41.770> a<00:00:41.800> dummy<00:00:42.100> light<00:00:42.370> and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
so I don't just have a dummy light and

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.300 
so I don't just have a dummy light and
that<00:00:43.660> white<00:00:43.990> wire<00:00:44.260> is<00:00:44.470> going<00:00:44.650> to<00:00:44.710> be<00:00:44.830> fog

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
that white wire is going to be fog

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.250 
that white wire is going to be fog
lights<00:00:45.640> I<00:00:45.910> ran<00:00:46.120> them<00:00:46.330> all<00:00:46.480> through<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.990> hole

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260

that<00:01:18.490> was<00:01:18.819> completely<00:01:19.299> rebuilt<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:20.859> if<00:01:21.039> you

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
that was completely rebuilt and if you

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.300 
that was completely rebuilt and if you
look<00:01:21.310> right<00:01:21.490> there<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:23.409> not<00:01:23.649> drilled<00:01:24.100> for

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
look right there it's not drilled for

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.050 
look right there it's not drilled for
the<00:01:24.369> mechanical<00:01:25.090> pump<00:01:26.219> so<00:01:27.219> I'm<00:01:27.340> going<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.909> have

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
the mechanical pump so I'm going to have

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.940 
the mechanical pump so I'm going to have
to<00:01:28.090> use<00:01:28.390> an<00:01:28.659> electric<00:01:29.020> pump<00:01:29.229> which<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:29.740> have<00:01:29.920> a

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
to use an electric pump which I have a

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.510 
to use an electric pump which I have a
pure<00:01:30.310> later<00:01:31.229> which<00:01:32.229> my<00:01:32.439> father<00:01:32.679> put<00:01:33.130> in<00:01:33.310> his

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.399 

see<00:01:38.249> that<00:01:39.770> it's<00:01:40.770> coming<00:01:41.100> along

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.349 

got<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.719> wiring<00:01:47.719> harness<00:01:48.200> right<00:01:48.439> here

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
got the wiring harness right here

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.029 
got the wiring harness right here
crossing<00:01:50.359> where<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.960> radiator<00:01:51.439> will<00:01:51.740> be<00:01:51.920> as

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
crossing where the radiator will be as

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.830 
crossing where the radiator will be as
well<00:01:52.249> so<00:01:52.520> they<00:01:52.579> have<00:01:52.819> a<00:01:52.850> lot<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:53.119> loose<00:01:53.420> wires

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
well so they have a lot of loose wires

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.849 
well so they have a lot of loose wires
dangling<00:01:54.560> around<00:01:54.799> I<00:01:58.119> went<00:01:59.119> ahead<00:01:59.179> and<00:01:59.679> got<00:02:00.679> the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
things that really appealed to me when I

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.920 
things that really appealed to me when I
look<00:04:54.180> at<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.360> 2002<00:04:55.229> engine<00:04:56.600> someone<00:04:57.600> has<00:04:57.720> taken

look at a 2002 engine someone has taken

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.180 
look at a 2002 engine someone has taken
a<00:04:58.260> lot<00:04:58.620> of<00:04:58.680> time<00:04:59.150> paid<00:05:00.150> attention<00:05:00.479> to<00:05:00.660> detail

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
a lot of time paid attention to detail

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.120 
a lot of time paid attention to detail
here's<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.280> old<00:05:02.520> engine<00:05:02.729> right<00:05:03.030> there<00:05:03.330> I

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
here's the old engine right there I

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.570 
here's the old engine right there I
think<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.190> was<00:05:05.220> pretty<00:05:05.520> worn<00:05:05.820> out<00:05:07.340> see<00:05:08.340> that

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
think it was pretty worn out see that

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.760 
think it was pretty worn out see that
there<00:05:08.760> was<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:11.850> rear<00:05:12.060> seal<00:05:12.510> was<00:05:12.810> shot<00:05:13.260> and<00:05:13.590> the

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
there was the rear seal was shot and the

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.800 
there was the rear seal was shot and the
stripping<00:05:14.250> oil<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:16.110> they're<00:05:18.169> pretty<00:05:19.169> nasty

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
stripping oil and they're pretty nasty

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.460 
stripping oil and they're pretty nasty
and<00:05:21.979> i<00:05:23.150> think<00:05:24.150> that<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.539> valve<00:05:24.870> guides<00:05:25.199> are

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
and i think that the valve guides are

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.140 
and i think that the valve guides are
pretty<00:05:25.740> worn<00:05:26.010> i<00:05:26.190> think<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.490> rings<00:05:26.729> were<00:05:26.850> worn

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
pretty worn i think the rings were worn

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.409 
pretty worn i think the rings were worn
