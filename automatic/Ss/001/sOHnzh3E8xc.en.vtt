00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.180 
hey guys ed here from recap audio I've

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.210 
hey guys ed here from recap audio I've
been<00:00:04.750> reading<00:00:04.990> a<00:00:05.049> lot<00:00:05.080> on<00:00:05.410> forums<00:00:05.800> these<00:00:06.010> days

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.220 
been reading a lot on forums these days

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.700 
been reading a lot on forums these days
about<00:00:06.430> the<00:00:06.700> new<00:00:06.910> line<00:00:07.420> six<00:00:07.780> wireless<00:00:08.440> mics

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
about the new line six wireless mics

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.730 
about the new line six wireless mics
that<00:00:09.700> effectively<00:00:10.059> use<00:00:10.330> the<00:00:10.539> Wi-Fi<00:00:10.740> frequency

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
that effectively use the Wi-Fi frequency

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.299 
that effectively use the Wi-Fi frequency
range

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
range

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.390 
range
I<00:00:12.549> think<00:00:12.730> it's<00:00:12.820> 2.4<00:00:13.360> gigahertz<00:00:14.309> rather<00:00:15.309> than

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
I think it's 2.4 gigahertz rather than

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.880 
I think it's 2.4 gigahertz rather than
the<00:00:15.490> old<00:00:15.610> analog<00:00:16.199> analog<00:00:17.199> ones<00:00:17.560> which<00:00:17.770> have

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
the old analog analog ones which have

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.830 
the old analog analog ones which have
just<00:00:18.010> changed<00:00:18.580> well<00:00:18.820> change<00:00:19.210> like<00:00:19.480> a<00:00:19.510> couple

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
just changed well change like a couple

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.940 
just changed well change like a couple
years<00:00:20.080> ago<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.930> I've<00:00:22.930> been<00:00:22.960> reading<00:00:23.380> a<00:00:23.620> lot<00:00:23.650> of

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
years ago and I've been reading a lot of

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.520 
years ago and I've been reading a lot of
kind<00:00:24.310> of<00:00:24.400> good<00:00:24.610> things<00:00:24.850> about<00:00:24.970> them<00:00:25.330> and<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:26.110> -

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
kind of good things about them and the -

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.170 
kind of good things about them and the -
them<00:00:26.830> is<00:00:26.950> certainly<00:00:27.130> good<00:00:27.550> but<00:00:27.790> I<00:00:27.850> haven't

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
them is certainly good but I haven't

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.779 
them is certainly good but I haven't
seen<00:00:28.420> any<00:00:28.720> concrete<00:00:29.620> evidence<00:00:30.100> of<00:00:30.490> what<00:00:30.640> they

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
seen any concrete evidence of what they

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.050 
seen any concrete evidence of what they
sound<00:00:31.000> like<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:32.230> here<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:33.129> am<00:00:33.280> today<00:00:33.670> with<00:00:33.910> one

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
sound like so here I am today with one

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.540 
sound like so here I am today with one
of<00:00:34.180> them<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.710> I'm<00:00:35.860> gonna<00:00:35.920> be<00:00:36.100> comparing<00:00:36.490> it

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
of them and I'm gonna be comparing it

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.620 
of them and I'm gonna be comparing it
against<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:36.970> shore<00:00:37.390> beta<00:00:37.810> 58<00:00:38.350> I<00:00:39.310> did<00:00:40.300> play

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
against the shore beta 58 I did play

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.450 
against the shore beta 58 I did play
around<00:00:40.810> with<00:00:40.960> it<00:00:41.079> earlier<00:00:41.200> and<00:00:41.560> there's<00:00:42.220> a<00:00:42.280> lot

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
around with it earlier and there's a lot

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.100 
around with it earlier and there's a lot
of<00:00:42.489> videos<00:00:42.910> on<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.239> actual<00:00:43.510> distance<00:00:43.960> these

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
of videos on the actual distance these

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.440 
of videos on the actual distance these
things<00:00:44.440> can<00:00:44.680> do<00:00:44.829> and<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:46.060> I'm<00:00:46.210> not<00:00:46.329> gonna

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
things can do and so I'm not gonna

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.900 
things can do and so I'm not gonna
really<00:00:46.750> assess<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.050> distance<00:00:47.980> today<00:00:48.190> of<00:00:48.610> the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
really assess the distance today of the

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.000 
really assess the distance today of the
the<00:00:49.329> range<00:00:49.570> of<00:00:49.810> the<00:00:49.899> wireless<00:00:50.050> mic<00:00:50.440> because<00:00:50.770> I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
the range of the wireless mic because I

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.770 
the range of the wireless mic because I
know<00:00:51.489> it<00:00:51.640> can<00:00:51.760> go<00:00:51.850> pretty<00:00:52.030> far<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.480> I've<00:00:52.600> seen

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
know it can go pretty far and I've seen

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.170 
know it can go pretty far and I've seen
lots<00:00:53.020> of<00:00:53.110> videos<00:00:53.170> with<00:00:53.590> the<00:00:53.680> game<00:00:53.860> miles<00:00:54.180> so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
lots of videos with the game miles so

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.510 
lots of videos with the game miles so
this<00:00:55.300> is<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.750> XD<00:00:56.559> V<00:00:57.460> 30<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:59.800> got<00:00:59.950> it<00:01:00.100> today<00:01:00.340> so

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
this is the XD V 30 just got it today so

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.819 
this is the XD V 30 just got it today so
I<00:01:00.730> have<00:01:00.880> unless<00:01:01.000> you<00:01:01.180> used<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:01.600> properly<00:01:02.500> live

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
I have unless you used it properly live

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.889 
I have unless you used it properly live
yet<00:01:03.190> so<00:01:03.430> all<00:01:03.579> I<00:01:03.610> can<00:01:03.820> do<00:01:03.969> is<00:01:04.149> a<00:01:04.360> little<00:01:04.509> test

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
yet so all I can do is a little test

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.800 
yet so all I can do is a little test
here<00:01:05.019> so<00:01:05.440> you<00:01:05.860> can<00:01:05.950> hear<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.130> difference<00:01:06.460> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
here so you can hear the difference so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.110 
here so you can hear the difference so
I'm<00:01:07.810> just<00:01:08.020> gonna<00:01:08.140> switch<00:01:08.260> over<00:01:08.470> should<00:01:08.710> now

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
I'm just gonna switch over should now

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.070 
I'm just gonna switch over should now
okay<00:01:10.120> so<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.510> is<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.870> line<00:01:11.350> 6<00:01:11.710> X<00:01:12.040> DV<00:01:13.049> 30<00:01:14.049> I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
okay so this is the line 6 X DV 30 I

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.840 
okay so this is the line 6 X DV 30 I
think<00:01:14.409> I<00:01:14.470> got<00:01:14.620> that<00:01:14.740> right

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
think I got that right

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.149 
think I got that right
so<00:01:16.390> I<00:01:16.720> mean<00:01:17.140> earlier<00:01:17.470> it<00:01:17.530> sounded<00:01:17.860> very<00:01:17.890> nice

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
so I mean earlier it sounded very nice

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.080 
so I mean earlier it sounded very nice
it<00:01:18.729> sounded<00:01:19.000> really<00:01:19.180> usable<00:01:19.720> really<00:01:20.560> clean

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it sounded really usable really clean

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.649 
it sounded really usable really clean
quite<00:01:22.090> clear

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
quite clear

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.920 
quite clear
so<00:01:23.500> again<00:01:23.740> was<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.159> beta<00:01:24.340> 58<00:01:24.760> so<00:01:25.240> about<00:01:25.510> 58

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
so again was the beta 58 so about 58

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.890 
so again was the beta 58 so about 58
sounds<00:01:26.260> like<00:01:26.440> and<00:01:26.680> going<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:27.909> line<00:01:28.360> 6<00:01:28.659> mic

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
sounds like and going to the line 6 mic

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.219 
sounds like and going to the line 6 mic
it's<00:01:29.409> all<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.650> line<00:01:29.799> 6<00:01:30.130> mic<00:01:30.369> that<00:01:30.610> sounds<00:01:31.000> like

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
it's all the line 6 mic that sounds like

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.300 
it's all the line 6 mic that sounds like
this<00:01:32.229> has<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.330> their<00:01:34.330> capsule<00:01:34.750> on<00:01:34.900> which<00:01:35.799> I

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
this has the their capsule on which I

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.960 
this has the their capsule on which I
think<00:01:37.119> they<00:01:37.180> said<00:01:37.360> was<00:01:38.220> their<00:01:39.220> own<00:01:39.369> personal

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
think they said was their own personal

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.210 
think they said was their own personal
one<00:01:40.150> of<00:01:40.450> kind<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:40.869> a<00:01:41.080> modelling<00:01:41.710> of<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.890> best

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
one of kind of a modelling of the best

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.890 
one of kind of a modelling of the best
out<00:01:42.760> there<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.040> makes<00:01:45.310> any<00:01:45.400> sense<00:01:45.729> but<00:01:46.540> go

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
out there if that makes any sense but go

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.060 
out there if that makes any sense but go
and<00:01:47.049> have<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.170> look<00:01:47.320> at<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.590> if<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:47.799> like<00:01:47.979> the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
and have a look at it if you like the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.590 
and have a look at it if you like the
sound<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.430> gonna<00:01:49.030> have<00:01:49.180> a<00:01:49.240> look<00:01:49.360> at<00:01:49.479> it

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
sound of it gonna have a look at it

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.330 
sound of it gonna have a look at it
there<00:01:49.840> really<00:01:50.350> are<00:01:50.619> quite<00:01:50.890> cheap<00:01:51.070> at<00:01:51.250> the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
there really are quite cheap at the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.210 
there really are quite cheap at the
moment<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.750> know<00:01:52.869> not<00:01:53.259> much<00:01:53.500> more<00:01:53.860> than<00:01:54.100> you'd

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
moment you know not much more than you'd
