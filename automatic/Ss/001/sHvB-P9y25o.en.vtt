 a Chinese brand mobile 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:18.150

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:21.930

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.580
 here in the box we can see the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.930
 mobile features 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:36.489
 We have screens of 4.5 inches 960 x 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:39.160
 540 pixels per quad core to 1.3 if 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.590

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.440
 kitkat 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.760
 one gigabyte of memory ram 8 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.100
 internal that is not bad 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.019
 and external memory 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.000
 we have the possibility to put a 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:01:00.469
 microsd with a maximum of 64 GB and also 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.149
 the rear camera of 3 megapixels and 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:08.630
 front of 8 we also have 88 degrees 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:12.580
 of camera angle so we can 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.370
 take many more spaces 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.020
 of photo very well after nothing else 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.260
 web pages in English Italian 9 lo 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.260
 will 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.190
 the first thing that we found 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.190
 is the housing 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.950
 2b in a housing 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.760
 of the gift 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.930
 and in it 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.930
 in this case it is white 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.479
 the mobile must be highlighted that has 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.590
 tactile part from behind we can handle 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.570
 from behind with our finger 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.200
 certain t-mobile function as photos 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.259
 videos and others but this load is in 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 concrete would not have that possibility anymore 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.210
 what is it conforms we will see now 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.789
 when we take the phone that is the one 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.049
 It comes default is to appear the 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.280
 draw a tactile part to handle it 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:16.230
 so there are the gift ones we can not 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:21.470
 exchange very well we leave aside and 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.470
 here we have our mobile 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.159
 With our 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.159
 touch screen for me behind 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.900

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.379
 quito 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:10.860
 we took out of the box we can see 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.190
 the side where we have the button 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.200

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:26.639
 curious to keep it and the cable 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.219
 flat to avoid getting tangled that the 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:40.389
 true that it is very practical and not 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:40.389
 many brands have it very interesting 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.840
 and also the headphones 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.860
 we'll see how it works 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.480

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.180
