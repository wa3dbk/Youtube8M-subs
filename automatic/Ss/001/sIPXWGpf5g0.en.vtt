00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
adults like myself there is a reason why

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.460 
adults like myself there is a reason why
adults<00:02:26.590> don't<00:02:26.980> eat<00:02:27.130> baby<00:02:27.370> food<00:02:27.989> now<00:02:28.989> this<00:02:29.200> is

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
adults don't eat baby food now this is

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.100 
adults don't eat baby food now this is
horrible<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:30.310> don't<00:02:31.180> know<00:02:31.269> how<00:02:31.480> babies<00:02:31.900> can

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
horrible I don't know how babies can

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.559 
horrible I don't know how babies can
like<00:02:32.319> this<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.980> guess<00:02:33.430> that's<00:02:33.700> just<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:34.180> guess<00:02:34.420> so

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
like this I guess that's just I guess so

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:35.460 
like this I guess that's just I guess so
just<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.840> different<00:02:35.200> breed

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
just a different breed

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.770 
just a different breed
I<00:02:35.799> guess<00:02:36.310> babies<00:02:36.730> are<00:02:36.880> just<00:02:36.910> tougher<00:02:37.510> than<00:02:37.630> I

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
I guess babies are just tougher than I

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.380 
I guess babies are just tougher than I
am<00:02:37.829> but<00:02:38.829> that<00:02:39.040> is<00:02:39.190> horrible<00:02:39.489> folks<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.180> don't

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
am but that is horrible folks it I don't

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.940 
am but that is horrible folks it I don't
know<00:02:40.480> what<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.780> even<00:02:40.900> think<00:02:41.230> about<00:02:41.319> that<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.829> I

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
know what to even think about that it I

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.020 
know what to even think about that it I
thought<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.310> would<00:02:42.400> taste<00:02:42.579> just<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:42.910> a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
thought it would taste just like a
