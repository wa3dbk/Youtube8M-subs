 In our attempted bakery we present today Anton women dead 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.619
 This tradition break with sourdough, they can with the hobby bakers 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.460
 Baking mix at home on points 14 750 grams of bread they need 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.699
 500 grams of baking mix Anton sparing and good 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.329
 three grams of hobby baker's dry yeast 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.729
 and 380 grams of water 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.600
 First, mix the dried yeast to mow 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 and they have to get this off well 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.180
 then the water is added 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.040
 it should be about 35 degrees warm so that the HEV fermentation process is in progress 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.950
 coming 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.230
 Now click everything to a smooth dough 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.670
 cover with a dough cloth and keep going for about 45 minutes 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.040
 to let 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.130
 then they go to a parking lot and from them to a round 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.130
 loaf 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.220
 Hayek does not values 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.490
 this is the old peasant method for loose threatened 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.290
 Put the bread in a bed next Gerd Corp and let it be about 30 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.080
 Minutes go 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.430
 through the basket he receives threatens a beautiful corpse 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.770
 Without a basket, the dough would have run to a wide plan to show up 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.790
 the subgroup area the farmers prototypical Resta it is time for 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.210
 the further processing they tap into childhood from the Gerd form 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.210
 and fall then look at the baking tray 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.210
 but he still does about 10 minutes 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.820
 by a slight pressure with the flat thumb on the dough one can 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.110
 determine if the dough has risen sufficiently 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.170
 a dent in the dough will immediately slide into the oven 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.610
 Spring - wait the last half for another five to ten minutes 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.110
 then they push the since packed into the preheated to 240 degrees oven 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.560
 Dany Bober and the bread at this temperature for 8 to 10 minutes 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.670
 under heat 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.679
 there are at 170 to 180 degrees still bake for 50 minutes 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.319
 fold it on the floor 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.539
