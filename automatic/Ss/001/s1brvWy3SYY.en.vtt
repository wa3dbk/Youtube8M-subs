hi everyone my name is Ruben honora's

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.830 
hi everyone my name is Ruben honora's
and<00:00:02.580> today<00:00:03.000> I'm<00:00:03.120> going<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.300> show<00:00:03.480> you<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.629> small

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
and today I'm going to show you a small

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.539 
and today I'm going to show you a small
tool<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.290> I<00:00:04.319> made<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:05.040> basically<00:00:05.339> create

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
tool that I made to basically create

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.820 
tool that I made to basically create
vector<00:00:06.299> fields<00:00:06.660> that<00:00:07.049> will<00:00:07.170> drive<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.649> view

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
vector fields that will drive you view

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.250 
vector fields that will drive you view
particles<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.429> Unreal<00:00:08.700> Engine<00:00:08.849> 4<00:00:09.260> from

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
particles in Unreal Engine 4 from

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.459 
particles in Unreal Engine 4 from
splines<00:00:11.219> inside<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.730> 3ds<00:00:11.910> max<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:13.019> after<00:00:13.349> you

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
splines inside of 3ds max so after you

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.189 
splines inside of 3ds max so after you
install<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.920> script<00:00:14.190> just<00:00:14.969> click<00:00:15.809> button

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
install the script just click button

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.010 
install the script just click button
open<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:17.029> first<00:00:18.029> thing<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.270> want<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.779> of

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
open it first thing you want to do is of

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.700 
open it first thing you want to do is of
course<00:00:19.460> create<00:00:20.460> some<00:00:20.640> splines<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.750> let's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
course create some splines so let's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.080 
course create some splines so let's
create<00:00:22.890> two<00:00:23.100> circles<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.910> for

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
create two circles just for

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.130 
create two circles just for
demonstration<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.910> that's<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:27.510> you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
demonstration and that's this one you

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.759 
demonstration and that's this one you
can<00:00:28.289> scale<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.619> down<00:00:29.570> duplicate<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.769> let's

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
can scale it down duplicate it let's

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.340 
can scale it down duplicate it let's
rotate<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.610> fun<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.600> take<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.870> any

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
rotate it just for fun so take it any

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.540 
rotate it just for fun so take it any
degrees<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.670> x<00:00:35.940> axis<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:37.100> there<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.219> go

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
degrees the x axis is there we go

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.240 
degrees the x axis is there we go
the<00:00:39.420> tool<00:00:39.600> works<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:40.050> editable<00:00:40.680> spline<00:00:40.770> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the tool works with editable spline so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.209 
the tool works with editable spline so
you're<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.090> ahead<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.540> right-click

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
you're going to go ahead and right-click

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.740 
you're going to go ahead and right-click
convert<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.309> editable<00:00:44.460> spline<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.180> they

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
convert it to editable spline and they

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.270 
convert it to editable spline and they
have<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> shapes<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:47.010> have

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
have all the shapes that you have have

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.979 
have all the shapes that you have have
to<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.579> part<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> same<00:00:48.210> spline<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.899> go

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
to be part of the same spline so just go

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.930 
to be part of the same spline so just go
ahead<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> attach<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.789> one

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
ahead and attach this one to that one

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.049 
ahead and attach this one to that one
and<00:00:51.270> that's<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:53.550> once<00:00:53.730> you've<00:00:53.850> done<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and that's it so once you've done that

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
and that's it so once you've done that
the<00:00:54.510> first<00:00:54.539> thing<00:00:54.780> you're<00:00:54.899> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.320> to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the first thing you're going to do is to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.819 
the first thing you're going to do is to
tell<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.670> tell<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> tool<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:58.379> spline

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
tell the tell the tool which spline

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.920 
tell the tell the tool which spline
object<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.250> use<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.239> go<00:01:00.359> ahead<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.750> pick

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
object to use so just go ahead and pick

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
object to use so just go ahead and pick
object<00:01:01.440> select<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.160> object<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.579> select<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
object select your object and select it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.289 
object select your object and select it
so<00:01:03.329> when<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.480> show<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> name<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:06.000> we're

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
so when I show the name here and we're

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
so when I show the name here and we're
ready<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.750> by<00:01:07.590> default<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.070> light<00:01:08.250> button

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
ready to go by default the light button

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.340 
ready to go by default the light button
is<00:01:08.670> disabled<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.869> updates<00:01:10.200> are

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
is disabled so all the updates are

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.810 
is disabled so all the updates are
triggered<00:01:10.619> manually<00:01:11.010> by<00:01:11.159> hitting<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> Update

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
triggered manually by hitting the Update

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.960 
triggered manually by hitting the Update
button<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.390> let's<00:01:12.510> go<00:01:12.600> ahead<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:12.960> that

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
button so let's go ahead and do that

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.130 
button so let's go ahead and do that
click<00:01:14.970> update<00:01:15.390> will<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.900> gray

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
click update will see that the the gray

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.950 
click update will see that the the gray
box<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.710> basically<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.060> turn<00:01:21.240> meaning<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
box is basically the turn meaning the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.830 
box is basically the turn meaning the
bounding<00:01:22.409> box<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> vector

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
bounding box for the for the vector

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.990 
bounding box for the for the vector
field<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.920> we're<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.549> ahead<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
field so we're going to go ahead and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.499 
field so we're going to go ahead and
scale<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.320> roughly<00:01:28.920> fits<00:01:29.509> our

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
scale it so that it roughly fits our

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.100 
scale it so that it roughly fits our
shape<00:01:31.430> on<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:32.670> three<00:01:32.909> accesses<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.750> let's<00:01:34.020> go

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
shape on all three accesses so let's go

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.330 
shape on all three accesses so let's go
to<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.409> left<00:01:34.619> now<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.250> scale<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:37.250> should<00:01:38.250> be

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
to the left now and scale it I should be

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.090 
to the left now and scale it I should be
good<00:01:38.460> enough<00:01:39.079> let's<00:01:40.079> go<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> perspective<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
good enough let's go to perspective and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.789 
good enough let's go to perspective and
click<00:01:41.520> update<00:01:41.729> again<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
click update again and we can see that

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.929 
click update again and we can see that
basically<00:01:46.979> these<00:01:47.939> gray<00:01:48.210> boxes<00:01:48.500> represent

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
basically these gray boxes represent

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.030 
basically these gray boxes represent
intersections<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.740> spline

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
intersections with the with the spline

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.370 
intersections with the with the spline
basically<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.299> resolution<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.960> very<00:01:55.020> low

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
basically the resolution is very low

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.899 
basically the resolution is very low
right<00:01:55.590> now<00:01:55.680> that's<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.189> set<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> 4<00:01:56.729> so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
right now that's it is set to 4 so

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.350 
right now that's it is set to 4 so
that's<00:01:57.030> why<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.259> very<00:01:58.469> accurate<00:01:59.360> let's

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that's why it's not very accurate let's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.959 
that's why it's not very accurate let's
go<00:02:00.450> ahead<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.840> increase<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> 8<00:02:01.759> now<00:02:02.759> they

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
go ahead and increase it to 8 now they

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.039 
go ahead and increase it to 8 now they
see<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> lot<00:02:03.960> more<00:02:03.990> accurate<00:02:04.500> now

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
see that it's a lot more accurate now

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.109 
see that it's a lot more accurate now
you<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.200> turn<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.740> light<00:02:07.920> button<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.489> it

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
you can turn on the light button and it

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.630 
you can turn on the light button and it
will<00:02:09.440> update<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.830> grid<00:02:10.979> automatically<00:02:11.489> every

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
will update the grid automatically every

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.610 
will update the grid automatically every
time<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.940> do

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
time you do

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.210 
time you do
like<00:02:13.069> scaling<00:02:13.489> modifying<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.209> bounding<00:02:14.480> box

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
like scaling modifying the bounding box

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.910 
like scaling modifying the bounding box
changing<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.310> density<00:02:17.110> showing<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.290> voxels

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
changing the density showing the voxels

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.020 
changing the density showing the voxels
hiding<00:02:19.879> the<00:02:20.000> box<00:02:20.209> also<00:02:20.480> showing<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.989> vectors

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
hiding the box also showing the vectors

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.520 
hiding the box also showing the vectors
it's<00:02:23.030> just<00:02:23.209> depending<00:02:23.690> on<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.050> on<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.349> speed

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
it's just depending on the on the speed

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.530 
it's just depending on the on the speed
of<00:02:24.560> your<00:02:24.680> computer<00:02:24.860> for<00:02:25.310> something<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:26.269> four

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
of your computer for something like four

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.770 
of your computer for something like four
and<00:02:26.780> eight<00:02:26.900> should<00:02:27.230> be<00:02:27.349> fine<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.299> red<00:02:29.540> box

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
and eight should be fine the the red box

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.080 
and eight should be fine the the red box
do<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.470> see<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.709> right<00:02:30.890> now<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.280> matching

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
do you see that right now is matching

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.210 
do you see that right now is matching
the<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.870> we<00:02:33.019> set<00:02:33.290> but<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:33.650> we<00:02:33.769> go<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
the one that we set but if we go to the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.089 
the one that we set but if we go to the
to<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:34.970> side<00:02:35.239> view<00:02:35.480> we<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.680> red<00:02:36.890> box

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
to the side view we see that the red box

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.680 
to the side view we see that the red box
is<00:02:37.280> wider<00:02:37.610> than<00:02:37.970> what<00:02:38.540> we've<00:02:38.750> set<00:02:40.690> basically

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
is wider than what we've set basically

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.670 
is wider than what we've set basically
what<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.900> does<00:02:42.049> is<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.780> takes<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.200> white<00:02:45.410> box

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
what it does is it takes the white box

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.039 
what it does is it takes the white box
and<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.730> says<00:02:46.970> okay<00:02:47.299> so<00:02:47.390> what's<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.720> density

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
and it says okay so what's the density

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.720 
and it says okay so what's the density
that<00:02:48.079> you<00:02:48.170> want<00:02:48.470> eight<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.370> takes<00:02:49.549> the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
that you want eight so it takes the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.640 
that you want eight so it takes the
longest<00:02:50.090> side<00:02:50.329> in<00:02:50.569> this<00:02:50.780> case<00:02:51.019> it's<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.440> one

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
longest side in this case it's this one

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.550 
longest side in this case it's this one
or<00:02:51.829> this<00:02:52.250> one<00:02:52.310> they're<00:02:52.790> equally<00:02:53.120> R<00:02:53.239> square<00:02:53.560> and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
or this one they're equally R square and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.960 
or this one they're equally R square and
it<00:02:54.680> any<00:02:54.890> divided<00:02:55.489> in<00:02:55.730> in<00:02:56.239> eight<00:02:57.459> for<00:02:58.459> based<00:02:58.879> on

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
it any divided in in eight for based on

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.910 
it any divided in in eight for based on
the<00:02:59.090> density<00:02:59.450> so<00:02:59.629> then<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.200> determines<00:03:00.650> the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
the density so then it determines the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.729 
the density so then it determines the
size<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.730> box<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.569> needs<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.110> fill

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
size of the box so that it needs to fill

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.190 
size of the box so that it needs to fill
this<00:03:03.980> side<00:03:04.280> with<00:03:04.549> eight<00:03:04.760> boxes<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.420> then<00:03:06.019> from

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
this side with eight boxes and then from

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.809 
this side with eight boxes and then from
there<00:03:06.379> it<00:03:06.530> says<00:03:06.739> okay<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.069> for<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.489> for<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
there it says okay so for the for the

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.420 
there it says okay so for the for the
other<00:03:07.940> sides<00:03:08.410> what's<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.560> size<00:03:09.799> of<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.160> this

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
other sides what's the size of it this

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.420 
other sides what's the size of it this
one<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:11.329> how<00:03:11.900> many<00:03:11.959> voxels<00:03:12.590> can<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.860> feed<00:03:13.099> here

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
one so how many voxels can I feed here

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.830 
one so how many voxels can I feed here
to<00:03:14.180> know<00:03:14.840> maybe<00:03:15.410> three<00:03:15.920> okay<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.389> voxels

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
to know maybe three okay so the voxels

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.330 
to know maybe three okay so the voxels
have<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.139> be<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.260> power<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.650> two<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.980> number<00:03:19.220> of

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
have to be a power of two the number of

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.830 
have to be a power of two the number of
boxes<00:03:19.489> has<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.000> be<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.150> power<00:03:20.329> of<00:03:20.420> two<00:03:20.600> because

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
boxes has to be a power of two because

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.030 
boxes has to be a power of two because
at<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.019> end<00:03:21.049> of<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:21.230> day<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:21.500> real<00:03:21.620> engine<00:03:21.950> is

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
at the end of the day and real engine is

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.580 
at the end of the day and real engine is
is<00:03:22.250> converting<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.790> into<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:23.000> texture<00:03:23.590> so

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
is converting it into a texture so

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.319 
is converting it into a texture so
basically<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.040> was<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.579> nearest<00:03:25.760> power<00:03:26.180> of

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
basically this was the nearest power of

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.599 
basically this was the nearest power of
two<00:03:26.480> for<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:27.620> means<00:03:27.859> that<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.069> need<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.280> scale

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
two for that means that I need to scale

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.849 
two for that means that I need to scale
it<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.760> these<00:03:28.970> size<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:30.410> if<00:03:30.530> you<00:03:30.620> actually

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
it to these size and if you actually

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.270 
it to these size and if you actually
show<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:32.180> grid<00:03:32.389> of<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.900> not<00:03:33.319> heat<00:03:33.709> boxes<00:03:34.130> the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
show the grid of the not heat boxes the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.099 
show the grid of the not heat boxes the
boxes<00:03:34.310> that<00:03:34.639> are<00:03:34.700> not<00:03:34.940> intersecting<00:03:35.480> so<00:03:35.989> we

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
boxes that are not intersecting so we

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.780 
boxes that are not intersecting so we
have<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.500> voxels<00:03:37.099> intersecting<00:03:37.639> those

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
have the the voxels intersecting those

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.370 
have the the voxels intersecting those
that<00:03:38.000> knot<00:03:38.209> insert<00:03:38.510> intersecting<00:03:39.049> so<00:03:39.170> if<00:03:39.230> we

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
that knot insert intersecting so if we

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.050 
that knot insert intersecting so if we
if<00:03:39.620> we<00:03:39.650> enable<00:03:39.889> them<00:03:40.130> both<00:03:40.310> will<00:03:40.549> see<00:03:40.700> all<00:03:40.880> the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
if we enable them both will see all the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.589 
if we enable them both will see all the
voxels

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
voxels

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.039 
voxels
it's<00:03:42.169> actually<00:03:42.530> one<00:03:42.829> two<00:03:43.160> three<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:43.669> four

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
it's actually one two three and four

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.900 
it's actually one two three and four
that's<00:03:45.049> it<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.319> mean<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:46.459> takes<00:03:46.730> your

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
that's it I mean it takes your

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.460 
that's it I mean it takes your
automatically<00:03:47.419> for<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.660> nothing<00:03:48.079> that<00:03:48.260> you

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
automatically for you nothing that you

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.099 
automatically for you nothing that you
need<00:03:48.829> to<00:03:48.950> worry<00:03:49.160> about<00:03:49.250> but<00:03:49.639> just<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:49.940> know

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
need to worry about but just so you know

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.259 
need to worry about but just so you know
the<00:03:51.109> other<00:03:51.230> option<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:51.889> wanna<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:53.180> you

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
the other option that you wanna that you

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.900 
the other option that you wanna that you
want<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.540> play<00:03:53.690> with<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:54.169> the<00:03:54.950> force<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.579> the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
want to play with is the force of the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.479 
want to play with is the force of the
non<00:03:56.329> intersected<00:03:57.019> voxels<00:03:57.380> by<00:03:57.889> default<00:03:58.250> is<00:03:58.340> set

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
non intersected voxels by default is set

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.539 
non intersected voxels by default is set
to<00:03:58.549> live<00:03:59.200> now<00:04:00.230> basically<00:04:00.950> what<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:01.220> means<00:04:01.400> is

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
to live now basically what it means is

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.569 
to live now basically what it means is
that<00:04:01.579> if<00:04:01.970> we<00:04:02.120> show<00:04:02.329> the<00:04:02.480> vectors<00:04:03.370> we're<00:04:04.370> going

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
that if we show the vectors we're going

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.920 
that if we show the vectors we're going
to<00:04:04.639> do<00:04:04.730> is<00:04:04.910> going<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.120> leave<00:04:05.329> them<00:04:05.569> at<00:04:05.780> the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
to do is going to leave them at the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.770 
to do is going to leave them at the
default<00:04:06.319> coordinate<00:04:06.709> system<00:04:07.040> basically<00:04:07.780> if

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
default coordinate system basically if

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.140 
default coordinate system basically if
you<00:04:08.959> change<00:04:09.169> it<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.410> track<00:04:09.880> it's<00:04:10.880> going<00:04:11.060> to

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
you change it to a track it's going to

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.569 
you change it to a track it's going to
rotate<00:04:11.389> the<00:04:11.780> put<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.169> vectors<00:04:12.680> of<00:04:12.829> the<00:04:13.430> non

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
rotate the put the vectors of the non

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.909 
rotate the put the vectors of the non
intersecting<00:04:13.819> voxels<00:04:14.419> so<00:04:15.319> that<00:04:15.500> they<00:04:15.620> point

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
intersecting voxels so that they point

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.120 
intersecting voxels so that they point
at<00:04:16.099> the<00:04:16.310> closest<00:04:16.910> spline<00:04:17.389> that<00:04:17.419> they<00:04:17.780> find

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
at the closest spline that they find

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.819 
at the closest spline that they find
this<00:04:19.130> is<00:04:19.250> good<00:04:19.400> so<00:04:19.700> if<00:04:20.539> you<00:04:20.959> have<00:04:21.169> your<00:04:21.380> your

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
this is good so if you have your your

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.050 
this is good so if you have your your
vector<00:04:22.219> field<00:04:22.250> here<00:04:22.669> and<00:04:22.820> you<00:04:22.880> have<00:04:23.030> a

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
vector field here and you have a

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.659 
vector field here and you have a
particle<00:04:23.419> emitter<00:04:23.810> here<00:04:24.190> shooting<00:04:25.190> particles

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
particle emitter here shooting particles

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:26.390 
particle emitter here shooting particles
this<00:04:25.849> direction

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
this direction

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.659 
this direction
or<00:04:27.120> any<00:04:27.870> direction<00:04:28.290> basically<00:04:28.590> they're<00:04:29.460> going

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
or any direction basically they're going

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.900 
or any direction basically they're going
to<00:04:29.729> touch<00:04:30.540> any<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.650> these<00:04:31.889> boxes<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.580> it's

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
to touch any of these boxes and it's

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.760 
to touch any of these boxes and it's
going<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.120> send<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.720> particle<00:04:34.169> stores<00:04:34.650> to

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
going to send the particle stores to

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.290 
going to send the particle stores to
spline<00:04:35.039> and<00:04:35.250> then<00:04:35.759> it's<00:04:35.910> going<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.060> start

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
spline and then it's going to start

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.890 
spline and then it's going to start
rotating<00:04:36.449> in<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.169> direction<00:04:37.470> of<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.770> spline

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
rotating in the direction of the spline

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.800 
rotating in the direction of the spline
repel<00:04:39.900> that's<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.289> opposite<00:04:40.620> thing<00:04:40.830> so<00:04:41.810> that

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
repel that's the opposite thing so that

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.480 
repel that's the opposite thing so that
would<00:04:42.960> be<00:04:43.050> good<00:04:43.199> I<00:04:43.440> guess<00:04:43.650> if<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.039> have<00:04:44.250> the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
would be good I guess if you have the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.810 
would be good I guess if you have the
the<00:04:44.970> particle<00:04:45.690> system<00:04:45.810> inside<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:47.039> vector

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
the particle system inside of the vector

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.860 
the particle system inside of the vector
field<00:04:48.139> it<00:04:49.139> would<00:04:49.320> repel<00:04:50.280> them<00:04:50.490> send<00:04:51.479> them<00:04:51.630> to

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
field it would repel them send them to

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.310 
field it would repel them send them to
the<00:04:52.110> next<00:04:52.530> spline<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:53.130> if<00:04:53.940> they<00:04:54.750> don't<00:04:55.050> follow

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
the next spline and if they don't follow

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.939 
the next spline and if they don't follow
the<00:04:55.470> spline<00:04:55.830> 100%<00:04:56.759> perfectly<00:04:57.509> they<00:04:58.410> deviate<00:04:58.919> a

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
the spline 100% perfectly they deviate a

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.320 
the spline 100% perfectly they deviate a
little<00:04:59.100> bit<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.580> they<00:04:59.669> get<00:04:59.820> into<00:05:00.060> any<00:05:00.210> of

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
little bit and they get into any of

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.920 
little bit and they get into any of
these<00:05:00.419> boxes<00:05:00.780> is<00:05:00.810> going<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.169> speed<00:05:01.350> them<00:05:01.530> out

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
these boxes is going to speed them out

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.110 
these boxes is going to speed them out
so<00:05:03.930> for<00:05:04.650> this<00:05:04.740> abstraction<00:05:05.130> lesson<00:05:05.550> let's<00:05:05.970> set

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
so for this abstraction lesson let's set

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.310 
so for this abstraction lesson let's set
them<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.389> attract<00:05:06.800> let's<00:05:07.800> set<00:05:07.979> these<00:05:08.100> to<00:05:08.280> eight

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
them to attract let's set these to eight

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.120 
them to attract let's set these to eight
and<00:05:10.320> let's<00:05:10.530> go<00:05:10.620> ahead<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:10.979> export<00:05:13.130> so

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
and let's go ahead and export so

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.960 
and let's go ahead and export so
basically<00:05:14.430> we'll<00:05:14.639> save<00:05:14.880> these<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.449> some<00:05:15.570> FGA

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.460 

oops<00:05:22.639> let's<00:05:23.639> go<00:05:23.760> back<00:05:23.910> to<00:05:24.030> unreal<00:05:24.349> so<00:05:25.349> the

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
oops let's go back to unreal so the

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.570 
oops let's go back to unreal so the
first<00:05:25.680> thing<00:05:25.830> we're<00:05:25.949> going<00:05:26.039> to<00:05:26.099> do<00:05:26.220> is<00:05:26.400> to

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
first thing we're going to do is to

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.820 
first thing we're going to do is to
import<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.389> vector<00:05:28.229> field<00:05:28.410> we<00:05:28.530> asked<00:05:28.740> to

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
import the vector field we asked to

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.719 
import the vector field we asked to
export<00:05:29.190> it<00:05:29.310> so<00:05:29.520> let's<00:05:30.240> go<00:05:30.330> ahead<00:05:30.449> and<00:05:30.690> do<00:05:30.780> that

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
export it so let's go ahead and do that

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.000 
export it so let's go ahead and do that
let's<00:05:32.729> save<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:34.020> I've<00:05:34.139> already<00:05:34.530> created<00:05:34.770> a

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
let's save and I've already created a

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.680 
let's save and I've already created a
particle<00:05:35.340> effects<00:05:35.610> for<00:05:35.729> this<00:05:35.880> video<00:05:36.300> just

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
particle effects for this video just

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.659 
particle effects for this video just
something<00:05:37.080> very<00:05:37.110> very<00:05:38.039> basic<00:05:39.169> it's<00:05:40.169> basically

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
something very very basic it's basically

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.830 
something very very basic it's basically
let<00:05:41.669> me<00:05:41.789> see<00:05:41.940> what's<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.300> access<00:05:42.570> that<00:05:42.599> we

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
let me see what's the access that we

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.550 
let me see what's the access that we
know<00:05:43.550> it's<00:05:44.550> basically<00:05:44.789> a<00:05:45.030> sphere<00:05:45.560> emitter

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
know it's basically a sphere emitter

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.820 
know it's basically a sphere emitter
just<00:05:47.070> emitting<00:05:47.430> thousands<00:05:48.300> of<00:05:48.419> GPU<00:05:49.349> particle

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
just emitting thousands of GPU particle

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.020 
just emitting thousands of GPU particle
symbol<00:05:50.220> in<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.490> positive<00:05:50.669> y-direction<00:05:53.030> so

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
symbol in the positive y-direction so

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.879 
symbol in the positive y-direction so
what<00:05:54.449> we're<00:05:54.539> going<00:05:54.630> to<00:05:54.690> do<00:05:54.810> is<00:05:55.050> right<00:05:55.440> click<00:05:55.470> go

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
what we're going to do is right click go

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.040 
what we're going to do is right click go
to<00:05:56.039> vector<00:05:56.520> field<00:05:56.760> and<00:05:57.030> I'm<00:05:57.659> going<00:05:57.810> to<00:05:57.870> create

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
to vector field and I'm going to create

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.540 
to vector field and I'm going to create
a<00:05:58.139> local<00:05:58.530> vector<00:05:58.800> field<00:05:59.099> you<00:05:59.159> can<00:05:59.340> create

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
a local vector field you can create

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.040 
a local vector field you can create
global<00:05:59.789> vector<00:06:00.090> fields<00:06:00.449> and<00:06:00.570> animate<00:06:00.840> them<00:06:00.930> in

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
global vector fields and animate them in

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.290 
global vector fields and animate them in
the<00:06:01.110> level<00:06:01.349> you<00:06:01.500> want<00:06:01.680> well<00:06:01.889> so<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:03.060> first

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
the level you want well so the first

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.300 
the level you want well so the first
thing<00:06:03.449> is<00:06:03.599> to<00:06:03.630> select<00:06:04.199> the<00:06:04.500> vector<00:06:05.070> field<00:06:05.250> on

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
thing is to select the vector field on

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.159 
thing is to select the vector field on
the<00:06:05.430> content<00:06:05.760> browser<00:06:05.849> just<00:06:06.570> like<00:06:06.780> any<00:06:06.960> other

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
the content browser just like any other

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.110 
the content browser just like any other
thing<00:06:07.349> in<00:06:07.409> unreal<00:06:07.770> let's<00:06:08.460> go<00:06:08.580> to<00:06:08.639> the<00:06:08.789> local

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
thing in unreal let's go to the local

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.570 
thing in unreal let's go to the local
vector<00:06:09.270> field<00:06:09.690> and<00:06:10.500> click<00:06:10.710> arrow<00:06:10.979> so<00:06:11.550> that

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
vector field and click arrow so that

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.570 
vector field and click arrow so that
it's<00:06:11.820> using<00:06:12.090> it<00:06:12.210> there<00:06:12.900> we<00:06:13.020> go

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
it's using it there we go

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.850 
it's using it there we go
if<00:06:14.580> we<00:06:14.940> go<00:06:15.599> ahead<00:06:15.720> and<00:06:16.139> enable<00:06:16.849> vector<00:06:17.849> fields

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
if we go ahead and enable vector fields

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.409 
if we go ahead and enable vector fields
this<00:06:19.860> is<00:06:20.010> pretty<00:06:20.250> small<00:06:20.400> let's<00:06:20.909> scale<00:06:21.150> it<00:06:21.180> up<00:06:21.330> a

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
this is pretty small let's scale it up a

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.640 
this is pretty small let's scale it up a
little<00:06:21.599> bit<00:06:21.780> first

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.320 

the<00:06:25.650> vectors<00:06:26.040> are<00:06:26.250> tiny<00:06:26.550> so<00:06:27.000> I'm<00:06:27.090> going<00:06:27.270> to

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
the vectors are tiny so I'm going to

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.880 
the vectors are tiny so I'm going to
increase<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:27.900> intensity<00:06:28.320> interested

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
increase the intensity interested

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.040 
increase the intensity interested
something<00:06:29.220> like<00:06:29.310> 50<00:06:29.610> there<00:06:29.880> you<00:06:29.970> go<00:06:30.060> so<00:06:30.960> you

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
something like 50 there you go so you

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.990 
something like 50 there you go so you
can<00:06:31.170> see<00:06:31.320> that<00:06:31.500> these<00:06:32.010> voxels<00:06:32.580> are<00:06:32.760> going<00:06:32.910> to

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
can see that these voxels are going to

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.640 
can see that these voxels are going to
send<00:06:33.210> that<00:06:33.510> the<00:06:33.840> particles<00:06:34.260> in<00:06:34.410> this

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
send that the particles in this

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.620 
send that the particles in this
direction<00:06:34.860> towards<00:06:35.730> the<00:06:35.880> spline<00:06:36.150> basically

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
direction towards the spline basically

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.460 
direction towards the spline basically
and<00:06:36.780> they're<00:06:36.900> they're<00:06:37.020> going<00:06:37.110> to<00:06:37.200> start

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
and they're they're going to start

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.630 
and they're they're going to start
rotating<00:06:37.680> and<00:06:39.260> the<00:06:40.260> same<00:06:40.410> for<00:06:40.620> this<00:06:40.770> one<00:06:40.830> with

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
rotating and the same for this one with

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.720 
rotating and the same for this one with
my<00:06:41.820> mouse<00:06:42.020> maybe<00:06:43.020> and<00:06:44.010> the<00:06:44.190> same<00:06:44.340> for<00:06:44.550> this<00:06:44.670> one

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
my mouse maybe and the same for this one

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.120 
my mouse maybe and the same for this one
basically<00:06:45.210> so<00:06:45.360> let's<00:06:45.720> see<00:06:45.870> it<00:06:45.930> in<00:06:45.990> action

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
basically so let's see it in action

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.630 
basically so let's see it in action
let's<00:06:47.130> see<00:06:47.250> stable<00:06:47.640> this<00:06:47.820> once<00:06:48.540> again<00:06:49.610> up<00:06:50.610> a

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640 
let's see stable this once again up a

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.110 
let's see stable this once again up a
little<00:06:50.880> bit<00:06:51.950> and<00:06:52.950> right<00:06:53.370> now<00:06:53.520> nothing's

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
little bit and right now nothing's

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.400 
little bit and right now nothing's
happening<00:06:54.570> that's<00:06:54.750> basically<00:06:55.200> goes<00:06:55.320> the

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.410 
happening that's basically goes the

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.980 
happening that's basically goes the
deines<00:06:55.800> it's<00:06:56.430> set<00:06:56.700> to<00:06:56.880> zero<00:06:57.180> let's<00:06:57.720> let's

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
deines it's set to zero let's let's

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.270 
deines it's set to zero let's let's
increase<00:06:58.200> it<00:06:58.260> a<00:06:58.440> little<00:06:58.590> bit<00:06:58.800> let's<00:06:59.070> set<00:06:59.160> it<00:06:59.190> to

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
increase it a little bit let's set it to

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.070 
increase it a little bit let's set it to
point<00:06:59.610> one<00:07:01.970> and<00:07:02.970> we<00:07:03.300> can<00:07:03.419> see<00:07:03.540> the<00:07:03.660> effect<00:07:03.990> that

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
point one and we can see the effect that

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.730 
point one and we can see the effect that
start<00:07:05.000> working<00:07:08.450> that's<00:07:09.450> it<00:07:09.750> I<00:07:09.960> mean<00:07:10.169> you<00:07:10.590> can

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 
start working that's it I mean you can

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.050 
start working that's it I mean you can
increase<00:07:11.010> the<00:07:11.220> tightness<00:07:11.460> if<00:07:11.790> you<00:07:11.880> want<00:07:14.060> you

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
increase the tightness if you want you

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.190 
increase the tightness if you want you
can<00:07:15.150> start<00:07:15.419> playing<00:07:15.570> with<00:07:15.780> all<00:07:16.050> the

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.200 
can start playing with all the

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.100 
can start playing with all the
parameters<00:07:16.680> add<00:07:17.220> more<00:07:17.640> modules<00:07:18.120> do<00:07:18.900> whatever

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
parameters add more modules do whatever

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:26.030 
parameters add more modules do whatever
you<00:07:19.320> want<00:07:19.580> play<00:07:20.580> with<00:07:20.760> the<00:07:20.880> shapes<00:07:24.410> yeah<00:07:25.410> your

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.040 
you want play with the shapes yeah your

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.620 
you want play with the shapes yeah your
imagination<00:07:26.610> is<00:07:26.730> your<00:07:26.760> limit<00:07:27.090> basically<00:07:27.270> from

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
imagination is your limit basically from

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.690 
imagination is your limit basically from
here<00:07:27.900> so<00:07:28.590> thank<00:07:28.830> you<00:07:28.950> very<00:07:29.100> much<00:07:29.310> for<00:07:29.550> seeing
