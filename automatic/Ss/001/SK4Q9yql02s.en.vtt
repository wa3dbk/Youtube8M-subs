that the inspection was incomplete that

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.460 
that the inspection was incomplete that
the<00:05:22.770> developer<00:05:23.460> limited<00:05:23.940> our<00:05:24.120> access<00:05:25.020> even

the building could be or could not be

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.920 
the building could be or could not be
inspected<00:05:33.690> so<00:05:34.590> it's<00:05:35.039> purely<00:05:35.789> nothing<00:05:36.660> more

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
inspected so it's purely nothing more

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.320
