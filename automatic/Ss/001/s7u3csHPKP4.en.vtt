00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
kids start from the stern looks good

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.940 
kids start from the stern looks good
looks<00:05:07.120> good<00:05:07.270> looks<00:05:07.480> good<00:05:07.840> there's<00:05:08.230> a<00:05:08.380> sniffing

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
a crack in here and I think that's

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.000 
a crack in here and I think that's
actually<00:05:10.390> leaking<00:05:10.990> too<00:05:11.200> because<00:05:11.440> mad<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.740> hatch

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
actually leaking too because mad a hatch

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.130 
actually leaking too because mad a hatch
is<00:05:12.760> actually<00:05:13.090> got<00:05:13.180> water<00:05:13.420> in<00:05:13.510> it<00:05:13.630> first<00:05:13.960> time

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
sliding on that wave and the see the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.020 
sliding on that wave and the see the
seams<00:05:21.640> come<00:05:21.910> off<00:05:22.060> there<00:05:22.860> up<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:23.920> the<00:05:24.520> bow<00:05:24.670> again

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
seams come off there up to the bow again

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.890 
seams come off there up to the bow again
and<00:05:25.290> this<00:05:26.290> is<00:05:27.030> this<00:05:28.030> is<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.390> worst<00:05:28.570> of<00:05:28.780> it
