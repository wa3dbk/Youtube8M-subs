Steve: Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect, you’ve
decided to change the Ice Bin Drive Coupling

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.780
on your refrigerator, it’s a pretty easy
job, all you’re going to need is a Philips

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.440
screw driver, let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.589
Now to change the ice bin drive coupling,
we need to remove the complete ice bin off

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:22.119
of the door, simply open the door, and there’s
a release button on the side, you simply depress

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.809
that and lift the whole assembly off, you
can close that door again.

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:34.300
We’ll set this on a suitable work surface
so that we can change this drive coupling.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.829
Now with the ice bin removed and sitting on
a nice flat surface, we can change that drive

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.179
coupling, it’s held in place by a Philips
screw, now the caution that we have to take

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:53.179
here is that all your cutter blades are inside
of here, and these stir around is up in the

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.670
bin area, if we take the screw out, with it
up side down, then that arm will fall out,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.519
and all those cutter blades will become dislodged
and it’s a real pain to them back together.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.810
So you want top make sure that you support
that arm when you remove the screw.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:24.190
I’m holding that arm, you can just tilt
that up, and drop that part out, there is

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:35.830
a small thrust washer that needs to go on
first, and you’ll note that the original

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:44.119
drive coupling might be smaller than the replacement
one, it’s a little bit beefier, again supporting

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:54.170
that arm, you want to line that up, put the
slides over the shaft, and then replace the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.100
screw.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:05.900
Make sure it’s in tight, and we are ready
to reinstall the ice bin.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.820
Now, that we’ve got the drive coupling installed,
we just need to put the ice bin back on your

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:19.250
freezer door, and you may have to line that
coupling up with the other half, I suggest

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.420
that you take the arm and give it a little
turn till it drops into place, make sure it’s

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.360
latched, and our repair is complete, that’s
just how easy it is to change the ice bin

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.220
drive coupling, on your refrigerator.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.860
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
