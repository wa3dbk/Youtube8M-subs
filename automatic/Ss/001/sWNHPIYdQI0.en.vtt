00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.990 
which is the aileron or roll axis
there's<00:01:54.390> only<00:01:54.540> 20<00:01:54.990> degrees<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> take<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
there's only 20 degrees so you take the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.330 
there's only 20 degrees so you take the
sine<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.270> 20<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.049> that's<00:01:58.439> how<00:01:58.680> much<00:01:58.829> power<00:01:59.100> you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
sine of 20 and that's how much power you

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.399 
sine of 20 and that's how much power you
want<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.759> your<00:01:59.790> ailerons

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
want on your ailerons

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.760 
want on your ailerons
and<00:02:01.820> then<00:02:02.820> similarly<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:04.079> front<00:02:04.380> arms

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and then similarly the front arms

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.540 
and then similarly the front arms
because<00:02:05.700> they're<00:02:05.820> pulled<00:02:06.090> back<00:02:06.979> they<00:02:07.979> need<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
because they're pulled back they need a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.320 
because they're pulled back they need a
little<00:02:08.940> more<00:02:09.209> power<00:02:10.140> when<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.679> comes<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
little more power when it comes to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.920 
little more power when it comes to
elevator<00:02:12.709> in<00:02:13.709> order<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.069> calculate<00:02:14.310> this

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
centerline forward is 70 degrees you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.350 
centerline forward is 70 degrees you
take<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> sine<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.900> 70<00:02:28.440> degrees<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.130> get

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
take the sine of 70 degrees and you get

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.610 
take the sine of 70 degrees and you get
0.94<00:02:30.360> or<00:02:31.110> 94<00:02:32.630> so<00:02:33.630> what<00:02:33.959> does<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.200> all<00:02:34.380> look

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
0.94 or 94 so what does this all look

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.960 
0.94 or 94 so what does this all look

rudder<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.860> throttle<00:03:02.340> adjustments<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:04.230> also

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
rudder and throttle adjustments I also

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.550 
rudder and throttle adjustments I also
noticed<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.489> arms<00:03:05.970> are<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:07.170> half

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
noticed that the arms are a half

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.740 
noticed that the arms are a half
centimeter<00:03:08.100> longer<00:03:08.700> for<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.000> front<00:03:09.239> two<00:03:09.480> in

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
centimeter longer for the front two in

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.699 
centimeter longer for the front two in
the<00:03:09.930> back<00:03:10.079> too<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:12.090> gives<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:13.170> front<00:03:13.500> two

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
the back too this gives the front two

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.430 
the back too this gives the front two
arms<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.160> little<00:03:14.579> more<00:03:14.790> command<00:03:15.480> torque

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
arms a little more command torque

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.370 
arms a little more command torque
command<00:03:16.889> when<00:03:17.250> you're<00:03:17.400> doing<00:03:17.700> yah<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.079> had

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
command when you're doing yah so I had

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.699 
command when you're doing yah so I had
to<00:03:19.560> experiment<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.400> reduce<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:22.290> amount<00:03:22.410> of

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
to experiment and reduce the amount of

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.300 
to experiment and reduce the amount of
rudder<00:03:23.389> on<00:03:24.389> motor<00:03:24.750> 1<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.290> 2<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:25.859> found<00:03:26.160> that

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
rudder on motor 1 and 2 and I found that

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.559 
rudder on motor 1 and 2 and I found that
75<00:03:27.030> minus<00:03:27.510> 75<00:03:28.079> we're<00:03:28.410> about<00:03:28.560> just<00:03:28.950> right<00:03:29.569> that

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
75 minus 75 we're about just right that

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.300 
75 minus 75 we're about just right that
also<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:31.290> noticed<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.370> tended<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.959> not

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
also I noticed that it tended to not

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.280 
also I noticed that it tended to not
correct<00:03:35.030> when<00:03:35.240> a<00:03:35.270> thinner<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.840> stick<00:03:36.110> is

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
correct when a thinner the stick is

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.690 
correct when a thinner the stick is
quickly<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:37.580> I<00:03:37.610> had<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.300> bump<00:03:38.480> up<00:03:38.690> my<00:03:39.670> yuppie<00:03:40.670> I

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
quickly so I had to bump up my yuppie I

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.780 
quickly so I had to bump up my yuppie I
gained<00:03:41.240> way<00:03:42.140> beyond<00:03:42.410> what<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:42.709> usually<00:03:43.340> run<00:03:43.550> at

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
gained way beyond what I usually run at

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.210 
gained way beyond what I usually run at
I<00:03:44.060> usually<00:03:44.540> run<00:03:44.720> that<00:03:44.990> at<00:03:46.270> 45<00:03:47.270> or<00:03:47.360> 50<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:48.260> bought

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
I usually run that at 45 or 50 I bought

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.850 
I usually run that at 45 or 50 I bought
my<00:03:49.370> I<00:03:49.400> gained<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.819> 60<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.410> seemed<00:03:51.739> to

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
my I gained a 60 and that seemed to

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.390 
my I gained a 60 and that seemed to
bottle<00:03:52.550> it<00:03:52.610> down<00:03:52.850> quite<00:03:53.330> a<00:03:53.390> bit<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:55.370> last

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
bottle it down quite a bit the last

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.920 
bottle it down quite a bit the last
change<00:03:55.819> I<00:03:55.910> want<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.150> talk<00:03:56.300> about<00:03:56.480> is<00:03:56.900> a

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
change I want to talk about is a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.710 
change I want to talk about is a
throttle<00:03:57.380> adjustment<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:58.239> know<00:03:59.239> that<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.540> dead

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
throttle adjustment I know that the dead

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.500 
throttle adjustment I know that the dead
cat<00:03:59.959> wants<00:04:00.319> to<00:04:00.440> pitch<00:04:00.739> forward<00:04:01.580> if<00:04:02.300> you

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
cat wants to pitch forward if you

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.559 
cat wants to pitch forward if you
accelerate<00:04:02.930> quickly<00:04:04.000> that's<00:04:05.000> because<00:04:05.420> the

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
accelerate quickly that's because the

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.400 
accelerate quickly that's because the
rear<00:04:05.810> two<00:04:06.080> motors<00:04:06.500> are<00:04:06.920> angled<00:04:07.730> back<00:04:08.410> more

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
rear two motors are angled back more

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.259 
rear two motors are angled back more
than<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.800> front<00:04:09.980> two<00:04:10.220> because<00:04:10.519> we<00:04:10.640> come<00:04:11.150> back

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
than the front two because we come back

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.380 
than the front two because we come back
at<00:04:11.450> 70<00:04:11.780> degrees<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.290> slowly<00:04:12.470> degrees<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:14.180> when

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
at 70 degrees and slowly degrees so when

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.300 
at 70 degrees and slowly degrees so when
you<00:04:14.480> accelerate<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:15.110> whole<00:04:15.260> quad<00:04:15.500> pitches

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
you accelerate the whole quad pitches

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.630 
you accelerate the whole quad pitches
forward<00:04:16.790> so<00:04:17.090> just<00:04:17.540> need<00:04:17.660> reduce<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:19.040> throttle

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
forward so just need reduce the throttle

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.120 
forward so just need reduce the throttle
mixing<00:04:20.390> on<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.200> rear<00:04:21.320> two<00:04:21.590> motors<00:04:21.919> and<00:04:22.070> I

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
mixing on the rear two motors and I

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.760 
mixing on the rear two motors and I
found<00:04:22.400> that<00:04:22.580> 87<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.360> 87<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:23.990> both<00:04:24.320> motors

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
found that 87 and 87 on both motors

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.240 
found that 87 and 87 on both motors
three<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.310> four<00:04:26.169> was<00:04:27.169> just<00:04:27.530> right<00:04:27.770> for<00:04:28.040> the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
three and four was just right for the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.750 
three and four was just right for the
dead<00:04:28.430> cap<00:04:28.990> now<00:04:29.990> I<00:04:30.410> think<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.919> dead<00:04:31.460> calf

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
dead cap now I think that dead calf

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.570 
dead cap now I think that dead calf
would<00:04:32.150> these<00:04:32.300> adjustments<00:04:33.050> wise<00:04:33.400> just<00:04:34.400> as

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
would these adjustments wise just as

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.850 
would these adjustments wise just as
good<00:04:34.850> as<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.810> standard<00:04:36.410> x<00:04:36.590> sk<00:04:37.280> 450
