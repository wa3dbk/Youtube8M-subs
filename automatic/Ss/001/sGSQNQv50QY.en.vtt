discrepancies definitely fruits and
vegetables<00:00:23.910> are<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.600> healthiest<00:00:25.019> thing<00:00:25.199> on

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
vegetables are the healthiest thing on

vegetables are the healthiest thing on
the<00:00:25.500> planet<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.070> don't<00:00:26.340> think<00:00:26.599> anyone<00:00:27.599> can

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the planet I don't think anyone can

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
disagree with that like like even if

and things like diabetes were they

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.920 
and things like diabetes were they
telling<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:55.160> their<00:00:56.160> okay<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.120> here's<00:00:57.870> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
thing with diabetes their approach is to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.130 
thing with diabetes their approach is to
manage<00:01:00.449> carbs<00:01:01.100> manage<00:01:02.100> calories<00:01:02.840> also<00:01:03.840> wait

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
manage carbs manage calories also wait

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.170 
manage carbs manage calories also wait
right<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:04.710> telling<00:01:05.670> people<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> lose

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
right there telling people to lose

right there telling people to lose
weight<00:01:06.420> which<00:01:06.630> obviously<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.740> right<00:01:08.460> but

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
weight which obviously is right but

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.039 
weight which obviously is right but
they're<00:01:08.850> telling<00:01:09.119> them<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> manage<00:01:09.510> carbs

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
they're telling them to manage carbs

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.530 
they're telling them to manage carbs
manage<00:01:10.350> calories<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.850> look<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.180> dr.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
manage calories if you look at dr.

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
diet which doesn't make much sense

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.530 
diet which doesn't make much sense
according<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.820> nutrition<00:01:23.820> advice<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
according to the nutrition advice that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.770 
according to the nutrition advice that
they're<00:01:24.720> given<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.080> schools<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.780> what

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
they're given to schools right so what

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.920 
they're given to schools right so what
happens<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.350> when<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.369> cell<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.930> surrounded

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
happens is when the cell is surrounded

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.050 
happens is when the cell is surrounded
by<00:01:31.049> lots<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.439> fat<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.950> insulin<00:01:32.310> receptors<00:01:32.820> get

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
by lots of fat the insulin receptors get

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.780 
by lots of fat the insulin receptors get
covered<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.540> fat<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.829> glucose<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.549> move

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
covered in fat and the glucose can move

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.929 
covered in fat and the glucose can move
into<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.360> cell<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.540> know<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.900> really

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
into the cell and so you know it really

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.219 
into the cell and so you know it really
you<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.060> bothers<00:01:42.479> my<00:01:42.659> mind<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.079> they're

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
you know bothers my mind that they're

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.980 
you know bothers my mind that they're
trying<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.680> treat<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.670> symptoms<00:01:45.119> here<00:01:45.420> but

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
trying to treat the symptoms here but

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.499 
trying to treat the symptoms here but
not<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.320> causes<00:01:46.860> cuz<00:01:47.250> yeah<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.210> you're<00:01:48.390> going

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
not the causes cuz yeah if you're going

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.690 
not the causes cuz yeah if you're going
to<00:01:48.570> decrease<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.200> sugar<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:50.430> you're<00:01:50.610> not

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
to decrease your sugar like you're not

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.580 
to decrease your sugar like you're not
going<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.149> high<00:01:51.420> blood<00:01:51.659> sugar<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.470> know

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
going to have high blood sugar you know

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.039 
going to have high blood sugar you know
or<00:01:52.920> whatever<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.360> doesn't<00:01:54.689> take<00:01:54.810> care

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
or whatever but that doesn't take care

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.630 
or whatever but that doesn't take care
of<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> problem<00:01:55.649> you're<00:01:55.920> still<00:01:56.310> not<00:01:56.340> getting

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
of the problem you're still not getting

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.209 
of the problem you're still not getting
sugar<00:01:57.000> into<00:01:57.390> into<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.200> cell<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.890> you're<00:01:59.100> not

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
sugar into into the cell like you're not

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.410 
sugar into into the cell like you're not
going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> function<00:01:59.820> you're<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.329> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
going to function you're not going to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.660 
going to function you're not going to
reverse<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.869> diabetes<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:02.460> because

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
reverse that diabetes just because

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.480 
reverse that diabetes just because
there's<00:02:02.820> no<00:02:02.939> sugar<00:02:03.329> right<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:04.680> little<00:02:05.340> things

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
there's no sugar right so little things

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.859 
there's no sugar right so little things
like<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:08.789> another<00:02:09.270> thing<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:09.629> say<00:02:09.840> is

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
like that the another thing they say is
