 and the friendliest is the room 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.940
 nordman yana the nordmann 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.550
 why was he so successful 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.840
 because he keeps his needles 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.939
 long after christmas 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.570
 if you are looking for perfume there is a 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.760
 solution here is a fragrant fir is the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.560
 traditional spruce christmas tree 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.190
 it is stocky it is provided it is launched 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.020
 easy to decorate and it smells good another 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.059
 the nobilis room then brings him together 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.670
 almost all the qualities it is 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.829
 Nordmann as balanced as stocky 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.030
 well- supplied needles that they keep 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.149
 well after christmas 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.050
 and then to slight fragrance still want 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.590
 more perfume ok okay let's go 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.190
 still a little new 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.880
 the room grow with a perfume 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.040
 of citrus a very compact port and then 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.270
 relatively large needles easy 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.010
 to hang the balls on the hour 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.960
 there it is less common it is less 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.509
 known to surprise us even the father 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.460
 christmas when you finally chose the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.520
 variety remain to be taken 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.650
 the most beautiful fir of the lot first 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.530
 choose according to your place not 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.140
 the moment to take a fir too 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.110
 then choose a well balanced tree 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.630
 higher than broad some fir trees have 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.880
 tend to be very broad at the base and 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.810
 then the arrow is important 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.570
 the arrow must be well right 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.720
 balanced the crowns must be 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.630
 well distributed the between do not know the space 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.420
 between each crown must be well 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.549
 regular when you choose your 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.579
 fir it can be cut at the base 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.020
 or in older pot or show 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.630
 here is the fir in pack 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.770

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.840
 all its roots 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.000
 obviously he holds a lot more 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.710
