00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
moved into the correct place we can add

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.580 
moved into the correct place we can add
it<00:03:53.659> by<00:03:53.810> doing<00:03:53.870> BP<00:03:54.439> add<00:03:54.699> floor<00:03:56.319> YouTube<00:03:57.319> and

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
look in the config to make sure it's

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
that I can't actually do at the same

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.930 
that I can't actually do at the same
time<00:04:57.139> just<00:04:57.470> quite<00:04:57.620> annoying

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
time just quite annoying

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.290 
time just quite annoying
so<00:04:58.940> let<00:04:59.870> me<00:04:59.990> just<00:05:00.259> try<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.849> survive<00:05:01.849> both

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
so let me just try and survive both

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.950 
so let me just try and survive both
rounds<00:05:03.280> game<00:05:04.280> starts<00:05:04.699> soon<00:05:04.909> you<00:05:05.090> can<00:05:05.210> see<00:05:05.389> that

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
rounds game starts soon you can see that

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.700 
rounds game starts soon you can see that
the<00:05:06.139> bar<00:05:06.349> API<00:05:06.770> plug-in<00:05:07.400> working<00:05:07.849> there<00:05:08.710> and

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
the bar API plug-in working there and

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.140 
the bar API plug-in working there and
you<00:05:09.830> might<00:05:09.979> be<00:05:10.130> able<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.400> hear<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:10.880> note

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
you might be able to hear the note

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.999 
you might be able to hear the note
blocks<00:05:11.750> API<00:05:12.169> I<00:05:12.229> don't<00:05:12.500> know<00:05:12.560> whether<00:05:12.740> I've<00:05:12.860> got

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
blocks API I don't know whether I've got

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.350 
blocks API I don't know whether I've got
sounds<00:05:13.370> on<00:05:13.870> possibly<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:15.560> yeah<00:05:16.310> pretty<00:05:17.120> cool

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
sounds on possibly so yeah pretty cool

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.119 
sounds on possibly so yeah pretty cool
plugin<00:05:18.400> we're<00:05:19.400> going<00:05:19.520> to<00:05:19.580> be<00:05:19.639> teleported<00:05:20.000> here

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
plugin we're going to be teleported here

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.080 
plugin we're going to be teleported here
see<00:05:22.129> what<00:05:22.569> it's<00:05:23.569> a<00:05:23.659> bit<00:05:23.840> confusing<00:05:24.349> and<00:05:25.090> yellow

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
see what it's a bit confusing and yellow

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.540 
see what it's a bit confusing and yellow
yellow<00:05:26.270> yellow<00:05:26.469> quick<00:05:27.469> quick<00:05:27.919> quick<00:05:28.190> quick

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
yellow yellow quick quick quick quick

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.029 
yellow yellow quick quick quick quick
yellow<00:05:29.319> so<00:05:30.319> I<00:05:30.349> think<00:05:30.469> we're<00:05:30.710> both<00:05:30.860> on<00:05:31.009> the

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
yellow so I think we're both on the

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.430 
yellow so I think we're both on the
yellow<00:05:31.310> now<00:05:31.460> so<00:05:32.090> falling<00:05:32.630> blocks<00:05:32.870> very<00:05:33.229> very

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
yellow now so falling blocks very very

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.920 
yellow now so falling blocks very very
nice<00:05:33.590> looks<00:05:34.520> awesome<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.180> we<00:05:35.330> both<00:05:35.509> survived

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
nice looks awesome and we both survived

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.249 
nice looks awesome and we both survived
that<00:05:36.169> and<00:05:36.650> then<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:37.400> will<00:05:37.580> regenerate<00:05:38.029> like<00:05:38.690> so

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.620 

light<00:05:42.259> blue<00:05:42.590> so<00:05:43.009> like<00:05:43.340> two<00:05:43.460> blue<00:05:43.699> there<00:05:44.360> we<00:05:44.449> go

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
light blue so like two blue there we go

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.839 
light blue so like two blue there we go
on<00:05:44.900> on<00:05:45.050> light<00:05:45.229> blue<00:05:45.440> and<00:05:45.710> little<00:05:46.130> bark<00:05:46.400> a<00:05:46.639> is

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
on on light blue and little bark a is

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.600 
on on light blue and little bark a is
unlikely<00:05:47.449> as<00:05:47.750> well<00:05:47.930> there<00:05:48.650> we<00:05:48.740> go<00:05:48.770> so<00:05:49.340> we<00:05:49.430> both

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
unlikely as well there we go so we both

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.080 
unlikely as well there we go so we both
survived

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
survived

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:56.499 
survived
yay<00:05:50.979> which<00:05:51.979> is<00:05:52.130> good<00:05:53.770> so<00:05:54.789> this<00:05:55.789> is<00:05:56.090> one<00:05:56.360> the

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
yay which is good so this is one the

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:58.180 
yay which is good so this is one the
other<00:05:56.630> floors<00:05:56.930> as<00:05:57.139> I<00:05:57.169> was<00:05:57.710> showing<00:05:57.979> you

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
other floors as I was showing you

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.409 
other floors as I was showing you
because<00:05:58.400> you<00:05:58.639> can<00:05:58.759> add<00:05:58.849> as<00:05:58.940> many<00:05:59.120> as<00:05:59.240> you<00:05:59.330> want

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
because you can add as many as you want
