larger<00:02:26.400> fan<00:02:26.700> base<00:02:26.730> for<00:02:27.209> people<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:27.840> a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
larger fan base for people that like a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.260 
larger fan base for people that like a

here<00:04:43.320> did<00:04:43.440> an<00:04:43.560> amazing<00:04:43.860> job<00:04:44.100> with<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.520> that<00:04:45.270> I

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
here did an amazing job with that that I

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.080 
here did an amazing job with that that I
wouldn't<00:04:46.860> say<00:04:46.979> it<00:04:47.040> like<00:04:47.190> fooled<00:04:47.790> everybody
