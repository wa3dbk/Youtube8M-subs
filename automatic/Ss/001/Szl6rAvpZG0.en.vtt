okay now here's a walkthrough of our

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.919 
okay now here's a walkthrough of our
display<00:00:06.089> we're<00:00:06.690> gonna<00:00:06.779> start<00:00:07.200> off<00:00:07.379> with

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
display we're gonna start off with

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:17.990 
display we're gonna start off with
electric<00:00:12.080> those<00:00:13.219> are<00:00:15.049> GFCI<00:00:16.340> this<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> 20<00:00:17.880> amp

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
electric those are GFCI this is a 20 amp

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.439 
electric those are GFCI this is a 20 amp
circuit<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.869> 20<00:00:19.230> amp<00:00:19.380> circuit<00:00:20.270> 20<00:00:21.270> amp

20<00:00:22.199> amp<00:00:23.090> and<00:00:24.090> these<00:00:24.240> little<00:00:24.420> boxes<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:26.039> we

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
20 amp and these little boxes I think we

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.859 
20 amp and these little boxes I think we
have<00:00:27.320> chase<00:00:28.320> maybe<00:00:28.529> 12<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.099> these<00:00:29.220> boxes<00:00:29.869> all

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
have chase maybe 12 of these boxes all

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.120 
have chase maybe 12 of these boxes all
over<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> house<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:34.290> kind<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.559> stuff<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.980> do

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
over the house the kind of stuff you do

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.590 
over the house the kind of stuff you do
during<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.579> time<00:00:35.820> we're<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.360> warm

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
during this time we're going it's warm

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.670 
during this time we're going it's warm
out<00:00:36.870> there's<00:00:37.680> more<00:00:37.890> they're<00:00:38.160> more<00:00:39.050> their

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.010 

frontal<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.800> back<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:47.480> use<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> power

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
frontal it back and use all the power

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.209 
frontal it back and use all the power
for<00:00:49.440> controllers<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:51.360> light<00:00:51.629> around

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.299 

so<00:00:55.370> controller<00:00:57.789> open<00:00:58.789> it<00:00:58.879> up<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.010> each<00:01:01.010> one<00:01:01.250> of

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
so controller open it up and each one of

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.510 
so controller open it up and each one of
these<00:01:01.489> wires<00:01:02.500> onto<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.710> plug<00:01:04.630> and<00:01:05.630> each<00:01:05.810> plug

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
these wires onto a plug and each plug

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:23.469 
these wires onto a plug and each plug
goes<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:20.560> computer<00:01:21.560> in<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.799> house<00:01:22.479> tops

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
goes to the computer in the house tops

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.749 
goes to the computer in the house tops
to<00:01:23.720> everything<00:01:24.880> through<00:01:25.880> cat<00:01:26.869> 3<00:01:27.440> cable<00:01:27.759> it's

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
to everything through cat 3 cable it's

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.910 
to everything through cat 3 cable it's
plugged<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:29.300> now<00:01:30.259> all<00:01:30.380> you're<00:01:30.530> doing<00:01:30.800> is

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
plugged in now all you're doing is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.350 
plugged in now all you're doing is
you're<00:01:31.009> taking<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.580> signal<00:01:31.909> from<00:01:32.179> inside

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
you're taking the signal from inside

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.760 
you're taking the signal from inside
going<00:01:32.990> in<00:01:33.229> here

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
going in here

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.859 
going in here
then<00:01:34.429> it<00:01:34.550> comes<00:01:34.759> out<00:01:34.970> here<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.330> it<00:01:35.479> goes<00:01:35.659> to

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
then it comes out here and it goes to

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.620 
then it comes out here and it goes to
another<00:01:36.170> controller<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:38.119> then<00:01:38.240> we<00:01:38.330> come<00:01:38.479> in

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
another controller so then we come in

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.010 
another controller so then we come in
from<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.960> other<00:01:39.080> controller<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:40.659> you<00:01:41.659> go<00:01:41.810> out

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
from the other controller and you go out

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.040 
from the other controller and you go out
to<00:01:42.050> and<00:01:42.409> more<00:01:42.590> controllers<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.899> they're<00:01:44.899> our

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
to and more controllers and they're our

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.219 
to and more controllers and they're our
controllers<00:01:45.679> just<00:01:46.220> about<00:01:46.460> everywhere

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
controllers just about everywhere

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.249 
controllers just about everywhere
because<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.590> need<00:01:49.750> lots<00:01:50.750> of<00:01:50.899> things<00:01:51.110> to

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
because you need lots of things to

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.330 
because you need lots of things to
control<00:01:51.500> lots<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.860> lights<00:01:54.909> this<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:56.119> how<00:01:56.299> I

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
control lots of lights this is how I

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.600 
control lots of lights this is how I
keep<00:01:58.340> all<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.729> leather<00:01:58.940> out<00:01:59.179> of<00:01:59.330> my<00:01:59.770> axes<00:02:00.800> it's

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
keep all the leather out of my axes it's

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.930 
keep all the leather out of my axes it's
another<00:02:01.879> box<00:02:02.209> that<00:02:03.280> controls<00:02:04.280> part<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.849> the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
another box that controls part of the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.369 
another box that controls part of the
arches<00:02:05.390> there's<00:02:05.810> another<00:02:06.080> box<00:02:06.440> there<00:02:07.399> that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
arches there's another box there that

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.390 
arches there's another box there that
controls<00:02:09.379> more<00:02:09.739> of<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.979> arches

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.470 

and<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.240> get<00:02:14.420> more<00:02:15.430> faxes<00:02:16.430> control<00:02:17.150> more

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
and you get more faxes control more

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.850 
and you get more faxes control more
arches<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:19.190> more<00:02:20.030> boxes<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.840> go<00:02:21.110> more<00:02:21.380> arches

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.550 

more<00:02:24.860> boxes<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.400> control<00:02:25.940> more<00:02:26.180> arches<00:02:29.560> then

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
more boxes to control more arches then

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.460 
more boxes to control more arches then
we<00:02:30.740> have

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470
