00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:10.849
 good let's betray the filtering system 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:17.390
 already working at 40 in 360 liters I did 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:28.550
 a capture through the external flu and 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:28.550
 in there that ends there for the band 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:26.900
 main 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:26.900
 the other two are the largest of the water 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:40.579
 because making too much noise 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:59.630
 The solution was to put a record that I 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:59.630
 I'll show you and I put a good soldier 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.710
 raise the water level 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.490
 in the flu causing the swirl 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.490
 I disappeared 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.410
 we see 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:24.380
 is part of the return water collection 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.050
 best movie with bass 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:33.670
 This is the pump-filtered cachaÃ§a. 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:38.920
 of repression and there the record 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:45.099
 their labor coroner Eddy is 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:48.099
 formed that where it was once day had 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:52.830
 a lot of water there is no reason 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:56.860
 big then close a little record 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:01.090
 and then only some balls for dumplings 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.400
 the auxiliary orange 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.269
 This is it, everyone, any question is only 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.269
 to post there that we try to explain 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.260
 better and who knows how to solve a 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.260
 problem and thanks
