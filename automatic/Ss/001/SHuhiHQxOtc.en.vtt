00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
week for a patent that seems to be a

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
it falls to the ground so the patent

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.230 
it falls to the ground so the patent
calls<00:02:40.260> for<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> motor<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.160> devices<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.880> sense

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
calls for a motor and devices that sense

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.690 
calls for a motor and devices that sense
a<00:02:42.420> fall<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.050> then<00:02:43.170> rotates<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.980> phone<00:02:44.340> to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
a fall and then rotates the phone to

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.820 
a fall and then rotates the phone to
impact<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.330> less<00:02:45.540> vulnerable<00:02:45.900> area<00:02:46.620> of

impact in a less vulnerable area of
course<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.550> may<00:02:47.670> never<00:02:47.970> see<00:02:48.420> actual

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
course it may never see actual

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.770 
course it may never see actual
real-world<00:02:49.740> use<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.030> think<00:02:51.270> it's<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.600> lot

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
real-world use but I think it's a lot

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.780 
real-world use but I think it's a lot
better<00:02:51.930> than<00:02:52.260> tying<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.710> cat<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.280> your<00:02:53.400> iPhone

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
better than tying a cat to your iPhone
