00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 a thing is said to us very often 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.609
 we test far too few compact cameras 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.080
 So we just make time again 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.980
 review of a compact camera not 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.400
 any but the panasonic tz 41 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.949
 or xt z 41 of course an 18 megapixel 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.660
 compact camera relatively much as I think 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.140
 but she is not supposed to be qualitative 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.910
 so be so bad look in 18 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.350
 megapixel the open relatively small 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.090
 sensor that usually provides for 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.890
 relatively like picture noise does here 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.300
 actually but synonymous panasonic had 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.040
 very strong falls over 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.559
 Accordingly, you actually see it 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.180
 not so strong even iso 800 disadvantage 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.860
 turn on the other side of the picture 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.050
 is relatively soft even at iso 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.809
 100 you realize that at least from iso 400 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.550
 800 but it is also very disappointed 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.960
 that you lose very much details 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.640
 So textures and stuff not more 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.710
 I can actually recognize it well 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.300
 a fan of it lets him have one more 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.379
 a little more image noise last it 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.730
 but just a little bit 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.020
 to be keener as well as the Nikon 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.910
 makes an example with the new cameras 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.289
 then the picture is felt 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.520
 still sharper and of that 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.320
 Picture noise quite honestly if you do that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.969
 on the big a3 poster expression or 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.530
 has on the tv brings the ocean 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.299
 look at the end anyway not dynamic range 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.860
 Other thing is actually quite good at 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.240
 the camera iso 400 is on everyone 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.760
 case after that it stops 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.590
 compact camera typically relatively strong 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.090
 picture sharpness is just through the end 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.600
 Do not always sound the same as you do 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.250
 would like 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.810
 but otherwise in the telebereich finds 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.670
 actually pretty good falls to the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.290
 image margins are relatively strong 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.970
 accordingly picture qualitatively 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.909
 actually on a very good level 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.619
 picture sharpness is relatively soft but just 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.170
 I think for the price you 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 currently very bad in the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.409
 area equipment and packs on the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.119
 pretty much everything you put into it 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.590
 can imagine nfc that is live 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.540
 communication the devices can do so 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.369
 simply communicating with each other 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.259
 For example, they swap each other's data 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.399
 or similar are so direct 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.920
 connected with each other 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.530
 wifi already mentioned next topic 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.460
 that means you can be relatively easy too 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.079
 your pictures for example on the nas 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.970
 devices play directly on facebook 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.710
 upload or via app the camera 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.250
 Remote control is currently available for android 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.560
 and ios 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.060
 cool thing as I at least think then 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.439
 still a really big highlight 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.689
 my personal view of the people 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.040
 want to use it as a travel camera gps and 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.509
 glonass in there that means two 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.220
 different navigation systems 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.500
 the camera automatically saves eg 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.629
 stands with it so is just here for 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.210
 example still displayed berlin super tps 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.190
 receive 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.900
 built-in compass with straight to the bottom 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.060
 example here northwest is now 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.830
 that means you have so to speak 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.270
 as geoinformation once where I stand 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.830
 and in which direction I look no 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.660
 So everything you want 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.950
 can 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.610
 that draws the colors but also a whole 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.610
 discreet gates 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.960
 It is a really nice brick 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.180
 touch asstel not in the area 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.380
 series economy at least 41 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.180
 ten pictures per second in full 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.860
 Resolution up to 60 images per second 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.840
 a reduced resolution with just under 2 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.120
 I still find megapixel very much 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.710
 good of compact camera area qualitatively 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.260
 There are no smears forest 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.340
 christin pictures in full resolution 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.380
 unfortunately you can only in jpeg format 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.640
 I do not take pictures of raw data 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.200
 wished me and just now already 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.490
 mentioned story with the image noise 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.020
 adjust it a bit manually 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.610
 You can not do anything well 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.560
 but still a real highlight of the 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.240
 film mode picture with up to 60 pictures 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.920
 per second in full hd movie with 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.450
 Image stabilizer and continuous 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.980
 autofocus so understood everything 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.180
 I think you can 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.920
 so now definitely a 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.240
 good camcorder is on the journey 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.170
 yes relatively compact could hold well and 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.760
 as I said the image stabilizer 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.080
 works and he is still working 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.940
 really very nice and quiet 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.900
 so if you could use it with filmwelt 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.100
 do any case with it and the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.080
 let camcorder at home 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.050
 then we come to the conclusion 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.190
 the review for tz 41 from panasonic was 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.140
 you can say so roughly about the camera 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.180
 yes, I do not really think so 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.580
 bad times for the price of just under 320 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.120
 euro costs it currently but there are 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.610
 also some very interesting ones 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.470
 alternatives in the price range once 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.270
 for example the canon powershot s100 10 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.680
 is a bit more compact than that 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.600
 camera even offers one more 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.550
 a bit more picture quality especially in 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.320
 higher iso ranges so little 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.740
 Then we would have it on us 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.510
 the p7100 tested is a whole lot to give 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.860
 piece bigger than the camera offers but 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.690
 much more manual 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.020
 Adjustments and also in the 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.150
 mode and last but not least the p300 30 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.380
 tell the successor of petra 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.210
 we have already tested that 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.980
 is just about the size in about 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.960
 But it also offers something like that 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.480
 a bit more picture quality and one 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.350
 three cameras mentioned that you have 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.240
 they are all still a little bit 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.550
 cheaper so about 20 30 euro 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.960
 the camera here panasonic title to 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.330
 40 has just stuff in things 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.410
 really the nose far ahead already 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.460
 called nfc wifi gps glonass and and and 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.080
 david you really much in the field 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.320
 Image quality can be different for example 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.520
 can 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.350
 the better even if they are more compact 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.030
 or have your options 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.320
 Accordingly, just looks good 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.460
 focus on that finds all 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.080
 mentioned it came here again in 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.580
 the video description links in the 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.430
 Sins will be chosen by the next video 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.300
 we are looking at each other and thus just 1 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.120
 232 size 1 1 was there again 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.730
 I say I reached the small sensor 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.470
 18 megapixels of that running on it 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.570
 18 megapixel and that too a relative 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.870
 small sensor should and actually 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.210
 much he has to image noise woods the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.050
 theme cheep cheep cheep gives you youtube 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.050
