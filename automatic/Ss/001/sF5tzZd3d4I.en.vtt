you<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.819> because<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.330> opening<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.959> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you have to do because the opening on a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.139 
you have to do because the opening on a
body<00:02:07.319> on<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> bakelite<00:02:07.950> neck<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.580> different<00:02:09.030> on

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
body on a bakelite neck is different on

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.809 
body on a bakelite neck is different on
a<00:02:09.179> regular<00:02:09.660> national<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.979> was<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.400> hole<00:02:11.610> at

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
a regular national it was just a hole at

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.070 
a regular national it was just a hole at
the<00:02:11.849> top<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:13.140> top<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:14.420> body<00:02:15.420> itself<00:02:15.870> here

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
the top the top of the body itself here

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.320 
the top the top of the body itself here
that<00:02:16.230> allows<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.440> stick<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.010> go<00:02:17.160> through<00:02:17.489> and

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
that allows a stick to go through and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.180 
that allows a stick to go through and
they<00:02:18.599> bake<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:19.110> there's<00:02:19.440> actually<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.980> hole

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
they bake like there's actually the hole

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.830 
they bake like there's actually the hole
goes<00:02:20.400> all<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.640> way<00:02:20.819> down<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.209> front<00:02:21.510> about

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
goes all the way down the front about

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.900 
goes all the way down the front about
down<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.170> here<00:02:22.349> so<00:02:22.890> there's<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.130> slap<00:02:23.520> that's

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
down to here so there's a slap that's

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.360 
down to here so there's a slap that's
wide<00:02:24.239> open<00:02:24.290> all<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.410> way<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.250> then

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
wide open all the way up here and then

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.280 
wide open all the way up here and then
it<00:02:26.459> works<00:02:26.640> its<00:02:26.849> way<00:02:26.970> back<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.110> top

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
it works its way back to the on the top

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.210 
it works its way back to the on the top
there<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:29.550> needs<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.849> different<00:02:30.000> setup<00:02:31.220> if

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
there so it needs a different setup if

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.839 
there so it needs a different setup if
you're<00:02:32.400> gonna<00:02:32.550> use<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.880> original<00:02:33.830> parts

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
you're gonna use the original parts

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.260 
you're gonna use the original parts

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
that used on these older guitars and

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.210 
that used on these older guitars and
this<00:04:02.870> is<00:04:02.990> a<00:04:03.020> very<00:04:03.260> early<00:04:03.470> one<00:04:03.770> this<00:04:03.920> is<00:04:04.070> one<00:04:04.190> of

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
this is a very early one this is one of

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.740 
this is a very early one this is one of
the<00:04:04.370> earliest<00:04:04.610> try<00:04:04.910> aliens<00:04:05.360> with<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.540> bakelite

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
the earliest try aliens with a bakelite

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.880 
the earliest try aliens with a bakelite
neck<00:04:06.230> take<00:04:06.800> light<00:04:07.670> neck<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.530> would<00:04:12.830> have

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
neck take light neck and so I would have

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.350 
neck take light neck and so I would have
expected<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.520> be<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.610> little<00:04:13.820> thinner<00:04:14.120> but

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
expected it to be a little thinner but

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.150 
expected it to be a little thinner but
this<00:04:14.480> is<00:04:14.630> actually<00:04:14.780> beefy<00:04:15.380> it's<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.709> point<00:04:16.040> go

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
this is actually beefy it's a point go

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.610 
this is actually beefy it's a point go
3-2<00:04:16.900> thickness<00:04:17.900> on<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.410> body<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:18.980> it's<00:04:20.620> much

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
3-2 thickness on the body so it's much

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.760 
3-2 thickness on the body so it's much
thicker<00:04:21.890> than<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.160> typical<00:04:22.400> duolan

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
thicker than a typical duolan
