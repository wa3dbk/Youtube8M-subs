00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
environment all-in-one which is a high

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.780 
environment all-in-one which is a high
priority<00:00:58.550> for<00:00:59.000> us<00:00:59.900> not<00:01:00.260> just<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.790> secular

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
priority for us not just the secular

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.270 
priority for us not just the secular
education<00:01:02.360> but<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.350> spiritual<00:01:03.770> environment

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
education but the spiritual environment

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.460 
education but the spiritual environment
as<00:01:04.339> well<00:01:04.519> we've<00:01:05.479> recommended<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.080> school<00:01:06.350> to

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
as well we've recommended the school to

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.770 
as well we've recommended the school to
a<00:01:06.530> lot<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:06.830> people<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.880> would<00:01:08.090> continue<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.660> do

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
a lot of people and would continue to do

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.060 
a lot of people and would continue to do
so<00:01:08.990> I<00:01:09.020> think<00:01:09.290> it's<00:01:09.470> something<00:01:09.650> ought<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.010> be

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
so I think it's something ought to be

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.370 
so I think it's something ought to be
prayerfully<00:01:10.550> consider<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.360> it's<00:01:12.170> something

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
prayerfully consider and it's something

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.830 
prayerfully consider and it's something
that<00:01:12.560> would<00:01:12.830> be<00:01:13.000> not<00:01:14.000> only<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.420> parents

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
that would be not only the parents

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.230 
that would be not only the parents
interest<00:01:15.410> but<00:01:16.070> in<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.369> child's<00:01:16.850> well-being

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
interest but in the child's well-being

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.670 
interest but in the child's well-being
his<00:01:17.630> way<00:01:17.810> on<00:01:17.960> their<00:01:18.110> overall<00:01:18.820> will<00:01:19.820> be

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
his way on their overall will be

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.320 
his way on their overall will be
educationally<00:01:21.680> spiritually<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.790> socially<00:01:23.030> I

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
educationally spiritually and socially I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:51.990 
educationally spiritually and socially I
think<00:01:23.630> it's<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:24.320> winner

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770

environment that offered a Christian

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.000 
environment that offered a Christian
education<00:01:56.140> when<00:01:57.140> more<00:01:57.290> Christian<00:01:57.560> school<00:01:57.800> is
