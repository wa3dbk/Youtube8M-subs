00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 so look at the king's less secret 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:10.860
 service review but we start with one 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:13.170
 he stable so you go to the movies 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.670
 your natural selfie stick bill service 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.980
 three via twitter or instagram 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.330
 facebook and who knows comes in one of the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.980
 houses of the film audience rightly because 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.350
 I think that is because some fresh herbs 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.650
 but today it is all mine to do 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.529
 the film king my secret service the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.240
 50 directed films were actually through 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.579
 with your van that you might also know 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.800
 of the border looked like s and x-men first 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.420
 class and that did it nicely and yes 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.010
 then of course the question is 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.770
 do you know that rise then a fixed 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.200
 and I laughed 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.399
 I laughed a lot, we chose people 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.149
 secret service and I'm going to tell you 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.100
 why 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.489
 Plus points are really the cheeky ones 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.399
 humor and especially the hiss of an actor 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.570
 samuel l jackson man i still have it 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.610
 never like that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.809
 laughter pink pink I know and yet more like 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.559
 a kind of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.149
 sorry'll just fascinates between hello 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.700
 Phone also as a more serious one 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.820
 actor who is a little more bad guy and occasionally 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.619
 a little sarcastic but now you have 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.930
 him really like somewhere like the gooey 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.900
 guy and who dressed some kind of warby 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.759
 hipster the feel a on bad guy plays in 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.310
 the shape of richman valentine 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.570
 okay very well that I missed think 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.520
 nice and nice but then you make it 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.100
 of course no file with it anymore 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.420
 Layered setting of humor is I think 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.159
 some contrast 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.049
 it's all about two people 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.820
 namely noise heart played 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.100
 Collins turn wants a real one anyway 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.409
 classic English spy is really such 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.470
 adolescent classic king's men 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.119
 and the other is jerry and my ep action and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.860
 who is really a street kid that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.060
 little man who really lives off the streets 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.799
 lives on the street 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 his stepfather is a no is one 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.659
 gangster boss and such a real father was once 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.030
 also in king's but that contrast 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.189
 when noise heart and gary and win 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.750
 then meet again 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.399
 yes that occasionally causes one 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.940
 collision it's nice to see that gary 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.800
 and 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.450
 is then included in the trajectory at 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.920
 also in king's one to be with 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.060
 of course our setbacks and them 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.230
 harassment 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.360
 but still to see him 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.550
 transforms into a real sounds to me 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.680
 the humor in case one definitely for it 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.660
 Young audience is really after is I really 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.990
 laughter in addition to humor is also really whole 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.610
 much action and how it has been recorded 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.800
 i really have no like being in a kind 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.480
 roller coaster is constantly in 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.710
 The action was sucked in and then out again 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.510
 it spit out 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.210
 and that makes it pretty nice 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.100
 visually displaying action scenes is the only one 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.500
 what is a bit better is the film 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.500
 needs a huge run up to join the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.780
 climax because the need it 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.940
 thing it's all about why 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.950
 the king's men bridge would be my far 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.750
 I didn't have to stop time 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.160
 really bad 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.330
 yes i didn't really feel very much 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.010
 attracted 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.050
 it is then that there is a new one 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.540
 SIM card in the world is released 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.120
 free with which you can dig internet 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.620
 calling and texting like it's sort of 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.210
 is a reflection of hey guys 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.130
 nowadays we are so thick 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.950
 our phone and we just want it 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.989
 free internet calls and texts 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.730
 so maybe that's the only and 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.739
 different per person but i felt 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.870
 I was not attracted to that, so that one 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.320
 necessity was not really very high and 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.989
 then the war comes on top of that gary and 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.270
 white azzy only at the very last moment 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.180
 and for extras of yes help us too 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.280
 just to switch off that guy and 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.050
 the content does not have the characters either 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.880
 really much to tell that doesn't tell 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.019
 really about their who they are where they are 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.850
 to come from 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.920
 but that makes it start in the cops 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.410
