00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.099
 Hello everyone, hi-tech mail.ru 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.349
 today's issue we dedicate the announcement 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.400
 new flagship smartphone from 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.029
 lg company 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.820
 model lg g3 conceptually this 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.369
 continuation of last year's model g2 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.379
 at the cost of considerable effort to the manufacturer then 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.350
 actually managed to jump above your head 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.129
 because after one unsuccessful turn and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.980
 many years 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.559
 the wrong way companies dance 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.149
 managed to mix the right cocktail out 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.460
 features and characteristics 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.489
 successful camera balanced screen and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.039
 not the most ordinary way to control 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.350
 of course in terms of sales 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.390
 to contend with samsung or apple im not 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.729
 there was a volume of financial injections in 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.309
 advertising is not at all yet 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.569
 the application for success was nevertheless worthy 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.630
 and the new machine 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:08.790
 lg g3 supports the course taken too 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.590
 the lack of buttons on the front panel 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.890
 same special control on 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.020
 the back cover is also awakening after 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.780
 tapping but now we are dealing with 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 qualitatively new way 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.590
 autofocus and screen resolution 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.710
 whose smartphone has never been 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.260
 getting intrigued what 's the final 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.590
 device version as you can see already in ours 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.690
 hands 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.050
 so ready to draw the first conclusions and 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.820
 share impressions looks 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.250
 the novelty is significantly more noble and 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.070
 nicer than the previous version of the smartphone 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.620
 I grew thin I got more 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.690
 elegant look and replaced untidy brand 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.670
 glossy outfit on textured 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.280
 sweep up steal plastic which 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.770
 courageously and steadfastly endures attempts 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.780
 scratch him 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.850
 the design became collapsible that 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.250
 always happy to spare lovers 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.229
 batteries go to the clouds Korean looks like 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.630
 changed their mind because a slot for memory cards 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.399
 still provided but the principle 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.819
 the work of the main control 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.220
 it and the knob from the rocker in the doorway all that 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.200
 But only the design has changed has become less 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.690
 angular and rough and at the same time less 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.540
 convex that tactile search button 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.209
 do not interfere with moisture protection 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.739
 did not possibly not want to provoke 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.870
 people on stupid acts like 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.940
 long bathing with the apparatus in the ocean 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.970
 which can certainly lead to death 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.459
 even the protected device I myself 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.579
 Perhaps the interesting thing in the device is 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.530
 so-called laser autofocus strictly 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.870
 saying the focus here is well known to us 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.599
 contrast type of weak place 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.390
 there has always been slowness and that's where 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.610
 forehead is turned off the laser is not easy 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.069
 notice but there is barely noticeable 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.459
 red shimmer it just works 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.459
 laser 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.829
 his task is to play the role of a range finder or 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.650
 laser roulettes that is smart 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.660
 determine the distance to the object so by 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.780
 Idea autofocus should be 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.790
 more swift and accurate especially in 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.190
 conditions are not very good light 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.560
 By the way , the camera's control menu is very 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.420
 greatly simplified that we exclusively 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.190
 we approve of congestion 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.049
 interfaces greatly complicates 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.180
 users of the second life 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.459
 no less important improvement touched 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.650
 screens except that he pulled up 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.470
 five and a half inches which in itself 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.239
 predictably he was awarded very high 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.120
 by the standards of smartphones for not only 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.400
 smartphone resolution while not yet 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.239
 All TVs have received permission for 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.819
 ultra hd 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.980
 in front of us is a smartphone that surpasses 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.410
 them by the number of pixels per inch with 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.090
 one side for a smartphone is 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.130
 permission is redundant because 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.940
 human eye with such a diagonal 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.299
 screen 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.970
 quality hd and full hd practically 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.280
 indistinguishable nonetheless small and 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.519
 a simple experiment showed that almost 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.910
 everyone who was like that 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.000
 demonstrated 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:03.200
 not the same image resolution of 2560 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.670
 at 1440 on g2 and g3 screens 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.400
 the difference is all the same 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.190
 see focus group participants pointed to 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.670
 what is on the kuat hd screen that is on 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.830
 New screen more good detail 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.650
 more carefully traced gradient 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.220
 shadows and textures and colors are saturated and 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.860
 thick 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.170
 but also noted the fact that the grand 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.660
 there is no difference if you do not look closely and 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.970
 look at the screen from a distance of 30 40 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.510
 centimeters as it usually happens then 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.760
 the difference 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.890
 no one will feel though 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.900
 the company basically produced such 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.300
 the screen for the smartphone itself is cool 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.400
 By the way, the manufacturer likes to compare 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.720
 the effect produced by screen 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.210
 high-quality printing 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.030
 art albums surely 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.580
 top smartphone relies top 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.100
 iron and in that sense g3 is nothing 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.930
 deprived against the background of internal power is always 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.900
 it is especially interesting to see how much 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.670
 the device will live without an outlet 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.790
 to assess autonomy as 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.510
 I will give an example of extreme load 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.760
 resource-intensive game mode 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.990
 location off 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.420
 Wi-Fi too 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.270
 battery in this scenario holds 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.550
 somewhere two and a half hours more 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.860
 sparing mode video playback on 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.970
 100 percent brightness with active Wi-Fi 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.060
 and spike with modules 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.040
 the smartphone lasts almost five hours by itself 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.410
 by a less intense load 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.480
 the device will live a day or even more 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.340
 by the way, wireless is provided 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.890
 charging works 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.080
 lg g3 running fresh android 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.300
 over which is updated 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.730
 branded shell according to current 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.290
 interface development trends 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.410
 icons are made according to the principles so 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.690
 called flat design minimalism 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.820
 pure colors intuitive 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.280
 typography no congestion 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.630
 shadows and highlights gradients and other 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.270
 coarse he is not fashionable jewelry 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.560
 And finally, about the case completely 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.870
 self part 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.900
 Announcement of the company will jit your 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.580
 nontrivial look at this accessory 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.440
 principle so close the lid 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.780
 the interface is optimized for round 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.850
 Workspace where I am available 6 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.470
 applications looks need to say 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.100
 quite attractive and 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.540
 interesting so we showed you the most 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.790
 interesting in our opinion 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.460
 features on the market but it's far from 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.670
 all more details of the original 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.380
 photos and more you will find
