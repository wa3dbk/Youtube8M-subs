00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
we already showed you the Sony Xperia Z

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.310 
we already showed you the Sony Xperia Z
this<00:00:11.310> is<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.640> Sony<00:00:11.910> Xperia<00:00:12.000> Z

this is the Sony Xperia Z

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.959 
this is the Sony Xperia Z
essentially<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.460> almost<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.879> same

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
essentially this is almost the same

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.440 
essentially this is almost the same
exact<00:00:15.480> device<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:16.110> the<00:00:16.920> Z<00:00:17.220> as<00:00:17.460> far<00:00:17.700> as<00:00:17.820> specs<00:00:18.150> go

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
exact device as the Z as far as specs go

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.140 
exact device as the Z as far as specs go
the<00:00:19.439> camera<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.189> does<00:00:20.369> feature<00:00:20.610> a<00:00:20.760> 13

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the camera this one does feature a 13

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.280 
the camera this one does feature a 13
megapixel<00:00:21.270> camera<00:00:22.050> 2-megapixel

megapixel camera 2-megapixel
front-facing<00:00:22.980> camera<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.939> only<00:00:24.119> difference

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
front-facing camera the only difference

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.210 
front-facing camera the only difference
is<00:00:24.720> pretty<00:00:25.200> much<00:00:25.349> in<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.529> aesthetics<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
is pretty much in the aesthetics and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.529 
is pretty much in the aesthetics and
build<00:00:26.430> quality<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.000> let<00:00:27.119> me<00:00:27.180> take<00:00:27.329> you<00:00:27.450> around

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
build quality so let me take you around

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.320 
build quality so let me take you around
the<00:00:27.750> sides<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.200> the<00:00:28.289> front<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> device

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
the sides and the front of the device

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.390 
the sides and the front of the device
what's<00:00:30.330> interesting<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.199> has<00:00:31.410> 2<00:00:31.980> megapixel

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
what's interesting is it has 2 megapixel

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.860 
what's interesting is it has 2 megapixel
front-facing<00:00:32.580> cameras<00:00:33.090> right<00:00:33.330> there<00:00:33.390> along

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
front-facing cameras right there along

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.970 
front-facing cameras right there along
the<00:00:34.019> bottom<00:00:34.199> and<00:00:34.470> then<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.650> have<00:00:34.769> a<00:00:34.800> little

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the bottom and then you have a little

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.549 
the bottom and then you have a little
LED<00:00:35.370> glow<00:00:35.610> light<00:00:35.850> here<00:00:36.210> where<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.050> excuse<00:00:37.440> he

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
LED glow light here where the excuse he

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.250 
LED glow light here where the excuse he
had<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.070> mic<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.580> the<00:00:38.670> corner<00:00:39.140> this<00:00:40.140> is

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
had one mic up in the corner this is

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.990 
had one mic up in the corner this is
actually<00:00:40.589> kind<00:00:40.769> of<00:00:40.800> interesting<00:00:40.980> so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
actually kind of interesting so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.450 
actually kind of interesting so
it's<00:00:42.510> kind<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.470> can<00:00:43.650> hold<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.190> way

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
it's kind of you can hold it this way

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.479 
it's kind of you can hold it this way
let<00:00:44.640> me<00:00:44.700> get<00:00:44.880> it<00:00:45.000> from

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.299 

in<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:49.579> camera<00:00:50.140> so<00:00:51.140> you<00:00:51.350> can<00:00:51.469> see<00:00:51.769> it's<00:00:52.039> like

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
in the camera so you can see it's like

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.920 
in the camera so you can see it's like
right<00:00:52.550> here<00:00:52.730> in<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:52.879> bottom<00:00:53.030> corner<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:53.750> it's

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
right here in the bottom corner so it's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.829 
right here in the bottom corner so it's
a<00:00:54.079> little<00:00:54.260> bit<00:00:54.519> strange<00:00:56.170> tonight<00:00:57.170> but<00:00:58.070> um

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
a little bit strange tonight but um

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.049 
a little bit strange tonight but um
hello<00:00:59.839> it<00:00:59.989> works<00:01:00.350> good<00:01:00.589> for<00:01:00.649> portrait<00:01:01.489> guy

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
hello it works good for portrait guy

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.240 
hello it works good for portrait guy
which<00:01:02.360> meant<00:01:03.229> to<00:01:03.320> be<00:01:03.409> held<00:01:03.680> in<00:01:03.800> portrait<00:01:04.220> mode

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
which meant to be held in portrait mode

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.560 
which meant to be held in portrait mode
so<00:01:04.670> that's<00:01:05.180> pretty<00:01:05.300> much<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.449> only

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
so that's pretty much the only

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.389 
so that's pretty much the only
difference<00:01:06.020> is<00:01:06.170> everything<00:01:06.590> else<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:07.009> lies

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
difference is everything else you I lies

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.399 
difference is everything else you I lies
spec-wise<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:08.210> pretty<00:01:08.450> much<00:01:08.570> exactly<00:01:08.780> the

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
spec-wise is pretty much exactly the

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.560 
spec-wise is pretty much exactly the
same<00:01:09.649> I<00:01:10.310> would<00:01:10.790> imagine<00:01:10.970> this<00:01:11.240> device

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
same I would imagine this device

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.700 
same I would imagine this device
although<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:12.020> wasn't<00:01:12.170> announced<00:01:12.409> which

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
although it wasn't announced which

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.680 
although it wasn't announced which
carriers<00:01:13.130> anything<00:01:13.520> yet<00:01:13.700> imagine<00:01:14.479> this<00:01:14.540> is

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
carriers anything yet imagine this is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.620 
carriers anything yet imagine this is
going<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:14.899> come<00:01:15.049> through<00:01:15.970> or<00:01:16.970> will<00:01:17.149> be<00:01:17.270> offered

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
going to come through or will be offered

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.240 
going to come through or will be offered
for<00:01:17.659> a<00:01:17.869> little<00:01:17.990> bit<00:01:18.140> cheaper<00:01:18.470> than<00:01:18.710> the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
for a little bit cheaper than the

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.850 
for a little bit cheaper than the
regular<00:01:19.850> disease<00:01:20.330> so<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:21.140> can<00:01:21.259> see<00:01:21.440> here<00:01:21.619> it's

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
regular disease so you can see here it's

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.029 
regular disease so you can see here it's
got<00:01:22.039> an<00:01:22.160> eggshell<00:01:22.399> I'm<00:01:23.060> finished<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.380> very<00:01:24.740> mad

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
got an eggshell I'm finished so very mad

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.999 
got an eggshell I'm finished so very mad
white<00:01:25.640> like<00:01:26.570> would<00:01:27.140> probably<00:01:27.590> some<00:01:27.740> affection

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
white like would probably some affection

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.560 
white like would probably some affection
that<00:01:28.340> would<00:01:28.550> actually<00:01:28.729> pick<00:01:29.060> up<00:01:29.149> some<00:01:29.360> gene

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
that would actually pick up some gene

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.590 
that would actually pick up some gene
stain<00:01:29.869> or<00:01:30.700> some<00:01:31.700> type<00:01:31.909> of<00:01:31.940> things<00:01:32.300> actually

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
stain or some type of things actually

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.510 
stain or some type of things actually
got<00:01:33.080> your<00:01:33.229> speaker<00:01:33.530> here<00:01:33.800> it's<00:01:34.310> kind<00:01:34.429> of

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
got your speaker here it's kind of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.790 
got your speaker here it's kind of
covered<00:01:34.850> their<00:01:35.030> little<00:01:35.869> camera<00:01:36.200> protrusion

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
covered their little camera protrusion

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.529 
covered their little camera protrusion
here<00:01:37.009> with<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.369> movement<00:01:37.880> of<00:01:38.060> around<00:01:38.330> the

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
here with the movement of around the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.249 
here with the movement of around the
side<00:01:39.130> noise<00:01:40.130> cancelling<00:01:40.550> mic<00:01:40.580> led<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:42.050> is

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
side noise cancelling mic led this is

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.770 
side noise cancelling mic led this is
where<00:01:42.500> your<00:01:43.069> sim<00:01:43.640> card<00:01:43.880> in<00:01:44.030> your<00:01:44.149> micro<00:01:44.450> SD

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
where your sim card in your micro SD

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.070 
where your sim card in your micro SD
card<00:01:45.140> slot<00:01:45.229> go<00:01:45.740> on<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:46.520> open<00:01:46.759> that<00:01:46.880> up<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:47.990> you

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
card slot go on the open that up so you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.380 
card slot go on the open that up so you
can<00:01:48.200> see<00:01:48.350> here<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:48.740> have<00:01:48.770> your<00:01:48.970> sim<00:01:49.970> card<00:01:50.210> or

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
can see here you have your sim card or

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.450 
can see here you have your sim card or
my<00:01:50.509> crusty<00:01:50.930> then<00:01:51.110> your<00:01:51.200> sim<00:01:51.380> final<00:01:51.710> answer

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
my crusty then your sim final answer

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.399 
my crusty then your sim final answer
pretty<00:01:54.460> good<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:54.969> far<00:01:55.000> again<00:01:55.960> build<00:01:56.229> quality
