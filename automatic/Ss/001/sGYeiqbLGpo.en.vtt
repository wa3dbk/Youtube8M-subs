00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.230
 hallÃ¶chen my glossybox is there after 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.849
 I 'm looking forward to it we'll take a look 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.660
 first off in the magazine again 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.490
 beauty balance what do we have here? 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.699
 It's possible for him to be fine again 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.480
 Rummage again very mixed 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.260
 out and unimportant we look the box 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 much more important 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.369
 The magazine is a solo for extra 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.439
 for me at least I know how to do it 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.829
 But you guys I notice the magazine 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:44.219
 only as sometime later times 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:45.840
 good balance that's what it's about 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:52.020
 box what have we got here is beautiful 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.989
 what is this here rollers rule he 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.640
 is finally for light skin types 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.050
 directly for Bella otherwise one has in the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.370
 mostly boxing for middle and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.020
 dark you always have the feeling the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.070
 the things are not going on now 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.589
 in here 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.729
 very nice that makes me happy for bright 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.409
 Inside is a good looking one 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.810
 Moisturizing with 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.210
 sun protection factor 15 with color 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.820
 color correction anti aging gentle make 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.659
 I like the perfect, very good up here 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.479
 a moisturizer from near by 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:31.320
 moisturizer is not wrong 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.119
 yes, it looks as if that too 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.070
 All skin types is perfect for perfect 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.159
 very beautiful very nice love me green 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.100
 conditioner a conditioner a tiny 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.860
 conditioner with coconut oil and funky pani 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.770
 Extract that certainly smells delicious 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.920
 sprinkled on the hair 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:02:03.210
 What is the cream Egyptian cream 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:07.200
 Skin cream that's pretty much not necessary now 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:12.370
 for resale ok clubs is synonymous on it 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.540
 what once here bella pierre a mineral 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:21.040
 blush interesting color interesting 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.900
 color look again on the cheeks 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.330
 looks like I'm curious if the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.660
 I like it, I like full color 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.739
 Something yes does not really come anymore 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.770
 on how it looks on the cheeks 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.540
 You can not say that too difficult and so 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.530
 balance emi a half full lipgloss yes 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.019
 he is filled to this point 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.630
 that seems to be common 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:48.360
 somehow I do not know if that's normal 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:53.130
 Well, yes, only ten milliliters 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.660
 limited edition 100 percent of course 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.069
 he is already open or somehow open 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.720
 because he is open or running here 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.940
 he just seems to roar a lot 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.459
 to be liquid 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.319
 that is very fluid he looks like 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.600
 a lip whether the so still so if so 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.959
 I've seen that makes sense 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.920
 not now 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.260
 Is that how I thought I did not know 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.910
 Well, let's see if that thought so 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.280
 Vladimir Jakunin definitely looks 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.670
 a bit very fluid in detail so 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.180
 that's it more is not in it what have 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.040
 I like the box best 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.170
 flush and of course the make up 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.700
 those are the two products that me 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.260
 really liked and the box for 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.790
 already made me meaningful 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.260
 the rest are in gave the nice too 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.519
 are by now on the cream find one 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.769
 a little nonsense but if that must be 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.590
 extra is apparently then it's okay 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.650
 But the two products are for me 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.540
 of course the highlights are clear and the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.260
 rest I'm curious on it my 30th 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.549
 milliliter for this one 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.510
 Moisturizer is also ok 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.590
 can not complain of actually 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.500
 check the condition 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.780
 I can not really do anything 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.820
 negative to say i like the box 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.690
 satisfied there is nothing to complain nothing 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.709
 to grumble and I would say fits 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.959
 exactly 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.160
 be found there just as she writes times 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.109
 my comments if not then 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.419
 also and I would say 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.419
 bye bye video bye
