you know what the quality is it but

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.889 
you know what the quality is it but
we've<00:00:32.099> integrated<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.300> concept<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.840> zero

in<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.530> our<00:00:43.649> new<00:00:43.770> homes<00:00:43.980> we're<00:00:44.219> doing<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> few

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
in all our new homes we're doing a few

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.459 
in all our new homes we're doing a few
simple<00:00:44.940> things<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.390> increasing<00:00:45.870> insulation

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
simple things for increasing insulation

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.040 
simple things for increasing insulation
we're<00:00:47.430> reducing<00:00:47.730> leaks<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.690> we're<00:00:48.840> improving

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
we're reducing leaks and we're improving

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.360 
we're reducing leaks and we're improving
the<00:00:49.289> quality<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> windows<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.309> doors

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the quality of the windows and doors

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.490 
the quality of the windows and doors
when<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.750> something<00:00:52.110> magical

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
when you do that something magical

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.200 
when you do that something magical
happens<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> mechanical<00:00:53.460> systems<00:00:53.789> virtually

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
happens the mechanical systems virtually

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.020 
happens the mechanical systems virtually
drop<00:00:54.390> away<00:00:54.570> we've<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.699> super<00:00:56.699> insulated

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
drop away we've got super insulated

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.900 
drop away we've got super insulated
shell<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:58.289> an<00:00:58.440> air<00:00:58.680> infiltration<00:00:59.010> system

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
shell with an air infiltration system

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.810 
shell with an air infiltration system
that<00:01:00.090> exchanges<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.109> indoor<00:01:01.920> air<00:01:02.129> every<00:01:02.640> hour

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that exchanges the indoor air every hour

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.969 
that exchanges the indoor air every hour
so<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> very<00:01:04.080> healthy<00:01:04.350> indoor<00:01:04.739> air

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
so you have a very healthy indoor air

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
so you have a very healthy indoor air
environment<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.360> our<00:01:06.479> new<00:01:06.600> buildings

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
environment and all our new buildings

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.230 
environment and all our new buildings
bracket<00:01:07.650> estates<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.580> our<00:01:08.760> new<00:01:08.880> homes<00:01:09.090> in

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
bracket estates and all our new homes in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.240 
bracket estates and all our new homes in
Maine<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.720> fact<00:01:09.900> are<00:01:10.619> being<00:01:10.860> built<00:01:11.070> without

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
Maine in fact are being built without

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.210 
Maine in fact are being built without
furnaces<00:01:12.260> so<00:01:13.260> what<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> building

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
furnaces so what we have is a building

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.429 
furnaces so what we have is a building
that's<00:01:14.400> that's<00:01:14.970> healthier<00:01:15.390> more<00:01:15.990> durable

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that's that's healthier more durable

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.850 
that's that's healthier more durable
more<00:01:17.060> comfortable<00:01:18.060> more<00:01:18.780> energy-efficient<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
more comfortable more energy-efficient a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.010 
more comfortable more energy-efficient a
little<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.340> no<00:01:20.490> additional<00:01:20.970> cost<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.900> way

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
little to no additional cost the way

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.320 
little to no additional cost the way
this<00:01:22.229> works<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.250> solar<00:01:23.460> panels<00:01:23.909> feed<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
this works is the solar panels feed the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.880 
this works is the solar panels feed the
power<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> peak<00:01:25.290> times<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> year

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
power in at the peak times of the year

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.399 
power in at the peak times of the year
and<00:01:26.310> at<00:01:27.180> times<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.630> year<00:01:27.659> when<00:01:27.960> we're<00:01:28.259> not

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and at times of the year when we're not

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.469 
and at times of the year when we're not
producing<00:01:28.740> enough<00:01:29.040> power<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.640> draw<00:01:29.880> back<00:01:30.180> from

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
producing enough power we draw back from

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.749 
producing enough power we draw back from
the<00:01:30.570> grid<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.409> sometimes<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.310> year<00:01:32.430> there's<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the grid so sometimes the year there's a

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.870 
the grid so sometimes the year there's a
surplus<00:01:33.150> sometimes<00:01:34.079> we're<00:01:34.680> at<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.280> negative

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
surplus sometimes we're at a negative

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.910 
surplus sometimes we're at a negative
but<00:01:36.390> over<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.900> course<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> year<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.650> end

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
but over the course of the year you end

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.610 
but over the course of the year you end
up<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.280> net<00:01:38.520> zero<00:01:38.549> energy<00:01:38.939> bill

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.050 

you<00:01:42.620> pick<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:42.890> house<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.280> get<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.520> customize<00:01:44.030> it
