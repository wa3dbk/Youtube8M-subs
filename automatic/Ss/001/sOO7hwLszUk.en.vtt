top coat I'm using is Seche vite because

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.549 
top coat I'm using is Seche vite because
that's<00:00:34.239> what<00:00:34.420> I<00:00:34.450> have<00:00:34.719> and<00:00:35.020> it<00:00:35.079> gives<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.350> really

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
that's what I have and it gives a really

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.220 
that's what I have and it gives a really
nice<00:00:35.710> shine<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:37.180> I'm<00:00:37.480> gonna<00:00:37.660> go<00:00:37.900> ahead<00:00:38.020> and

nice shine so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.860 
nice shine so I'm gonna go ahead and
apply<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:38.650> and<00:00:39.430> then<00:00:40.300> let<00:00:40.480> you<00:00:40.600> know<00:00:40.690> what<00:00:40.840> I

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
apply that and then let you know what I

00:00:40.870 --> 00:01:05.130 
apply that and then let you know what I
think

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.550 

all<00:01:06.140> right<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:07.430> there<00:01:08.150> are<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.930> pixie<00:01:09.530> dust

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
all right so there are the pixie dust

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.240 
all right so there are the pixie dust
colors<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:11.810> can<00:01:11.960> see<00:01:12.290> they're<00:01:12.890> just<00:01:12.920> kind

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
colors and you can see they're just kind

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.120 
colors and you can see they're just kind
of<00:01:13.310> more<00:01:13.520> vibrant<00:01:14.300> and<00:01:14.540> obviously<00:01:15.470> glossy

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
of more vibrant and obviously glossy

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.840 
of more vibrant and obviously glossy
rather<00:01:16.310> than<00:01:16.580> matte<00:01:17.680> it's<00:01:18.680> not<00:01:18.950> dry<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:19.820> I

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
rather than matte it's not dry so I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.560 
rather than matte it's not dry so I
can't<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:21.320> know<00:01:21.440> touch<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.250> see<00:01:22.360> but<00:01:23.360> it

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
can't you know touch it and see but it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.810 
can't you know touch it and see but it
looks<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:24.050> me<00:01:24.200> like<00:01:24.229> they<00:01:24.590> only<00:01:24.770> need<00:01:25.070> one<00:01:25.430> coat

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
looks to me like they only need one coat

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.249 
looks to me like they only need one coat
in<00:01:26.150> order<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.540> be<00:01:26.810> completely<00:01:27.350> smooth<00:01:29.259> the

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
in order to be completely smooth the

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.710 
in order to be completely smooth the
liquid<00:01:30.770> sand<00:01:31.159> colors<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:32.360> can<00:01:32.509> especially

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
liquid sand colors you can especially

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.320 
liquid sand colors you can especially
see<00:01:33.229> on<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.470> blue<00:01:33.710> there<00:01:34.009> since<00:01:34.940> they<00:01:35.090> are<00:01:35.300> a

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
see on the blue there since they are a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.420 
see on the blue there since they are a
little<00:01:35.539> bit<00:01:35.869> rougher<00:01:36.410> I<00:01:36.710> think<00:01:37.130> they<00:01:37.280> would

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
little bit rougher I think they would

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.520 
little bit rougher I think they would
probably<00:01:37.460> need<00:01:37.940> two<00:01:38.240> coats<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.690> topcoat<00:01:38.990> in

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
probably need two coats of topcoat in

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.999 
probably need two coats of topcoat in
order<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:39.950> be<00:01:40.070> completely<00:01:40.460> smooth<00:01:41.619> maybe<00:01:42.619> even

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
order to be completely smooth maybe even

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.340 
order to be completely smooth maybe even
more<00:01:43.220> than<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:44.060> mean<00:01:44.450> just<00:01:44.780> looking<00:01:45.200> at

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
more than that I mean just looking at

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.460 
more than that I mean just looking at
them<00:01:45.500> here<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:47.360> going<00:01:47.810> by<00:01:47.929> how<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.110> light

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
them here and going by how the light

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.160 
them here and going by how the light
reflects<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.250> think<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.550> can<00:01:49.729> see<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.899> the

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
reflects I think you can see that the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
reflects I think you can see that the
blue<00:01:51.470> is<00:01:51.800> a<00:01:51.920> lot<00:01:52.280> rougher<00:01:52.610> than<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.509> black<00:01:54.190> but

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
blue is a lot rougher than the black but

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.029 
blue is a lot rougher than the black but
in<00:01:55.520> all<00:01:56.119> of<00:01:56.330> them<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:57.140> different<00:01:57.710> sizes<00:01:58.009> a

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
in all of them the different sizes a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.060 
in all of them the different sizes a
glitter<00:01:58.399> pop<00:01:58.789> a<00:01:59.030> lot<00:01:59.270> more<00:01:59.920> when<00:02:00.920> they're

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
glitter pop a lot more when they're

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.310 
glitter pop a lot more when they're
glossy<00:02:01.520> than<00:02:01.670> when<00:02:01.789> they're<00:02:01.940> Matt<00:02:02.179> and<00:02:03.140> I

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
glossy than when they're Matt and I

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.370 
glossy than when they're Matt and I
think<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:03.770> black<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.369> particular<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.380> little

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
think this black in particular a little

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.470 
think this black in particular a little
bit<00:02:06.500> easier<00:02:07.070> to<00:02:07.460> see<00:02:09.130> yeah<00:02:10.160> now<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.030> can<00:02:11.209> see

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
bit easier to see yeah now you can see

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.449 
bit easier to see yeah now you can see
that<00:02:11.690> pink<00:02:12.049> really<00:02:12.560> pops<00:02:12.829> out<00:02:13.070> with<00:02:13.340> the

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
that pink really pops out with the

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.600 
that pink really pops out with the
topcoat<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.590> I'll<00:02:15.590> just<00:02:15.769> spin<00:02:16.010> back<00:02:16.220> over<00:02:16.489> to

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
topcoat and I'll just spin back over to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.539 
topcoat and I'll just spin back over to
the<00:02:16.730> pixie<00:02:17.120> dust<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.570> you<00:02:17.660> can<00:02:17.840> see<00:02:18.280> those<00:02:19.280> on

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
the pixie dust so you can see those on

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.110 
the pixie dust so you can see those on
black<00:02:19.880> also<00:02:20.680> but<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.980> mean<00:02:22.579> that's<00:02:22.790> really

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
black also but I mean that's really

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.539 
black also but I mean that's really
basically<00:02:23.630> all<00:02:23.810> there<00:02:23.989> is<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.920> know<00:02:25.370> if

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
basically all there is to it you know if

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.360 
basically all there is to it you know if
you<00:02:25.730> wear<00:02:25.970> any<00:02:26.239> of<00:02:26.420> these<00:02:26.570> polishes<00:02:27.370> adding

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
you wear any of these polishes adding

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.729 
you wear any of these polishes adding
topcoat<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.209> really<00:02:29.660> fast<00:02:29.959> easy<00:02:30.350> way<00:02:30.709> to

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
topcoat is a really fast easy way to

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.069 
topcoat is a really fast easy way to
switch<00:02:31.549> up<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.910> look<00:02:32.120> after<00:02:32.690> you've<00:02:32.780> had<00:02:32.989> them

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
switch up the look after you've had them

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.120 
switch up the look after you've had them
on<00:02:33.230> for<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.560> day<00:02:33.739> or<00:02:33.890> two

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
on for a day or two

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.090 
on for a day or two
and<00:02:34.959> obviously<00:02:35.959> they<00:02:36.320> don't<00:02:36.440> look<00:02:36.620> completely

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
and obviously they don't look completely
