00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 2 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.769
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.500
 I told you about a great tweak that has 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.419
 had a big success under ios 6 he did 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 never been updated for ios is 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.150
 alas it will soon be available for 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.039
 ayew and more 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.970
 look at me maybe that 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.609
 recalls memories to some 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.369
 of you villoch comes back in version 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.019
 2 the premise of this tweak know that you 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.550
 will be able to slide on the water from 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.500
 an application to display it in 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.820
 little insight like these and you 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.809
 could use it 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.550
 there for example I can do a 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.140
 search on youtube as if I had 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.640
 open the application in full screen except 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.629
 that I just have a glimpse 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.550
 like these i can leave 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.079
 quickly same example with 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.420
 the application plans a small slip 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.800
 on the top and hop there perceived his record and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.760
 then I can use it as if 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.350
 I was in the app 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.390
 so the goal is really to make you 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.949
 save time and take the example 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.770
 an application like this one that has 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.960
 a notification here a sms if I slip 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.530
 up this time look at this 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.329
 which is displayed 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.859
 it's the notification that I have 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.989
 waiting which is displayed like these 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.000
 in the small menu quote locks if 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.200
 I press on it, I'm sent back to 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.240
 my application message in the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.800
 concerned conversation so this 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.510
 way for all applications that 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.250
 will have pending notifications you 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.610
 can see them and in the city myth 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.600
 ocher 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.490
 if you want you can too 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.500
 display a dark mode up 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.910
 now I had the clear mode if I 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 slide to the water on the settings by 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.720
 example that's what it gives you and 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.130
 that the bottom is black and besides 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.560
 you see that we propose three options 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.420
 extinguishing their minds then taste the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.730
 lock so that's how that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.840
 works that was the dark mode if 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.190
 I remove you go immediately see 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.810
 the difference always with the same 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.650
 example on the settings confess that 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.240
 it's much clearer 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.590
 and besides we distinguish a little bit 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.030
 less text that's why me 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.770
 I like to use the dark mode 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.840
 then you will be able to choose your 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.700
 gesture to make a shift towards the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.680
 up on the icon down a double 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.630
 tap a triple tap or even 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.250
 maintain the app icon if 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.390
 you prefer me I like the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.860
 sliding up I find that 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.720
 it's the most natural that does not interfere 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.760
 with the spotlight you can also choose 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.470
 to use or not fast animations 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.320
 at the opening of the little menu of life locks 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.430
 here we will find the extensions so 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.380
 this is what is called here in the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.910
 panel plugin prefer m6 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.470
 you will find here all the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.390
 applications that are supported by 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.590
 beenox so for now in this 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.330
 beta version there is not much 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.650
 but what is really practical with 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.000
 this tweak know that a lot of developers 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.709
 will be able to propose extensions 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840
 for applications compatible with 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.190
 the tweak as time goes by 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.750
 more and more applications will be 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.819
 supported and besides you 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.200
 find here its applications there you 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.300
 you will be able to choose the menu 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.430
 you want with villoch this is the menu 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.269
 notification be the interaction menu 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.400
 with the application 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.900
 take the example of tweetbot here or 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.630
 for now I checked ocher city 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.400
 tweetbot if i choose notification view 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.900
 if I slide up on the icon and 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.180
 his profile the view of notifications 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.930
 I do not have any, and if I do not 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.250
 Ocher city check 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.080
 tweetbot this will no longer be the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.519
 notifications but the content of 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.739
 my twitter application that will be 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.510
 posted i have here my timeline look and 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.069
 I can interact in the application 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.680
 as if I were in that in full 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.209
 screen I can for example here visualize 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.890
 my tweets or even pressed on the small 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.019
 composition button here to write a 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.340
 new tweet like this is how that 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.989
 works for applications 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.000
 compatible with the tweet you will be able to 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.370
 either see the notifications or see the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.840
 content for example with the app store here 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.400
 you see that I am offered a function 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.590
 quick search simply by 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.760
 sliding on the top of the icon I'm doing 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.950
 my research who then she goes 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.299
 appear on my iphone the goal is 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.310
 really save time for example 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.319
 very quickly visualize the weather 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.880
 activate an alarm if you slide on 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.019
 the clock app or still do 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.880
 an internet search 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.170
 what's nice is that the functions 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.389
 are not necessarily the same 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.739
 the application for example here with cydia 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.000
 I see the brand new packages that 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.069
 are available on cydia 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.889
 it's really nice to find this 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.900
 tweak life locks version ios more 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.730
 so if he interests you when he will be 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.920
 available on cydia it will cost 2 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.269
 dollars on the source of big boss and 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.040
 for those who had already bought the 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.329
 previous version soyaux and 6 you 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.340
 will have 50% discount 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.079
 so here's this presentation in 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.700
 before premiere I repeat it to you 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.350
 it's a tweet that I loved 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.600
 two years when it was available I 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.959
 can not wait for him to come back on cydia so you 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.609

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.709

 Hi
