00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
MPD and became in charge and had all

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.970 
MPD and became in charge and had all
this<00:00:58.510> power<00:00:58.690> which<00:00:59.290> worked<00:00:59.500> off<00:00:59.650> and<00:00:59.830> really

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
this power which worked off and really

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.290 
this power which worked off and really
didn't<00:01:00.310> want<00:01:00.430> to<00:01:00.460> happen<00:01:00.640> he<00:01:00.880> was<00:01:01.030> trying<00:01:01.240> to

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
didn't want to happen he was trying to

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.400 
didn't want to happen he was trying to
actually<00:01:01.390> kill<00:01:01.720> them<00:01:01.900> but<00:01:02.170> he<00:01:02.260> actually

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
actually kill them but he actually

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
actually kill them but he actually
thought<00:01:02.620> he'd<00:01:02.770> killed<00:01:02.800> him<00:01:03.040> as<00:01:03.130> soon<00:01:03.250> as<00:01:03.340> they

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
thought he'd killed him as soon as they

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.369 
thought he'd killed him as soon as they
got<00:01:03.520> teleported<00:01:03.850> so<00:01:04.479> he<00:01:04.600> starts<00:01:04.869> laughing<00:01:05.019> and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
got teleported so he starts laughing and

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.319 
got teleported so he starts laughing and
then<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.590> origin<00:01:05.979> screw<00:01:06.159> jumps<00:01:06.490> in<00:01:06.609> but<00:01:07.179> how

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
then the origin screw jumps in but how

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:08.880 
then the origin screw jumps in but how
exactly<00:01:07.659> did<00:01:07.899> the<00:01:07.990> origin<00:01:08.350> screw<00:01:08.530> get<00:01:08.710> there

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
exactly did the origin screw get there

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.260 
exactly did the origin screw get there
that<00:01:09.009> is<00:01:09.100> something<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.520> has<00:01:09.850> spent<00:01:10.090> forever

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
that is something I has spent forever

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.609 
that is something I has spent forever
trying<00:01:10.509> to<00:01:10.719> figure<00:01:10.899> out<00:01:10.929> and<00:01:11.229> I<00:01:11.259> think<00:01:11.469> I

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
trying to figure out and I think I

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.349 
trying to figure out and I think I
finally<00:01:11.859> know<00:01:12.219> but<00:01:12.789> I<00:01:12.820> make<00:01:13.030> an<00:01:13.119> entire

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:13.359 
finally know but I make an entire

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.389 
finally know but I make an entire
separate<00:01:13.840> theory<00:01:14.109> video<00:01:14.380> on<00:01:14.619> how<00:01:14.859> exactly<00:01:15.280> I

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
separate theory video on how exactly I

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.919 
separate theory video on how exactly I
think<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:15.729> know<00:01:15.789> this<00:01:16.030> but<00:01:16.539> just<00:01:16.810> a<00:01:16.840> quick

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
anything else cuz she has no power in

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.069 
anything else cuz she has no power in
that<00:01:39.280> universe<00:01:39.520> she<00:01:40.179> only<00:01:40.299> has<00:01:40.450> power<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:40.810> the

and this entire storyline she's going to
keep<00:04:08.150> being<00:04:08.389> rewritten<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:09.019> now<00:04:09.139> where<00:04:09.379> does

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
keep being rewritten so now where does

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.379 
keep being rewritten so now where does
this<00:04:09.620> leave<00:04:09.859> us<00:04:09.889> we<00:04:10.220> have<00:04:10.400> Richthofen<00:04:11.239> kill

this leave us we have Richthofen kill

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.909 
this leave us we have Richthofen kill
Richthofen<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.079> the<00:04:12.229> zombies<00:04:12.799> storyline

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
Richthofen so the zombies storyline

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.469 
Richthofen so the zombies storyline
Richthofen<00:04:13.609> that<00:04:13.729> we<00:04:13.819> all<00:04:13.909> know<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.060> love<00:04:14.209> is

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
Richthofen that we all know and love is

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.029 
Richthofen that we all know and love is
officially<00:04:14.930> dead<00:04:15.109> this<00:04:15.530> could<00:04:15.739> completely

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
officially dead this could completely

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.430 
officially dead this could completely
rewrite<00:04:16.909> the<00:04:17.060> zombies<00:04:17.359> storyline<00:04:17.479> where<00:04:18.229> do<00:04:18.380> I

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
rewrite the zombies storyline where do I

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.719 
rewrite the zombies storyline where do I
think<00:04:18.620> we're<00:04:18.709> going<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.889> go<00:04:18.949> next<00:04:19.130> what's

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
think we're going to go next what's

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.009 
think we're going to go next what's
going<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:19.909> happen<00:04:20.000> so<00:04:20.449> I<00:04:20.479> think<00:04:20.750> we're<00:04:20.900> going

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
going to happen so I think we're going

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.629 
going to happen so I think we're going
to<00:04:21.079> go<00:04:21.199> try<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.440> awaken<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.889> test<00:04:22.099> subjects<00:04:22.520> I

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
to go try to awaken the test subjects I

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:23.469 
to go try to awaken the test subjects I
think<00:04:22.849> that's<00:04:22.970> what<00:04:23.090> they're<00:04:23.150> going<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.330> go

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
think that's what they're going to go

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.000 
think that's what they're going to go
and<00:04:23.750> we<00:04:24.139> know<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.380> test<00:04:24.560> subjects<00:04:24.889> are

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
and we know the test subjects are

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.469 
and we know the test subjects are
currently<00:04:25.340> residing<00:04:25.669> and<00:04:25.909> called<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.300> dead

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
currently residing and called the dead

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.730 
currently residing and called the dead
because<00:04:26.690> that's<00:04:26.870> where<00:04:27.050> Richthofen<00:04:27.530> did<00:04:27.650> his

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
because that's where Richthofen did his

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.439 
because that's where Richthofen did his
experiments<00:04:28.250> on<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.030> think<00:04:29.240> we<00:04:29.300> might<00:04:29.389> be

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
experiments on so I think we might be

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.850 
experiments on so I think we might be
heading<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:29.780> call<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.199> a<00:04:30.349> completely

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
heading to call that a completely

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.320 
heading to call that a completely
different<00:04:31.190> call<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.460> dead<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:31.789> think<00:04:32.180> that's

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
different call the dead I think that's

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.520 
different call the dead I think that's
where<00:04:32.419> we<00:04:32.510> might<00:04:32.659> be<00:04:32.780> heading<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:33.139> is<00:04:33.320> called

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
where we might be heading to is called

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.320 
where we might be heading to is called
the<00:04:33.680> dead<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.039> as<00:04:34.520> Samantha<00:04:34.909> still<00:04:35.120> in<00:04:35.240> the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.730 
had different ways on how they want to
save<00:05:08.420> it<00:05:08.570> the<00:05:08.960> three<00:05:09.110> heroes<00:05:09.320> want<00:05:09.530> to<00:05:09.620> use

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
save it the three heroes want to use

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.840 
save it the three heroes want to use
Richthofen<00:05:10.280> to<00:05:10.370> sort<00:05:10.520> of<00:05:10.580> change<00:05:10.790> the

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
Richthofen to sort of change the

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.370 
Richthofen to sort of change the
storyline<00:05:11.270> that<00:05:11.300> way<00:05:11.630> but<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.050> origins

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
storyline that way but the origins

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.780 
storyline that way but the origins
Richtofen<00:05:12.620> was<00:05:12.980> like<00:05:13.100> fuck<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:13.370> we're<00:05:13.670> just

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
Richtofen was like fuck that we're just

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.430 
Richtofen was like fuck that we're just
going<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:13.940> rewrite<00:05:14.090> it<00:05:14.360> ourselves<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:15.020> he's

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
going to rewrite it ourselves and he's

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.470 
going to rewrite it ourselves and he's
like<00:05:15.620> BAM<00:05:15.920> kills<00:05:16.250> Richthofen<00:05:16.820> and<00:05:16.970> now<00:05:17.120> they

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
like BAM kills Richthofen and now they

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.700 
like BAM kills Richthofen and now they
have<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.660> keep<00:05:17.810> going<00:05:17.900> down<00:05:18.110> that<00:05:18.290> path<00:05:18.320> now

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
have to keep going down that path now

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.260 
have to keep going down that path now
they<00:05:18.830> have<00:05:18.950> to<00:05:19.040> rewrite<00:05:19.310> history<00:05:19.490> themselves

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
they have to rewrite history themselves

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.670 
they have to rewrite history themselves
so<00:05:20.690> I<00:05:20.720> think<00:05:20.810> that's<00:05:21.080> what's<00:05:21.230> going<00:05:21.350> on<00:05:21.530> is

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
so I think that's what's going on is

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.600 
so I think that's what's going on is
they're<00:05:21.770> gonna<00:05:21.890> try<00:05:22.040> to<00:05:22.100> rewrite<00:05:22.430> history

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
they're gonna try to rewrite history

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.130 
they're gonna try to rewrite history
themselves<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.360> stop<00:05:23.570> everything<00:05:23.900> from

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
themselves and stop everything from

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.900 
themselves and stop everything from
happening<00:05:24.500> and<00:05:24.590> I<00:05:25.220> also<00:05:25.340> have<00:05:25.490> another<00:05:25.640> theory

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
happening and I also have another theory

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.610 
happening and I also have another theory
so<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:26.210> can<00:05:26.390> mentioned<00:05:26.600> earlier<00:05:26.900> Nikolai<00:05:27.380> set<00:05:27.590> a

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
so I can mentioned earlier Nikolai set a

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.590 
so I can mentioned earlier Nikolai set a
great<00:05:27.950> evil<00:05:28.190> could<00:05:28.880> possibly<00:05:29.210> be<00:05:29.330> unleashed

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
great evil could possibly be unleashed

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.150 
great evil could possibly be unleashed
or<00:05:29.750> something<00:05:30.020> like<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.170> I<00:05:30.530> have<00:05:30.800> an<00:05:30.890> entire

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
or something like that I have an entire

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.640 
or something like that I have an entire
theory<00:05:31.490> dedicated<00:05:32.090> to<00:05:32.270> a<00:05:32.510> greater<00:05:33.020> evil<00:05:33.230> being

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
theory dedicated to a greater evil being

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.900 
theory dedicated to a greater evil being
in<00:05:33.770> zombies<00:05:34.130> I<00:05:34.250> think<00:05:34.490> there's<00:05:34.670> something

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
in zombies I think there's something

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.910 
in zombies I think there's something
stronger<00:05:35.540> than<00:05:35.720> Richthofen<00:05:36.500> or<00:05:36.650> Samantha

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
stronger than Richthofen or Samantha

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.740 
stronger than Richthofen or Samantha
could<00:05:37.130> ever<00:05:37.310> dream<00:05:37.640> I<00:05:37.820> think<00:05:38.000> Samantha<00:05:38.540> knows

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
could ever dream I think Samantha knows

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.150 
could ever dream I think Samantha knows
about<00:05:39.020> it<00:05:39.080> so<00:05:39.530> this<00:05:39.620> is<00:05:39.650> gonna<00:05:39.800> be<00:05:39.919> a<00:05:39.980> theory

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
about it so this is gonna be a theory

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.260 
about it so this is gonna be a theory
for<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.340> different<00:05:40.580> video<00:05:40.669> because<00:05:41.060> there's

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
for a different video because there's

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.550 
for a different video because there's
just<00:05:41.450> so<00:05:41.750> much<00:05:41.930> that<00:05:42.110> I<00:05:42.169> want<00:05:42.320> to<00:05:42.380> talk<00:05:42.530> about

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
just so much that I want to talk about

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.080 
just so much that I want to talk about
an<00:05:42.890> itouch<00:05:43.280> want<00:05:43.520> this<00:05:43.610> video<00:05:43.760> to<00:05:43.850> be<00:05:44.000> about

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
an itouch want this video to be about

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.120 
an itouch want this video to be about
the<00:05:44.210> giant<00:05:44.540> but<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.020> have<00:05:45.200> 23<00:05:45.590> videos<00:05:45.770> coming

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
the giant but I have 23 videos coming

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.650 
the giant but I have 23 videos coming
out<00:05:46.190> keep<00:05:46.400> you<00:05:46.460> guys<00:05:46.550> eyes<00:05:46.790> open<00:05:47.120> one<00:05:47.480> of<00:05:47.570> them

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
out keep you guys eyes open one of them

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.970 
out keep you guys eyes open one of them
is<00:05:47.690> about<00:05:47.900> a<00:05:47.930> great<00:05:48.200> evil<00:05:48.410> and<00:05:48.650> zombie

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
is about a great evil and zombie

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.110 
is about a great evil and zombie
something<00:05:49.250> far<00:05:49.490> stronger<00:05:49.790> than<00:05:49.880> we've<00:05:50.060> ever

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
something far stronger than we've ever

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.110 
something far stronger than we've ever
seen<00:05:50.450> and<00:05:51.410> another<00:05:51.800> is<00:05:52.010> about<00:05:52.220> Samantha<00:05:52.730> does

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
seen and another is about Samantha does

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.790 
seen and another is about Samantha does
she<00:05:53.240> still<00:05:53.300> have<00:05:53.450> power<00:05:53.720> what<00:05:54.380> all<00:05:54.500> does<00:05:54.620> she

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
she still have power what all does she

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.320 
she still have power what all does she
know<00:05:54.950> I<00:05:54.980> think<00:05:55.190> she<00:05:55.460> still<00:05:55.640> plays<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.880> big<00:05:56.120> role

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
know I think she still plays a big role

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.120 
know I think she still plays a big role
in<00:05:56.360> zombies<00:05:56.780> I<00:05:56.930> think<00:05:57.230> the<00:05:57.320> giant<00:05:57.680> after<00:05:57.980> we<00:05:58.040> do

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
in zombies I think the giant after we do

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.260 
in zombies I think the giant after we do
the<00:05:58.250> easter<00:05:58.520> egg<00:05:58.640> I<00:05:58.760> think<00:05:59.000> we're<00:05:59.090> going<00:05:59.180> to

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
the easter egg I think we're going to

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.790 
the easter egg I think we're going to
see<00:05:59.300> that<00:05:59.419> it<00:05:59.630> was<00:05:59.720> actually<00:05:59.870> Eddie's<00:06:00.350> turn<00:06:00.560> I

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
see that it was actually Eddie's turn I

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.930 
see that it was actually Eddie's turn I
think<00:06:01.250> we're<00:06:01.370> gonna<00:06:01.460> see<00:06:01.640> that<00:06:01.790> it<00:06:01.850> was

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
think we're gonna see that it was

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.310 
think we're gonna see that it was
actually<00:06:02.060> Eddie<00:06:02.390> playing<00:06:02.780> and<00:06:02.990> then

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
actually Eddie playing and then

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.840 
actually Eddie playing and then
Samantha's<00:06:03.740> gonna<00:06:03.830> take<00:06:04.040> over<00:06:04.160> her<00:06:04.460> turn<00:06:04.700> next

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
Samantha's gonna take over her turn next

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.920 
Samantha's gonna take over her turn next
I<00:06:05.000> think<00:06:05.150> she's<00:06:05.300> gonna<00:06:05.390> keep<00:06:05.570> going<00:06:05.750> back<00:06:05.870> and

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
I think she's gonna keep going back and

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.360 
I think she's gonna keep going back and
forth<00:06:06.230> like<00:06:06.410> that<00:06:06.440> so<00:06:06.710> I<00:06:06.740> think<00:06:06.980> the<00:06:07.130> ending<00:06:07.280> of

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
forth like that so I think the ending of

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.440 
forth like that so I think the ending of
the<00:06:07.430> Johnny<00:06:07.640> strike<00:06:07.940> we're<00:06:08.090> gonna<00:06:08.180> see<00:06:08.330> that

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
the Johnny strike we're gonna see that

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.670 
the Johnny strike we're gonna see that
it<00:06:08.510> was<00:06:08.600> actually<00:06:08.750> Eddie's<00:06:09.080> turn<00:06:09.229> all<00:06:09.410> along

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
it was actually Eddie's turn all along

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.100 
it was actually Eddie's turn all along
and<00:06:09.890> one<00:06:10.580> more<00:06:10.790> thing<00:06:10.820> I<00:06:11.240> fucking<00:06:11.660> called<00:06:11.870> this

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
and one more thing I fucking called this

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.840 
and one more thing I fucking called this
a<00:06:12.290> few<00:06:12.770> guys<00:06:12.860> remember<00:06:13.250> about<00:06:13.400> two<00:06:13.610> years<00:06:13.760> ago

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
a few guys remember about two years ago

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.610 
a few guys remember about two years ago
I<00:06:14.000> made<00:06:14.180> a<00:06:14.210> video<00:06:14.360> and<00:06:14.780> I<00:06:14.960> said<00:06:15.380> that<00:06:15.530> were

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
I made a video and I said that were

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.540 
I made a video and I said that were
going<00:06:15.740> to<00:06:15.800> go<00:06:15.860> back<00:06:16.010> in<00:06:16.130> time<00:06:16.280> and<00:06:16.340> kill

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
going to go back in time and kill

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.490 
going to go back in time and kill
Richthofen<00:06:17.360> I<00:06:17.510> said<00:06:18.050> we<00:06:18.169> were<00:06:18.229> going<00:06:18.320> to<00:06:18.410> go

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
Richthofen I said we were going to go
