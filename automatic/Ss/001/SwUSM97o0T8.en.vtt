00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.899
 it's a big day for amadeus for the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.099
 first time thanks to the support of the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.469
 region of the countries of the Loire 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.780
 this prototype is coming out of aluminum construction sites 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.330
 Navy to couetron to be launched 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.680
 is tested on the Loire it's a step 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.130
 important part of phase 1 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.480
 phase 1 she and she started there 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.609
 three months when the boat arrived 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.670
 in marine alu for transformations 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.050
 and then it will continue until 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.269
 end of September roughly when we will have 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.300
 demonstrated that the whole process what was 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.040
 developed by tome ci works 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.899
 when it's done we start phase 2 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.059
 and here phase 2c the construction of 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.489
 several objective boats with this 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.620
 amphibious ship develop a die 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.610
 collection and refining of algae 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.460
 with pickup on beaches or at sea 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.809
 the trawl concentrate the algae next 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.170
 they are inspired by the system of 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.449
 pump 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.530
 she arrives in the jacuzzi this jacuzzi 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.780
 it's a hot tub that goes 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.059
 allow the sands to settle and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.500
 then they fall into bins and 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.879
 once they are in the bins we 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.220
 compresses a little bit to remove 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.320
 excess seawater because the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.450
 Needs green or red algae are 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.150
 there in sectors as diverse as the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.979
 phytopharmacy fertilizers the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.000
 animal and human nutrition or 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.369
 cosmetics 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.110
 the work started from the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.180
 group the right partners so a 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.700
 naval architect arrco navy a 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.070
 naval shipyard alu navy as if so 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.049
 remediation specialist we also 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.020
 olmix who is he is valuing the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.990
 seaweed the cds sell after and then everything 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.119
 it was coordinated managed by neopolia and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.200
 with substantial support from the region 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.810
 feet still have a point that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.270
 we subsidized 50% of the project there 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.409
 be aware that olmix has 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.380
 expressed a need of 15 thousand tons 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.750
 of green algae in 2015 here is a boat 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.579
 like that he will manage to fish 2500 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 tons a year so we imagine everything from 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.990
 following the potential today is these 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.689
 algae that then the matter that they 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.860
 proliferate on our beaches the idea is 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.229
 so to fight against this 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.850
 proliferation while offering 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.490
 complementary markets to businesses 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.110
 naval sector and especially by creating 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.539
 jobs 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.670
 if the supply is satisfactory 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.280
 in the countries of the Loire the society 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.020
 olmix will reopen his factory to brens and 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.550
 will hire about twenty people 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.550
 to enhance algae
