00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.089
 hi friends now we are here with a 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.370
 of the difficult new missions of 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:07.959
 clover to vary a difficult mission and 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.720
 is three good this mission is called 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:12.550
 chop chop and the first stage is that 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.310
 we have to go to sandy airport 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.740
 short and we must hack a computer 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.900
 is the first stage but let's say that 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.519
 it is divided as two parts because 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.009
 the first part we have to get to 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.449
 eliminate the rivals and after that 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.640
 when we are already hacking the 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.839
 computer when we finish hacking 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.519
 rather the computer are going to get 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.539
 other rivals to whom also 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.670
 we have to eliminate 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.920
 after that we have to grab two 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.480
 helicopters two buses and we have to go 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.879
 where the mission of 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.320
 satellite communications eliminate 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.269
 the rivals there of meriweather and 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.160
 us back to the airport 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.660
 I bring is not in which we are the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.239
 Trevor airport out there for that 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.089
 zone and eliminate more mary guards 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.769
 good web let's start I'm going to put on 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.109
 this part of the map here you have to 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.089
 cover yourself with a car if you can 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.089
 get a car that is a bit more 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.800
 high would be ideal now come in the same 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.659
 map as are two companions who are going to 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.040
 crossing there they just crossed with a 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.030
 car and they are going to put in the part 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.350
 rear 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.690
 let's say that of all these 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.940
 constructions to also attack here 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.860
 to my left side of the screen is 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.590
 another partner who is going to cross his car 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.119
 I was going to start shooting too 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.549
 here we have to coordinate 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.210
 put everyone in position 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.070
 protecting us as well as I am 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.869
 doing with the car and you have to start 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.580
 killing this one has to kill that 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.500
 sniper that is very treacherous and 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.240
 and then we started to liquidate the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.200
 who are here very close to me 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.759
 position 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.100
 we started with all of these that 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.869
 find here close to remove 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.429
 all risk of being killed 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.740
 here appeared another let's remove it 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.770
 quickly and that is what we have to 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.050
 do basically cover the area and now 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.149
 the enemies we have them as he says 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.729
 almost surrounded we are already attacking 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.950
 here we are attacking it in a little more 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.619
 like me and two companions that is the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.470
 chuma and the perfect one went up 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.149
 back to give them fire here too 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.159
 one side of thousands to one that is the one that 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.110
 is also giving fire since 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.819
 let's clear a bit the area you have to have 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.560
 be careful because they keep responding here 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.690
 you have to be very careful because you still 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.459
 let's say they continue to respond and there is no 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.569
 forget that they are from Mayweather and the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.730
 of emery webber are 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.310
 aggressive they have very good marksmanship 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.469
 they have very good weapons and therefore 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.810
 you have to be very careful with this 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.609
 type of enemies that are those of emery 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.459
 webber to vary go these are are 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.409
 gloves that if shot bullet very accurate and 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.200
 Well, let's say you have to have a lot 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.299
 be very careful with them but good 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.459
 we passed the first part here first 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.230
 part is already gone now we are going to 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.329
 prepare to pass the second part 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.040
 to pass the second part we are going to 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.189
 distribute let's say the location of the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.049
 players one player is going to stay here 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.730
 this is the one that is going to stay here we 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.079
 is going to protect let's say that from this 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.150
 position there is going to stay in this 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.699
 door frame and it's going to cover and it's going to 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.230
 protect from that part now our 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:59.079
 friend of chuma is going to stay here in 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.269
 is this car and those things like 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.370
 wood they make like a square and there they 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.739
 can perfectly protect from 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.620
 enemies now the next friend that 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.209
 is helping us is the perfect and he 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.099
 will be there there will start to 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.769
 cover and from there also going to throw 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.900
 bullet to the ruthless go and I'm going to 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.419
 stay in this position when check the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.620
 laptop I'm going to retire from the room and not 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:24.010
 I will put in that position 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.659
 where is that part of wood and then 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.700
 here nothing else you have to tell them they are already 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.739
 prepared all and all are in their 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.900
 ok places we started hacking this 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.180
 because it gets intense then you have to 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.610
 Now you have to ask if you already 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.560
 they are all very prepared and we started 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.440
 create this are let's say it's simple 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.450
 nothing else you have to place horizontal the 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.799
 letters that appear in red and already 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.540
 we have this we have to get out very 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.819
 quickly from here and direct us towards 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.500
 our position that we are going to cover because 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.079
 the enemies start to appear very 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.630
 quickly here I'm going to grab a rpg 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.090
 and I'm going to fly that truck 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.610
 1 we shoot and we eliminate those rivals 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.950
 that were there now I grab a 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.070
 combat machine gun and let's see 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.270
 what enemies can I also liquidate 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.440
 here we see the helicopter that is 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.660
 front I'm going to do a little bit towards 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.670
 left to have angle of shot and 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.530
 start to liquidate it I 'm not going to die 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.780
 the other in the other that I think that 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.310
 they responded there to another enemy not good 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.630
 we are going to use the mini boom and 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.459
 let's go down and we 're going to stop 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.530
 accounts with him with machine gun 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.360
 combat and we eliminate it we already have 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.970
 eliminated this and it seems that already 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.100
 we have controlled the situation here my 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.800
 friends and I already managed to control 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.110
 situation in this part let 's say the map 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.760
 in this part of the mission and now we're going 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.980
 to take the buses that are here 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.410
 nothing more taking care let's say the area there 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.630
 to take care of the situation that is not in 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.820
 high risk because still as there is a 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.520
 character there are two enemies are from 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.440
 very high risk or that character is 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.510
 enemy that shoots you a blast you 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.090
 can kill then nothing else have 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.890
 very careful if when especially in 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.510
 This stage of the mission also has to be 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.490
 identify if there are still some 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.680
 enemies that can betray using by 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.920
 example they can not be betrayed because 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.390
 never 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.980
 they are on our side rather than you 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.350
 they can affect you can shoot 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.410
 direct and they can kill you let's say a 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.970
 burst that's how dangerous the 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.760
 hired assassins of emery webber who are 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.590
 practically very very dangerous now 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.080
 we are already reaching this part where 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.060
 the communications mission is given 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.190
 satellites then here nothing else what 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.840
 what we have to do is shoot many 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.640
 missiles since it fires missiles and you have to 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.710
 keep moving that's very 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.660
 important that we have to maintain 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.610
 the movement of the helicopter does not 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.430
 we have to be quiet because down 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.430
 there are people who have rpg and we are going to 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.740
 suddenly shoot there and to a step one 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.050
 by our right side and the little by little 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.120
 it impacts us then we have to maintain the 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.240
 movement in the helicopter this is 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.340
 basic to achieve let's say be safe 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.380
 of all those rpg is that we are going to 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.970
 winnow the enemies the enemies are 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.130
 very aggressive and because nothing makes 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.440
 keep pace with applying the 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.770
 firing of helicopter missiles 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.860
 of the bus up and here fortunately there are 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.300
 There he already threw a is for a friend 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.100
 we hope that there is no 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.080
 had knocked down no no 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.880
 but then it shows the aggressiveness that 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.130
 they have our merriweather buddies 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.190
 also that are equipped with see there 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.500
 came out terrorism verifies lose good 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.290
 anti-aircraft batteries these guys 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.540
 with your rpp missiles see another one here if it 's 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.150
 be very careful of our 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.860
 part of the mission and the and in the 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.990
 next in which we are going to remove 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.500
 we take care let's say that already protected all 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.990
 that part is already fully protected 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.820
 totally liquidated we are heading now 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.770
 to this warehouse and here we are going to do what 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.080
 same we are going to keep the movement 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.730
 because two buses also arrive and 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.920
 we also have to remove 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.320
 I pass averages of protector because 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.390
 it's good now my friend is going 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.310
 to take care of that Russian and we 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.140
 let's concentrate here on this part 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.660
 eliminate all those on the ground 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.910
 to clear the way and that she 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.100
 conclude the mission the mission is over 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.440
 when already liquidated all those who 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.430
 are on land go then here nothing 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.860
 more what we have to do is 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.260
 concentrate on taking care of those who 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.840
 they are down and then winnowing missiles now 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.430
 yes indiscriminately 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.100
 they will also be down 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:20.470
 equipped with rpg and you can download it in 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.840
 any time then keep the 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.699
 Helicopter movement is essential 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.400
 in this mission we have to move this 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:30.580
 modern if suddenly we see that no 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.199
 we are moving down descend ascend from 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.970
 I hate rather I recommend you to 

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:35.320
 go make movements like lateral 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.479
 because when they make movements 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.460
 lateral let's say that the missiles that 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:40.870
 they shoot them the kings because they are going to them 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.680
 move to the side for the movement that 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:46.000
 they do and the mission is over and 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.090
 let's see how much they are going to give us 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.050
 gave 21,400 in money and three thousand 889 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:55.389
 in erp and well it is a vision that 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.820
 He called it a difficult vision 

00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:59.740
 it's a really difficult vision if you 

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.930
 can support by a musher who throw 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.690
 from the beginning that a friend gets out 

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.340
 of the area let's say and ask to search is 

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.830
 a lot of help 

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.389
 because it's going to help them to go down, let's say 

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.669
 the intensity of the fire that the 

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:14.979
 enemies of emery web well good friends 

00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:19.260
 this was all this was the topshop mission 

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:19.260
 with your new one bye bye
