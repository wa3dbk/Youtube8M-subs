00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.030 
so that is with the two applications it
gave<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:13.819> little<00:03:14.150> bit<00:03:14.390> more<00:03:14.510> volume<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.440> it

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
gave it a little bit more volume and it

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.390 
gave it a little bit more volume and it
didn't<00:03:16.340> clip<00:03:16.519> at<00:03:16.670> all<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:19.069> kept<00:03:19.310> the

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
didn't clip at all and you kept the

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.350 
didn't clip at all and you kept the
lashes<00:03:19.790> pretty<00:03:20.239> separated<00:03:21.459> so<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:22.849> side<00:03:23.090> has

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
lashes pretty separated so this side has

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.990 
lashes pretty separated so this side has
the<00:03:23.390> two<00:03:23.900> applications<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.340> side<00:03:25.610> has

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
the two applications and this side has

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.800 
the two applications and this side has
the<00:03:26.239> one<00:03:26.510> application<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:28.670> noticed<00:03:29.239> when<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.450> did

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
the one application I noticed when I did

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.020 
the one application I noticed when I did
the<00:03:29.959> two<00:03:30.110> applications<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:31.129> did<00:03:31.400> give<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:31.730> a

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
the two applications it did give it a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.289 
the two applications it did give it a
little<00:03:32.360> bit<00:03:32.540> more<00:03:32.720> volume<00:03:33.099> and<00:03:34.099> it<00:03:34.910> kept<00:03:35.120> it

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
little bit more volume and it kept it

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.470 
little bit more volume and it kept it
pretty<00:03:36.140> calm<00:03:36.500> free<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.790> kept<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.090> lashes

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
pretty calm free and it kept the lashes

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.339 
pretty calm free and it kept the lashes
separated

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
separated

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.500 
separated
I<00:03:39.379> like<00:03:40.340> this<00:03:40.549> mascara<00:03:41.560> for<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.730> lengthening

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
I like this mascara for the lengthening

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.619 
I like this mascara for the lengthening
and<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.230> separating<00:03:45.890> I<00:03:46.160> would<00:03:47.150> not<00:03:47.329> recommend

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
and the separating I would not recommend

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.270 
and the separating I would not recommend
this<00:03:47.810> mascara<00:03:48.410> for<00:03:49.129> volume<00:03:51.040> even<00:03:52.040> though<00:03:52.160> it

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
this mascara for volume even though it

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.849 
this mascara for volume even though it
says<00:03:52.519> that<00:03:52.879> it's<00:03:53.120> pumped<00:03:53.720> up<00:03:53.870> colossal<00:03:54.500> volume

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
says that it's pumped up colossal volume

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.539 
says that it's pumped up colossal volume
Express<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:56.200> really<00:03:57.200> don't<00:03:57.859> believe<00:03:58.069> that<00:03:58.129> this

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
Express I really don't believe that this

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.280 
Express I really don't believe that this
does<00:03:58.790> give<00:03:59.090> you<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.239> lot<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.540> volume

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
does give you a lot of volume

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.400 
does give you a lot of volume
I<00:04:00.319> would<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:00.950> would<00:04:01.760> buy<00:04:01.879> this<00:04:01.940> for<00:04:02.780> the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
I would I would buy this for the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.770 
I would I would buy this for the
separating<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.489> lengthening<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.209> then

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
separating and the lengthening and then

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.830 
separating and the lengthening and then
use<00:04:06.170> another<00:04:06.410> good<00:04:07.190> mascara<00:04:07.790> that<00:04:08.299> is<00:04:08.480> really

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
use another good mascara that is really

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.879 
use another good mascara that is really
good<00:04:09.019> for<00:04:09.290> volume<00:04:09.700> like<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:11.500> last<00:04:12.500> review

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889

yeah if you're looking for a good

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.020 
yeah if you're looking for a good
lengthening<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:41.860> separating<00:04:42.860> that<00:04:43.610> doesn't

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
lengthening and separating that doesn't

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.020 
lengthening and separating that doesn't
leave<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:44.389> with<00:04:44.539> out<00:04:45.020> any<00:04:45.289> clumps<00:04:45.860> then<00:04:46.700> I

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
leave you with out any clumps then I

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.060 
leave you with out any clumps then I
would<00:04:47.240> recommend<00:04:47.720> this<00:04:47.900> but<00:04:48.380> even<00:04:48.770> though

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
would recommend this but even though

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.159 
would recommend this but even though
it's<00:04:49.280> packaged<00:04:49.789> for<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.090> volume<00:04:50.419> mascara<00:04:50.599> I

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
it's packaged for a volume mascara I

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.230 
it's packaged for a volume mascara I
really<00:04:51.800> don't<00:04:52.010> believe<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:52.610> gave<00:04:52.789> that

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
really don't believe that it gave that

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.409 
really don't believe that it gave that
much<00:04:53.479> volume<00:04:54.340> compared<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.430> this<00:04:55.550> side<00:04:55.789> it<00:04:56.240> did

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
much volume compared to this side it did

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.240 
much volume compared to this side it did
just<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.840> little<00:04:56.870> bit<00:04:57.380> more<00:04:57.789> but<00:04:58.789> not<00:05:00.099> but<00:05:01.099> not

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
just a little bit more but not but not

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.969 
just a little bit more but not but not
as<00:05:01.460> much<00:05:01.700> as<00:05:01.970> other<00:05:02.710> volume<00:05:03.710> mascaras<00:05:04.580> do<00:05:05.979> so

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
as much as other volume mascaras do so

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.529 
as much as other volume mascaras do so
I'm<00:05:07.370> gonna<00:05:07.490> put<00:05:07.699> it<00:05:07.789> on<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.000> bottom<00:05:08.150> lashes

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310
