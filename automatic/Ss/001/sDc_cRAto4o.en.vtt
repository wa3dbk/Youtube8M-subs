broadening<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.500> out<00:03:18.650> too<00:03:18.980> it's<00:03:19.520> hard<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.880> get

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
broadening it out too it's hard to get

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.540 
broadening it out too it's hard to get
it<00:03:20.240> in<00:03:20.390> one<00:03:20.690> specific<00:03:21.050> area<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.010> mine<00:03:22.250> I

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
it in one specific area and mine I

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.250 
it in one specific area and mine I
definitely<00:03:22.910> stay<00:03:23.180> put<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.720> back<00:03:23.930> like

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
definitely stay put to the back like

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.920 
definitely stay put to the back like
kind<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.560> one<00:03:24.770> when<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.370> say<00:03:25.580> one<00:03:25.730> area<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.030> went

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
kind of one when I say one area I went

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.810 
kind of one when I say one area I went
back<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.140> forth<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.740> saw<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:27.950> stayed<00:03:28.280> behind<00:03:28.430> a

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
back and forth you saw I stayed behind a

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.270 
back and forth you saw I stayed behind a
a<00:03:29.210> lot<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:29.930> then<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:30.380> would<00:03:30.500> extend<00:03:30.860> kind<00:03:31.220> of

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
a lot and then I would extend kind of

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.190 
a lot and then I would extend kind of
behind<00:03:31.460> be<00:03:31.760> in<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.360> back<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.630> resistance<00:03:33.080> if

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
behind be in the back of resistance if

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.450 
behind be in the back of resistance if
you<00:03:33.260> guys<00:03:33.410> know<00:03:33.560> what<00:03:33.590> I'm<00:03:33.710> talking<00:03:33.800> about<00:03:34.130> and

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
you guys know what I'm talking about and

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.730 
you guys know what I'm talking about and
but<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.120> did<00:03:35.360> not<00:03:35.540> overextend<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.410> was<00:03:36.500> hard<00:03:36.650> not

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
but I did not overextend it was hard not

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.860 
but I did not overextend it was hard not
to<00:03:37.130> but<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.670> think<00:03:37.940> that's<00:03:38.120> definitely<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.660> tip

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
to but I think that's definitely the tip

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.010 
to but I think that's definitely the tip
not<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.380> expose<00:03:39.740> yourself<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.310> like<00:03:41.120> 360

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
not to expose yourself to like 360

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.050 
not to expose yourself to like 360
degrees<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.610> possibilities<00:03:43.610> of<00:03:43.640> getting<00:03:43.760> hit

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
degrees of possibilities of getting hit

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.910 
degrees of possibilities of getting hit
exactly<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:44.960> brings<00:03:45.080> me<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.410> our<00:03:45.440> final

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
exactly and that brings me to our final

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.320 
exactly and that brings me to our final
point<00:03:46.220> which<00:03:46.340> is<00:03:46.520> like<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.000> remember<00:03:47.210> guys

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
want to remain to the outskirts of the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.129 
want to remain to the outskirts of the
map<00:04:38.889> not<00:04:39.219> in<00:04:39.340> super<00:04:39.550> wide<00:04:39.819> open<00:04:40.150> areas<00:04:40.479> and<00:04:40.779> you

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
map not in super wide open areas and you

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.209 
map not in super wide open areas and you
just<00:04:41.229> want<00:04:41.379> to<00:04:41.409> make<00:04:41.529> your<00:04:41.680> rounds<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:42.099> know

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
just want to make your rounds you know

you<00:04:44.409> want<00:04:44.560> to<00:04:44.650> also<00:04:44.800> be<00:04:45.099> conscious<00:04:45.490> of<00:04:45.550> the

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
you want to also be conscious of the

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.640 
you want to also be conscious of the
spawns<00:04:45.939> so<00:04:46.509> look<00:04:46.779> on<00:04:46.930> your<00:04:47.050> mini-map<00:04:47.289> we're

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
spawns so look on your mini-map we're

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.559 
spawns so look on your mini-map we're
teammates<00:04:48.099> are<00:04:48.370> um<00:04:48.639> if<00:04:49.090> they're<00:04:49.300> right<00:04:49.449> in

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
teammates are um if they're right in

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.269 
teammates are um if they're right in
front<00:04:49.749> of<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:50.110> know<00:04:50.229> full<00:04:50.560> of<00:04:50.680> 180<00:04:51.039> and

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:51.279 
front of you you know full of 180 and

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:52.559 
front of you you know full of 180 and
turn<00:04:51.430> around<00:04:51.759> and<00:04:51.939> then<00:04:52.029> you'll<00:04:52.150> probably<00:04:52.360> run

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
turn around and then you'll probably run

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.570 
turn around and then you'll probably run
into<00:04:52.749> a<00:04:52.840> group<00:04:53.080> of<00:04:53.139> enemies<00:04:53.469> and<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:54.310> reason

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
into a group of enemies and the reason

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.950 
into a group of enemies and the reason
it's<00:04:54.699> so<00:04:54.759> good<00:04:55.090> is<00:04:55.210> because<00:04:55.240> one<00:04:55.659> in<00:04:55.750> enemy

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
it's so good is because one in enemy

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.050 
it's so good is because one in enemy
spawns<00:04:56.319> they<00:04:57.009> spawn<00:04:57.310> in<00:04:57.430> outskirts<00:04:57.819> of<00:04:57.909> map

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
spawns they spawn in outskirts of map

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.760 
spawns they spawn in outskirts of map
that's<00:04:58.240> how<00:04:58.360> spawns<00:04:58.719> are<00:04:58.810> set<00:04:58.990> up<00:04:59.139> and<00:04:59.319> what

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
that's how spawns are set up and what

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.800 
that's how spawns are set up and what
they<00:04:59.889> do<00:04:59.949> one<00:05:00.610> ninety-nine<00:05:00.879> percent<00:05:01.360> of<00:05:01.659> like

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
they do one ninety-nine percent of like

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.510 
they do one ninety-nine percent of like
the<00:05:01.990> general<00:05:02.349> population<00:05:02.710> does<00:05:03.069> is<00:05:03.279> start

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
the general population does is start

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.860 
the general population does is start
running<00:05:03.879> right<00:05:03.909> towards<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.270> middle<00:05:04.479> so<00:05:04.779> if

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
running right towards the middle so if

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.749 
running right towards the middle so if
you're<00:05:04.930> laughing<00:05:05.319> around<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.590> map<00:05:05.740> um<00:05:06.039> you're

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
you're laughing around the map um you're

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.700 
you're laughing around the map um you're
doing<00:05:07.120> a<00:05:07.300> perpendicular<00:05:07.689> pattern<00:05:08.319> to<00:05:08.560> their

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
doing a perpendicular pattern to their

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.830 
doing a perpendicular pattern to their
general<00:05:09.189> spawn<00:05:09.520> running<00:05:09.939> to<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.180> middle<00:05:10.449> you

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
general spawn running to the middle you

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.329 
general spawn running to the middle you
know<00:05:10.930> it's<00:05:11.050> like<00:05:11.080> a<00:05:11.169> circle<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:11.830> they're<00:05:12.159> like

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:12.339 
know it's like a circle and they're like

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.100 
know it's like a circle and they're like
the<00:05:12.550> lines<00:05:12.789> on<00:05:13.089> a<00:05:13.120> basketball<00:05:13.360> it<00:05:13.870> makes

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
the lines on a basketball it makes

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.450 
the lines on a basketball it makes
pretty<00:05:14.349> easy<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.740> you're<00:05:14.889> also<00:05:14.979> running<00:05:15.250> them

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
pretty easy and you're also running them

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.309 
pretty easy and you're also running them
that<00:05:15.669> you're<00:05:16.150> running<00:05:16.389> into<00:05:16.539> them<00:05:16.719> a<00:05:16.779> lot<00:05:17.050> when

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
that you're running into them a lot when

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.850 
that you're running into them a lot when
they're<00:05:17.500> sideways<00:05:17.949> if<00:05:18.490> it<00:05:18.639> makes<00:05:18.759> any<00:05:18.969> sense

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
they're sideways if it makes any sense

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.829 
sprinting you kind of want to control
your<00:05:26.800> sprinting<00:05:27.159> I<00:05:27.250> know<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.430> love<00:05:28.360> to<00:05:28.599> spray

your sprinting I know I love to spray
and<00:05:28.990> I<00:05:29.050> sprint<00:05:29.379> like<00:05:29.439> every<00:05:29.770> other<00:05:29.860> second

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
and I sprint like every other second

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.279 
and I sprint like every other second

actually we haven't do socks God so

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.149 
actually we haven't do socks God so
check<00:05:34.449> it<00:05:34.479> out<00:05:34.659> so<00:05:34.900> check<00:05:35.080> that<00:05:35.139> out<00:05:35.319> um<00:05:35.710> but<00:05:35.979> I

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
check it out so check that out um but I

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.159 
check it out so check that out um but I
mean<00:05:36.399> I'll<00:05:36.580> sprint<00:05:37.000> for<00:05:37.180> like<00:05:37.300> one<00:05:37.539> step<00:05:37.839> and<00:05:38.080> I

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
mean I'll sprint for like one step and I

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.899 
mean I'll sprint for like one step and I
guess<00:05:38.620> I'm<00:05:38.770> just<00:05:38.860> paranoid<00:05:39.039> like<00:05:39.339> click<00:05:39.610> look

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
guess I'm just paranoid like click look

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:41.850 
guess I'm just paranoid like click look
left<00:05:40.120> click<00:05:40.449> like<00:05:40.930> to<00:05:40.960> sprint<00:05:41.439> all<00:05:41.560> the<00:05:41.589> time

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
left click like to sprint all the time

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.920 
left click like to sprint all the time
but<00:05:42.099> even<00:05:42.789> if<00:05:42.909> you<00:05:43.060> have<00:05:43.240> sleight<00:05:43.479> of<00:05:43.509> hand<00:05:43.779> and

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
but even if you have sleight of hand and

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.110 
but even if you have sleight of hand and
steady<00:05:44.379> aim<00:05:44.589> pro<00:05:44.620> and<00:05:45.129> quick<00:05:45.399> draw<00:05:45.610> all<00:05:45.819> the

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
steady aim pro and quick draw all the

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
things that kind of help either hip

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.399 
things that kind of help either hip
firing<00:05:47.919> or<00:05:48.250> bringing<00:05:49.210> your<00:05:49.389> gun<00:05:49.569> up<00:05:49.689> faster<00:05:50.139> or

firing or bringing your gun up faster or
coming<00:05:50.740> up<00:05:50.860> at<00:05:51.009> pester<00:05:51.310> after<00:05:51.550> sprinting<00:05:52.479> all

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
coming up at pester after sprinting all

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.170 
coming up at pester after sprinting all
that<00:05:53.020> it's<00:05:53.620> still<00:05:54.099> definitely<00:05:54.639> there's<00:05:55.120> a

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
that it's still definitely there's a

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.899 
that it's still definitely there's a
time<00:05:55.599> differential<00:05:56.199> so<00:05:56.710> like<00:05:57.129> if<00:05:57.159> you<00:05:57.729> watch

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
time differential so like if you watch

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:59.610 
time differential so like if you watch
tube<00:05:58.240> socks<00:05:58.539> I<00:05:58.689> know<00:05:58.750> it's<00:05:58.990> just<00:05:59.080> watching<00:05:59.469> his
