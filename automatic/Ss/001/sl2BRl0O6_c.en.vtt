see on screen right now I use Ruby bolts

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.640 
see on screen right now I use Ruby bolts
for<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:30.789> first<00:00:31.060> two<00:00:31.300> waves<00:00:31.599> for<00:00:31.960> respect<00:00:32.500> and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
for the first two waves for respect and

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.889 
for the first two waves for respect and
then<00:00:33.130> dragonbane<00:00:33.790> bolts<00:00:34.210> to<00:00:34.420> give<00:00:34.629> huge

first two phases the Ruby spec doesn't

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.029 
first two phases the Ruby spec doesn't
hit<00:00:40.149> as<00:00:40.329> much<00:00:40.539> because<00:00:40.750> her<00:00:41.170> total<00:00:41.559> health<00:00:41.800> is

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
hit as much because her total health is

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.940 
hit as much because her total health is
low<00:00:42.280> now<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:43.510> to<00:00:43.719> summon<00:00:44.110> flasks<00:00:44.620> are<00:00:44.770> to

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
about the super rare drop for the moment

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.580 
about the super rare drop for the moment
because<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.450> main<00:01:46.630> problem<00:01:47.170> was<00:01:47.290> how<00:01:47.530> many

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
because the main problem was how many

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.160 
because the main problem was how many
times<00:01:48.100> I<00:01:48.370> dyed<00:01:48.430> /<00:01:49.000> kill<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.450> start<00:01:49.720> with<00:01:49.900> but

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
times I dyed / kill to start with but

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.710 
times I dyed / kill to start with but
with<00:01:50.320> experience<00:01:50.920> this<00:01:51.550> is<00:01:51.820> very<00:01:52.240> low<00:01:52.480> now

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
with experience this is very low now

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.810
