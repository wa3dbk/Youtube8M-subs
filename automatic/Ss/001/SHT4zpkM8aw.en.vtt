00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.379
 foot and that honda people 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.089
 I'm here again and this time brought a top-10 of gamecube games 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.550
 and remember, it's my fucking opinion, so if you do not like it, take it for ass 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.230
 this top will be like the one I made of ps2 qualifies for graphics history and 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.519
 good gameplay let's start 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.519
 Good morning, extend the closure 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.140
 Sergio Sanchez have failed model was killed and only remains as only 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.140
 relative living in the house of his grandfather will find a 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.950
 which will go up to some chapters of the history of his family in total 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.670
 12 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.620
 the game is something short but it really makes your clothes dirty you're very 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.850
 Terrifying control is a bit strange but it responds well and after a while 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.040
 you get used to the graphics are good the characters are very good 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.290
 designed and the quality of the textures is also good 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.480
 graphic ads 8 gameplay 7 story 8 good has been enough 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.430
 number nine 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.630
 it's really fun to be playing in shipyards area although the truth is 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260
 better is mario kart like 64 and 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.310
 13 in this game go four cups with 401 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.250
 the game has no history 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.860
 the graphics are also good and the gameplay also although the control 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.870
 of the game cube for racing games are almost equally conditioned 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.530
 that the chairlifts and this looks more like that of ps 2 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.530
 waters with getting used to it is fun to play said 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.300
 in the executive phase mother but after a while it bores because that's in this 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.500
 put in 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.310
 the graphics eight stories and with dovizioso gameplay when we pass 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.340
 eight days 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.250
 Number 8 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.540
 resident evil zero 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.850
 well this game I had never played until recently I'm playing all 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.720
 the resident evil and I started with this one without gambling the game is very good a 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.159
 little confusing the story but you understand the others better as 1 on 2 and 3 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.230
 the graphics are very good they are 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.100
 10 are very well made and the main characters like rebecca hall 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.830
 and also 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.950
 the classic Resident Evil gameplay with a control that responds very 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.730
 well with illusion graphics 9 gameplay 2d story eight let's move on 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.700
 next number 7 medtronic 30 this game is the host are very thin 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.450
 Even though it does not have a lot of argument, it is very funny, it has good graphics, 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.329
 Gameplay is good and it's long and difficult 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.370
 a challenge here you have to get choshuenco pieces like cojones 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:38.349
 call if you have to go today get this game is very good do not let them 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.489
 I say how it ends because if I'm not going to shit them good in conclusion graphics 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.769
 skill 8 story 8 points 5 let's move on 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.040
 number 6 pikmin in this game we control the captain olimar of shit 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.810
 and its moments that are called pikmin the game has good difficulty 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.940
 good weather effects and good graphics the game looks like me 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.660
 game that nintendo presented in the e3 of who knows that click year hahaha that is 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.300
 called mario 128 that were 128 neighborhoods on top of a game cube running like 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.420
 true mentally retarded good the story begins when you hit a 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.230
 meteorite and the ship falls to the ground but the captain olimar can not survive 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.690
 on earth more than 30 days and you have until then to rebuild tuna from 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.910
 Fuck you in conclusion graphics 8 points 5 gameplay 8 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.880
 points 5 story 8 let's move on to the next 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.169
 the number five 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.779
 resident evil 4 maybe some of you send me to hell for putting 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:38.709
 this great game in this position but let them tell you why the game has 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.230
 great graphics 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.030
 good story and good gameplay but it is vicious and after spending about 50 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.159
 sometimes it starts to bore just for that 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.959
 but it's a great game no one says no 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.289
 conclusion graphics 10 gameplay is already history 8 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:57.469
 number four of legend of zelda the wind waker this game is the host 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.959
 I thought it would be crap just to see it but I did not play and I liked it a lot 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.689
 although sometimes it's a bit boring to go traveling in the sea, the game has 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.469
 good playability but what I do not like about zelda games is that 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.790
 You can jump only when you run to an edge and that makes me a bit weird 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:18.410
 but it is a matter of getting used to the game it is quite difficult I shit on the whore 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:22.430
 mother the second mission where are you going to the skull or death island or how 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.460
 fuck you call 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.210
 return and return 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.280
 so more laps 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.200
 I was about to send the ball shit but after a while I could pass 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.770
 something that also my mother shit but that has nothing to do with 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.990
 at stake but I almost finished the game and chad 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.509
 they are woven with memory and 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:39.530
 I sent everything to hell 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.300
 she thinks something was done to me 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.800
 the game the fucking trips the whores caves and those shits 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:50.900
 Eleven soldiers travel to Japan or in conclusion graphics 7 gameplay 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.279
 nine story 9 let's move on to the next 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:54.939
 number 3 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.479
 maiso 'paper mario' and the millennial door in this game we will be the 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.289
 nintendo plumber in a new adventure where the team x rat to the 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.409
 bitch princess bicycles pitch and also want to own the crystals 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.759
 stellar stones are mario must gather to open a door that 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.689
 is under villaviciosa or as shit is called the game has good 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.039
 gameplay and plot is one of the rpgs that I liked the most obvious with 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.669
 exceptions to me I almost do not like rpgs but this one is very good since 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.259
 do not program the attack as it is done in other rpgs you also have to do 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.289
 sequences of buttons and make movements with it historical as 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.169
 graphics 6 gameplay and it's story 9 number 2 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:41.550
 super smash bros mane I think that many were already waiting for this great game has 

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.139
 a great gameplay 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.259
 good graphics and has no history and sad but that does not stop being a 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:52.160
 played in this game we can choose about 25 characters and 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:56.830
 sad of the best sagas of nintendo is very very very very fun to play it with 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.830
 friends it's kind of hard to unlock some avenues and some people 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.360
 3 as the point of view of the sea lorenzo sands as the one of tank and with 64 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.270
 you have to contribute 15 minutes worth of shit 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.250
 taking the shit out of the male and female characters that are like 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.940
 humanoids but in spite of that we are doing in the game in conclusion 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.280
 classics of its gameplay and it's history 6 we pass alamedas those that already 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.400
 there has been a boy who does not want there exists 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.219
 number one legend of zelda twilight princess good no doubt a masterpiece 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.879
 without much to say just a fantastic word 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:32.620
 the best 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.620
 gamecube cell and the best game for the console according to me and if you do not think 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.700
 so take your mouse that you are sure is holding right now and gobble it up with 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.930
 your ass and if this data is good then you have more luck as the game is 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.500
 great many good things to highlight 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.150
 like his impeccable graphics adding so responsive and his great argument 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.610
 as graphics are playable feet and it's history and just like I told them is my 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.530
 opinion asi ke 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.960
 who does not like it you can go fuck your career 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.490
 I do not hope you liked it 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.159
 until next time
