hey<00:00:00.299> what's<00:00:00.630> up<00:00:00.750> their<00:00:00.960> diesel<00:00:01.110> first<00:00:01.560> today

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
hey what's up their diesel first today

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.409 
hey what's up their diesel first today
question<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.370> you<00:00:02.429> can<00:00:02.580> find<00:00:02.820> that<00:00:02.970> this<00:00:03.210> the

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
question how you can find that this the

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.809 
question how you can find that this the
bad<00:00:03.629> fuel<00:00:03.990> injector<00:00:04.470> so<00:00:05.220> whether<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.700> have<00:00:05.730> a

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
bad fuel injector so whether you have a

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.670 
bad fuel injector so whether you have a
misfire<00:00:06.240> I'm<00:00:06.390> trying<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.660> see<00:00:06.810> if<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.319> fuel

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
misfire I'm trying to see if the fuel

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.200 
misfire I'm trying to see if the fuel
injector<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.160> problem<00:00:08.519> or<00:00:08.639> maybe<00:00:09.059> you

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
injector is the problem or maybe you

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.490 
injector is the problem or maybe you
have<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.360> check<00:00:09.540> engine<00:00:09.690> light<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.320> code

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
have a check engine light and the code

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.680 
have a check engine light and the code
is<00:00:10.679> for<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.920> open<00:00:11.730> circuit<00:00:12.090> or<00:00:12.120> bad<00:00:12.420> fuel

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
is for a open circuit or bad fuel

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.480 
is for a open circuit or bad fuel
injector<00:00:13.049> there<00:00:13.230> are<00:00:13.320> two<00:00:13.590> ways<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.280> do

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
injector there are two ways that I do

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.519 
injector there are two ways that I do
the<00:00:14.639> software<00:00:15.000> can<00:00:15.540> test<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> fuel<00:00:16.109> injector

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the software can test the fuel injector

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.439 
the software can test the fuel injector
and<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.279> first<00:00:17.550> method<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.000> basically<00:00:18.150> a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
and the first method is basically a

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.660 
and the first method is basically a
sound<00:00:18.750> test<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.380> your<00:00:20.130> fuel<00:00:20.369> indicative

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
sound test as your fuel indicative

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.640 
sound test as your fuel indicative
becomes<00:00:21.029> activated<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.810> then<00:00:21.930> deactivated

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
becomes activated and then deactivated

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.220 
becomes activated and then deactivated
by<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.859> post<00:00:23.160> signal<00:00:23.519> from<00:00:23.670> your<00:00:23.820> ECU<00:00:24.119> if<00:00:24.990> it's

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
by the post signal from your ECU if it's

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.230 
by the post signal from your ECU if it's
working<00:00:25.439> properly<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.609> needle<00:00:26.970> or<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
working properly the needle or the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.849 
working properly the needle or the
pencil<00:00:27.449> that's<00:00:27.720> inside<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.289> fuel<00:00:28.590> injector

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
pencil that's inside this fuel injector

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.169 
pencil that's inside this fuel injector
as<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.070> moves<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.519> down<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.880> creates<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
as it moves up and down it creates a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.030 
as it moves up and down it creates a
ticking<00:00:30.480> sound<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.439> pretty<00:00:31.590> much<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:31.949> you

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
ticking sound so pretty much all you

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.530 
ticking sound so pretty much all you
have<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.579> figure<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.969> way<00:00:33.180> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
have to do is just figure out a way to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.090 
have to do is just figure out a way to
check<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.230> ticking<00:00:34.530> sound<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.950> should

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
check for the ticking sound that should

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.500 
check for the ticking sound that should
be<00:00:35.219> coming<00:00:35.460> from<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.670> good<00:00:35.790> working<00:00:36.210> fuel

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
be coming from a good working fuel

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.049 
be coming from a good working fuel
injector<00:00:36.950> with<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> car<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> engine

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
injector with the car on and the engine

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.819 
injector with the car on and the engine
running<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.930> probably<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> best<00:00:40.620> tool<00:00:40.800> for

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
running now probably the best tool for

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.740 
running now probably the best tool for
the<00:00:41.010> job<00:00:41.100> would<00:00:41.370> be<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> mechanic<00:00:42.180> stethoscope

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the job would be a mechanic stethoscope

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.330 
the job would be a mechanic stethoscope
like<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.020> got<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.190> at

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
you're trying to check fuel injectors

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.139 
you're trying to check fuel injectors
that<00:00:50.219> are<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> hard-to-reach<00:00:50.820> place

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that are in a hard-to-reach place

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.299 
that are in a hard-to-reach place
basically<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> put<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.980> turn

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
basically just have to put this on turn

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.790 
basically just have to put this on turn
on<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.550> engine<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.930> end<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
on the engine and I get this end on the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.010 
on the engine and I get this end on the
base<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.460> fuel<00:00:56.879> injector<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.480> then

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
base of the fuel injector and then

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.840 
base of the fuel injector and then
listen<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.590> ticking<00:00:58.859> sound<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:59.699> if<00:00:59.789> you

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
listen for that ticking sound now if you

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.770 
listen for that ticking sound now if you
don't<00:00:59.910> want<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> go<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.570> buy<00:01:00.750> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
don't want to go out and buy a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450 
don't want to go out and buy a
stethoscope<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.649> also<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:01.980> use<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> long

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
stethoscope you can also just use a long

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.429 
stethoscope you can also just use a long
screwdriver<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.750> basically<00:01:03.960> use<00:01:04.350> this

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
screwdriver and you basically use this

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.810 
screwdriver and you basically use this
in<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.710> similar<00:01:04.949> fashion<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> stethoscope

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
in a similar fashion to the stethoscope

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.420 
in a similar fashion to the stethoscope
with<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> engine<00:01:06.780> running<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.189> end

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
with the engine running you get this end

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.609 
with the engine running you get this end
of<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.150> fuel<00:01:09.360> injector<00:01:09.810> itself<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
of it on the fuel injector itself and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.590 
of it on the fuel injector itself and
then<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.340> put<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> other<00:01:11.760> end<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.180> your<00:01:12.210> ear

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
then just put the other end to your ear

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.359 
then just put the other end to your ear
and<00:01:12.810> then<00:01:13.229> listen<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> thinking<00:01:14.130> sound

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and then listen for the thinking sound

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850 
and then listen for the thinking sound
and<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.909> will<00:01:15.090> hear<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.689> will<00:01:15.930> work<00:01:16.110> in

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
and you will hear it this will work in

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.289 
and you will hear it this will work in
fact<00:01:17.100> I'm<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.460> turn<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> engine<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
fact I'm going to turn on the engine and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.450 
fact I'm going to turn on the engine and
put<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> Cendant<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> mic<00:01:20.070> that's<00:01:20.250> on

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
put the Cendant on the mic that's on

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.830 
put the Cendant on the mic that's on
this<00:01:20.640> camera<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.180> hopefully<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.570> guys<00:01:21.630> can

hear<00:01:21.960> through<00:01:22.170> your<00:01:22.290> soul

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.990 

my<00:01:28.300> friend<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.720> near

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.970 

all<00:01:33.720> right<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.050> use<00:01:34.350> variable<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
all right so I use variable to do the

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.560 
all right so I use variable to do the
ticking<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:35.760> you<00:01:35.880> read<00:01:36.060> you're<00:01:36.330> basically

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
ticking but if you read you're basically

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.150 
ticking but if you read you're basically
looking<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:36.870> a<00:01:36.990> consistent<00:01:37.350> ticking<00:01:37.890> sound

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
looking for a consistent ticking sound

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.220 
looking for a consistent ticking sound
and<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:39.000> know<00:01:39.120> I<00:01:39.150> watching<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.750> injectors<00:01:40.140> I

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
and you know I watching the injectors I

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.660 
and you know I watching the injectors I
suspect<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.710> bad<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.130> also<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> other

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
suspect this bad but also all the other

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.360 
suspect this bad but also all the other
injectors<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.480> just<00:01:43.320> compare<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.800> frequency

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
injectors and just compare the frequency

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.160 
injectors and just compare the frequency
and<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.610> loudness<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.330> ticking<00:01:45.750> between

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and the loudness of the ticking between

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530 
and the loudness of the ticking between
all<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.410> injectors<00:01:46.800> and<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.940> know<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.420> know

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
all the injectors and you know you know

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.820 
all the injectors and you know you know
loudness<00:01:48.900> is<00:01:49.050> also<00:01:49.320> important<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:49.680> you

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
loudness is also important because you

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.350 
loudness is also important because you
don't<00:01:49.890> want<00:01:49.980> why<00:01:50.220> injector<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.760> be<00:01:50.910> super<00:01:51.210> loud

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
don't want why injector to be super loud

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.580 
don't want why injector to be super loud
compared<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> other<00:01:52.080> ones<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
compared to the other ones because the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.860 
compared to the other ones because the
loud<00:01:52.800> injector<00:01:53.340> could<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> sign<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.480> a<00:01:54.690> bad

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
loud injector could be a sign of a bad

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.290 
loud injector could be a sign of a bad
injector<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.590> an<00:01:55.950> injector<00:01:56.400> that's<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:57.180> its

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
injector or an injector that's on its

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.330 
injector or an injector that's on its
way<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:58.380> second<00:01:58.710> method<00:01:58.830> for<00:01:58.980> testing

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
way out and a second method for testing

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.650 
way out and a second method for testing
your<00:01:59.580> fuel<00:01:59.820> injector<00:02:00.120> is<00:02:00.240> going<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.510> using

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
your fuel injector is going to be using

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.560 
your fuel injector is going to be using
a<00:02:00.930> multimeter<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:02.010> do<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> resistance<00:02:02.730> test<00:02:02.970> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
a multimeter to do a resistance test and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.880 
a multimeter to do a resistance test and
again<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.230> with<00:02:04.380> any<00:02:04.500> basic

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
again you can do this with any basic

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.800 
again you can do this with any basic
multimeter<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.700> these<00:02:05.910> basic<00:02:06.240> multimeters

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
multimeter and these basic multimeters

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.330 
multimeter and these basic multimeters
you<00:02:07.080> can<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.350> them<00:02:07.470> for<00:02:07.619> as<00:02:07.710> little<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:08.040> 6

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you can get them for as little as 6

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.520 
you can get them for as little as 6

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
bucks at Harbor Freight so what you want

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.170 
bucks at Harbor Freight so what you want
to<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.979> put<00:02:11.340> your<00:02:11.459> settings<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.910> ohms

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
to do is to put your settings to ohms

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.930 
to do is to put your settings to ohms
and<00:02:12.600> we're<00:02:13.500> going<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> choose<00:02:13.800> 200<00:02:14.490> since<00:02:14.760> our

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and we're going to choose 200 since our

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.610 
and we're going to choose 200 since our
readings<00:02:15.240> are<00:02:15.360> going<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.600> be<00:02:15.720> way<00:02:16.170> less<00:02:16.380> than

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
readings are going to be way less than

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.340 
readings are going to be way less than
that<00:02:16.770> 200<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:18.390> next<00:02:18.630> we<00:02:18.810> look<00:02:19.020> into<00:02:19.110> your

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
that 200 so next we look into your

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.740 
that 200 so next we look into your
repair<00:02:19.620> manual<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.160> look<00:02:20.340> up<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.640> spec<00:02:21.180> for

but<00:02:23.910> generally<00:02:24.630> speaking<00:02:24.959> you're<00:02:25.470> depending

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
but generally speaking you're depending

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.440 
but generally speaking you're depending
on<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> type<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.610> fuel<00:02:26.820> injector<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.330> have

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
on the type of fuel injector you have

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.570 
on the type of fuel injector you have
you<00:02:27.750> either<00:02:27.870> your<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.770> resistance<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.400> going

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
you either your the resistance is going

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.290 
you either your the resistance is going

else we can do is just check all of your
injectors<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.130> look<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.030> odd<00:02:42.150> one

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
injectors and just look for the odd one

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.449 
injectors and just look for the odd one
out<00:02:42.450> like<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:42.989> they<00:02:43.080> all<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.350> them<00:02:43.470> have<00:02:43.709> about

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
out like if they all of them have about

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.150 
out like if they all of them have about
13<00:02:44.970> ohms<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.780> resistance<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.500> one<00:02:46.709> has<00:02:46.890> about

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
like 45 where no resistance at all then

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.190 
like 45 where no resistance at all then
you've<00:02:50.430> probably<00:02:50.700> found<00:02:50.940> your<00:02:51.180> problem<00:02:51.480> now

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
you've probably found your problem now

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.990 
you've probably found your problem now
don't<00:02:52.440> expect<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:52.920> these<00:02:53.130> injectors<00:02:53.700> but

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
don't expect for these injectors but

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.190 
don't expect for these injectors but
we'll<00:02:54.330> do<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.480> bunch<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.810> them<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.110> then

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
we'll do a bunch of them and then

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.380 
we'll do a bunch of them and then
compare<00:02:55.620> them<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.430> here<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.940> first<00:02:57.300> one

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
compare them so here on this first one

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.420 
compare them so here on this first one
we<00:02:57.720> got<00:02:57.870> about<00:02:58.800> fifteen<00:02:59.280> point<00:02:59.489> three<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:02.310> get

15.2<00:03:15.130> on<00:03:15.250> this<00:03:15.370> one<00:03:15.520> as<00:03:15.640> well<00:03:15.820> all<00:03:16.510> right<00:03:16.570> so<00:03:16.840> as

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
15.2 on this one as well all right so as

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.330 
15.2 on this one as well all right so as
you<00:03:16.990> saw<00:03:17.230> all<00:03:17.380> of<00:03:17.560> them<00:03:17.740> have<00:03:17.890> pretty<00:03:18.040> much<00:03:18.130> the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
you saw all of them have pretty much the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.610 
you saw all of them have pretty much the
same<00:03:18.520> resistance<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:19.330> I<00:03:19.570> would<00:03:20.170> say<00:03:20.320> all<00:03:20.470> these

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
same resistance so I would say all these

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.440 
same resistance so I would say all these
injectors<00:03:21.160> would<00:03:21.340> pass<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.760> resistance<00:03:22.210> test

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
injectors would pass the resistance test

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.570 
injectors would pass the resistance test
alright<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.530> two<00:03:23.770> tests<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.250> do<00:03:24.460> this

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
alright so the two tests that I do this

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.130 
alright so the two tests that I do this
offer<00:03:24.820> at<00:03:25.030> home<00:03:25.180> can<00:03:25.390> perform<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.870> see<00:03:25.990> whether

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
offer at home can perform to see whether

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.570 
offer at home can perform to see whether
that<00:03:26.290> they<00:03:26.410> have<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.590> bad<00:03:26.830> fuel<00:03:27.160> injector<00:03:27.520> or

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
that they have a bad fuel injector or

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.400 
that they have a bad fuel injector or
not<00:03:27.760> but<00:03:28.030> before<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.780> condemn<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.140> fuel

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
not but before you condemn a fuel

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.950 
not but before you condemn a fuel
injector<00:03:29.770> and<00:03:29.920> try<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.250> replace<00:03:30.520> it

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
injector and try to replace it

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.270 
injector and try to replace it
especially<00:03:31.960> if<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.320> maybe<00:03:32.650> failed<00:03:33.010> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
especially if it maybe failed the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.820 
especially if it maybe failed the
ticking<00:03:34.120> sound<00:03:34.300> test<00:03:35.020> but<00:03:35.350> past<00:03:35.620> the

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
ticking sound test but past the

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.740 
ticking sound test but past the
resistance<00:03:36.310> test<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:37.270> want<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.480> make<00:03:37.570> sure

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
resistance test you want to make sure

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.930 
resistance test you want to make sure
that<00:03:37.900> that<00:03:38.620> injector<00:03:39.190> is<00:03:39.310> actually<00:03:39.610> receiving

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
that that injector is actually receiving

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.820 
that that injector is actually receiving
your<00:03:40.150> post<00:03:40.450> signal<00:03:40.780> from<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.110> ECU<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.710> be

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
your post signal from you ECU to be

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.220 
your post signal from you ECU to be
activated<00:03:42.250> because<00:03:43.180> if<00:03:43.390> it's<00:03:43.540> not<00:03:43.600> receiving

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
activated because if it's not receiving

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.440 
activated because if it's not receiving
voltage<00:03:44.650> or<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:44.920> pulse<00:03:45.310> signal<00:03:45.520> it's<00:03:46.270> just

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
to make the ticking sound and the way

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.240 
to make the ticking sound and the way
you<00:03:49.840> do<00:03:50.050> this<00:03:50.110> is<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.560> want<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.800> remove<00:03:51.070> the

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
you do this is you want to remove the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.250 
you do this is you want to remove the
connector<00:03:51.700> that's<00:03:51.850> for<00:03:52.090> your<00:03:52.240> fuel<00:03:52.750> injector

these<00:04:14.440> light<00:04:14.980> bulbs<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.400> they'll<00:04:15.580> be<00:04:15.760> there

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
these light bulbs and they'll be there

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.539 
these light bulbs and they'll be there
stop<00:04:16.300> thinking<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.170> that's<00:04:18.160> how<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:18.340> know

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
stop thinking and that's how you know

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.640 
stop thinking and that's how you know
the<00:04:18.760> connector<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.900> wiring<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.350> they<00:04:20.500> see

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
the connector the wiring and they see

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.380 
the connector the wiring and they see
you<00:04:20.920> are<00:04:21.010> doing<00:04:21.220> their<00:04:21.370> job<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:21.850> signals

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
you are doing their job and signals

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.520 
you are doing their job and signals
getting<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:22.840> connector<00:04:23.290> for<00:04:23.440> your

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
getting to that connector for your

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.740 
getting to that connector for your
injector<00:04:24.010> but<00:04:24.820> since<00:04:25.210> you're<00:04:25.330> not<00:04:25.450> hearing<00:04:25.630> a

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
injector but since you're not hearing a

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.350 
injector but since you're not hearing a
ticking<00:04:26.080> sound<00:04:26.830> from<00:04:27.580> your<00:04:27.700> injector<00:04:28.060> maybe

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
ticking sound from your injector maybe

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.080 
ticking sound from your injector maybe
it<00:04:28.600> also<00:04:28.750> failed<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.830> resistance<00:04:30.640> test<00:04:30.850> and

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
it also failed the resistance test and

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.610 
it also failed the resistance test and
then<00:04:31.210> you<00:04:31.240> verified<00:04:31.810> that<00:04:31.990> that's<00:04:32.260> indeed<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
then you verified that that's indeed the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.410 
then you verified that that's indeed the
injector<00:04:33.070> that's<00:04:33.250> bad<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.700> not<00:04:34.240> the

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
injector that's bad and not the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.270 
injector that's bad and not the
connector<00:04:34.870> within<00:04:35.200> your<00:04:35.350> ECU<00:04:35.680> or<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.070> wiring

connector within your ECU or the wiring

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.460 
connector within your ECU or the wiring
and<00:04:36.610> with<00:04:37.600> that<00:04:37.750> set<00:04:37.930> kind<00:04:38.140> of<00:04:38.200> wrap<00:04:38.320> this

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
and with that set kind of wrap this

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.960 
and with that set kind of wrap this
video<00:04:38.620> up<00:04:38.860> but<00:04:39.220> you<00:04:39.490> want<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.640> make<00:04:39.760> sure<00:04:39.880> you
