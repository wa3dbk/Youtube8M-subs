00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 the staff plus a video here for you is 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.120
 I changed the rear disc of the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.889
 record 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.550
 I put the 160 disc and it's doing 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:22.650
 a ride I've already rode and 15 kilometers 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:26.189
 is to put these passers-by here 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:33.090
 also had to change these 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:36.989
 two screws that are safe is ours and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.379
 now that the tablet has settled on the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.350
 the brake disc was very good very good 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.579
 same point of being made at one 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 little and you can even brake the wheel can 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.430
 drag is however as it is with the a 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.120
 locking tendency is lower 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.100
 it's done and efficient so I'd say 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.370
 that I got 100% of what I can 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.439
 have to brake for that bike 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.270
 It was really good 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.490
 the front brake is just a 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.890
 spacer as I have already shown in another 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.650
 video 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.520
 so it has a set of brake now 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.619
 mechanical to disk everything you can 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.610
 to be done I believe without changing 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.610
 nothing is the disk you find in the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.640
 bicycles for about fifteen reais more 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.119
 or less have looked and recommend you 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.610
 buy a bike because buying 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.590
 over the internet plus you pay the freight 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.470
 if you have a warped disc cvt pain 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.509
 head will not be able to install 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.979
 to leave working properly goes 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:53.549
 I can talk but it will not work 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:56.100
 how it should work and also attacks this 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.759
 ratchet was very good with very good 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:06.270
 even for strong climbs and drinks 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:11.970
 I recommend to anyone who wants to 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.440
 land right there and that all I did 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.800
 I 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.570
 I had success I succeeded and went well 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:26.610
 comings and never has so much is now only 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:29.810
 the suspension even if it does not help 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.630
 lubricate what you had to do and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.270
 to get dirt road on the road 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.310
 with enough hole 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:45.930
 no use walking on the road 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.820
 land with enough hole you there you 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.750
 sees that you really need a 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.210
 better suspension for walking on asphalt is 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.990
 street without any holes or need 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.150
 suspension has no need but in a 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.780
 dirt road hole even you 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.880
 needs and has stability with the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.200
 hand on the handlebars in order to stop a 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.210
 descent 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.780
 so it's not just my next acquisition 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:19.050
 that thinking well a model a way 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.810
 our legal intention the next I believe 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.420
 that is the march exchangers up 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.510
 because I need to pass this exchanger 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:32.450
 another bike that is bad and I 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.840
 I want you 111 rapid fire to power 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.930
 evolve 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.640
 There's also a new one here. 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.140
 also and even changed for another 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:49.380
 I was going out, I'm going to change here for another month. 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:52.350
 or less what I recommend this change 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.420
 the investment was low for me 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.019
 the bolt cost 35 cents 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:03.600
 passers-by I got it for free and the 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.920
 in 160 you will spend and neither will 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.000
 20 reais 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.000
 if buying everything is a great change 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.350
 There are people who talk like this, but you 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.360
 buys a crappy bicycle that does not 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.630
 works right 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.820
 only that person for five hundred six hundred 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.240
 What are you going to buy? 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.120
 in fact up to one thousand reais 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.070
 you buy today what kind of 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.890
 bicycle bike the effective in 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.460
 beginner whatever it is I'm doing 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:15.750
 a harder use but I'm having 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:19.290
 Success I already played the 600km school 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:23.490
 more or less a little bit now and not 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:28.050
 they were neither a tire just having fun 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:31.440
 same and third things very good 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:35.250
 I knew the product I was going to get 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.669
 I knew that a cool bicycle is 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:43.650
 from 12 thousand in all items of 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:45.780
 quality and then I knew 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.919
 very well I was not without a bike and I 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:52.950
 I needed to have one so now I go 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.950
 making the changes are liking both 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.690
 they like to move they have all the tools 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.630
 have other bikes that I also change 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.030
 My wife and my daughter are being 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.710
 funny 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:11.960
 if someone is still thinking of getting 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:15.290
 not have much money I recommend is 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.290
 it's worth it
