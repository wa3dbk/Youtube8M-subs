00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
figured if there wasn't enough in the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.840 
figured if there wasn't enough in the
box<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.370> would<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.790> do<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> top<00:00:36.210> half<00:00:36.320> um<00:00:37.850> when

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
box I would just do the top half um when

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.360 
box I would just do the top half um when
I<00:00:38.879> got<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.450> actually<00:00:39.600> Don<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.590> only<00:00:40.800> covered

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
I got to actually Don it it only covered

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
I got to actually Don it it only covered
my<00:00:41.579> bangs<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.540> very<00:00:42.719> top<00:00:43.020> layer<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.290> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
my bangs and my very top layer so it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.770 
my bangs and my very top layer so it
looked<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:43.950> weird<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.460> kept<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.629> two

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
looked really weird I kept it for two

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
looked really weird I kept it for two
days<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.649> maybe<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.190> changed<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:47.640> mind

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
days to see if maybe I changed my mind

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.119 
days to see if maybe I changed my mind
but<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.690> didn't<00:00:49.020> um<00:00:50.840> well<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.870> actually<00:00:52.320> realized

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
but I didn't um well I actually realized

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.709 
but I didn't um well I actually realized
that<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.940> wasn't<00:00:54.149> gonna<00:00:54.390> cover<00:00:54.780> enough<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:56.719> went

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
that it wasn't gonna cover enough I went

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.180 
that it wasn't gonna cover enough I went
ahead<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.989> washed<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.680> didn't<00:00:58.890> like

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
ahead and washed out so I didn't like

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.639 
ahead and washed out so I didn't like
white<00:00:59.699> like<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.390> supposed<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
white like it's supposed to do and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.369 
white like it's supposed to do and
within<00:01:02.309> five<00:01:02.609> minutes<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.180> turned<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.629> really

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
within five minutes it turned a really

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.429 
within five minutes it turned a really
really<00:01:04.890> orangish<00:01:05.700> Cutler<00:01:06.229> but<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.320> looked

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439
