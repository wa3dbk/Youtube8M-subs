00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.399 

it's<00:01:15.649> often<00:01:16.369> difficult<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:17.090> say<00:01:17.539> just<00:01:18.110> what

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
it's often difficult to say just what

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.639 
it's often difficult to say just what
motivates<00:01:19.130> someone<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.880> such<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.479> high<00:01:20.960> plane

of<00:01:22.039> screwing<00:01:22.789> around<00:01:22.939> is<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.659> build<00:01:23.899> a<00:01:24.079> replica

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
of screwing around is to build a replica

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.179 
of screwing around is to build a replica
Disneyland<00:01:26.180> in<00:01:26.450> their<00:01:26.630> backyard<00:01:27.289> so<00:01:28.009> let's

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
doesn't mean you want to build something

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.230 
doesn't mean you want to build something
like<00:01:42.619> this<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:42.950> your<00:01:43.069> backyard<00:01:43.220> I<00:01:43.700> wanted<00:01:44.149> to

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
like this in your backyard I wanted to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.880 
like this in your backyard I wanted to
build<00:01:44.329> a<00:01:44.479> railroad<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.439> knew<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:45.799> most

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
build a railroad and I knew that most

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.770 
build a railroad and I knew that most
people<00:01:46.189> in<00:01:46.310> this<00:01:46.429> hobby<00:01:46.700> will<00:01:47.330> build<00:01:47.509> them<00:01:47.659> out

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
people in this hobby will build them out

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.600 
people in this hobby will build them out
of<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:48.020> railroad<00:01:48.289> that<00:01:48.530> they<00:01:48.679> grew<00:01:49.069> up<00:01:49.220> with<00:01:49.429> or

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
of a railroad that they grew up with or

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.699 
of a railroad that they grew up with or
something<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.149> they<00:01:50.299> known<00:01:51.080> about<00:01:51.349> or

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
something that they known about or

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.559 
something that they known about or
something<00:01:52.039> from<00:01:52.159> their<00:01:52.280> past<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:53.240> didn't

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
something from their past and I didn't

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:54.880 
something from their past and I didn't
have<00:01:53.720> any<00:01:53.840> roads<00:01:54.140> in<00:01:54.200> my<00:01:54.259> past<00:01:54.470> other<00:01:54.679> than

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
have any roads in my past other than

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.990 
have any roads in my past other than
Disneyland<00:01:55.189> so<00:01:55.459> it<00:01:55.549> seemed<00:01:55.700> like<00:01:55.789> a<00:01:55.819> natural

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
Disneyland so it seemed like a natural

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.870 
Disneyland so it seemed like a natural
fit<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:56.720> also<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:58.039> could<00:01:58.189> find<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.549> figures

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
fit and also you could find the figures

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.600 
fit and also you could find the figures
readily<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.599> easily<00:02:00.080> in<00:02:00.560> Disneyland<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:01.580> I

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
readily and easily in Disneyland so I

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.190 
readily and easily in Disneyland so I
knew<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:01.909> would<00:02:02.270> have<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.450> endless<00:02:02.899> supply<00:02:03.170> of

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
knew I would have a endless supply of

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.139 
knew I would have a endless supply of

that I find really fun is that a lot of

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.280 
that I find really fun is that a lot of
people<00:04:55.880> who<00:04:56.030> build<00:04:56.240> a<00:04:56.330> model<00:04:56.660> railroad<00:04:56.840> will

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
people who build a model railroad will

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.400 
people who build a model railroad will
create<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.650> railroad<00:04:58.190> pass<00:04:58.510> back<00:04:59.510> in<00:04:59.750> the<00:04:59.900> 19th

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
create a railroad pass back in the 19th

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.860 
create a railroad pass back in the 19th
century<00:05:00.530> when<00:05:01.070> people<00:05:01.430> had<00:05:01.670> railroads<00:05:02.600> they

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
century when people had railroads they

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.290 
century when people had railroads they
would<00:05:03.020> have<00:05:03.170> a<00:05:03.200> railroad<00:05:03.710> pass<00:05:04.010> and<00:05:04.460> they

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
would have a railroad pass and they

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.290 
would have a railroad pass and they
could<00:05:05.480> hand<00:05:05.720> those<00:05:05.870> out<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.260> VIPs<00:05:06.830> and

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
could hand those out to VIPs and

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.580 
could hand those out to VIPs and
managers<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.570> so<00:05:08.720> on<00:05:08.900> so<00:05:09.140> they<00:05:09.380> could<00:05:09.560> just

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
managers and so on so they could just

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.530 
managers and so on so they could just
show<00:05:09.950> their<00:05:10.220> pass<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.760> then<00:05:10.850> get<00:05:11.060> onto<00:05:11.420> any

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
show their pass and then get onto any

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.980 
show their pass and then get onto any
train<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.260> go<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.340> so<00:05:14.180> if<00:05:14.300> you<00:05:14.390> build<00:05:14.600> a<00:05:14.720> model

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
train and go and so if you build a model

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.510 
train and go and so if you build a model
railroad<00:05:15.170> it's<00:05:15.560> sort<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:15.830> fun<00:05:16.010> to<00:05:16.160> create<00:05:16.370> a

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
railroad it's sort of fun to create a

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.370

e ticket ride and that included the

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.330 
e ticket ride and that included the
railroad<00:05:59.150> which<00:05:59.750> was<00:05:59.990> a<00:06:00.020> D<00:06:00.290> ticket<00:06:00.710> so<00:06:01.070> that's

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
railroad which was a D ticket so that's

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.820 
railroad which was a D ticket so that's
what<00:06:01.910> he's<00:06:02.060> giving<00:06:02.390> out<00:06:02.540> as<00:06:02.930> a<00:06:02.990> railroad<00:06:03.350> pass

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
what he's giving out as a railroad pass

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.220 
what he's giving out as a railroad pass
is<00:06:04.160> a<00:06:04.190> pretty<00:06:04.520> accurate<00:06:04.990> reproduction<00:06:05.990> of<00:06:06.110> a

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230
