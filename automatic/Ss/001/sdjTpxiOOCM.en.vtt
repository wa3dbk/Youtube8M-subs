and I I really I had this vision I was I

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.260 
and I I really I had this vision I was I
was<00:00:03.750> taking<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.140> flight<00:00:04.380> last<00:00:05.250> year<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.730> was

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
was taking a flight last year I was

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.120 
was taking a flight last year I was
going<00:00:06.480> somewhere<00:00:06.629> in<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.500> States<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.040> had

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
going somewhere in the States and I had

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.000 
going somewhere in the States and I had
this<00:00:08.250> image<00:00:08.580> come<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.210> me<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:10.170> clear<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.740> wrote

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
this image come to me so clear I wrote

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.209 
this image come to me so clear I wrote
it<00:00:11.160> down<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.519> notebook<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.860> it<00:00:13.860> was<00:00:14.009> along

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
it down in a notebook and it was along

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.760 
it down in a notebook and it was along
the<00:00:14.309> lines<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.929> flare<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.560> will

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
the lines of this the flare that will

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.160 
the lines of this the flare that will
come<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.910> solar<00:00:18.180> flare<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.020> he's

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
come this the the solar flare that he's

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.670 
come this the the solar flare that he's
coming<00:00:19.609> he's<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> par<00:00:21.090> with<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.840> opening<00:00:22.560> of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
coming he's on a par with the opening of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.820 
coming he's on a par with the opening of
the<00:00:22.740> third<00:00:23.010> eye<00:00:23.449> almost<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:25.680> an

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the third eye almost like the like an

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.230 
the third eye almost like the like an
etch-a-sketch<00:00:25.980> as<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> child<00:00:26.730> remember<00:00:27.000> those

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
etch-a-sketch as a child remember those

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.580 
etch-a-sketch as a child remember those
etch-a-scketches<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.170> know<00:00:28.260> when<00:00:28.439> you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
etch-a-scketches and you know when you

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.830 
etch-a-scketches and you know when you
are<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.010> do<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> drawing<00:00:29.580> magnetic<00:00:30.449> drawings

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
are you do a drawing magnetic drawings

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.479 
are you do a drawing magnetic drawings
with<00:00:30.960> iron<00:00:31.140> filings<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.890> make<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> drawing

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
with iron filings and you make a drawing

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
with iron filings and you make a drawing
yo<00:00:32.850> yo<00:00:33.030> yo<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.540> then<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.719> could<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.050> go<00:00:34.230> you

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
yo yo yo and then you could just go you

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.080 
yo yo yo and then you could just go you
just<00:00:34.829> used<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.070> wipe<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.430> clean<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.880> start

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
just used to wipe you clean and start

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.190 
just used to wipe you clean and start
again<00:00:36.270> hmm<00:00:36.890> well<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.160> very<00:00:39.059> much<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
again hmm well in very much so that I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.440 
again hmm well in very much so that I
see<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> world<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:42.239> know<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
see that the world that we you know the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.790 
see that the world that we you know the
world<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.750> we're<00:00:42.930> immersed<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
world that we're immersed in and the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.639 
world that we're immersed in and the
world<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.219> manifesting<00:00:45.469> it's<00:00:46.469> going

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
world that we are manifesting it's going

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.400 
world that we are manifesting it's going
to<00:00:46.710> look<00:00:46.829> very<00:00:46.860> different<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:48.180> people<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
to look very different to people the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.040 
to look very different to people the
world<00:00:49.620> isn't<00:00:49.770> ending<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.640> view<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.899> world

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
world isn't ending in my view the world

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.439 
world isn't ending in my view the world
is<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.410> beginning<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.160> when<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
is just beginning and when when the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.439 
is just beginning and when when the
flare<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.110> when<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> energies<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:57.180> are

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
flare and when the energies that are

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
flare and when the energies that are
very<00:00:57.690> much<00:00:57.870> part<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.260> who<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.500> are<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.039> part<00:00:59.340> of

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
very much part of who we are and part of

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.639

sense we will see everything as it is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.130 
sense we will see everything as it is
and<00:01:38.180> that's<00:01:39.180> that's<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.780> New<00:01:39.900> Jerusalem

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
and that's that's the New Jerusalem

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.380 
and that's that's the New Jerusalem
that's<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.460> me<00:01:41.549> that's<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> new<00:01:42.090> world

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that's the for me that's the new world

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.800 
that's the for me that's the new world
it's<00:01:42.689> not<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.619> place<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> location

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
it's not a place it's not a location

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.899 
it's not a place it's not a location
it's<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.350> well<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.920> dislocated<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.790> in

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
it's it well if you dislocated it's in

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.520 
it's it well if you dislocated it's in
the<00:01:48.030> heart<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.329> every<00:01:48.570> human<00:01:48.780> being<00:01:48.899> good

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
stuff you know got going way back the

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.750 
stuff you know got going way back the
pre-raphaelites<00:05:22.800> have<00:05:23.100> always<00:05:23.340> found<00:05:23.490> quite

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
pre-raphaelites have always found quite

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.860 
pre-raphaelites have always found quite
intriguing<00:05:24.330> I<00:05:24.390> mean<00:05:24.570> there's<00:05:24.690> a<00:05:24.720> lot<00:05:24.780> of

intriguing I mean there's a lot of

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.000 
intriguing I mean there's a lot of
symbolism<00:05:25.170> in<00:05:25.530> there<00:05:25.650> we<00:05:25.710> could<00:05:25.830> talk<00:05:25.980> about

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
symbolism in there we could talk about

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.680 
symbolism in there we could talk about
that<00:05:26.340> as<00:05:26.430> a<00:05:26.460> separate<00:05:26.820> subject<00:05:27.210> another<00:05:27.420> time

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
that as a separate subject another time

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.970 
that as a separate subject another time
but<00:05:27.900> there's<00:05:28.020> this<00:05:28.260> whole<00:05:28.470> range<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:28.920> things

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
but there's this whole range of things

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.130 
but there's this whole range of things
and<00:05:29.340> then<00:05:29.880> saying<00:05:30.090> that<00:05:30.330> one<00:05:30.600> that<00:05:30.750> one<00:05:30.900> of<00:05:31.020> the

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
and then saying that one that one of the

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.320 
and then saying that one that one of the
stuff<00:05:31.350> that<00:05:31.380> really<00:05:31.710> touches<00:05:32.070> my<00:05:32.340> heart<00:05:32.520> is<00:05:32.910> it

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
stuff that really touches my heart is it

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.660 
stuff that really touches my heart is it
is<00:05:33.750> purely<00:05:34.170> the<00:05:34.410> outside<00:05:34.800> of<00:05:35.010> work<00:05:35.190> what<00:05:35.580> we

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
is purely the outside of work what we

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.850 
is purely the outside of work what we
call<00:05:35.880> shamanic<00:05:36.300> stuff<00:05:36.720> an<00:05:36.990> outsider<00:05:37.530> art
