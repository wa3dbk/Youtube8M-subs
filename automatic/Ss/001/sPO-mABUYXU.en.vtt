00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.830
 if instead the edge to be placed on the roof looks like this 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.730
 andrea positioned clearly on the other right 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.219
 away second floor because elco ordo which we started orange elan are 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.060
 fat and against us 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 to me this case a move to query 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.679
 turn the front of the cube counterclockwise 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.649
 bringing the edge 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.789
 space cinema 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.070
 it turns in the direction 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.070
 counterclockwise central part 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.740
 clockwise the front part 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.350
 a counterclockwise rotation of the central part 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.740
 a rotation 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.930
 pisciasott 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.930
 counterclockwise. the front of the cube 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.450
 2 of the part 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.450
 the second floor we say 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.020
 now the front part turns in the direction 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.210
 done 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.210
 our 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.190
 It is interesting to also dwell on what happens with this type of move 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.620
 then how do we put it well what happens because more than the parameters at 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.380
 moves it is interesting to understand what happens inside the cube with 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.750
 the latter because my dog ​​showed 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.970
 at the position I love the edge the first we left behind now 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.450
 proposition homo here on the left because the color guts 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.610
 milan that central street of the roof must be facing towards us 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 alano is the one we did we brought it right away 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.970
 at the roof level 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.130
 ee the edge the foreground comes here is moved from here to here 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.130
 time I move the edge 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.820
 of the old first floor 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.180
 I leave it here 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.580
 you second floor 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.070
 as if I wanted to download it, let's say with did until now downloading it 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.109
 the fountains part return to the south 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.430
 aligning the white with the yellow in this case 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.739
 the important thing is that these two colors are not so lilly aligned 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.999
 s useless 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.499
 the Red 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.910
 and the orange are placed those that are not its own side 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.289
 1 in fact here 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.189
 and the other one from here 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.399
 then what do you do 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.399
 cefap a vote on the second floor 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:38.189
 so that our couple 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.829
 the one who is interested 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.089
 it is in the part in the back of the cube 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.109
 away from the movements that numbers will take will do 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.769
 these in this part here some interested 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.149
 3 license parked here this copy 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.039
 What happen 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.609
 cl we don't turn 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.839
 clockwise the front of the cube 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.049
 and we prepare to receive 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.219
 the couple 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.719
 that we have 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.029
 prepared before 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.319
 parking on the cube lawn 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.159
 these become aligned 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.739
 and these h 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.399
 we turn the front of the cube 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:17.069
 we placed the edge 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.509
 while also maintaining the first floor 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.969
 here is this 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.150
 it seemed interesting to me that it is more important 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.109
 understand what happens inside the cube rather than learning one by heart 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.109
 series of moves 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.109
 which can however serve in certain cases 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:42.290
 once one understands what happens nintendo nightmare doesn't need to 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.289
 learn by heart but if someone spies 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.340
 got to this point 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.760
 sigam a second floor of the cube so as to put in phase 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.259
 the central tiles 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:56.569
 green 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.859
 White 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.799
 yellow 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.909
 and look for which one 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.790
 since now only the edges of the second plane given by remain 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.529
 fix 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:10.439
 let's find out what the edge is 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.439
 which has already positioned and possibly also oriented 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.579
 but in this case 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.039
 in our case we have a blue yellow edge 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.039
 that already positioned and also oriented 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.930
 now with this move that I can see up there we go turn 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.420
 this 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.150
 this and this I write here the other 3 we say that they still have to be 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.129
 placed 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:35.639
 edge position 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.900
 then the edge positioned in this case also oriented what behind a 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.400
 left 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.830
 committed here 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.309
 with the edge 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.309
 positioned at the rear left of the cube 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.969
 is from this move here 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.969
 you come forward with the second floor of the cube 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.300
 2 rotations with the right side 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.819
 come back 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.819
 and two other rotation between the right side is repeated 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.080
 now this is 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.680
 positioned manu planted 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.710
 this is positioned monumentally you the other two have gone to place 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.879
 now his mind is missing these two here 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.479
 and we realize a very simple thing the white brought under 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.229
 and even here on this side white brought here is in the front 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.240
 we celebrate the cube as well as 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.039
 that we turn it 90 degrees in this sense 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.650
 we realize that we have happened in the event that the two edges 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.520
 see against each other 180 degrees between them 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.250
 year the bottom part of this new fund we are those white this case 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.710
 however brought under 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.400
 but this move we know from here 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.400
 in fact, and this scream in the rush in the central 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.949
 away with the first floor 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.749
 piedimonte 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:30.419
 you duct rotation new foreground 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:31.380
 the nightmare is over
