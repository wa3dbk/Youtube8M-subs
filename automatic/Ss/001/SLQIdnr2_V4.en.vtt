00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.129
 hello my good glad again 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.439
 greet you on your channel and 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.210
 today with one beautiful 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.029
 beauty blogger Nastya 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.099
 link to her channel on her video I will leave 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.039
 in the description of this video necessarily 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.430
 look we make such a joint 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:34.750
 the video is so it seems its original 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.610
 name one or the other and questions for 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.559
 This tag sent to me Nastya therefore 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.750
 Now I answer as it is and honestly tell you 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.329
 I have not read these questions yet because 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.469
 I find it interesting to watch myself 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.030
 something will come as a surprise to me 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.219
 the point is to choose between what and 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.190
 what then let's start if you 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.879
 interesting enjoyable 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.570
 So I will talk about makeup I will not 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.910
 pry laptop apologize 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.950
 rouge or bronzer well here i am i 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.740
 I prefer more blush than bronzer 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.590
 uniquely because all the same skin 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.310
 me bright tonal foundation or 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.110
 concealer 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.920
 surely tonal basis for me 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.630
 the most important is the complexion then 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.759
 foundation can be used as 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.970
 concealer on some problem areas then 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.440
 I have no such problem zone types 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.470
 acne pronounced but the complexion 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.990
 lip gloss suffers a little or 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.020
 pallas i think lip gloss they 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.509
 more comfortable to use though lipstick 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.759
 I really love but all the same lip gloss 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.819
 I feel closer 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.030
 mascara or eyeliner well mascara 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:52.080
 because it looks awful when 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.209
 eyelashes are white 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.310
 blonde and absolutely no them of course 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.750
 eyeliner can draw something on 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.670
 your eyelashes 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.440
 he did not think it would be good but stew 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.810
 a long time ago I saw not a mascara 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.370
 really did with the carcass eyeliner something 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.380
 There is about a lira toothpick in my and so 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.060
 drew arrows so what can 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.980
 move 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.680
 crisp shadows or compressed shadows 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.959
 I think that the compressed ones are unusual. 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.000
 because 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.440
 crumbly or pigments even before with them 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.570
 need to be careful not to do them 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.860
 such a quick make up you need to tinker 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.080
 natural or colored shadows but this one 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.540
 understood the shadows no yes shades of brown 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.270
 or color can of course and prefer 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.910
 natural because they are used more often 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.840
 most of all now the question about 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.880
 nails with sms or golden rose complex 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.560
 question because you have a camp 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.989
 which i really like these sweet 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.520
 which is not at all here the angle to y 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.160
 we are most of the varnishes after all to me 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:03.280
 like so we have golden rose nails 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.470
 long or short short all 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.200
 on the contrary answering though I constantly 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.380
 constantly try to grow instantly 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.880
 I prefer a short one and itâ€™s more convenient 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.560
 acrylic or natural, of course 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.810
 Matu they never did to themselves 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.910
 nail acrylic never 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.730
 wore because like and so their 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.610
 not bad grow and even lower sense if 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.980
 honestly light or dark colors of lacquer 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.830
 more convenient to me all the same probably with 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.030
 bright 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.670
 they are lacquer because they are so universal 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.760
 now let's talk about the body 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:41.240
 Eau le parfum am I can 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.860
 be not eat yes I do not know what toilet 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.690
 water cartier we are different by film by 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.810
 my more concentrated if they 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.880
 wrong toilet water no parfum 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.300
 probably although in principle all the same 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.400
 the main thing is to smell the world share oil for 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.120
 body or cream still choose a cream for 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.850
 bodies though 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.390
 oils and oils for the body, too, there is no 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.060
 blame soap or shower gel 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.640
 depending on which soap but still more from 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.140
 most 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.610
 I still have a soap for my skin 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.209
 so shower gel 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:20.080
 yours or dolce milk well, then no one 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:23.180
 I tried I do not know qoros now about fashion 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.220
 jeans or leggings really love little 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.510
 I'll choose Jess myself because with him I 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:33.050
 most conveniently and with them it is possible more 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.140
 create images long and long or 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.550
 short sleeve short 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.050
 I especially like when it's generally short 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.780
 skirt or dress 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.440
 booths themselves clean more comfortable dress 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.850
 more feminine probably salary 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.610
 ballet shoes or heels with them the same 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.190
 the story of ballet shoes more somehow 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.480
 like a girl he is more comfortable in heels 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:00.980
 i feel feminine like so 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:02.750
 choose heels zara or bershka probably 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.890
 zara because beshte not so much i 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:11.330
 shopping made liver d or 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:14.200
 new yorker well reasons because the second 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.840
 I honestly did not use the brand 2 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.150
 Now questions about hair, hair, long 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.610
 or short lengths I'm sure 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.770
 I do not like when women have short hair 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:29.000
 forgive me all but someone goes 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.880
 really yes but when especially under 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.590
 I do not like a boy cut 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.960
 long hair just adore the very very 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.090
 want long hair dyed or 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.400
 unpainted hair this again 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.620
 how come if the planet has dyed hair 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:48.890
 dark or light well, it is generally that is 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.230
 50 to 50 now relevant for me 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.060
 blonde hair but this is not a fact this is not 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.180
 means that when they become dark to 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.420
 besides, I was dark for almost three years 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.600
 farther 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:03.650
 gel or spray spray bow or pins 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.290
 I still like the Baltics 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.640
 want hardening more often use stealth 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:12.080
 or gum often use gum although 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.910
 I understand that the invisible still need 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.350
 Better and everything is random, I will say 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.040
 the sun does rain 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.940
 the sun must be winter and summer summer 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.480
 understandable thing 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.370
 spring or autumn spring love when everyone 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.100
 wakes come alive and don't love autumn 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.410
 winter now starts at 5 that cold 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.450
 there will be several months again these debris 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.700
 snow will be my God 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.890
 how much more we have to go through and me 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.680
 getting scary don't want to just 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.990
 this 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.320
 not autumn and winter trying to keep myself 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.240
 so is the last vanilla or chocolate 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.850
 probably all the same vanilla 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.830
 yes if i'm no ordinary ice cream 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.750
 gave chocolate all I don't like chocolate 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.210
 ice cream there is ice cream with chocolate 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.900
 crumb which curd bars there with 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.150
 chocolate 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.310
 although chocolate itself I am very very 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.789
 love but more like it smells 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.960
 vanilla on it all 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:09.539
