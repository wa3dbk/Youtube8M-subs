what you're getting and then rewind the
VCR<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.160> seven-zero

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
VCR and seven-zero

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.599 
VCR and seven-zero
and<00:00:48.520> then<00:00:49.239> each<00:00:50.020> step<00:00:50.530> on<00:00:50.829> your<00:00:51.070> step<00:00:51.309> list

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
and then each step on your step list

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.610 
and then each step on your step list
write<00:00:51.879> down<00:00:52.120> what<00:00:52.390> number<00:00:52.750> it<00:00:52.809> is<00:00:52.899> on<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.230> VCR

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
write down what number it is on the VCR

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.759

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
going to begin with the basic step and

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.479 
going to begin with the basic step and
we'll<00:00:59.140> demonstrate<00:00:59.320> it<00:00:59.890> a<00:01:00.010> couple<00:01:00.340> of

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
we'll demonstrate it a couple of

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:01.889 
we'll demonstrate it a couple of
directions<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:01.179> then<00:01:01.300> we'll<00:01:01.480> break<00:01:01.690> it<00:01:01.870> down

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
directions and then we'll break it down

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.590 
directions and then we'll break it down
and<00:01:02.410> we<00:01:03.280> hope<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:03.609> have<00:01:03.730> lots<00:01:03.969> of<00:01:04.210> fun<00:01:04.420> with

and we hope you have lots of fun with
this<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:09.310> basic<00:01:09.789> step<00:01:10.030> we<00:01:10.300> do<00:01:10.479> step<00:01:10.960> together

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
this the basic step we do step together

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.740 
this the basic step we do step together
step<00:01:11.440> step<00:01:12.340> together<00:01:12.520> step<00:01:12.789> step<00:01:13.600> together

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
step step together step step together

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.990 
step step together step step together
step<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.410> step<00:01:14.740> together<00:01:14.950> step<00:01:15.220> I'll<00:01:15.670> do<00:01:15.819> that

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
step and step together step I'll do that

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.499 
step and step together step I'll do that
again

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
again

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.980 
again
it<00:01:17.380> starts<00:01:17.830> with<00:01:18.009> and<00:01:18.280> step<00:01:19.060> step<00:01:19.390> step<00:01:19.539> and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
it starts with and step step step and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.290 
it starts with and step step step and
step<00:01:20.289> step<00:01:20.619> step<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.160> step<00:01:21.520> step<00:01:21.849> step<00:01:22.000> and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
step step step and step step step and

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.040 
step step step and step step step and
step<00:01:22.720> step<00:01:22.929> step<00:01:24.539> when<00:01:25.539> you<00:01:25.630> get<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.810> little

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
step step step when you get a little

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.510 
step step step when you get a little
more<00:01:26.200> advanced<00:01:26.800> if<00:01:26.920> you're<00:01:27.069> very<00:01:27.280> ambitious

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
more advanced if you're very ambitious

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.419 
more advanced if you're very ambitious
you<00:01:28.149> do<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.360> little<00:01:28.569> hop<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.050> a<00:01:29.500> hop<00:01:29.770> two<00:01:30.069> three

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
you do a little hop and a hop two three

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.460 
you do a little hop and a hop two three
and<00:01:30.640> hop<00:01:30.880> two<00:01:31.179> three<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.720> hop<00:01:31.899> two<00:01:32.200> three

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
and hop two three and a hop two three

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.680 
and hop two three and a hop two three
and<00:01:32.649> a<00:01:32.739> hop<00:01:32.920> two<00:01:33.160> three<00:01:35.940> now<00:01:36.940> we'll<00:01:37.209> break<00:01:37.450> that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
and a hop two three now we'll break that

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.540 
and a hop two three now we'll break that
down<00:01:37.929> I<00:01:37.989> think<00:01:38.410> I'll<00:01:38.560> demonstrate<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:39.310> step

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
down I think I'll demonstrate the step

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.770 
down I think I'll demonstrate the step
by<00:01:39.759> myself<00:01:40.239> for<00:01:40.450> just<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.720> moment
