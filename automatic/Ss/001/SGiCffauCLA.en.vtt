00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.330 
same thing about Josh a Java zoom well
Jess<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:16.900> zoom<00:04:17.900> it's<00:04:18.410> guy<00:04:18.560> it's<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.799> same<00:04:19.040> thing

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
Jess a zoom it's guy it's the same thing

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.610 
Jess a zoom it's guy it's the same thing
but<00:04:20.060> mine<00:04:20.299> just<00:04:20.540> altered<00:04:20.959> more<00:04:21.169> because<00:04:21.590> I

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
but mine just altered more because I

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.540 
but mine just altered more because I
have<00:04:22.510> everything<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.720> I<00:04:23.960> need<00:04:24.320> and

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
have everything that I need and

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.070 
have everything that I need and
everything<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.789> I<00:04:25.820> use<00:04:26.090> for

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
everything that I use for

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.170 
everything that I use for
so<00:04:27.530> then<00:04:27.740> you<00:04:27.889> want<00:04:27.979> to<00:04:28.099> do<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.340> same<00:04:28.550> for<00:04:28.940> your

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
so then you want to do the same for your

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.249 
so then you want to do the same for your
source<00:04:29.569> and<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:32.000> believe<00:04:32.389> you<00:04:32.750> have<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.020> source

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
source and I believe you have the source

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.050 
source and I believe you have the source
the<00:04:33.680> actual<00:04:34.069> source<00:04:34.280> file<00:04:34.430> itself<00:04:34.759> you<00:04:34.849> can<00:04:34.970> go

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
the actual source file itself you can go

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.059 
the actual source file itself you can go
ahead<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.270> drag<00:04:35.389> out<00:04:35.599> so<00:04:36.229> my<00:04:36.440> mistake<00:04:36.770> I<00:04:36.889> just

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
ahead and drag out so my mistake I just

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.619 
ahead and drag out so my mistake I just
kept<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:37.400> dragged<00:04:37.610> them<00:04:37.759> both<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.270> so<00:04:38.449> now<00:04:38.599> I

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:38.629 
kept and dragged them both and so now I

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.119 
kept and dragged them both and so now I
have<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.050> double<00:04:39.379> click<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:39.620> every<00:04:39.800> time<00:04:39.949> you

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:40.129 
have to double click it every time you

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.860 
have to double click it every time you
know<00:04:42.009> so<00:04:43.009> really<00:04:43.759> that's<00:04:44.180> about<00:04:44.479> it<00:04:44.690> all

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
know so really that's about it all

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.119 
know so really that's about it all
that's<00:04:45.139> all<00:04:45.319> you<00:04:45.470> have<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.680> do<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:45.949> then<00:04:46.039> you

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
that's all you have to do and then you

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.830 
that's all you have to do and then you
can<00:04:46.280> start<00:04:46.550> my<00:04:46.759> first<00:04:47.030> video<00:04:47.330> it's<00:04:47.690> probably

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
can start my first video it's probably

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.080 
can start my first video it's probably
the<00:04:48.110> video<00:04:48.319> I<00:04:48.379> should've<00:04:48.949> posted<00:04:49.099> first<00:04:49.460> but<00:04:49.849> I

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
the video I should've posted first but I

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.790 
the video I should've posted first but I
just<00:04:50.389> wasn't<00:04:50.569> thinking<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:51.169> figured<00:04:51.560> you<00:04:51.680> guys

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
just wasn't thinking I figured you guys

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.740 
just wasn't thinking I figured you guys
would<00:04:51.979> have<00:04:52.069> followed<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:52.580> video<00:04:52.849> and<00:04:53.150> gotta

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
would have followed that video and gotta

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.480 
would have followed that video and gotta
pick<00:04:53.990> two<00:04:54.080> different<00:04:54.110> private<00:04:54.650> server<00:04:54.919> I<00:04:55.099> just
