quickly turn that into different
products<00:05:23.419> we<00:05:23.510> lose<00:05:23.690> all<00:05:23.870> of<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:24.169> that's<00:05:25.010> why

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
products we lose all of that that's why

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.790 
products we lose all of that that's why
