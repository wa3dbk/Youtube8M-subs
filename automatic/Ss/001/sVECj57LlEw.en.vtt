I do here is I go for the ten supply

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.929 
I do here is I go for the ten supply
which<00:01:16.590> means<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.159> 10<00:01:17.369> population

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
right here i go for the supply depot

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.850 
right here i go for the supply depot
meanwhile<00:01:21.240> i<00:01:21.479> maintain<00:01:22.170> my<00:01:22.200> constant

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
production of SC vs that is a little

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.330 
production of SC vs that is a little
different<00:01:25.229> from<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.500> Protoss<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.070> because

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
different from the Protoss one because

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.340 
different from the Protoss one because

you are going to not be able to produce

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.100 
you are going to not be able to produce
the<00:01:31.549> next<00:01:32.549> probe<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.360> about<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> second<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.049> two

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the next probe for about a second or two

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.740 
the next probe for about a second or two
but<00:01:34.380> se4<00:01:35.159> turn<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:35.790> always<00:01:36.210> able<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
but se4 turn on you are always able to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.920 
but se4 turn on you are always able to
because<00:01:37.170> Terran<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.430> 11<00:01:39.000> supply<00:01:39.390> from

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
because Terran can have 11 supply from

only<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.350> 10<00:01:43.350> from<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.040> nexus<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.909> 12<00:01:45.600> supply

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
only have 10 from the nexus so 12 supply

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
only have 10 from the nexus so 12 supply
you<00:01:46.079> throw<00:01:46.439> down<00:01:46.649> your<00:01:46.680> barracks<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.939> could

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
you throw down your barracks you could

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.730 
you throw down your barracks you could
do<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> block<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.780> want<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.320> personally

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
do a block if you want but I personally

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.910 
do a block if you want but I personally
don't<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.280> don't<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.090> blocks<00:01:51.360> anymore

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
don't do don't like to do blocks anymore

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.319 
don't do don't like to do blocks anymore
so<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.979> could<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.579> want<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.149> go

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
so you could do that if you want you go

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.410 
so you could do that if you want you go
for<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.540> 12<00:01:55.470> super<00:01:56.159> 12<00:01:56.640> barracks<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.240> then

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
chatters love to call it so you do this

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.120 
chatters love to call it so you do this
to<00:02:04.539> get<00:02:04.750> your<00:02:04.930> gas<00:02:05.079> up<00:02:05.380> because<00:02:05.710> if<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:05.979> want

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
to get your gas up because if you want

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.089 
to get your gas up because if you want
to<00:02:06.189> get<00:02:06.280> tech<00:02:06.880> lab<00:02:07.060> then<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.329> definitely<00:02:07.570> need

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
to get tech lab then you definitely need

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.830 
to get tech lab then you definitely need
gas<00:02:09.099> so<00:02:09.369> unless<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.789> want<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.000> do<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.330> mass

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
gas so unless you want to do a mass

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.400 
gas so unless you want to do a mass
marine<00:02:11.260> push<00:02:11.560> or<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:12.690> what<00:02:13.690> else<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.349> you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
marine push or a what else is that you

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.020 
marine push or a what else is that you
could<00:02:14.530> do<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.769> could<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.040> fast<00:02:15.430> expand<00:02:15.760> then

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
could do you could do a fast expand then

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.729 
could do you could do a fast expand then
you<00:02:16.120> will<00:02:16.239> not<00:02:16.330> get<00:02:16.510> gas<00:02:16.720> but<00:02:17.019> every<00:02:17.590> other

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
you will not get gas but every other

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.280 
you will not get gas but every other
build<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.310> I'm<00:02:18.880> doing<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.569> because<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.140> is

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
build and I'm doing that because this is

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.309 
build and I'm doing that because this is
a<00:02:20.319> standard<00:02:20.560> build<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.069> will<00:02:21.280> have<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.760> use

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
a standard build you will have to use

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.220 
a standard build you will have to use
gas<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:24.099> when<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.940> have<00:02:25.120> when<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.810> SUV

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
gas so when you have when this SUV

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.380 
gas so when you have when this SUV
finish<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.709> your<00:02:27.340> better<00:02:27.670> should<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.209> finish

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
finish is your better should just finish

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.180 
finish is your better should just finish
and<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.750> start<00:02:29.170> researching<00:02:29.739> orbital

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
and you start researching orbital

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.170 
and you start researching orbital
command<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:31.120> build<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:32.489> marine<00:02:33.489> right

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
command and you build a marine right

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.390 
command and you build a marine right
when<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.480> finish<00:02:34.780> your<00:02:34.930> bear<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.400> basically

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
when you finish your bear so basically

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.710 
when you finish your bear so basically
when<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.670> finish<00:02:36.970> your<00:02:37.090> barracks<00:02:37.390> your

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
when you finish your barracks your

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.780 
when you finish your barracks your
population<00:02:38.140> says<00:02:38.500> 15<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:39.280> have<00:02:39.370> 200

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
population says 15 and you have 200

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.370 
population says 15 and you have 200
minerals<00:02:40.090> just<00:02:40.510> enough<00:02:40.780> for<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.049> research

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
minerals just enough for you to research

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.190 
minerals just enough for you to research
orbital<00:02:41.799> command<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.280> build<00:02:42.549> one<00:02:42.730> marine<00:02:43.200> now

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
orbital command and build one marine now

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.020 
orbital command and build one marine now
you<00:02:44.739> can<00:02:44.860> really<00:02:45.130> bury<00:02:45.430> your<00:02:45.580> build<00:02:45.819> how<00:02:45.970> you

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
you can really bury your build how you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.030 
you can really bury your build how you
want<00:02:46.330> right<00:02:46.480> now<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:47.080> can<00:02:47.230> throw<00:02:47.440> down<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.650> gas

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
want right now you can throw down a gas

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.880 
want right now you can throw down a gas
a<00:02:48.459> supply<00:02:49.209> depot<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:50.019> is<00:02:50.170> generally<00:02:50.620> how<00:02:50.860> I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
a supply depot that is generally how I

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.630 
a supply depot that is generally how I
do<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:55.380> because<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.769> will<00:02:57.040> need<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.340> go

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
do it and because you will need to go

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.789 
do it and because you will need to go
for<00:02:57.819> the<00:02:57.940> two<00:02:58.390> gas<00:02:58.660> even<00:02:59.290> if<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.470> want<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.709> get

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
for the two gas even if you want to get

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.490 
for the two gas even if you want to get
reactor<00:03:00.220> up<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.459> go<00:03:00.640> for<00:03:01.019> some<00:03:02.019> kind<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.290> bio

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
reactor up and go for some kind of bio

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.440 
reactor up and go for some kind of bio
ball<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:03.069> will<00:03:03.220> probably<00:03:03.549> still<00:03:03.730> need<00:03:03.940> gas

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
ball you will probably still need gas

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.410 
ball you will probably still need gas
because<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:05.470> do<00:03:05.709> need<00:03:06.040> ghosts<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:06.850> unless

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
because you do need ghosts so unless

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.080 
because you do need ghosts so unless
you're<00:03:07.569> playing<00:03:07.780> against<00:03:08.400> zerg<00:03:09.400> Zerg<00:03:09.880> you

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
you're playing against zerg Zerg you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.660 
you're playing against zerg Zerg you
could<00:03:10.269> run<00:03:10.420> out<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.569> one<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:10.900> believe<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:12.430> you

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
could run out of one I believe but you

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.180 
could run out of one I believe but you
will<00:03:13.060> need<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.269> factory<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.829> throw<00:03:15.040> down

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
will need a factory so you throw down

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.009 
will need a factory so you throw down
your<00:03:15.220> factory<00:03:15.670> at<00:03:15.730> 18<00:03:16.030> supply<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.569> also<00:03:16.959> you

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
your factory at 18 supply and also you

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.500 
your factory at 18 supply and also you

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.590 
you could actually go for two beds
instead<00:03:32.650> of<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.829> factory<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:33.700> could<00:03:33.940> go<00:03:34.269> for<00:03:34.510> an

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
instead of a factory you could go for an

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.750 
instead of a factory you could go for an
expand<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:35.769> there<00:03:36.069> is<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.250> fast<00:03:36.489> expand

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
expand this there is a fast expand

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.240 
expand this there is a fast expand
available<00:03:37.299> for<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.750> build<00:03:38.049> order<00:03:38.319> you<00:03:38.709> don't<00:03:39.069> go

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
available for a build order you don't go

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.819 
available for a build order you don't go
down<00:03:39.280> your<00:03:39.639> refinery<00:03:40.180> at<00:03:40.450> 16<00:03:40.750> supply<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.560> just

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
down your refinery at 16 supply you just

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.229 
down your refinery at 16 supply you just
throw<00:03:42.069> down<00:03:42.280> your<00:03:43.709> expansion<00:03:44.910> your<00:03:45.910> command

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
throw down your expansion your command

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.390 
throw down your expansion your command
center<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:46.930> this<00:03:47.380> is<00:03:47.560> how<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.769> build<00:03:48.010> varies

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
center so this is how the build varies

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.129 
center so this is how the build varies
and<00:03:48.609> you<00:03:48.790> could<00:03:48.940> actually<00:03:48.970> go<00:03:49.389> about<00:03:49.630> however

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
and you could actually go about however

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.750 
and you could actually go about however
you<00:03:50.260> want<00:03:50.440> right<00:03:50.620> now<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:51.250> could<00:03:51.400> get<00:03:51.579> another

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
you want right now you could get another

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.069 
you want right now you could get another
barracks<00:03:52.150> up<00:03:52.299> so<00:03:52.480> let<00:03:52.660> me<00:03:52.720> show<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:52.930> how<00:03:52.989> this

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
barracks up so let me show you how this

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.580 
barracks up so let me show you how this
works<00:03:53.230> this<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.680> common<00:03:54.100> push<00:03:54.340> for<00:03:55.590> terran

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
works this is a common push for terran

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.530 
works this is a common push for terran
against<00:03:57.160> terran<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:57.609> do<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.910> barracks<00:03:58.269> build

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
against terran you do to barracks build

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.140

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
build I have seen it done before or you

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.550 
build I have seen it done before or you
could<00:04:04.420> go<00:04:04.569> for<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:05.079> you<00:04:05.950> know<00:04:06.069> 111<00:04:06.790> build

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
could go for a you know 111 build

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.990 
could go for a you know 111 build
but<00:04:08.560> this<00:04:08.709> really<00:04:09.040> wasn't<00:04:09.190> 11<00:04:09.610> because<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:09.849> did

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
but this really wasn't 11 because I did

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.390 
but this really wasn't 11 because I did
get<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.180> barracks<00:04:10.510> up<00:04:10.630> so<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.170> mean<00:04:11.500> this<00:04:11.830> it<00:04:12.370> all

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
get a barracks up so I mean this it all

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400 
get a barracks up so I mean this it all
varies<00:04:12.940> from<00:04:13.060> there<00:04:13.300> around<00:04:13.510> 20<00:04:13.870> population

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
varies from there around 20 population

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.870 
varies from there around 20 population
for<00:04:14.560> every<00:04:14.770> race<00:04:14.920> as<00:04:15.099> I<00:04:15.220> said<00:04:15.400> in<00:04:15.520> my<00:04:15.550> Protoss

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
for every race as I said in my Protoss

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.729 
for every race as I said in my Protoss
video<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.780> shouldn't<00:04:17.169> start<00:04:17.290> varying

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
video you shouldn't start varying

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.289 
video you shouldn't start varying
actually<00:04:18.100> for<00:04:18.280> turn<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.760> can<00:04:18.880> start<00:04:19.030> varying

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
actually for turn you can start varying

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.759 
actually for turn you can start varying
around<00:04:19.510> 16<00:04:19.840> population<00:04:20.350> because<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.650> can

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
around 16 population because you can

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.110 
around 16 population because you can
decide<00:04:20.980> whether<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.370> want<00:04:21.549> another<00:04:21.700> barracks

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
decide whether you want another barracks

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.920 
decide whether you want another barracks
a<00:04:22.240> factory<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:24.310> fast<00:04:24.880> expand<00:04:25.270> or<00:04:25.480> something<00:04:25.810> of

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
a factory a fast expand or something of

a factory a fast expand or something of
the<00:04:25.960> sort<00:04:26.050> so<00:04:26.410> it<00:04:26.620> all<00:04:26.770> berries<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.310> guys<00:04:27.820> just

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
the sort so it all berries and guys just

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.560 
the sort so it all berries and guys just
um<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:29.620> know<00:04:29.740> be<00:04:29.889> creative<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:31.030> will<00:04:31.240> put

um you know be creative and I will put
up<00:04:31.720> more<00:04:31.900> specific<00:04:32.440> builds<00:04:32.740> as<00:04:32.830> in<00:04:33.040> like<00:04:33.220> you

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
up more specific builds as in like you

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.740 
up more specific builds as in like you
know<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.850> barracks<00:04:34.180> push<00:04:34.389> or<00:04:34.510> something<00:04:34.690> like
