00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.550 
and totem yes they do some damage over
time<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.509> great<00:02:06.780> deal

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
time but not a great deal

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.469 
time but not a great deal
so<00:02:07.860> once<00:02:08.130> I've<00:02:08.310> got<00:02:08.459> crystal<00:02:08.880> powered<00:02:09.209> up<00:02:09.330> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
so once I've got crystal powered up and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.690 
so once I've got crystal powered up and
I've<00:02:09.630> got<00:02:09.840> my<00:02:10.020> power<00:02:10.649> interaction<00:02:11.190> down<00:02:11.400> by<00:02:11.670> a
