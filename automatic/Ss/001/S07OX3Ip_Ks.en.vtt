forget things you know but science is

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.339 
forget things you know but science is
actually<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.670> our<00:00:26.939> side<00:00:27.210> that's<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:28.109> guys

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
actually on our side that's right guys

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.070 
actually on our side that's right guys
and<00:00:28.650> gals<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.580> really<00:00:29.820> guys<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.300> study<00:00:30.840> has

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and gals but really guys a study has

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.470 
and gals but really guys a study has
recently<00:00:31.410> come<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.369> may<00:00:32.700> indicate<00:00:33.090> that

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
recently come out that may indicate that

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.780 
recently come out that may indicate that
women<00:00:34.140> actually<00:00:34.380> have<00:00:34.829> better<00:00:35.070> memories<00:00:35.550> than

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
women actually have better memories than

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.260 
women actually have better memories than
men

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
men

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.119 
men
so<00:00:36.600> we're<00:00:36.750> compromised<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.530> not<00:00:37.680> our<00:00:37.829> fault

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
so we're compromised it's not our fault

on today's medical moment is there

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.920 
on today's medical moment is there
scientific<00:00:40.920> proof<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:42.030> women<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.690> better

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
scientific proof that women have better

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.700 
medical moment and on today's medical
moment<00:01:09.270> we're<00:01:09.570> examining<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.170> study<00:01:10.440> that<00:01:10.560> came

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
moment we're examining a study that came

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
moment we're examining a study that came
out<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.980> Europe<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.520> shows<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.970> men<00:01:12.240> may

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
out of Europe that shows that men may

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.330 
out of Europe that shows that men may
have<00:01:12.660> worse<00:01:12.990> subjective<00:01:13.500> memory<00:01:13.830> than<00:01:14.040> women

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
have worse subjective memory than women

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.980 
have worse subjective memory than women
what<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> researchers<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.660> this<00:01:15.810> study

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
what the researchers in this study

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.750 
what the researchers in this study
basically<00:01:16.350> did<00:01:16.650> was<00:01:16.830> they<00:01:16.980> had<00:01:17.010> males<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
basically did was they had males and

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.820 
basically did was they had males and
females<00:01:18.090> fill<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.480> surveys<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> surveys

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
females fill out surveys and the surveys

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.590 
females fill out surveys and the surveys
required<00:01:20.280> them<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.730> recall<00:01:21.000> things<00:01:21.270> like

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
required them to recall things like

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 
required them to recall things like
names<00:01:21.960> dates<00:01:22.530> details<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.460> conversations

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
names dates details of conversations

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.610 
names dates details of conversations
things<00:01:24.480> of<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.720> nature<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.320> occurred

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
things of that nature that it occurred

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.140 
things of that nature that it occurred
within<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.160> last<00:01:26.250> year<00:01:26.580> yet<00:01:26.729> who<00:01:26.820> cares<00:01:27.060> about

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
within the last year yet who cares about

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.620 
within the last year yet who cares about
that<00:01:27.240> stuff

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that stuff

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.360 
that stuff
right<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:28.440> basically<00:01:28.740> found<00:01:29.040> was

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
right but what they basically found was

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.280 
right but what they basically found was
women<00:01:29.790> were<00:01:29.940> much<00:01:30.240> more<00:01:30.510> likely<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.050> be<00:01:31.140> able

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
women were much more likely to be able

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
women were much more likely to be able
to<00:01:31.350> recall<00:01:31.620> things<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.190> names<00:01:32.490> dates<00:01:32.940> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
to recall things like names dates and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.060 
to recall things like names dates and
conversation<00:01:33.840> details<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.680> had<00:01:34.800> occurred

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
conversation details that had occurred

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.830 
conversation details that had occurred
over<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.369> last<00:01:35.400> year<00:01:35.850> than<00:01:36.210> men<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.690> study

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
over the last year than men in the study

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.440 
over the last year than men in the study
were<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.619> conclusion<00:01:38.130> was<00:01:38.280> men<00:01:39.030> have

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
were and the conclusion was men have

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.810 
were and the conclusion was men have
poor<00:01:39.840> subjective<00:01:40.530> memories<00:01:40.860> than<00:01:41.130> women<00:01:41.610> do

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
poor subjective memories than women do

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120 
poor subjective memories than women do
okay<00:01:42.300> I'll<00:01:42.570> accept<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.560> why<00:01:43.890> does<00:01:44.100> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
okay I'll accept that but why does that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.150 
okay I'll accept that but why does that
happen<00:01:44.550> I<00:01:44.610> mean<00:01:44.759> what<00:01:44.910> causes<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.420> well<00:01:46.160> nobody

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
happen I mean what causes it well nobody

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.219 
happen I mean what causes it well nobody
knows<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:47.670> researchers<00:01:48.540> unfortunately

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
knows that researchers unfortunately

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.840 
knows that researchers unfortunately
we're<00:01:49.350> able<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.619> tell<00:01:49.830> us<00:01:49.950> how<00:01:50.100> compromised

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
we're able to tell us how compromised

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.450 
we're able to tell us how compromised
and<00:01:51.150> diseased<00:01:51.509> our<00:01:51.810> brains<00:01:52.170> are<00:01:52.470> recently

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and diseased our brains are recently

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.609 
and diseased our brains are recently
we're<00:01:54.210> compromising<00:01:54.990> fortunately<00:01:55.500> they

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
we're compromising fortunately they

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.170 
we're compromising fortunately they
couldn't<00:01:55.920> tell<00:01:56.070> us<00:01:56.100> why<00:01:56.520> men<00:01:56.850> tend<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.119> have

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
couldn't tell us why men tend to have

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.910 
couldn't tell us why men tend to have
poorer<00:01:57.630> subjective<00:01:58.200> memories<00:01:58.470> than<00:01:58.650> women

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
poorer subjective memories than women

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.440 
poorer subjective memories than women
there<00:01:59.460> was<00:01:59.580> some<00:01:59.729> theories<00:02:00.090> though<00:02:00.240> one

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
there was some theories though one

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.730 
there was some theories though one
theory<00:02:00.660> revolves<00:02:00.930> around<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.410> fact<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
theory revolves around the fact that

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.950 
theory revolves around the fact that
prior<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.520> menopause<00:02:02.940> women<00:02:03.630> tend<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.899> have

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
prior to menopause women tend to have

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.900 
prior to menopause women tend to have
less<00:02:04.229> cardiovascular<00:02:04.979> disease<00:02:05.250> than<00:02:05.460> men<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
less cardiovascular disease than men and

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.370 
less cardiovascular disease than men and
so<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.300> thought<00:02:06.450> process<00:02:06.899> was<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:07.259> have

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
so the thought process was if you have

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.630 
so the thought process was if you have
all<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.530> these<00:02:07.679> diseases<00:02:08.009> blood<00:02:08.310> vessels<00:02:08.580> in

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
all of these diseases blood vessels in

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.160 
all of these diseases blood vessels in
your<00:02:08.670> body<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.569> diseased<00:02:09.840> blood<00:02:10.050> that's

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
your body you have diseased blood that's

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.300 
your body you have diseased blood that's
what's<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> brain<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.190> have

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
what's going to the brain you have

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.920 
what's going to the brain you have
compromised<00:02:11.790> blood<00:02:12.030> flow<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> brain<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
compromised blood flow to the brain and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.600 
compromised blood flow to the brain and
so<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.170> might<00:02:13.350> compromise<00:02:13.620> brain<00:02:14.160> function

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
so that might compromise brain function

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.460 
so that might compromise brain function
but<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:15.030> know<00:02:15.690> at<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> end<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.260> day<00:02:16.380> they

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
but you know at the end of the day they

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.950 
but you know at the end of the day they

physical and social activity can

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.080 
physical and social activity can
actually<00:02:31.080> help<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.290> slow<00:02:31.800> memory<00:02:32.400> decline<00:02:32.700> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
actually help to slow memory decline and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.260 
actually help to slow memory decline and
actually<00:02:33.390> boost<00:02:33.750> memory<00:02:34.470> activity<00:02:35.190> well<00:02:35.760> was

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
actually boost memory activity well was

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
actually boost memory activity well was
there<00:02:36.420> anything<00:02:36.600> else<00:02:36.930> dr.<00:02:37.290> DiMaio<00:02:38.720> ladies<00:02:39.720> we
