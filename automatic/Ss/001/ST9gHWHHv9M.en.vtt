00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
this year maybe just because our

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.199 
this year maybe just because our
defending<00:03:19.290> isn't<00:03:19.620> really<00:03:19.830> up<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.580> par<00:03:20.610> yet<00:03:20.820> but

defending isn't really up to par yet but

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.030 
defending isn't really up to par yet but
the<00:03:21.780> start<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.110> game<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.590> really<00:03:22.860> wasn't

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the start of the game I really wasn't

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
more of a tiki taka style of play and

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.880 
more of a tiki taka style of play and
not<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.360> lot<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.600> people<00:03:57.810> used<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.350> here<00:03:58.590> again

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890

in<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.640> 16th<00:04:03.090> minute<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:03.690> he<00:04:04.650> was<00:04:04.950> probably

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
in the 16th minute so he was probably

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.789 
in the 16th minute so he was probably
one<00:04:05.880> of<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.209> best<00:04:06.450> opponents<00:04:07.049> I've<00:04:07.200> played<00:04:07.560> on

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.300 
I mean it just seemed to work so well I
don't<00:04:21.180> know<00:04:21.299> if<00:04:21.390> it's<00:04:21.570> maybe<00:04:21.810> because<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:22.860> how

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
don't know if it's maybe because of how

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.550 
don't know if it's maybe because of how
the<00:04:23.400> attacking<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.389> I<00:04:24.419> works<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:25.110> year<00:04:25.380> that

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
it's so much better we eventually did

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.180

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.740 
being it's the 451 the spacing but there
was<00:05:19.620> nothing<00:05:20.040> I<00:05:20.520> can<00:05:20.729> do<00:05:20.880> obviously<00:05:21.270> I<00:05:21.360> sped<00:05:21.660> up

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
was nothing I can do obviously I sped up

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.940 
was nothing I can do obviously I sped up
the<00:05:21.780> footage<00:05:22.080> just<00:05:22.410> so<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:22.590> guys<00:05:22.740> wouldn't

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
the footage just so you guys wouldn't

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.740 
the footage just so you guys wouldn't
sit<00:05:23.310> here<00:05:23.520> and<00:05:23.610> watch<00:05:23.820> passing<00:05:24.330> for<00:05:24.510> a<00:05:24.540> while<00:05:24.720> I

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
sit here and watch passing for a while I

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.860 
sit here and watch passing for a while I
figured<00:05:24.870> maybe<00:05:25.169> you<00:05:25.320> guys<00:05:25.410> would<00:05:25.560> be<00:05:25.620> bored

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
figured maybe you guys would be bored

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.630 
figured maybe you guys would be bored
but<00:05:27.870> yeah<00:05:27.960> I<00:05:27.990> mean<00:05:28.140> he<00:05:28.530> was<00:05:28.680> literally<00:05:29.100> able<00:05:29.490> to

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
but yeah I mean he was literally able to

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.700 
but yeah I mean he was literally able to
keep<00:05:29.820> possession<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.690> whole<00:05:30.720> second<00:05:31.680> half

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
keep possession the whole second half

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.469 
keep possession the whole second half
there<00:05:32.160> he<00:05:32.370> had<00:05:32.460> like<00:05:32.640> sixty-three<00:05:33.330> percent

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
there he had like sixty-three percent

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.750 
there he had like sixty-three percent
possession<00:05:34.110> this<00:05:34.350> has<00:05:34.560> not<00:05:34.950> happened<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.669> me

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
possession this has not happened to me

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.360 
possession this has not happened to me
yet<00:05:36.030> he<00:05:36.240> was<00:05:36.390> a<00:05:36.419> great<00:05:36.990> player<00:05:37.229> and<00:05:37.620> I

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
yet he was a great player and I

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.060 
yet he was a great player and I
definitely<00:05:38.820> want<00:05:39.419> to<00:05:39.479> try<00:05:39.660> the<00:05:39.780> 451<00:05:40.410> and<00:05:40.860> see
