00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
at Freddy's but there could possibly be

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.820 
at Freddy's but there could possibly be
nine<00:02:12.239> nights<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.050> game<00:02:13.230> that's<00:02:13.440> pretty

nine nights in the game that's pretty

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.350 
nine nights in the game that's pretty
it's<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.160> guys<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.520> almost<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:14.880> two<00:02:15.090> games

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
it's a guys it's almost like two games

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.150 
it's a guys it's almost like two games
in<00:02:15.570> one<00:02:15.600> but<00:02:15.960> essentially<00:02:16.410> there<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.680> also<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
in one but essentially there is also a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.940 
in one but essentially there is also a
zero<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.420> exact<00:02:18.930> same<00:02:19.260> font<00:02:19.650> maybe

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
zero in the exact same font maybe

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.260 
zero in the exact same font maybe
there's<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> night<00:02:20.580> zero<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.000> don't<00:02:21.210> know

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
there's like a night zero I don't know

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.030 
there's like a night zero I don't know
if<00:02:21.360> there's<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.570> night<00:02:21.720> zero<00:02:21.990> guys<00:02:22.170> maybe<00:02:22.620> Scott

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
if there's a night zero guys maybe Scott

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.700 
if there's a night zero guys maybe Scott
is<00:02:23.190> planning<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.730> doing<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.750> little<00:02:25.230> bit<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.590> a

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
is planning on doing a a little bit of a

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.470 
is planning on doing a a little bit of a
origin<00:02:26.130> story<00:02:26.580> or<00:02:26.700> something<00:02:27.000> cool<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.210> that

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
origin story or something cool like that

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.330 
origin story or something cool like that
for<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.960> DLC<00:02:28.620> that's<00:02:28.830> why<00:02:28.920> there's<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.190> night

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
for a DLC that's why there's a night

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.890 
for a DLC that's why there's a night
zero<00:02:29.610> rather<00:02:29.820> cool<00:02:30.030> stuff<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.660> don't

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
zero rather cool stuff like that I don't

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.460 
zero rather cool stuff like that I don't
know<00:02:30.990> guys

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
know guys

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.380 
know guys
these<00:02:31.740> are<00:02:31.920> all<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:32.400> speculation<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
these are all just speculation and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.090 
these are all just speculation and
theories<00:02:33.660> but<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.260> did<00:02:34.410> find<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.740> number<00:02:34.890> nine

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
theories but I did find a number nine

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.620 
theories but I did find a number nine
which<00:02:35.340> makes<00:02:35.550> me<00:02:35.640> believe<00:02:35.670> there<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.150> possibly

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
which makes me believe there is possibly

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.290 
which makes me believe there is possibly
a<00:02:36.690> night<00:02:37.050> nine<00:02:37.290> actually<00:02:37.710> hidden<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.000> five

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
a night nine actually hidden in the five

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.300 
a night nine actually hidden in the five
nights<00:02:39.330> at<00:02:39.900> Freddy's<00:02:40.290> for<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> game<00:02:40.860> gettype

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
nights at Freddy's for a game gettype

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.680 
nights at Freddy's for a game gettype
