00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.719
 hello and welcome to goal.com 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.420
 today we will see an exercise in 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.619
 bodybuilding without equipment so it's okay 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.440
 be composed of a round of three 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.930
 minutes and two exercises there is no 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.790
 series or repetition it is finished 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.280
 you have a choice between these two 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.170
 exercises and you get up do not you 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.820
 stop for three minutes 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.550
 so the first exercise with the beurs 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.410
 peas their worst is what are you going to 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.719
 have two ways to do them 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.550
 you are several variations so in 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.829
 best way we'll just go 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.930
 bend the legs we can join the ground 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.410
 I 'm going to the legs behind to make a 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:53.110
 pump raised by swings of agreement 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.110
 so I'm showing you real speed 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.760
 ok second way you do not have to 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.710
 bend your legs almost you go 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.940
 throw directly back and forth 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.940
 cut you off right away 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.350
 this is more cardio it is necessary 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.759
 absorbed with hands okay for 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.479
 those who do not have enough strength 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.709
 to do the right okay you can 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.490
 you can do two things are not 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:25.179
 do not bridge all you had to 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.179
 throw legs 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:37.940
 jump in agreement or do some 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:40.880
 pumps on the gym ok so that's the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.280
 first year second year to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.200
 the be the readings removed called 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.970
 is it up in English we are in English 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:59.180
 like these and we will close 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:02:01.369
 would have helped our exercise there if he's 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.869
 done correctly but it's really 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.790
 on the belt 2012 she will work 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.170
 it must not shoot you in the back 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.300
 okay so if that means in the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.160
 back you know you have changed badly 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.160
 exercise the right alternative 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.860
 the rower we are there online on ds and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.280

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.860
 people we are not going to move 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.739

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.130

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.260
