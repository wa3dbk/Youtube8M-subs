this while the dark paint was still a

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.780 
this while the dark paint was still a
little<00:01:44.619> wet<00:01:44.830> so<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.189> would<00:01:45.280> blend<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.580> little

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
little wet so it would blend a little

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.280

paint<00:01:49.450> dry<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:49.960> decided<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.890> use<00:01:51.009> velcro<00:01:51.220> strips

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
paint dry I decided to use velcro strips

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.920 
paint dry I decided to use velcro strips
on<00:01:51.790> each<00:01:51.909> side<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.240> frame<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.570> hold<00:01:52.659> it<00:01:52.840> in

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
on each side of the frame to hold it in

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.899 
on each side of the frame to hold it in
place<00:01:53.049> this<00:01:53.920> also<00:01:54.159> makes<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.549> easier<00:01:54.850> to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
place this also makes it easier to

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.359 
place this also makes it easier to
