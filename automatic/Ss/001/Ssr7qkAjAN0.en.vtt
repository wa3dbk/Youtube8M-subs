00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.000
Let me tell you a story

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.400
There was this boy that will break his sister dolls and toys

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.400
Crying

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.500
Not only that ...He also break his own things

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.530
Then one day he even broke the neighbor's window and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:46.000
Wait a minute Wait a minute Wait a minute
What is happening here

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.539
I am not liking this
I do not like this

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:59.000
Do you think what this boy is doing is right?
Why don't we discuss this child behavior

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.000
You probably thought that
This boy was not behaving very well

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:23.000
His sister was very sad
when he broke her toys

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
And when he broke his own toys

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.840
he did not have any more toys to play with

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.990
Then he broke his neighbor window
By doing this he was damaging their property and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.000
The neighbors could even call the police

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.900
It is not nice to break toys or things that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.000
belong to others

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If the boy continues behaving like this nobody

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.750
would like to play with him and he will feel
lonely

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.459
and by breaking the neighbor's window the little boy

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.000
is making his parents feel sad

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:25.000
Remember if you are nice...  you will always feel good about yourself

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
