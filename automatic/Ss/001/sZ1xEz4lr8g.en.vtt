00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.570
 welcome friends of the forum all 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:10.550
 survival 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:14.300
 to this sunny June day 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.410
 to do the cutting tests to the 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.410
 knife man 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.039
 Mt 4 is a knife that we already tested in your 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.619
 day 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:32.110
 but that I could wrong sent us again 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.269
 basically because they had solved a 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.300
 Posers why people 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:39.659
 complained people complained about all of 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.839
 that what is the extraction of the knife 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:46.000
 at the time of opening it to the being with a 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:50.170
 single hand then 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.350
 it was complicated it was not impossible yes 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.090
 yes we are big hands and such because 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.280
 I could open and close it with the same 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.809
 hand without no more problem but there was 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.480
 people who gave him problems not that he was going 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.989
 very hard in this case because they took good 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.840
 note so we can see that the one that 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.869
 then they look at what we say and 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.850
 in this case it opens and closes and 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.310
 look at line air opens and closes 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.390
 without any problem in this case what 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.390
 I'm operating with gloves 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.189
 it opens 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.140
 and it closes without any glue or 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.869
 be that the problem is more than 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.250
 solved well we're not going to talk about 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.590
 the characteristics of this knife 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.420
 because we already did it in his day more than 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.490
 nothing therefore taking advantage of the occasion that 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.340
 he gave us gave us this second 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.490
 unit we are going to perform some tests of 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.270
 cut a little more extensive than those that 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.670
 We did in his day and more than anything 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:56.479
 to see if it works or does not work 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.429
 the tests will consist of those in 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.450
 the rope cuts so much rope 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:06.530
 Extra thick boat like marine rope 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.849
 also of normal thickness we are 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.540
 talking about a 12 millimeter rope 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:14.720
 in the small case and about 20 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.650
 millimeters in the big case is this 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.019
 I did not want to spend much time 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.209
 I've cut it with two hacks 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.400
 for axes to go fast I have cut it 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.109
 the hatchet and make this this 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.220
 section here that is a bit more 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.160
 irregular 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.830
 the axes and that's it 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.790
 let's see also hose cut 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:41.290
 plastic cut leather cut of a cue 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.860
 good plastic and pneumatic 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.140
 these cuts are always a bit 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.620
 problematic and finally the cuts 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.290
 fine we are not going to do button or anything 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.870
 like that because I think that 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.500
 would be to break the knife and in this case what 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.310
 that we are interested in is to see if it cuts and 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.160
 is nothing I hope you like the video 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.840
 I hope you see with good eyes that 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.970
 let's try again and I'll tell you the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.360
 They returned to give with the last batch 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.510
 they sent us that it was the muzzle the mt 5 and 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.970
 this knife came to us also so that 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.060
 we will show that the problem of 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.850
 opening it was solved let's go 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.960
 there 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.770
 and see see what we see so far and 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.770
 for them
