00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.990 

you<00:00:39.170> know<00:00:39.290> some<00:00:40.130> of<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.250> stuff<00:00:40.430> I<00:00:40.550> do<00:00:40.610> through

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
you know some of the stuff I do through

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.460 
you know some of the stuff I do through
a<00:00:41.030> cosmic<00:00:41.210> cross-cultural<00:00:42.140> I<00:00:42.230> talked<00:00:42.440> a

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
a cosmic cross-cultural I talked a

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.320 
a cosmic cross-cultural I talked a
little<00:00:42.650> bit<00:00:42.830> about<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.220> extended<00:00:43.520> family<00:00:44.090> and

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
little bit about the extended family and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.900 
little bit about the extended family and
to<00:00:44.840> enter<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.170> helped<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:46.100> understand<00:00:46.670> how<00:00:46.850> the

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
to enter I helped to understand how the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.570 
to enter I helped to understand how the
traditional<00:00:47.540> Aboriginal<00:00:48.500> family<00:00:49.160> worked<00:00:49.370> and

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
traditional Aboriginal family worked and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.490 
traditional Aboriginal family worked and
now<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:49.760> extended<00:00:50.330> family<00:00:50.690> work<00:00:50.900> and<00:00:51.170> just

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
now the extended family work and just

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.680 
now the extended family work and just
for<00:00:51.710> example<00:00:52.360> traditionally<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:53.480> even

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
for example traditionally and even

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.360 
for example traditionally and even
though<00:00:53.809> we<00:00:54.020> might<00:00:54.260> say<00:00:54.680> auntie<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:55.309> uncle

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
though we might say auntie and uncle

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.390 
though we might say auntie and uncle
today<00:00:55.760> but<00:00:56.750> traditionally<00:00:57.440> all<00:00:58.070> their

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
today but traditionally all their

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.760 
today but traditionally all their
mothers<00:00:58.760> sisters<00:00:58.970> were<00:00:59.330> our<00:00:59.510> mothers<00:00:59.840> all

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
mothers sisters were our mothers all

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.410 
mothers sisters were our mothers all
their<00:01:01.100> mothers<00:01:01.460> brothers<00:01:01.699> were<00:01:02.059> our<00:01:02.210> fathers

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
their mothers brothers were our fathers

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.640 
their mothers brothers were our fathers
and<00:01:04.119> so<00:01:05.119> uncle<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:05.630> aunt<00:01:05.780> eggs<00:01:05.990> didn't<00:01:06.260> exist

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
and so uncle and aunt eggs didn't exist

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.710 
and so uncle and aunt eggs didn't exist
so<00:01:07.040> if<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:07.790> think<00:01:07.940> about<00:01:08.150> a<00:01:08.210> child<00:01:08.600> being

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
so if you think about a child being

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680 
so if you think about a child being
taken<00:01:08.900> away<00:01:09.350> from<00:01:10.310> not<00:01:10.460> just<00:01:10.700> one<00:01:10.910> mother<00:01:11.240> but

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
taken away from not just one mother but

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.560 
taken away from not just one mother but
many<00:01:11.990> mothers<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:14.000> there<00:01:14.180> were<00:01:14.360> many

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
many mothers and and there were many

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.050 
many mothers and and there were many
mothers<00:01:14.930> because<00:01:15.259> cousins<00:01:15.770> didn't<00:01:16.100> exist<00:01:16.460> all

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
mothers because cousins didn't exist all

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.639 
mothers because cousins didn't exist all
your<00:01:17.390> cousins<00:01:17.630> were<00:01:18.050> your<00:01:18.200> brothers<00:01:18.530> and

your cousins were your brothers and

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.620 
your cousins were your brothers and
sisters<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:19.940> if<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.090> think<00:01:20.210> about<00:01:20.330> your

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
sisters so if you think about your

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
brother's children under my sister's

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.360 
brother's children under my sister's
children<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:34.550> they<00:02:34.730> much<00:02:34.910> older<00:02:35.300> than<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.600> am

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
children and they much older than I am

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.060 
children and they much older than I am
they<00:02:37.370> are<00:02:37.550> your<00:02:37.730> great<00:02:38.000> grandparents<00:02:38.690> your

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
they are your great grandparents your

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.610 
they are your great grandparents your
great-grandparents<00:02:40.070> become<00:02:40.430> your<00:02:40.640> children

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
great-grandparents become your children

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.940 
great-grandparents become your children
so<00:02:42.620> what<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:42.950> means<00:02:43.280> then<00:02:43.460> is<00:02:44.770> when<00:02:45.770> they're

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
so what that means then is when they're

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.370 
so what that means then is when they're
my<00:02:46.130> oldest<00:02:46.400> get<00:02:46.610> older<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.510> means<00:02:47.750> when<00:02:48.290> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
my oldest get older that means when the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.110 
my oldest get older that means when the
great<00:02:48.590> grandchildren<00:02:49.280> grow<00:02:49.460> up<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.910> great

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
great grandchildren grow up the great

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.210 
great grandchildren grow up the great
grandparents<00:02:50.750> much<00:02:50.990> older<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.560> frail<00:02:51.830> and

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
grandparents much older and frail and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.280 
grandparents much older and frail and
they<00:02:53.150> call<00:02:53.390> their<00:02:53.570> great-grandchildren

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
they call their great-grandchildren

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.010 
they call their great-grandchildren
mother<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.070> father<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:56.360> that<00:02:56.600> means<00:02:56.840> that

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
mother and father so that means that

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.110 
mother and father so that means that
elderly<00:02:57.500> have<00:02:57.920> many<00:02:58.160> people<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.520> take<00:02:58.760> care<00:02:59.000> of

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
elderly have many people to take care of

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.290 
elderly have many people to take care of
him<00:02:59.300> so<00:02:59.870> it<00:02:59.900> was<00:03:00.020> a<00:03:00.080> cycle<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.680> went<00:03:00.920> around

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
him so it was a cycle that went around

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.090 
him so it was a cycle that went around
now<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.600> be<00:03:02.720> taken<00:03:02.930> out<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:03.440> system<00:03:03.800> and

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
now to be taken out of that system and

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.190 
now to be taken out of that system and
put<00:03:04.280> an<00:03:04.400> institution<00:03:05.120> or<00:03:05.330> taken<00:03:05.930> away<00:03:06.140> from

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
put an institution or taken away from

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.710 
put an institution or taken away from
that<00:03:06.500> as<00:03:06.860> if<00:03:07.100> there's<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.400> stolen<00:03:08.090> generation

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
that as if there's a stolen generation

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.990 
that as if there's a stolen generation
and<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.590> can<00:03:09.739> see<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.130> enormous<00:03:10.459> effect<00:03:10.820> that

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
and you can see the enormous effect that

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.420 
and you can see the enormous effect that
it<00:03:11.120> would<00:03:11.180> have
