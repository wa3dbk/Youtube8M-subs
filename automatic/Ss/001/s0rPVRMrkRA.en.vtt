00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.189 
that nocturnal but it's not going as
high<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:13.120> it's<00:04:13.209> creating<00:04:13.419> a<00:04:13.629> lot<00:04:13.810> of<00:04:13.959> you<00:04:14.169> know

high so it's creating a lot of you know

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.839 
high so it's creating a lot of you know
depth<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:14.980> contour<00:04:17.099> and<00:04:18.099> then<00:04:18.250> just<00:04:18.459> blew<00:04:18.699> on
