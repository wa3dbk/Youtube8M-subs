00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.170
 honeycomb tablet here on the 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.690
 vacancy and that is the lenovo es 6000 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.520
 a pretty cheap tablet soon 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.170
 it is a come on the market 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 10 inch display with a resolution of 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.120
 1280 x 720 pixels 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.010
 that means it will not be that expensive 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.430
 tablet you go from a price of 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.739
 less than 250 euros from the beginning at the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.570
 It's a small, that is , around 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.850
 and everything from all sides very good 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.309
 read off 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.350
 Although it is quite subjective so you 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.120
 but here are some reflections 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.079
 otherwise it's really a lot 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.969
 We do not have a nice race 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.030
 Connections should be the right one 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.550
 also no connections around we have soon 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.159
 a few millimeters headphone output 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.140
 then the on and off switch and on the 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.170
 left side the loudness Rewe here 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.180
 it will be a micro HDMI output, a 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.100
 micro-usb connection because the tablet must 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.870
 Just load after the day does not have it 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.170
 completely survived and here one 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.729
 Memory extension via micro-SD cards 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.369
 and probably is still pure here 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.079
 sim card slot income for the 3g 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.170
 so that's also on the way online 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.030
 can go 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.240
 in the back we were still a camera and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.830
 this is the io speaker i think 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.470
 that will be a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.110
 So be just enough for photos 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.990
 otherwise here a matte plastic housing 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.840
 which is really very and overworked 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.820
 So you can do it though you can not 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.530
 it can not be bent 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.630
 so really, very much 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.010
 well finished and it is also painted 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.030
 I'm really very good in 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.720
 the hand you can see it here 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.000
 bit in the light otherwise we have 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.070
 four android jelly bean so the newest 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.899
 version preinstalled always very short 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.570
 in the attitude and shows you that 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.649
 look like how fast the whole thing 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.000
 is then rather 4.2.1 different data 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.030
 quite a few more here as well 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.030
 settings sign 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.800
 Overall , there is a generous 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.310
 amounts of animals 20 watts 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.680
 built-up should operate for one day 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.000
 really enough or just for one 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.860
 week if you only have it in between 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.510
 Of course we also used here 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.610
 a how to know the chrome browser 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.260
 very nice to go to the internet wants 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.660
 then here is just not set up 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.650
 otherwise it is quite performant 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.269
 but that's not it 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.700
 fastest we have a 4 here 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.810
 Carinthia is the victim mediathek or the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.850
 may not be as well known though 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.070
 especially the very cheap and 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.200
 also saves a lot of power but you can see 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.910
 yes it is not completely liquid so the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.150
 you should not expect top performance 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.820
 for the price of under 250 euro like me 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.930
 is said for the media version is 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.010
 It's definitely a very good one 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.230
 what you tablet 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.269
 from the second quarter so i had like that 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.099
 Buy May to June the child lenovo it 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.239
 6000 if you liked the video 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.670
 then in any case a thumbs up 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.620
 and subscribe to the channel because you will 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.409
 it probably very very many or 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.400
 a few more video to the nofx eyes 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:20.560
 find here yes that is the nova 6000th 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.250
