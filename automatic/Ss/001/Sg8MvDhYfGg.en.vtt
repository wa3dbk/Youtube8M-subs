00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.470
 remove this and they're going to put that in 5 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.850
 I'm going to leave you ok well after 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.850
 let's open on those who see 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.790
 we did not go to the folder where I 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.110
 I have that is on the desk 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.920
 but 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.759
 and good 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.759
 we will open it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.410
 first they will realize that no 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.300
 you can read and tell us this 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.250
 message saying it could not read 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.870
 the data please turn off the console and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.870
 reinsert the game card 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.270
 I'm going to lower the volume of the remainder 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.170
 because as you know you hear 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.399
 quite this emulator we'll leave it here 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.400
 well now the next thing we're going to 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.090
 to do is to go to stay 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.740

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.180

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.180
 to copy and we will put 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.570
 This is already what you want ok you 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.220
 let's give ok ok I'll look like this or I'll 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.980
 I forgot that they also have to press 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.410
 in action play and we will give the ok 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.010
 let's do the popcorn and we're going to 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.080
 give in ok then let's press in 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.140
 reset 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.770
 and as you can see read us the game we will 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.020
 to see in the world genius 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.050
 but let's customize the controls 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.450
 we are going to change them to our liking ok 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.960
 as you can see it reads there is no 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.960
 problem 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.310
 at the beginning this introduction is a 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.459
 little slow 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.319
 really I do not know why but good 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.830
 What happens is that the introduction goes slow 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.840
 but when you're already playing what they are 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.260
 the fights you're walking that you're going 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.750
 by cities and all that goes very fast the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.239
 game when it when you set it up properly 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.330
 where you see how right now it's going 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.170
