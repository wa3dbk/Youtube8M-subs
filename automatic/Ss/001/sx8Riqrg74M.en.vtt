00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.120
 I'm going to teach you how to make 4 hairstyles with 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.120
 little braids are very easy do not know me in 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.330
 long time maximum 5 minutes i the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.880
 I almost did not paint 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.849
 but I 'm going to start combing the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.720
 I do not know how it is promised but good 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:27.149
 I promise I hope you like it follow 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.890
 watching we're going to need nikita and 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:33.510
 curlers or pins for our 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.519
 first hairstyle let's start 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.769
 dividing our hair into three 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:42.140
 equal sections and we're going to make three 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.140
 braids from ends to ends 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.720
 we hold him with a friend and since 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.030
 our tensitas are ready we are going to 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.920
 start to open them a little to give a 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.120
 little volume 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.899
 now with pins we're going to grab the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:08.420
 back section and let's start the a 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:11.210
 hold as seen in the video now 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.360
 let's move one of the little braids 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.119
 up more or less than the braid that 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.270
 we just hold and we will hold 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.240
 also with pins later we go to 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.770
 spend the last 30 above the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.950
 second and we're going to hide the tail of the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.520
 hair that we have left in this braid and 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.830
 we hold it very well with pins 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.340
 being correcting some hairs that are 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.319
 they had left me with pins and I did not 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.900
 like transform can remove some 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:49.370
 hairs to make it look cooler 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.370
 and that's how it is 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.420
 ah 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.550
 for our second hairstyle we are going to 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.120
 start watching our hair for a 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.600
 side and we're going to start making a 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:13.440
 braid on each side by lashing them with 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:15.870
 a little girl since we made our 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.450
 successes from both sides let's start to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.110
 stretch them a little to give it a little 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.440
 of volume to our little braids now 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.760
 let's move our little train towards 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.710
 back and we're going to hold the compass 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.400
 then let's go the other journeys 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.220
 trying to keep the tail in the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.090
 first 30 and also holding it com 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:46.550
 pins as shown in the video and 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.550
 that's how our hairstyle looks 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.270
 now we go with the hairstyle number 3 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.720
 let's also divide our hair 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.850
 on one side and we're going to start 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.030
 make a side braid where there is 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.920
 more hair where we go more or less to the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.920
 half of the braid we're going to put a 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.200
 twine and we're going to leave it there and the 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.380
 another side let's start making a 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.680
 churrito with our hands is the 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.120
 churrito we will pass for the side 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.880
 where are we doing our 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.570
 transit and we will continue doing 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:30.420
 our braid and finally we hold it 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.420
 with a league to the end 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:38.390
 to give it some volume we're going to 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.390
 pull a little and it would be ready 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.200
 show our fourth and last hairstyle 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.570
 let's divide our hair into three 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.270
 sections side is in front should of 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.640
 be smaller and the same size 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.850
 hair and the back has to have 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.340
 a lot more hair with the section of 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:10.260
 back we're going to start making a braid 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.930
 since we reached the height of our 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.570
 neck or where our 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.220
 hair we are going to tie with a friend 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.989
 but in the last round we are going to do 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.370
 what you see in the video I do not know how 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:29.340
 explain it and we're going to start giving it 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.670
 volume to our traffic pulling the one 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.100
 little bit 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.860
 in the two sections opposite them 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.770
 let's do a bit of pancake with the 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.460
 help from a little brush and so it seems that 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:47.410
 we just pulled the hair and we're going to 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.210
 pass the section back and we will 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.390
 give it a little splash so that 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.000
 we can hold it with a pin 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.490
 and we're going to pass the other section trying 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.870
 to cover the pin of the first 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.480
 section and putting the tail in our 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:09.310
 first bone section treating it as 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.860
 hide finally let's try to with 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.690
 pins hide a little the trickle 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.790
 that we had left at the beginning 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.710
 we're going to try to put it in and that's how 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.870
 is this would be the cover of today's video 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.330

 again I hope you have a nice time 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.640
 they did not ask for a good meal and I wanted them 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.800
 say two little things 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.040
 the first is that if they are going to give away 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.870
 puppies or kittens it is better that they go to 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.150
 a place and wolf 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.940
 and make sure that the person to whom 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.770
 they are going to give it really can take care of it 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.680
 and the second is that if they are going to give gifts 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.540
 try not to use both 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.010
 wraps and all that because it's done 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.010
 a lot of garbage and all that 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.220
 thanks for watching this video and thanks to 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.800
 what they already subscribed I send them 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.659
 Many greetings and many hugs and much 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.000
 of everything 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.539
 take care, see you soon 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.539
