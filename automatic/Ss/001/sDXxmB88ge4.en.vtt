00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
in this video I'm going to cover

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.339 
in this video I'm going to cover
abbreviated<00:00:08.460> formulas<00:00:09.240> now<00:00:09.420> what<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.260> an

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
abbreviated formulas now what is an

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.100 
abbreviated formulas now what is an
abbreviated<00:00:10.830> formula<00:00:11.400> well<00:00:11.900> I've<00:00:12.900> already

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
abbreviated formula well I've already

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.289 
abbreviated formula well I've already
discussed<00:00:13.620> proprietary<00:00:14.280> blends<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.120> why<00:00:15.240> you

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
discussed proprietary blends and why you

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.810 
discussed proprietary blends and why you
want<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.660> avoid<00:00:15.809> them<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> lot<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.460> other

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
want to avoid them so a lot of other

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.630 
want to avoid them so a lot of other
some<00:00:18.119> companies<00:00:18.539> are<00:00:18.570> jumping<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.350> this

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
some companies are jumping on this

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.929 
some companies are jumping on this
non-proprietary<00:00:21.199> bandwagon<00:00:22.550> they're<00:00:23.550> waving

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
non-proprietary bandwagon they're waving

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.790 
non-proprietary bandwagon they're waving
their<00:00:24.060> non-proprietary<00:00:24.570> flag<00:00:25.320> now<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
their non-proprietary flag now the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.300 
their non-proprietary flag now the
problem<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:27.480> non<00:00:27.900> proprietary<00:00:28.710> formula

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
problem with a non proprietary formula

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.810 
problem with a non proprietary formula
is<00:00:29.460> they're<00:00:29.640> very<00:00:30.150> expensive<00:00:30.920> to<00:00:31.920> make<00:00:32.160> that's

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
is they're very expensive to make that's

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.850 
is they're very expensive to make that's
why<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.090> have<00:00:33.329> proprietary<00:00:33.630> blends<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:34.710> can

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
why we have proprietary blends they can

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.630 
why we have proprietary blends they can
put<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> tiny<00:00:35.340> bit<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.850> ingredients<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.540> their

13 ingredients in pre gym no they can't
so<00:01:42.570> what<00:01:43.170> they're<00:01:43.380> doing<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.950> they're<00:01:44.009> putting

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
so what they're doing is they're putting

so what they're doing is they're putting
in<00:01:44.790> 9<00:01:45.000> proprietary<00:01:45.750> blends<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.920> they're

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
in 9 proprietary blends but they're

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.940 
in 9 proprietary blends but they're
abbreviated<00:01:47.850> formulas<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.930> let's<00:01:49.170> talk<00:01:49.890> about

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
abbreviated formulas so let's talk about

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.569 
abbreviated formulas so let's talk about
pre<00:01:50.430> workouts<00:01:50.820> right<00:01:52.040> for<00:01:53.040> those<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.369> who
