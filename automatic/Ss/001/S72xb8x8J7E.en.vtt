00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
you connect system with it so it works

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.410

doesn't<00:01:13.110> stick<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.439> really<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:13.920> all<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:15.210> know

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
doesn't stick out really at all you know

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.640 
doesn't stick out really at all you know
people<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.840> been<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> car<00:01:16.320> haven't

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
people have been in the car haven't

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.100 
people have been in the car haven't
really<00:01:16.830> even<00:01:16.920> noticed<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.479> basically<00:01:18.930> that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
really even noticed it so basically that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.170 
really even noticed it so basically that
has<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.470> magnetic<00:01:20.040> cover<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.580> there<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
has that magnetic cover on there and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.200 
has that magnetic cover on there and
then<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.140> take<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.530> iPad

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
then what I do is I just take my iPad

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.370 
then what I do is I just take my iPad
and<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.509> sticks<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.140> there<00:01:25.350> like

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
and it just sticks right on there like

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.249 
and it just sticks right on there like
that<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.720> there<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
that so you can see it's on there and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.969 
that so you can see it's on there and
stuff<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:29.490> pretty<00:01:29.759> good<00:01:30.380> I'll<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.619> ahead<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
stuff it's pretty good I'll go ahead and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
stuff it's pretty good I'll go ahead and
start<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> up

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.130 

so<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:41.500> kind<00:01:41.680> of<00:01:41.770> takes<00:01:42.009> like<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.700> minute<00:01:43.420> or<00:01:43.930> two

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
so it kind of takes like a minute or two

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.429 
so it kind of takes like a minute or two
for<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.950> Bluetooth<00:01:45.189> to<00:01:45.700> connect<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.899> on<00:01:47.229> this
