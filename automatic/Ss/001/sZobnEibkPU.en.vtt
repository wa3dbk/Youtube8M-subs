use strong battles which is the B button

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.600 
use strong battles which is the B button
they<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:21.990> take<00:01:22.320> longer<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.830> perform<00:01:23.250> and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
they do take longer to perform and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.520 
they do take longer to perform and
you've<00:01:23.939> got<00:01:24.060> more<00:01:24.150> chance<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.630> hit<00:01:24.930> I'll

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you've got more chance to get hit I'll

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.429 
you've got more chance to get hit I'll
tend<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> them<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> play<00:01:27.930> safe

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
tend to them so if you want to play safe

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.710 
tend to them so if you want to play safe
just<00:01:28.710> tap<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.670> keep<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.479> for

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
just tap here and just keep going for

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.690 
just tap here and just keep going for
big<00:01:31.079> battles<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:32.100> even<00:01:32.400> when<00:01:32.490> you're<00:01:32.610> doing

big battles now even when you're doing
these<00:01:32.820> quick<00:01:33.090> grapples<00:01:33.680> don't<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> same

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
these quick grapples don't do the same

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.350 
these quick grapples don't do the same
combination<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.939> here<00:01:36.479> or<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.890> Y<00:01:38.460> X

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
combination like here or here be a Y X

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.820 
combination like here or here be a Y X
and

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
and

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.040 
and
this<00:01:41.610> way<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.880> will<00:01:42.180> fill<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.450> your<00:01:42.600> signature

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
this way you will fill up your signature

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.690 
this way you will fill up your signature
bar<00:01:43.230> and<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:44.040> once<00:01:44.190> you've<00:01:44.340> got<00:01:44.520> two

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
bar and in once you've got two

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.470 
bar and in once you've got two
signatures<00:01:45.440> basically<00:01:47.030> perform<00:01:48.030> both<00:01:48.300> of

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
signatures basically perform both of

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.720 
signatures basically perform both of
them<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.800> go<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.130> pin<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.580> you're

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
them and just go for the pin and you're

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.490 
them and just go for the pin and you're
guaranteed<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.240> win<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.960> long<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:52.350> keep

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
guaranteed a win as long as you keep

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:01.480 
guaranteed a win as long as you keep
your<00:01:52.710> distance<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.400> will<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.670> get<00:01:53.880> hit

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.700 

and<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.820> go<00:02:03.030> achievement<00:02:03.600> unlocked<00:02:03.710> 20g

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
and there we go achievement unlocked 20g

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.930 
and there we go achievement unlocked 20g
