00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
gamelan I want to just say hello I was

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.260 
gamelan I want to just say hello I was
recording<00:00:17.510> several<00:00:17.930> gongs<00:00:18.410> today<00:00:18.939> the<00:00:19.939> Sun

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
recording several gongs today the Sun

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.480 
recording several gongs today the Sun
Gong<00:00:20.570> Gong<00:00:21.230> Gong<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:21.680> vinhos<00:00:22.400> Gong<00:00:22.730> this<00:00:23.480> Gong

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
Gong Gong Gong the vinhos Gong this Gong

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:32.220 
Gong Gong Gong the vinhos Gong this Gong
this<00:00:25.490> was<00:00:25.760> a<00:00:25.789> platonic<00:00:26.300> hear<00:00:30.760> that<00:00:31.760> sound

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
this was a platonic hear that sound

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:40.230 
this was a platonic hear that sound
26,000<00:00:33.230> years<00:00:33.500> but<00:00:33.710> so<00:00:33.920> I<00:00:36.699> think<00:00:37.699> it's<00:00:38.090> amazing

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
26,000 years but so I think it's amazing

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.680 
26,000 years but so I think it's amazing
I<00:00:40.300> just<00:00:40.990> covered<00:00:41.970> most<00:00:42.970> of<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.180> Balinese

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
I just covered most of the Balinese

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.980 
I just covered most of the Balinese
songs<00:00:44.050> achieved<00:00:44.530> planar<00:00:44.890> tones<00:00:45.220> I<00:00:45.840> think<00:00:46.840> it's

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
songs achieved planar tones I think it's

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.440 
songs achieved planar tones I think it's
very<00:00:47.140> interesting<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.730> think<00:00:48.760> about<00:00:49.000> where

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
very interesting to think about where

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.410 
very interesting to think about where
they<00:00:49.570> get<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:49.930> knowledge<00:00:50.110> from<00:00:51.120> because<00:00:52.120> most

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
they get the knowledge from because most

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.270 
they get the knowledge from because most
of<00:00:52.540> their<00:00:52.750> frequencies<00:00:53.440> we<00:00:53.620> have<00:00:53.770> to<00:00:53.950> measure

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
of their frequencies we have to measure

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.270 
of their frequencies we have to measure
out<00:00:55.050> exactly<00:00:56.130> and<00:00:57.130> we<00:00:57.280> have<00:00:57.400> to<00:00:57.610> know<00:00:58.440> how<00:00:59.440> many

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
out exactly and we have to know how many

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.510 
out exactly and we have to know how many
days<00:01:00.610> a<00:01:01.530> planet<00:01:02.530> needs<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:04.890> make<00:01:05.890> one<00:01:05.920> circle

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
days a planet needs to make one circle

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.320 
days a planet needs to make one circle
around<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.940> Sun<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.960> then<00:01:08.890> we<00:01:09.100> have<00:01:09.970> to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
around the Sun and then we have to

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.930 
around the Sun and then we have to
double<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.140> doublet<00:01:11.500> again<00:01:11.860> until<00:01:12.700> we<00:01:12.850> know

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
double the doublet again until we know

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.400 
double the doublet again until we know
the<00:01:13.090> frequency<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.840> then<00:01:13.990> we<00:01:14.140> have<00:01:14.260> to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
the frequency and then we have to

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.000 
the frequency and then we have to
measure<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.890> frequency<00:01:15.070> but<00:01:15.610> they<00:01:15.760> did<00:01:15.910> it<00:01:16.060> I

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
measure the frequency but they did it I

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.260 
measure the frequency but they did it I
think<00:01:18.010> they<00:01:18.190> did<00:01:18.369> their<00:01:18.580> gongs<00:01:18.760> without<00:01:19.060> any

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
think they did their gongs without any

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.050 
think they did their gongs without any
computer<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.890> where<00:01:21.190> do<00:01:21.340> they<00:01:21.490> get<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.850> noise

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
computer so where do they get the noise

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.950 
computer so where do they get the noise
where<00:01:22.840> do<00:01:22.960> they<00:01:23.110> get<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.440> sounds<00:01:23.830> from<00:01:24.960> this

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
where do they get the sounds from this

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.680 
where do they get the sounds from this
is<00:01:26.200> an<00:01:26.410> interesting<00:01:26.830> question<00:01:27.240> maybe<00:01:28.240> some<00:01:28.570> of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
is an interesting question maybe some of

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.940 
is an interesting question maybe some of
you<00:01:28.780> know<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.110> answer<00:01:29.200> already<00:01:30.360> listen<00:01:31.950> this

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
you know the answer already listen this

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.850 
you know the answer already listen this
big<00:01:33.250> gong

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.440 

yeah<00:01:40.080> you<00:01:41.080> know<00:01:41.230> this<00:01:41.590> is<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.010> Sun<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:46.030> big

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
yeah you know this is the Sun this big

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.560 
yeah you know this is the Sun this big
guns<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:48.070> Sun<00:01:48.580> gone<00:01:50.190> all<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.520> moon<00:01:51.760> guns<00:01:52.090> it

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
guns the Sun gone all the moon guns it

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.990 
guns the Sun gone all the moon guns it
depends<00:01:53.050> on<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:54.760> frequency<00:01:55.030> you<00:01:55.450> prefer<00:01:57.000> this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
depends on the frequency you prefer this

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.900 
depends on the frequency you prefer this
is<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.330> gamelan<00:01:58.780> orchestra<00:01:59.670> Jim<00:02:00.670> Penniston

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
is the gamelan orchestra Jim Penniston

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:19.110 
is the gamelan orchestra Jim Penniston
and<00:02:03.180> again<00:02:05.550> this<00:02:06.550> is<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.760> Sun<00:02:07.120> tone<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.610> where<00:02:19.030> do

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
and again this is a Sun tone so where do

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.840 
and again this is a Sun tone so where do
they<00:02:19.270> get<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.570> knowledge<00:02:19.720> from<00:02:20.580> they<00:02:21.580> get<00:02:21.730> the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
they get the knowledge from they get the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.830 
they get the knowledge from they get the
knowledge<00:02:21.970> from<00:02:22.270> nature<00:02:23.310> I'm<00:02:24.310> sure<00:02:24.840> they

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
knowledge from nature I'm sure they

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.800 
knowledge from nature I'm sure they
meditate<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:27.340> they<00:02:27.550> can<00:02:27.730> hear<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.030> trance<00:02:28.300> in

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
meditate and they can hear the trance in

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.440 
meditate and they can hear the trance in
the<00:02:29.680> nature<00:02:30.010> it's<00:02:30.160> very<00:02:30.220> out<00:02:30.550> there<00:02:30.760> today<00:02:30.910> I'm

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
the nature it's very out there today I'm

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.220 
the nature it's very out there today I'm
sorry<00:02:32.790> they<00:02:33.790> get<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.180> knowledge<00:02:34.330> on<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
sorry they get the knowledge on the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.680 
sorry they get the knowledge on the
nature<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.390> nearly<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.989> SX<00:02:38.500> frequency

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
nature this is nearly the SX frequency

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.270 
nature this is nearly the SX frequency
platonic<00:02:40.690> here<00:02:43.200> most<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.350> us<00:02:44.470> would<00:02:44.680> suggest

platonic here most of us would suggest

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.390 
platonic here most of us would suggest
that<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.970> would<00:02:46.090> be<00:02:46.269> very<00:02:46.510> low<00:02:46.810> loud<00:02:47.280> but<00:02:48.280> it

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
that it would be very low loud but it

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.820 
that it would be very low loud but it
doesn't<00:02:48.730> matter<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.959> low<00:02:50.140> node<00:02:50.500> or<00:02:50.799> a
