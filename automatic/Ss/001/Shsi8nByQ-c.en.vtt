in my day to day diet it doesn't really
extend<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:26.340> like<00:00:26.490> during<00:00:27.090> racing<00:00:27.510> or

training<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.640> run<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.180> don't<00:00:30.720> eat<00:00:30.840> very

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
training on the run I don't eat very

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.660 
training on the run I don't eat very
much<00:00:31.169> food<00:00:32.239> racing<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.900> lot<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.440> just

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
much food racing I a lot but it's just

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.110 
much food racing I a lot but it's just
very<00:00:35.670> simple<00:00:36.440> gel<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.680> water<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.100> salt<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
very simple gel with water and salt and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.840 
very simple gel with water and salt and
then<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.480> terms<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.899> my<00:00:40.199> training<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:41.190> try<00:00:41.699> to<00:00:41.730> be

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
then in terms of my training I try to be

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.060 
then in terms of my training I try to be
more<00:00:42.600> intuitive<00:00:43.110> about<00:00:43.290> my<00:00:43.440> training<00:00:43.800> rather

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
more intuitive about my training rather

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.250 
more intuitive about my training rather
than<00:00:44.339> relying<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.589> gps<00:00:46.589> or<00:00:47.220> part<00:00:47.460> ray<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:48.260> tell

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
than relying on gps or part ray to tell

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
than relying on gps or part ray to tell
me<00:00:49.379> what<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.589> do<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:49.890> training<00:00:50.129> instead<00:00:50.550> try

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
me what to do in my training instead try

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.470 
me what to do in my training instead try
really<00:00:51.030> listen<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.329> my<00:00:51.420> body<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.400> each<00:00:53.400> day

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
really listen to my body and each day

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.479 
really listen to my body and each day
find<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> optimal<00:00:55.079> level<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.949> effort<00:00:56.070> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
find the optimal level of effort you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.039 
find the optimal level of effort you
know<00:00:56.519> if<00:00:56.670> I'm<00:00:56.790> feeling<00:00:57.059> good<00:00:57.180> i'll<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.540> hard<00:00:57.780> if

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
know if I'm feeling good i'll go hard if

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:59.210 
know if I'm feeling good i'll go hard if
I'm<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.320> feeling<00:00:58.650> good<00:00:58.769> i'll<00:00:58.890> make<00:00:59.040> sure<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
I'm not feeling good i'll make sure to

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.820 
I'm not feeling good i'll make sure to
scale<00:00:59.760> back<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.269> it<00:01:00.299> easier<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> yeah

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
scale back and get it easier so yeah

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.619 
scale back and get it easier so yeah
that's<00:01:01.949> really<00:01:02.100> listen<00:01:02.430> my<00:01:02.580> body<00:01:02.790> and<00:01:03.299> not

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that's really listen my body and not

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.010 
that's really listen my body and not
relying<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.140> guy<00:01:04.739> did<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.070> much

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.020 

I<00:01:09.109> don't<00:01:09.950> yeah<00:01:10.219> because<00:01:10.399> I<00:01:10.609> don't<00:01:10.789> want<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.969> be

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
I don't yeah because I don't want to be

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.459 
I don't yeah because I don't want to be
distracted<00:01:11.240> I<00:01:11.600> guess<00:01:11.780> is<00:01:12.020> what<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:12.229> comes<00:01:12.320> down

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
distracted I guess is what it comes down

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.139 
distracted I guess is what it comes down
to<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:12.920> my<00:01:13.219> day<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.399> day<00:01:13.490> training<00:01:13.880> I<00:01:14.000> don't

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
to you my day to day training I don't

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.749 
to you my day to day training I don't
want<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.329> be<00:01:14.390> distracted<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.990> during<00:01:15.229> a<00:01:15.289> race

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
want to be distracted and during a race

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.450 
want to be distracted and during a race
a<00:01:16.759> big<00:01:17.509> reason<00:01:17.630> why<00:01:17.780> race<00:01:18.110> is<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.530> be<00:01:19.159> there<00:01:19.340> and

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
a big reason why race is to be there and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.510 
a big reason why race is to be there and
experience<00:01:19.789> what<00:01:20.719> it's<00:01:20.899> like<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.409> run<00:01:22.100> 100

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
experience what it's like to run 100

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.999 
experience what it's like to run 100
miles<00:01:22.640> as<00:01:22.850> hard<00:01:23.000> as<00:01:23.119> I<00:01:23.179> can<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:24.619> distract

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
miles as hard as I can and to distract

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.880 
miles as hard as I can and to distract
myself<00:01:25.189> from<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:26.319> it's<00:01:27.319> just<00:01:27.560> not<00:01:27.679> what<00:01:27.770> I'm

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
myself from that it's just not what I'm

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.499 
myself from that it's just not what I'm
interested<00:01:28.069> in<00:01:28.340> in<00:01:28.579> terms<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.000> experience

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
interested in in terms of the experience

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.470 
interested in in terms of the experience
when<00:01:30.110> I<00:01:30.140> kind<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.409> like<00:01:30.439> experience<00:01:31.039> at<00:01:31.100> all

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.900 

yeah<00:01:36.380> that's<00:01:36.680> that's<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.160> big<00:01:37.310> motivation<00:01:37.700> in

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
yeah that's that's a big motivation in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.600 
yeah that's that's a big motivation in
mine<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.180> running<00:01:38.680> but<00:01:39.680> it's<00:01:39.830> paradoxical

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
mine and running but it's paradoxical

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.040 
mine and running but it's paradoxical
because<00:01:40.820> if<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.180> focus<00:01:41.480> on<00:01:41.540> that<00:01:41.600> it's<00:01:41.900> not

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
because if you focus on that it's not

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.630 
because if you focus on that it's not
gonna<00:01:42.230> happen<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.680> know<00:01:42.830> it's<00:01:43.070> something

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
gonna happen you know it's something

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.280 
gonna happen you know it's something
that<00:01:43.850> happens<00:01:43.970> sort<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.510> me<00:01:44.720> equity<00:01:45.080> and<00:01:45.230> you

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
that happens sort of me equity and you

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.980 
that happens sort of me equity and you
can't<00:01:45.530> force<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.540> kind<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:47.600> lessons<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:47.960> learned

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
can't force it kind of lessons I learned

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.470 
can't force it kind of lessons I learned
from<00:01:48.230> running<00:01:48.700> in<00:01:49.700> terms<00:01:49.910> of<00:01:50.030> them<00:01:50.150> find<00:01:50.360> them

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
from running in terms of them find them

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.990 
from running in terms of them find them
to<00:01:50.570> my<00:01:50.690> rest<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.110> rest<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.410> my<00:01:51.470> life<00:01:51.620> is<00:01:52.000> sore

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
to my rest the rest of my life is sore

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.030 
to my rest the rest of my life is sore
that<00:01:53.150> same<00:01:53.360> vein<00:01:53.600> of<00:01:53.660> learned<00:01:54.620> how<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.770> live<00:01:54.920> in

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
that same vein of learned how to live in

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.450 
that same vein of learned how to live in
the<00:01:55.070> moment<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.640> not<00:01:55.820> be<00:01:56.230> always<00:01:57.340> thinking<00:01:58.340> of

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
the moment and not be always thinking of

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.670 
the moment and not be always thinking of
the<00:01:58.580> future<00:01:58.730> is<00:01:58.940> gonna<00:01:59.030> be<00:01:59.120> better<00:01:59.680> focusing

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
the future is gonna be better focusing

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.500 
the future is gonna be better focusing
on<00:02:01.430> your<00:02:01.550> energies<00:02:01.910> in<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.030> future<00:02:02.390> if

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
on your energies in the future if

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.240 
on your energies in the future if
instead<00:02:02.900> being<00:02:03.170> satisfying<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:04.070> in<00:02:04.220> a

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
instead being satisfying to that in a

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.680 
instead being satisfying to that in a
moment<00:02:04.400> I<00:02:04.790> think<00:02:05.240> that's<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.510> big<00:02:05.660> part

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
moment I think that's a big part

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.500 
moment I think that's a big part
enjoying<00:02:06.230> life<00:02:06.440> and<00:02:06.680> something<00:02:07.430> that<00:02:07.670> all<00:02:08.450> of

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
enjoying life and something that all of

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.890 
enjoying life and something that all of
us<00:02:08.810> need<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.500> work<00:02:09.740> on
