00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
yeah and some of the experiences are

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.580 
yeah and some of the experiences are
pretty<00:00:46.289> intense<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.480> always<00:00:48.930> classify

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
pretty intense and I always classify

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.290 
pretty intense and I always classify
experiences<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.280> two<00:00:50.460> ways<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.910> think<00:00:50.940> there

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
experiences in two ways I think there

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.380 
experiences in two ways I think there
are<00:00:51.620> physically<00:00:52.620> dangerous<00:00:53.090> experiences<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
are physically dangerous experiences and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.330 
are physically dangerous experiences and
then<00:00:54.570> there<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.800> psychologically<00:00:55.800> dangerous

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
then there are psychologically dangerous

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.400 
then there are psychologically dangerous
and<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.360> some<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> scariest<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.320> me

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and I think some of the scariest for me

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.200 
and I think some of the scariest for me
have<00:00:58.530> been<00:00:58.559> sick<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> lot<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.370> would<00:00:59.820> say<00:01:00.000> well

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
have been sick a lot I would say well

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.639 
have been sick a lot I would say well
