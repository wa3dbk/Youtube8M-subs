of this part of the shot down here and
since<00:02:02.560> light<00:02:02.799> falls<00:02:03.100> off<00:02:03.310> in<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.549> gradient<00:02:03.880> what

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
since light falls off in a gradient what

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.749 
since light falls off in a gradient what
I<00:02:04.299> want<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:04.689> use<00:02:04.900> is<00:02:05.320> Lightroom's<00:02:05.890> graduated

I want to use is Lightroom's graduated
filter<00:02:07.150> tool<00:02:07.390> which<00:02:07.540> allows<00:02:07.869> me<00:02:08.049> to<00:02:08.170> do<00:02:08.379> these

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
filter tool which allows me to do these

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.649 
filter tool which allows me to do these
kind<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:08.979> gradient<00:02:09.280> Corrections<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:10.509> that's

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
kind of gradient Corrections so that's

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:11.940 
kind of gradient Corrections so that's
this<00:02:10.810> little<00:02:11.049> tool<00:02:11.260> right<00:02:11.290> here<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.860> the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
this little tool right here on the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.770 
this little tool right here on the
toolbar<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.730> I'm<00:02:12.849> gonna<00:02:13.000> click<00:02:13.269> to<00:02:13.390> open<00:02:13.420> it

and

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.080 
and
to<00:02:14.379> make<00:02:14.530> sure<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.859> exposure<00:02:15.340> has<00:02:15.879> just

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
to make sure the exposure has just

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.670 
to make sure the exposure has just
brought<00:02:16.299> down<00:02:16.329> a<00:02:16.629> bit<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.319> then<00:02:17.439> I'm<00:02:17.499> gonna

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
brought down a bit and then I'm gonna

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.559 
brought down a bit and then I'm gonna
drag<00:02:18.069> in<00:02:18.249> a<00:02:18.340> gradient<00:02:18.670> from<00:02:18.969> the<00:02:19.090> bottom<00:02:19.420> where

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
drag in a gradient from the bottom where

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.360 
drag in a gradient from the bottom where
the<00:02:19.689> light<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:19.930> too<00:02:20.290> hot<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.010> I'm<00:02:21.099> just<00:02:21.249> gonna

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
the light is too hot and I'm just gonna

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.640 
the light is too hot and I'm just gonna
darken<00:02:21.939> the<00:02:22.030> exposure<00:02:22.510> along<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.409> same

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
darken the exposure along the same

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.259 
darken the exposure along the same
gradient<00:02:24.189> that<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.430> light<00:02:24.609> is<00:02:24.790> naturally

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
gradient that the light is naturally

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.179 
gradient that the light is naturally
falling<00:02:25.659> off<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.079> correct<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:26.950> and

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
falling off and correct for it and

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.830 
falling off and correct for it and
fortunately<00:02:28.150> with<00:02:28.299> Lightroom<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.689> can

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
fortunately with Lightroom you can

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.869 
fortunately with Lightroom you can
adjust<00:02:29.200> these<00:02:29.409> after<00:02:30.189> the<00:02:30.280> fact<00:02:30.489> so<00:02:30.700> now<00:02:30.819> that

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
adjust these after the fact so now that

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.190 
adjust these after the fact so now that
I've<00:02:31.120> laid<00:02:31.329> it<00:02:31.359> in<00:02:31.569> there<00:02:31.689> I<00:02:31.719> can<00:02:31.930> make<00:02:31.959> it

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
I've laid it in there I can make it

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.319 
I've laid it in there I can make it
brighter<00:02:32.530> or<00:02:32.799> darker<00:02:33.040> if<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.790> wanted<00:02:33.969> it<00:02:34.060> really

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
brighter or darker if I wanted it really

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.750 
brighter or darker if I wanted it really
dark<00:02:34.629> I<00:02:34.840> could<00:02:35.019> go<00:02:35.139> way<00:02:35.349> down<00:02:35.590> or<00:02:36.159> if<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.670> know

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
dark I could go way down or if you know

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.039 
dark I could go way down or if you know
if<00:02:36.909> I<00:02:37.000> want<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.239> lighten<00:02:37.389> it<00:02:37.540> up<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.750> bit<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.989> can

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
if I want to lighten it up a bit I can

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.199 
if I want to lighten it up a bit I can
bring<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.379> up<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:39.129> just<00:02:39.370> dial<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.849> in<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.120> the

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
bring it up and I just dial it in to the

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.149 
bring it up and I just dial it in to the
point<00:02:40.419> where<00:02:40.599> I<00:02:40.659> think<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:40.959> looks<00:02:41.169> good<00:02:41.439> maybe

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
point where I think it looks good maybe

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.759 
point where I think it looks good maybe
about<00:02:42.459> like<00:02:42.519> that<00:02:42.969> and<00:02:43.269> then<00:02:43.719> I<00:02:43.749> close<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
about like that and then I close the

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.530 
about like that and then I close the
tool<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.609> adjustments<00:02:46.150> done<00:02:46.359> it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
tool and the adjustments done it

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.909 
tool and the adjustments done it
literally<00:02:46.870> just<00:02:46.900> took<00:02:47.169> a<00:02:47.260> few<00:02:47.439> seconds<00:02:47.859> to

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:47.919 
literally just took a few seconds to

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.740 
literally just took a few seconds to
correct<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.430> problem<00:02:48.489> so<00:02:49.389> let's<00:02:49.569> take<00:02:49.719> a

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
correct this problem so let's take a

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.319 
correct this problem so let's take a
look<00:02:49.959> at<00:02:50.019> one<00:02:50.169> more<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.700> now<00:02:51.819> we're<00:02:51.969> looking<00:02:52.060> at

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
look at one more so now we're looking at

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.670 
look at one more so now we're looking at
a<00:02:52.389> case<00:02:52.569> from<00:02:52.689> shooting<00:02:52.989> with<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.230> flash<00:02:53.469> on

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
a case from shooting with the flash on

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.220 
a case from shooting with the flash on
the<00:02:54.040> camera<00:02:54.069> and<00:02:54.669> I'm<00:02:55.359> shooting<00:02:55.599> a<00:02:55.780> performer

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
the camera and I'm shooting a performer

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.259 
the camera and I'm shooting a performer
who's<00:02:56.379> standing<00:02:56.650> on<00:02:56.889> a<00:02:56.919> stage<00:02:57.280> above<00:02:57.790> me<00:02:58.060> and

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
who's standing on a stage above me and

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.270 
who's standing on a stage above me and
because<00:02:58.719> of<00:02:58.750> her<00:02:58.959> position<00:02:59.290> higher<00:02:59.799> than<00:03:00.129> me

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
because of her position higher than me

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.759 
because of her position higher than me
my<00:03:00.790> flash<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.449> lighting<00:03:01.840> her<00:03:01.959> tube<00:03:02.230> right<00:03:02.530> down

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
my flash is lighting her tube right down

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.500 
my flash is lighting her tube right down
at<00:03:02.889> the<00:03:02.919> bottom<00:03:03.040> hurt<00:03:03.519> her<00:03:03.760> legs<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.299> boots

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
at the bottom hurt her legs and boots

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.899 
at the bottom hurt her legs and boots
and<00:03:04.719> feet<00:03:04.989> are<00:03:05.169> too<00:03:05.319> bright<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:06.699> light

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
and feet are too bright and the light

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.970 
and feet are too bright and the light
falls<00:03:07.269> off<00:03:07.569> up<00:03:07.840> toward<00:03:08.079> her<00:03:08.139> face<00:03:08.379> and<00:03:08.620> also

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
falls off up toward her face and also

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.800 
falls off up toward her face and also
from<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.370> left<00:03:09.579> side<00:03:09.849> because<00:03:10.269> I'm<00:03:10.419> standing

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
there that looks much more balanced and

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.800 
there that looks much more balanced and
it's<00:03:45.310> not<00:03:45.519> obvious<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.359> was<00:03:46.569> lit<00:03:46.780> with

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
it's not obvious that this was lit with

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.629 
it's not obvious that this was lit with
on-camera<00:03:47.590> flash<00:03:47.620> anymore

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639
