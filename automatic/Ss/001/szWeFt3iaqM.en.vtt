into<00:00:57.710> a<00:00:57.769> much<00:00:57.949> more<00:00:58.129> compact<00:00:58.580> unit<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.000> does

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
into a much more compact unit that does

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.369 
into a much more compact unit that does
one<00:00:59.390> effect<00:00:59.690> at<00:00:59.839> a<00:00:59.870> time

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
one effect at a time

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.680 
one effect at a time
it<00:01:00.890> has<00:01:01.010> stereo<00:01:01.400> inputs<00:01:01.760> stereo<00:01:02.269> outputs

it has stereo inputs stereo outputs

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.210 
it has stereo inputs stereo outputs
there's<00:01:03.140> an<00:01:03.290> input<00:01:03.559> for<00:01:03.650> an<00:01:03.769> expression<00:01:04.070> pedal

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
there's an input for an expression pedal

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.010 
there's an input for an expression pedal
so<00:01:04.610> you<00:01:04.670> can<00:01:04.850> control<00:01:05.089> delay<00:01:05.420> times<00:01:05.720> or

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
so you can control delay times or

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.540 
so you can control delay times or
basically<00:01:06.590> any<00:01:06.770> parameter<00:01:07.130> that<00:01:07.220> you<00:01:07.340> want

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
basically any parameter that you want

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.410 
basically any parameter that you want
using<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.880> foot<00:01:08.060> pedal

using a foot pedal
there's<00:01:08.840> also<00:01:09.020> MIDI<00:01:09.320> in<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:09.650> out<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:09.979> can

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
there's also MIDI in and out so you can

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.859 
there's also MIDI in and out so you can
integrate<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:10.790> into<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:11.030> more<00:01:11.270> complex<00:01:11.659> system

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
integrate it into a more complex system

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.840 
integrate it into a more complex system
if<00:01:12.080> you<00:01:12.170> wanted<00:01:12.440> to<00:01:12.619> it's<00:01:13.190> a<00:01:13.250> pedal<00:01:13.430> friendly

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
if you wanted to it's a pedal friendly

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.969 
if you wanted to it's a pedal friendly
size<00:01:14.060> has<00:01:14.539> 20<00:01:14.930> presets<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:15.710> can<00:01:15.830> actually

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
size has 20 presets so you can actually

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.410 
size has 20 presets so you can actually
store<00:01:16.369> your<00:01:16.399> favorite<00:01:16.640> sounds<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.240> step

different categories in fact they're the

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.029 
different categories in fact they're the

exact same effects that are in line six
is<00:01:43.190> larger<00:01:43.580> modeling<00:01:43.970> pedals<00:01:44.270> like<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.509> DL

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
is larger modeling pedals like the DL

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.020 
is larger modeling pedals like the DL
for<00:01:45.020> delay<00:01:45.319> modeler<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:46.160> modulation<00:01:46.580> model

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
for delay modeler the modulation model

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.910 
for delay modeler the modulation model
or<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.240> filter<00:01:47.539> modeler<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.440> distortion

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
or the filter modeler and the distortion

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.620 
or the filter modeler and the distortion
modeler<00:01:49.310> then<00:01:49.640> they<00:01:49.759> also<00:01:49.910> have<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.300> reverbs

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
modeler then they also have the reverbs

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.730 
modeler then they also have the reverbs
in<00:01:50.810> there<00:01:50.899> that<00:01:51.050> are<00:01:51.140> in<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.319> verb<00:01:51.500> Zilla

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.100 
setup without using a soldering iron it
uses<00:05:43.770> all<00:05:43.950> solderless<00:05:44.490> connections<00:05:45.020> so<00:05:46.020> when

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
uses all solderless connections so when

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.660 
uses all solderless connections so when
you<00:05:46.200> open<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.500> box<00:05:46.650> the<00:05:46.920> two<00:05:47.040> pickups<00:05:47.400> are<00:05:47.550> in

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
you open the box the two pickups are in

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.980 
you open the box the two pickups are in
there<00:05:47.880> there's<00:05:48.600> also<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:51.240> potentiometers

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
there there's also the potentiometers

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.600 
there there's also the potentiometers
which<00:05:52.350> have<00:05:52.530> little<00:05:52.740> connectors<00:05:53.280> on<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.430> end

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
which have little connectors on the end

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.860 
which have little connectors on the end
of<00:05:53.730> them<00:05:53.820> so<00:05:53.940> you<00:05:54.030> can<00:05:54.150> just<00:05:54.300> slip<00:05:54.420> the<00:05:54.540> slotted

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
of them so you can just slip the slotted

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.480 
of them so you can just slip the slotted
list<00:05:55.050> connectors<00:05:55.410> on<00:05:55.590> there<00:05:55.800> all<00:05:56.070> of<00:05:56.250> the

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
list connectors on there all of the

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.770 
list connectors on there all of the
cables<00:05:56.850> already<00:05:57.060> have<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.360> solderless

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
cables already have the solderless

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.150 
cables already have the solderless
connectors<00:05:58.170> in<00:05:58.320> there<00:05:58.530> so<00:05:58.950> when<00:05:59.040> you're

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
connectors in there so when you're

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.290 
connectors in there so when you're
retrofitting<00:05:59.460> this<00:05:59.850> into<00:06:00.060> your<00:06:00.150> guitar

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
retrofitting this into your guitar

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.390 
retrofitting this into your guitar
