00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:04.930
 the Russian the living room this motto applies to all control units whether Luca 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.079
 was the fair or Luger Martic 4000 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.779
 now the RC will be 20 percent in the high dome 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:15.579
 he keeps the regulation of the heating system information about the measured 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.189
 room temperature 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.689
 This information flows into the calculation of the boiler even the Rain 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.050
 help to increase comfort and bring energy savings 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.579
 Since 2005, Buderus offers him unit RC 20 he invented over the radio 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.280
 the Luga Matic of the metering data on penalty she is in functional range 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.460
 comparable with the control unit PRC 20 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.500
 The main advantage of the control unit RC 20 RF is the radio connection 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.580
 that is for the connection to the scheme Loga Martigny VAT where there is no 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.230
 Cable taz be relocated to the living room 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.000
 the advantages of room temperature connection are even easier 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.120
 To use Heroes in the living room this motto is therefore especially good for 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.580
 the control unit PRC 20 RF 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.360
 the benefits at a glance for interfacing with the scheme the MST needs 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.170
 no cable to be relocated to the living room which ultimately 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.530
 Installation costs and therefore costs especially in stock where frequent 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.220
 no cable between heat generator and reference space can be laid 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.730
 now the significantly higher heating costs place used by a remote control 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.080
 also the subsequent installation in a house with 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.200
 Granny flat is easily possible 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.600
 For example, if the customer subsequently no control unit in the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.860
 Move the living space or even the tenants to open access to the heating system 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.410
 The flexible mounting makes it easy to excite on the wall 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.410
 possible to set up freely in the room 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.230
 The change of the reference space is also problem-free if the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.100
 Needs should change once 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.780
 this gives the overall system an extremely high degree of flexibility 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.360
 and in principle, up to three control units RC 20 RF can be one 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.920
 Basic motive and connected 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.950
 In summary, it can be said that at the latest from the installation of a second 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.980
 Heating circuits is no way on RC 20 KF adults 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:19.069
 only with the installation of a barely concrete si maximum economy one 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.689
 Reach heating system 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.389
 and why should I do without it? 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.870
 if the installation of the waiver of CHF 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.790
 that's easy
