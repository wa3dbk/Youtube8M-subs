00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
kind of for me at least strikes a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.999 
kind of for me at least strikes a
balance<00:01:28.799> between<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.790> truth

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
balance between the truth

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
which this has been burning for a while

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.600 
which this has been burning for a while
and<00:03:39.270> I'm<00:03:39.390> using<00:03:39.690> relatively<00:03:40.290> light<00:03:40.500> heat<00:03:40.860> on<00:03:41.100> a

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
and I'm using relatively light heat on a

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.470 
and I'm using relatively light heat on a
mini<00:03:42.060> funnel<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.760> smokes<00:03:45.360> a

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
mini funnel so the so the smokes a

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.710 
mini funnel so the so the smokes a
little<00:03:45.750> lighter<00:03:45.990> than<00:03:46.850> then<00:03:47.850> could<00:03:48.210> be<00:03:48.450> pushed

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
little lighter than then could be pushed

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600 
little lighter than then could be pushed
out<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:48.990> this<00:03:49.140> tobacco<00:03:49.350> but<00:03:49.830> I<00:03:49.890> find<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.490> to<00:03:50.580> be

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
out of this tobacco but I find it to be

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.450 
out of this tobacco but I find it to be
a<00:03:50.700> little<00:03:51.000> bit<00:03:51.240> heat<00:03:51.630> sensitive<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:53.220> if<00:03:53.340> you're

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
a little bit heat sensitive so if you're

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.880
