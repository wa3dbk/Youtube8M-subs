00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:15.020
 probably it is 1 1 1 and I will say this question 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.880
 that we have to solve it with us 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.599
 individually will we 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.869
 trust 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:29.359
 To start the Olympic champion 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.400
 the head of the regalia zero servants whether it will be 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.080
 devireg practically ira language 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:41.080
 but we are practically in the same team 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.080
 I'm over a year old match 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.829
 I will trust you 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.649
 understanding of the heart of the psyche brain must 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.340
 feel understand it 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.489
 it works it right but it only 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.960
 works is seeking and work 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.700
 there are features of course i personally 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.180
 features of any person need it 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.180
 look 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.890
 In Russia , these are not working 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:24.440
 American options came American 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.440
 all about yes yes he can be numbers coach 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.250
 others on we don't have another very simple 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.540
 under gives advice very process and you even 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:40.110
 in the ring box do not fight anymore 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.830
 Combine Prissi I can do everything there clearly 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.979
 there is no such as we have a good coach 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.690
 can can simply decompose even 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.149
 episode of the moment he further continued 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:56.750
 what I take off jacob and how we go out to 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:01.380
 we just go to box more 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:05.280
 will depend on my need to have my 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.440
 view us and bring to him what it is 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.739
 it works then our door on the flag 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.739
 what 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.370
 will not be good hard I need 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.510
 getting from him here is the most important thing 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.510
 gain trust and 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:39.180
 boxing language there is an expression necessary 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.100
 shoot an athlete show before 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.220
 just show him his mistakes 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.990
 straight show and tell it you 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.870
 you do it because he because everything 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.590
 Here the balance breaks down 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.480
 bent over here hands hanging here 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.480
 strike gets go well 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.349
 Russia is definitely not the coaches that we 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.330
 maybe got excited probably have 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:16.500
 with the forest there are of course who build and 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.709
 athletes building are afraid that 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:26.760
 flexible thinking that can change 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.760
 change the fight for a year on the situation 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:39.100
 to the engine 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:44.450
