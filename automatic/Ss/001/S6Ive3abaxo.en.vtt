micro settings particularly give us the

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.599 
micro settings particularly give us the
ability<00:01:37.929> to<00:01:38.109> adjust<00:01:38.380> in<00:01:38.590> between<00:01:38.889> each<00:01:39.039> macro

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
ability to adjust in between each macro

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.219 
ability to adjust in between each macro
setting<00:01:39.969> so<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.659> can<00:01:40.810> precisely

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
setting so that you can precisely

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.230 
setting so that you can precisely
fine-tune<00:01:41.979> your<00:01:42.069> coffee<00:01:42.429> to<00:01:42.639> get<00:01:42.789> that<00:01:42.969> shot

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
fine-tune your coffee to get that shot

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.519 
fine-tune your coffee to get that shot
timing<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.810> you're<00:01:43.959> looking<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:44.380> get

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
another nice feature of the grinder has

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.209 
another nice feature of the grinder has
unique<00:01:46.959> set<00:01:47.169> of<00:01:47.200> conical<00:01:47.649> birds<00:01:47.859> that<00:01:48.039> can

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
unique set of conical birds that can

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.309 
unique set of conical birds that can
grind<00:01:48.459> up<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.119> two<00:01:49.299> grams<00:01:49.569> of<00:01:49.749> coffee<00:01:49.990> per

grind up to two grams of coffee per

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.679 
grind up to two grams of coffee per
second<00:01:50.829> and<00:01:51.039> that's<00:01:51.819> actually<00:01:52.240> quite<00:01:52.389> a<00:01:52.479> bit

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
second and that's actually quite a bit

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.480 
second and that's actually quite a bit
faster<00:01:53.259> than<00:01:53.649> a<00:01:53.709> lot<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:54.069> other<00:01:54.159> similar

thing that the machine features like the

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.190 
thing that the machine features like the
virtuoso<00:01:59.859> is<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.700> has<00:02:00.849> the<00:02:01.060> ability<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.450> can

it has a timer switch here on this side
as<00:02:09.910> well<00:02:10.060> where<00:02:10.570> you<00:02:10.660> could<00:02:10.840> grind<00:02:11.140> right<00:02:11.350> into

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
as well where you could grind right into

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.900 
as well where you could grind right into
the<00:02:11.830> hopper<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.220> what<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.520> does<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.880> gives

the hopper and what that does it gives

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.559 
the hopper and what that does it gives
you<00:02:13.120> control<00:02:13.330> for<00:02:13.840> time

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
ahead to save some time here I've

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.809 
ahead to save some time here I've
actually<00:02:42.169> loaded<00:02:42.650> up<00:02:42.769> my<00:02:42.889> portafilter<00:02:43.340> handle

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
actually loaded up my portafilter handle

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.339 
actually loaded up my portafilter handle
with<00:02:43.909> the<00:02:43.999> right<00:02:44.150> amount<00:02:44.269> of<00:02:44.480> coffee<00:02:44.659> and<00:02:45.049> of

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
with the right amount of coffee and of

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.259 
with the right amount of coffee and of
course<00:02:45.560> I've<00:02:45.739> ground<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.159> correctly<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.819> what

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
course I've ground it correctly and what

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.240 
course I've ground it correctly and what
I<00:02:47.299> did<00:02:47.599> is<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.930> out<00:02:48.169> in<00:02:48.439> my<00:02:48.560> grinder<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.219> make

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
I did is that out in my grinder to make

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.679 
I did is that out in my grinder to make
sure<00:02:49.579> that<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.760> could<00:02:49.879> get<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.150> ideal<00:02:50.419> shot

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
sure that I could get the ideal shot

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.199 
sure that I could get the ideal shot
time<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.290> with<00:02:51.829> this<00:02:51.950> grinder<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.459> have<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:52.939> set

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
time and with this grinder I have it set

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.929 
time and with this grinder I have it set
at<00:02:53.680> number<00:02:54.680> eleven<00:02:55.159> on<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.579> macro

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 
at number eleven on the macro

at number eleven on the macro
adjustments<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.719> then<00:02:56.870> I'm<00:02:57.109> the<00:02:57.650> micro
