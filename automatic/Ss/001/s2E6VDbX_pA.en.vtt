00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
and I don't remember it was good enough

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.640 
and I don't remember it was good enough
because<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.230> original

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650

for<00:00:26.789> me<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.180> remember<00:00:27.570> correctly<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.410> think

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
for me if I remember correctly I think

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.019 
for me if I remember correctly I think
it<00:00:28.830> was<00:00:28.949> actually<00:00:29.220> pretty<00:00:29.369> good<00:00:29.490> what<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.849> was

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
it was actually pretty good what it was

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.669 
it was actually pretty good what it was
is<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.269> having<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> sweetness<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
is that having the sweetness of the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.170 
is that having the sweetness of the
dough<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> book<00:00:32.399> eats<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> chewiness

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
dough of the book eats of the chewiness

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.580 
dough of the book eats of the chewiness
of<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> peanut<00:00:33.840> butter<00:00:33.899> kind<00:00:34.140> made<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.380> hard

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
of the peanut butter kind made it hard

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.440 
of the peanut butter kind made it hard
to<00:00:34.620> eat<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> think<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.700> should<00:00:35.730> do<00:00:36.030> is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
to eat so I think what we should do is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330 
to eat so I think what we should do is
not<00:00:36.510> put<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> lot<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.380> butt<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.890> show<00:00:38.100> we

not put a lot of butt on this show we

not put a lot of butt on this show we
know<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.610> that's<00:00:38.820> gonna<00:00:39.000> overdo<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.540> put<00:00:39.930> a
