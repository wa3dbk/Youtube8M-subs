00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 the one that Carlos told you that he has always 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.940
 liked this to grow as 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.880
 good professional we were in colombia 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.340
 and he dreamed of getting to Europe he was 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.109
 presented the opportunity for witches and the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.029
 truth is that we do not think much 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.130
 because he already wanted to leave 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.460
 Colombia was presented with that opportunity 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.160
 well it was a totally different country 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.460
 the language as you said but the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.830
 truth is that we do not think much 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.739
 We decided to come and he started there 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.090
 work to get the other step that 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.559
 was to get to a league much more 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.329
 important good and thank god 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.450
 we come to the Spanish league a good 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.160
 team and here we are very pleased with the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.129
 I tell you that we had heard 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.610
 rumors were heard all but nothing 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.270
 we made a trip 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.039
 we used to take a trip in 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.039
 vacation alone we were both in 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.260
 mexico when Carlos was started 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.390
 good call to tell him that they had 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.230
 interests this but still nothing is 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.420
 I had specified 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.320
 we were very excited because 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.170
 we were coming 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.240
 a country with a little good language 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.300
 similar to ours are not words 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.360
 exactly the same but this is Spanish 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.920
 we came to a very beautiful city with a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.040
 pleasant climate 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.720
 then we were very excited 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.850
 carlos traveled to witches had to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.400
 present yourself being there safe 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.560
 preseason and when he called me 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.470
 said not so things go to me anymore 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.780
 black very much I was already saying it is not that no 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.520
 I like witches because the truth is that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.630
 There are living very beautiful experiences the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.000
 birth of my girl everything but already 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.850
 We wanted to catch another air then 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.800
 We were very happy when they were already 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.119
 gave the definite news that she does 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.369
 apart from seville the truth is that 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.500
 we were very happy the truth is that 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.160
 Seville is a very beautiful city with 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.530
 a lot of history with a lot of thread and what 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.030
 typical they always tell you is to travel 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.680
 know her turn 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.590
 we went and the truth is that he called me a lot 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.050
 the attention in the cathedral is a site 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.690
 very nice then when I saw her I told her 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.679
 to Carlos that this is a site like 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.310
 nice that you 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.560
 cut to the story all that site I 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.200
 liked it a lot because the truth is that you 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.030
 we said the custom the Spaniards eat 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.299
 at the time 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.450
 well here they go out to dinner 19 the night 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.810
 there we in Colombia and at that time 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.239
 We have already eaten here 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.760
 us for lunch on the 12th 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.189
 noon to one in the afternoon then in 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.219
 yes, it's my turn to get used to it 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:43.950
 a little bit to meal times and it's 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:47.700
 call me to call my attention no no no 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.980
 but football is breathed here 24 hours 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.079
 of the day x we sit on television is 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.049
 football with so many competitions there 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.959
 now all of football here this is already 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.450
 it is already is commented a game with Carlos 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.010
 I give opinions to Carlos and to Carlos 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.659
 He says that sometimes I hit upon the 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.700
 things that I say then is something 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.950
 fun for us to sit and watch 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.390
 a football game and that we see 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.730
 the friendly side to 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.640
 to that the carla profession because the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.530
 truth we are as I tell you we are 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.560
 very believers we are very Christian 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.760
 then before each game always 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.540
 we speak and read passages of the bible 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:30.030
 I wish you successes and things like that 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.520
 then that is what makes us 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.350
 before he leaves a match 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.420
 are the conversations from us if 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.220
 here usually 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.980
 we read a lot to the bible before 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.580
 to lie down there are two or three days of the 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.270
 week we practice fasting sometimes 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.420
 we do it individually as couples 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:55.980
 then that of being Christian believers 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:00.780
 unites us more and it strengthens us is the 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.209
 truth is that we when we are in 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.060
 we are a different country 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.720
 only carlos the children and me then 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.930
 sometimes going to meet people and creating 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.049
 a nucleus of friendship is something very nice 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.690
 and in Belgium we left many friendships and 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.810
 here little by little we have already done 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:26.630
 friendship and it's something that's going to make you 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.630
 full that you do not feel so alone
