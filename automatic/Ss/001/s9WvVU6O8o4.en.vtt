00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
they traveled the log net what looking

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.590 
they traveled the log net what looking
at<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.420> for<00:02:02.690> some<00:02:02.900> time<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:05.030> then<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.390> Lord

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
where I started watching and looking at

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.190 
where I started watching and looking at
the<00:02:10.130> river<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.000> he<00:02:11.420> took<00:02:11.630> me<00:02:11.870> up<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.170> other

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
the river and he took me up the other

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.250 
the river and he took me up the other
way<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.830> he<00:02:13.250> showed<00:02:13.940> me<00:02:14.150> what<00:02:14.390> looks<00:02:14.630> like<00:02:14.840> to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
way and he showed me what looks like to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.130 
way and he showed me what looks like to
me<00:02:15.410> they<00:02:15.770> were<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:16.100> streams<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.900> were

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
me they were like streams that were

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.700 
me they were like streams that were
leading<00:02:18.590> into<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.730> river<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.710> they

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
leading into this this river and they

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.560 
leading into this this river and they
were<00:02:21.770> completely<00:02:22.400> dry<00:02:22.820> maybe<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.270> little

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
were completely dry maybe a little

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.270 
were completely dry maybe a little
trickle<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:24.110> water<00:02:24.140> in<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.740> center

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
trickle of water in the center

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.520 
trickle of water in the center
he<00:02:25.670> showed<00:02:25.910> me<00:02:25.940> either<00:02:26.390> two<00:02:26.810> or<00:02:26.990> three<00:02:27.320> of

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
he showed me either two or three of

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.300 
he showed me either two or three of
these<00:02:28.420> these<00:02:29.420> streams<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.590> called<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.130> myself

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
these these streams I I called it myself

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.780 
these these streams I I called it myself
streams<00:02:32.209> as<00:02:32.570> it<00:02:32.720> praying<00:02:33.020> over<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.350> vision<00:02:33.860> he

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
streams as it praying over the vision he

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.910 
streams as it praying over the vision he
told<00:02:35.030> me<00:02:35.120> they<00:02:35.240> were<00:02:35.300> tributaries<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.500> not

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
told me they were tributaries and not

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.470 
told me they were tributaries and not
knowing<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.640> know<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.790> kind<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.120> had<00:02:38.270> an<00:02:38.360> idea

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
knowing you know I kind of had an idea

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.360 
knowing you know I kind of had an idea
what<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.140> was<00:02:39.320> but<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.530> had<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.860> go<00:02:39.980> ahead<00:02:40.220> and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
what that was but I had to go ahead and

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.550 
what that was but I had to go ahead and
look<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.610> up<00:02:40.700> in<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:40.940> in<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.630> Google<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.260> find

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
look it up in the in the Google and find

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.949 
look it up in the in the Google and find
out<00:02:42.680> where<00:02:42.830> tributary<00:02:43.370> was<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.150> what<00:02:44.840> it

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
out where tributary was and of what it

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.500 
out where tributary was and of what it
is<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.350> exactly<00:02:45.950> what<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.459> would<00:02:46.670> was<00:02:47.000> seeing<00:02:47.270> it

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
is is exactly what I would was seeing it

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.860 
is is exactly what I would was seeing it
was<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:47.720> feed<00:02:48.160> going<00:02:49.160> into<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.880> river<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
was a feed going into the river so the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.040 
was a feed going into the river so the
tributaries<00:02:51.590> are<00:02:51.890> dried<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:53.180> river<00:02:53.360> is<00:02:53.660> dried

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
tributaries are dried the river is dried

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.470 
tributaries are dried the river is dried
and<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.980> further<00:02:55.459> understanding<00:02:56.240> after

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
and the further understanding after

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.930 
and the further understanding after
praying<00:02:56.840> on<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.260> vision<00:02:57.590> was<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.610> I

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
praying on the vision was that the I

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.670 
praying on the vision was that the I
don't<00:02:59.540> even<00:02:59.630> know<00:02:59.870> what<00:03:00.050> I<00:03:00.080> want<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.470> call<00:03:00.620> it

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
don't even know what I want to call it

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.949 
don't even know what I want to call it
the<00:03:01.040> fountain<00:03:01.519> or<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.910> spraying<00:03:02.239> or<00:03:02.540> whatever

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
the fountain or the spraying or whatever

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.860 
the fountain or the spraying or whatever
it<00:03:03.320> is<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:04.340> sends<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.030> water<00:03:05.269> into<00:03:05.840> the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
it is that sends the water into the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.620 
it is that sends the water into the
River<00:03:06.230> Delta<00:03:06.650> through<00:03:07.340> these<00:03:07.630> tributaries

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
River Delta through these tributaries

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.080 
River Delta through these tributaries
that<00:03:08.660> source<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.739> also<00:03:10.280> going<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.519> be<00:03:10.610> dried<00:03:10.910> up

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
that source is also going to be dried up

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.310 
that source is also going to be dried up
so<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.680> morning<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.100> came<00:03:13.160> down<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:15.050> put
