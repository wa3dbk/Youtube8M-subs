00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
perhaps 150 million pounds a year we

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.930 
perhaps 150 million pounds a year we

I do this trip from Nairobi Sundin every
year<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.350> very<00:02:20.500> far<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.920> most<00:02:21.100> part

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400

year and this is very far the most part
most<00:02:21.760> comfortable<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.330> can<00:02:22.510> remember<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:23.320> vc10

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
most comfortable I can remember the vc10

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.180 
most comfortable I can remember the vc10
was<00:02:24.100> deeply<00:02:24.880> loved<00:02:25.120> by<00:02:25.240> passengers<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.230> that

was deeply loved by passengers and that

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.800 
was deeply loved by passengers and that
was<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> great<00:02:27.610> selling<00:02:28.000> point<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.780> very

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
was a great selling point it's very

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.240 
was a great selling point it's very
seldom<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.500> get<00:02:29.680> people<00:02:29.950> coming<00:02:30.130> off

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
seldom you get people coming off

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.200 
seldom you get people coming off
aircraft<00:02:30.730> saying<00:02:30.970> what<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.120> wonderful

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
aircraft saying what a wonderful

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.690 
aircraft saying what a wonderful
aircraft<00:02:31.960> that<00:02:32.170> was<00:02:32.380> but<00:02:32.920> they<00:02:33.040> really<00:02:33.400> did<00:02:33.550> on

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
aircraft that was but they really did on

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.970 
aircraft that was but they really did on
the<00:02:33.790> vc10<00:02:34.120> people<00:02:34.570> were<00:02:34.660> actually<00:02:35.290> asked<00:02:35.800> to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
the vc10 people were actually asked to

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.890 
the vc10 people were actually asked to
fly<00:02:36.280> on<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:36.820> would<00:02:37.240> postpone<00:02:37.480> their

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
fly on it and would postpone their

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.960 
fly on it and would postpone their
flight<00:02:38.140> if<00:02:38.350> they<00:02:38.500> couldn't<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:39.070> think<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.790> an

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
flight if they couldn't I think is an

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.390 
flight if they couldn't I think is an
extremely<00:02:40.570> comfortable<00:02:41.170> playing<00:02:41.560> very

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
extremely comfortable playing very

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.400 
extremely comfortable playing very
smooth<00:02:42.760> very<00:02:43.120> quiet

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.370 
smooth very quiet
the<00:02:45.220> seating<00:02:45.460> most<00:02:45.910> comfortable<00:02:46.600> plenty<00:02:47.320> of

the seating most comfortable plenty of

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.670 
the seating most comfortable plenty of

it<00:02:49.680> seems<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.280> travel<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:50.790> serenely<00:02:51.590> when<00:02:52.590> you

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
it seems to travel so serenely when you

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.390 
it seems to travel so serenely when you
hit<00:02:52.939> turbulence<00:02:53.939> it<00:02:54.420> doesn't<00:02:54.749> um<00:02:55.400> ride

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
hit turbulence it doesn't um ride

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.610 
hit turbulence it doesn't um ride
turbulence<00:02:56.999> like<00:02:57.180> other<00:02:57.420> airliners<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.439> has<00:02:58.590> a

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
turbulence like other airliners it has a

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.860 
turbulence like other airliners it has a
very<00:02:58.950> very<00:02:59.159> stiff<00:02:59.549> wing<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.450> doesn't

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
very very stiff wing so it doesn't

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.690 
very very stiff wing so it doesn't
juggle<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.409> about<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.549> average

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
juggle you about like the average

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.690 
juggle you about like the average
aircraft<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.599> of<00:03:04.230> course<00:03:04.469> the<00:03:05.310> one<00:03:05.489> major

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
aircraft and of course the one major

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.699 
aircraft and of course the one major
advantage<00:03:05.939> the<00:03:06.480> aeroplane<00:03:06.840> always<00:03:07.379> had<00:03:07.530> and

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
advantage the aeroplane always had and

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.410 
advantage the aeroplane always had and
made<00:03:07.829> it<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.219> successful<00:03:08.430> was<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.030> fact<00:03:09.329> that

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
made it so successful was the fact that

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.819 
made it so successful was the fact that
the<00:03:09.569> engines<00:03:09.959> were<00:03:10.079> on<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.349> tail

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
the engines were on the tail

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.009 
the engines were on the tail
so<00:03:11.609> of<00:03:11.760> course<00:03:11.939> consequently<00:03:12.599> it's<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.840> very

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
so of course consequently it's a very

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.490 
so of course consequently it's a very
quiet<00:03:13.379> interior<00:03:14.419> also<00:03:15.419> for<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> nervous<00:03:16.260> person

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
quiet interior also for a nervous person

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.619 
quiet interior also for a nervous person
who<00:03:16.859> doesn't<00:03:17.099> really<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:17.700> flying<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
who doesn't really like flying the

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.229 
who doesn't really like flying the
aircraft<00:03:18.810> could<00:03:19.349> take<00:03:19.620> off<00:03:19.799> 2/3<00:03:20.430> quicker<00:03:20.969> than

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
aircraft could take off 2/3 quicker than

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.839 
aircraft could take off 2/3 quicker than
a<00:03:21.299> 707<00:03:21.719> so<00:03:22.409> consequently<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:23.099> are<00:03:23.219> a<00:03:23.280> thousand

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
a 707 so consequently you are a thousand

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.179 
a 707 so consequently you are a thousand
feet<00:03:24.090> above<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.900> runway<00:03:25.049> where<00:03:25.409> the<00:03:25.500> 707<00:03:25.859> was

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 
feet above the runway where the 707 was

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:32.390 
feet above the runway where the 707 was
still<00:03:26.430> sitting<00:03:26.879> on<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:31.049> vc10<00:03:31.469> was<00:03:31.949> sold<00:03:32.189> on

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
still sitting on it the vc10 was sold on

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.369 
still sitting on it the vc10 was sold on
its<00:03:32.549> passenger<00:03:33.030> experience<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.900> part<00:03:34.290> of

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
its passenger experience and part of

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.589 
its passenger experience and part of
this<00:03:34.560> was<00:03:34.769> down<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.189> the<00:03:35.280> cabin<00:03:35.639> crew<00:03:35.819> they

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
this was down to the cabin crew they

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.720 
this was down to the cabin crew they
also<00:03:37.260> preferred<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.859> aircraft<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.639> 707

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
also preferred the aircraft to the 707

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.569 
also preferred the aircraft to the 707
when<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.819> compared<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.129> 707<00:03:44.129> which<00:03:44.459> I

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
when you compared it to the 707 which I

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.569 
when you compared it to the 707 which I
also<00:03:44.760> went<00:03:45.090> on<00:03:45.299> for<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.019> short<00:03:46.049> period<00:03:46.459> it<00:03:47.459> was

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
also went on for a short period it was

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.729 
also went on for a short period it was
the<00:03:47.730> most<00:03:47.879> amazing<00:03:48.209> aircraft<00:03:48.719> the<00:03:49.109> vc10<00:03:49.439> cos

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
the most amazing aircraft the vc10 cos

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.280 
the most amazing aircraft the vc10 cos

fast and it was only 144 passengers but
it<00:03:56.819> was<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.150> latest<00:03:57.359> jet<00:03:58.049> plane<00:03:58.409> you<00:03:58.680> know

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
it was the latest jet plane you know

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.469 
it was the latest jet plane you know
that<00:03:59.099> everyone<00:03:59.519> was<00:03:59.639> quite<00:03:59.759> excited<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.209> fly

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479 
that everyone was quite excited to fly

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.199 
that everyone was quite excited to fly
in<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:01.530> same<00:04:01.739> zone<00:04:01.949> was<00:04:02.099> much<00:04:02.280> noisier<00:04:02.849> and

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
in the same zone was much noisier and

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.569 
in the same zone was much noisier and
also<00:04:03.659> the<00:04:03.750> landing<00:04:04.199> was<00:04:04.430> wisely<00:04:05.430> was

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
also the landing was wisely was

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.599 
also the landing was wisely was
controlled<00:04:06.030> crash<00:04:06.329> all<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.629> time<00:04:07.340> bang<00:04:08.340> down

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
controlled crash all the time bang down

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.729 
controlled crash all the time bang down
the<00:04:08.729> wrong<00:04:08.879> way<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.329> where's<00:04:10.229> the<00:04:10.290> vc10<00:04:10.500> was

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
the wrong way and where's the vc10 was

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.679 
the wrong way and where's the vc10 was
very<00:04:10.919> smooth<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.549> glided<00:04:11.970> off<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.389> it<00:04:12.449> glided

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
very smooth it glided off and it glided

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.199 
very smooth it glided off and it glided
down<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:13.470> was<00:04:13.620> very<00:04:14.459> smooth<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:15.000> think<00:04:15.150> the

I think it has one little drawback and
that<00:06:10.340> is<00:06:10.490> that<00:06:10.669> you<00:06:10.760> have<00:06:10.820> to<00:06:11.120> get<00:06:11.240> an<00:06:11.360> awful

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
that is that you have to get an awful

against it when they realized that the

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.440 
against it when they realized that the
707<00:06:22.430> was<00:06:23.360> actually<00:06:23.720> more<00:06:23.870> economical<00:06:24.530> to<00:06:24.590> fly

707 was actually more economical to fly
the<00:06:26.450> reason<00:06:26.840> it<00:06:26.960> was<00:06:27.080> more<00:06:27.260> economical<00:06:27.380> to<00:06:27.950> fly

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
the reason it was more economical to fly

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.420 
the reason it was more economical to fly
was<00:06:28.580> because<00:06:28.910> the<00:06:29.900> 707<00:06:30.320> had<00:06:30.770> been<00:06:30.979> built<00:06:31.220> for

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
was because the 707 had been built for

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.969

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
Nairobi on the Empire routes so it had a

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.400 
Nairobi on the Empire routes so it had a
bigger<00:06:43.039> wing<00:06:43.340> with<00:06:44.150> high-lift<00:06:44.570> devices<00:06:44.660> and

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:48.889 
the tail mounted engines this made it

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:51.820 
the tail mounted engines this made it
heavier<00:06:49.070> and<00:06:49.690> therefore<00:06:50.690> learned<00:06:51.440> a<00:06:51.530> bit<00:06:51.680> more
