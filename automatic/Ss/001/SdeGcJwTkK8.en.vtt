which<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.450> didn't<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:12.810> expect<00:01:12.930> us<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.439> do

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
which I didn't really expect us to do

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.830 
which I didn't really expect us to do
because<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.670> match<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.030> played<00:01:15.210> previous<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
because the match I played previous to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.050 
because the match I played previous to
this<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.590> map<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.979> was<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.340> think<00:01:17.549> maybe

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
this on this map this was I think maybe

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.550 
this on this map this was I think maybe
an<00:01:18.210> hour<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.600> later<00:01:18.810> after<00:01:19.080> played<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> first

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
an hour so later after played the first

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.230 
an hour so later after played the first
one<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:20.040> actually<00:01:20.310> ended<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.490> losing<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.119> that

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
one we actually ended up losing but that

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.090 
one we actually ended up losing but that
was<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.479> weird<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.960> got<00:01:22.080> four<00:01:22.380> v6<00:01:22.950> or

thing<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.360> them<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> mini-map

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
thing and I can see them on the mini-map

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.999 
thing and I can see them on the mini-map
so<00:01:43.079> I'm<00:01:43.140> trying<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> figure<00:01:43.560> out<00:01:43.619> hey<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.920> there

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
so I'm trying to figure out hey is there

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.050 
so I'm trying to figure out hey is there
a<00:01:44.070> ladder<00:01:44.280> because<00:01:44.460> I'm<00:01:44.700> still<00:01:44.880> learning

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
a ladder because I'm still learning

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.130 
a ladder because I'm still learning
these<00:01:45.299> maps<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.720> still<00:01:45.840> trying<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> figure

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
these maps and still trying to figure

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.330 
these maps and still trying to figure
out<00:01:46.290> where<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.470> these<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.860> cool<00:01:47.159> little

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
out where all these like cool little

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.310 
out where all these like cool little
features<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.360> places<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
features are places you can get to and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.660 
features are places you can get to and
there's<00:01:49.649> no<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> run<00:01:50.040> around<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> entire<00:01:50.430> side

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
there's no I run around the entire side

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.460 
there's no I run around the entire side
ok<00:01:50.909> no<00:01:51.119> letter<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.570> I'm<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.840> throw<00:01:52.439> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
ok no letter so I'm going to throw a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.499 
ok no letter so I'm going to throw a
grenade<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.950> there<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.340> let's<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.479> can

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
grenade up there and let's see if I can

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.120 
grenade up there and let's see if I can
get<00:01:54.720> them<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:57.630> there<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.200> got<00:01:58.710> them<00:01:58.890> so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
get them and there we go got them so

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.859 
get them and there we go got them so
apparently<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.210> can't<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.509> up<00:02:00.600> there<00:02:00.719> unless

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
apparently you can't get up there unless

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.440 
apparently you can't get up there unless
you<00:02:01.049> spawn<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> recon<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.969> spawn<00:02:03.270> beacon

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you spawn in on a recon a spawn beacon

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.120 
you spawn in on a recon a spawn beacon
and<00:02:03.750> then<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.049> parachute<00:02:04.469> down<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.920> there's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and then just parachute down so there's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.620 
and then just parachute down so there's
no<00:02:05.189> ladder<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.549> get<00:02:05.610> up<00:02:05.670> there<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.270> don't<00:02:06.360> try

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
no ladder to get up there so don't try

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.210 
no ladder to get up there so don't try
running<00:02:06.689> around<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.409> maybe<00:02:08.009> there's

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
running around you know maybe there's

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.440 
running around you know maybe there's
some<00:02:08.340> weird<00:02:08.459> things<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.270> there's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
some weird things I don't think there's

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.669 
some weird things I don't think there's
a<00:02:09.479> letter<00:02:09.599> maybe<00:02:09.840> there's<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> center

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
a letter maybe there's one in the center

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.220 
a letter maybe there's one in the center
tower<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.550> did<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.360> miss<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.020> right

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
tower I did I just miss but as of right

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.750 
tower I did I just miss but as of right
now<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.440> don't

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
now I don't

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.830 
now I don't
there<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.239> think<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.480> have<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.629> actually

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
there is I think you have to actually

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.740 
there is I think you have to actually
parachute<00:02:15.349> in<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:17.060> as<00:02:17.150> far<00:02:17.299> as<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.540> map

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
parachute in but as far as this map

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.740 
parachute in but as far as this map
Alborz<00:02:18.200> mountains<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.890> it's<00:02:19.819> actually<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.540> lot

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
Alborz mountains I it's actually a lot

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.960 
Alborz mountains I it's actually a lot
of<00:02:20.870> fun<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.829> even<00:02:22.159> playing<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.459> on<00:02:22.579> defense

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
of fun just even playing it on defense

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.670 
of fun just even playing it on defense
even<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:23.540> know<00:02:23.629> losing<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.110> first<00:02:24.290> time<00:02:24.500> and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
even you know losing the first time and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.929 
even you know losing the first time and
then<00:02:24.739> winning<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.129> second<00:02:25.430> time<00:02:25.549> I<00:02:25.640> played<00:02:25.819> on

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
then winning the second time I played on

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.850 
then winning the second time I played on
this<00:02:26.030> match<00:02:26.209> it's<00:02:26.689> still<00:02:26.959> fun<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.379> think<00:02:27.769> if

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
this match it's still fun I think if

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.229 
this match it's still fun I think if
Taylor's<00:02:28.189> a<00:02:28.220> little<00:02:28.760> bit<00:02:28.879> more<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.090> the

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
Taylor's a little bit more to the

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.880 
Taylor's a little bit more to the
attackers<00:02:29.780> they<00:02:29.959> get<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.290> believe<00:02:30.590> two<00:02:30.769> or

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
attackers they get I believe two or

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.380 
attackers they get I believe two or
three<00:02:31.010> more<00:02:31.159> vehicles<00:02:31.430> least<00:02:32.030> from<00:02:32.120> what<00:02:32.269> I've

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
three more vehicles least from what I've

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.699 
three more vehicles least from what I've
seen<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.690> attackers<00:02:33.110> get<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.470> tank

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
seen the attackers get to tank

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.640 
seen the attackers get to tank
destroyers<00:02:34.159> an<00:02:34.310> ac-130<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.989> Thunderbolt

destroyers an ac-130 and the Thunderbolt

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.530 
destroyers an ac-130 and the Thunderbolt
whereas<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.010> defenders<00:02:37.370> get<00:02:37.519> one<00:02:37.730> t90<00:02:38.299> in<00:02:38.450> the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
whereas the defenders get one t90 in the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.119 
whereas the defenders get one t90 in the
frog<00:02:38.840> foot<00:02:39.079> least<00:02:39.230> that's<00:02:39.409> what<00:02:39.620> i<00:02:39.650> have<00:02:39.890> seen

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
frog foot least that's what i have seen

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.640 
frog foot least that's what i have seen
yeah<00:02:41.000> that's<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.900> lot<00:02:42.079> of<00:02:42.109> vehicles<00:02:42.260> for<00:02:42.590> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
yeah that's a lot of vehicles for the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.289 
yeah that's a lot of vehicles for the
attackers<00:02:43.010> don't<00:02:43.220> feel<00:02:43.519> that<00:02:43.730> like<00:02:43.970> they<00:02:44.120> need

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
attackers don't feel that like they need

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.180 
attackers don't feel that like they need
that<00:02:44.480> many<00:02:44.750> if<00:02:44.959> like<00:02:45.170> if<00:02:45.439> the<00:02:45.680> defenders<00:02:46.069> are

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
that many if like if the defenders are

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.220 
that many if like if the defenders are
really<00:02:46.459> at<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.609> disadvantage<00:02:46.840> but<00:02:47.840> on<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:47.989> map

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
really at a disadvantage but on a map

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.440

these<00:05:30.050> mountains<00:05:30.409> dice<00:05:30.620> did<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:30.860> great<00:05:31.130> job<00:05:31.159> of

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
these mountains dice did a great job of

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.580 
these mountains dice did a great job of
letting<00:05:31.729> players<00:05:32.150> climb<00:05:32.750> up<00:05:32.960> the<00:05:33.199> mountains

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
letting players climb up the mountains

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.680 
letting players climb up the mountains
and<00:05:33.740> because<00:05:34.250> of<00:05:34.280> that<00:05:34.490> as<00:05:34.820> an<00:05:35.030> attacker<00:05:35.389> you

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
and because of that as an attacker you

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.330 
and because of that as an attacker you
can<00:05:35.840> use<00:05:36.139> that<00:05:36.349> to<00:05:36.500> your<00:05:36.590> advantage<00:05:36.650> and<00:05:37.099> even

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
can use that to your advantage and even

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.890 
can use that to your advantage and even
as<00:05:37.430> a<00:05:37.460> defender<00:05:38.030> you<00:05:38.060> can<00:05:38.360> use<00:05:38.539> that<00:05:38.690> to<00:05:38.840> your

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
as a defender you can use that to your

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.110 
as a defender you can use that to your
advantage<00:05:38.960> because<00:05:39.650> having<00:05:40.430> elevation<00:05:41.000> is

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
advantage because having elevation is

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.939 
advantage because having elevation is
huge<00:05:41.630> having<00:05:41.990> something<00:05:42.199> you<00:05:42.409> can<00:05:42.560> stand<00:05:42.800> on

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
huge having something you can stand on

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.890 
huge having something you can stand on
top<00:05:43.130> and<00:05:43.340> shoot<00:05:43.580> down<00:05:43.820> work<00:05:44.120> and<00:05:44.330> you<00:05:44.690> see

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
top and shoot down work and you see

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.600 
top and shoot down work and you see
there's<00:05:45.110> an<00:05:45.229> enemy<00:05:45.530> almay<00:05:45.860> open<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:46.340> you're

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
there's an enemy almay open and you're

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.249 
there's an enemy almay open and you're
up<00:05:46.789> behind<00:05:47.150> cover<00:05:47.449> on<00:05:47.690> top<00:05:47.870> of<00:05:48.020> this<00:05:48.110> mountain

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
up behind cover on top of this mountain

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.930 
up behind cover on top of this mountain
shooting<00:05:48.680> down<00:05:48.830> he's<00:05:49.310> in<00:05:49.490> a<00:05:49.580> horrible

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
shooting down he's in a horrible

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.760 
shooting down he's in a horrible
position<00:05:50.120> and<00:05:50.539> you're<00:05:50.659> in<00:05:50.750> a<00:05:50.840> great<00:05:51.110> spot<00:05:51.469> so

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
use that to your advantage if you're a

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.879 
use that to your advantage if you're a
defender<00:05:53.719> get<00:05:53.960> up<00:05:54.080> here<00:05:54.289> and<00:05:54.320> basically<00:05:54.590> kind

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
defender get up here and basically kind

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.439 
defender get up here and basically kind
of<00:05:54.979> pain<00:05:55.190> these<00:05:55.340> guys<00:05:55.550> down<00:05:55.759> on<00:05:55.969> the<00:05:56.060> roadways

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
of pain these guys down on the roadways

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:57.999 
of pain these guys down on the roadways

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
don't let them climb up the mountains

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.040 
don't let them climb up the mountains
but<00:05:58.130> one<00:05:58.430> thing<00:05:58.610> i<00:05:58.699> will<00:05:58.759> say<00:05:58.909> be<00:05:59.719> careful

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
but one thing i will say be careful

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.629 
but one thing i will say be careful
about<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:00.590> flank<00:06:00.830> routes<00:06:01.039> because<00:06:01.159> these

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
about the flank routes because these

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.370 
about the flank routes because these
flanking<00:06:02.120> i<00:06:02.240> mean<00:06:02.360> there's<00:06:02.570> no<00:06:02.690> like<00:06:02.870> one<00:06:03.139> fine

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
flanking i mean there's no like one fine

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.200 
flanking i mean there's no like one fine
crap<00:06:03.560> i<00:06:03.590> mean<00:06:03.770> there's<00:06:04.190> you<00:06:04.699> can<00:06:04.880> go<00:06:05.000> almost

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
everywhere on here mean go straight

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.140 
everywhere on here mean go straight
ahead<00:06:06.919> in<00:06:07.219> front<00:06:07.430> of<00:06:07.490> me<00:06:07.550> you<00:06:07.880> know<00:06:08.060> i<00:06:08.120> think

so just be careful just be watching be
looking<00:06:14.389> out<00:06:14.479> for<00:06:15.020> you<00:06:15.289> know<00:06:15.380> one<00:06:15.770> or<00:06:15.979> two

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.159 
looking out for you know one or two

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:17.920 
looking out for you know one or two
enemies<00:06:16.490> trying<00:06:16.759> to<00:06:16.880> flank<00:06:17.150> all<00:06:17.419> the<00:06:17.780> way

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
enemies trying to flank all the way

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.649 
enemies trying to flank all the way
around<00:06:18.310> but<00:06:19.310> overall<00:06:19.520> Alborz<00:06:20.210> mountains<00:06:20.270> is<00:06:20.630> a

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:20.659 
around but overall Alborz mountains is a

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:22.959 
around but overall Alborz mountains is a
pretty<00:06:20.960> fun<00:06:21.199> rush<00:06:21.530> map<00:06:21.770> even<00:06:22.400> for<00:06:22.580> attackers

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:22.969 
pretty fun rush map even for attackers

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:24.909 
pretty fun rush map even for attackers
or<00:06:23.300> defenders<00:06:23.719> however<00:06:24.139> i<00:06:24.229> think<00:06:24.590> this<00:06:24.710> map

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
or defenders however i think this map

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.439 
or defenders however i think this map
taylor's<00:06:25.310> a<00:06:25.340> little<00:06:25.759> bit<00:06:25.880> too<00:06:26.030> much<00:06:26.150> too<00:06:26.270> rosy

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
taylor's a little bit too much too rosy

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.209 
taylor's a little bit too much too rosy
attackers<00:06:26.840> i<00:06:27.020> wish<00:06:27.500> they<00:06:27.680> wouldn't<00:06:27.919> give<00:06:28.099> him

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
attackers i wish they wouldn't give him

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.180 
attackers i wish they wouldn't give him
a<00:06:28.400> may<00:06:28.909> be<00:06:29.169> quite<00:06:30.169> so<00:06:30.380> many<00:06:30.530> vehicles<00:06:30.740> i<00:06:30.949> think

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
a may be quite so many vehicles i think

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.740 
a may be quite so many vehicles i think
only<00:06:31.340> one<00:06:31.669> tank<00:06:31.909> destroyer<00:06:32.240> would<00:06:32.479> be<00:06:32.539> better

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
only one tank destroyer would be better

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.659 
only one tank destroyer would be better
instead<00:06:32.990> of<00:06:33.229> two<00:06:33.440> but<00:06:34.039> once<00:06:34.280> again<00:06:34.400> that's

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
instead of two but once again that's

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.070 
instead of two but once again that's
just<00:06:34.880> kind<00:06:35.150> of<00:06:35.180> my<00:06:35.240> personal<00:06:35.719> thoughts<00:06:35.870> on

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
just kind of my personal thoughts on

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.050 
just kind of my personal thoughts on
this<00:06:36.199> so<00:06:36.409> i'm<00:06:36.889> probably<00:06:37.250> a<00:06:37.400> lot<00:06:37.760> of<00:06:37.820> this<00:06:37.909> game

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
this so i'm probably a lot of this game

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.219 
this so i'm probably a lot of this game
but<00:06:38.180> you<00:06:38.270> saw<00:06:38.419> me<00:06:38.539> do<00:06:38.630> i<00:06:38.659> just<00:06:38.719> kind<00:06:38.900> of<00:06:38.930> reno

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
around whatever i'm just learning i'm

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.650 
around whatever i'm just learning i'm
still<00:06:42.760> trying<00:06:42.880> to<00:06:42.940> figure<00:06:43.090> these<00:06:43.300> things<00:06:43.360> out

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
still trying to figure these things out

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.750 
still trying to figure these things out
and<00:06:43.960> this<00:06:44.560> is<00:06:44.710> really<00:06:44.890> the<00:06:45.010> only<00:06:45.280> map<00:06:45.580> that

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 
and this is really the only map that

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.400 
and this is really the only map that
i've<00:06:45.880> actually<00:06:46.150> got<00:06:46.510> any<00:06:46.720> knowledge<00:06:46.990> on<00:06:47.260> as

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
i've actually got any knowledge on as

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.050 
i've actually got any knowledge on as
far<00:06:47.560> as<00:06:47.680> rush<00:06:48.010> a<00:06:48.220> lot<00:06:48.550> you<00:06:48.700> know<00:06:48.790> I<00:06:48.820> played<00:06:48.910> that

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
far as rush a lot you know I played that
