00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
grub screws from the side so we need to

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.169 
grub screws from the side so we need to
just<00:02:03.639> screws<00:02:03.909> up<00:02:04.119> it<00:02:04.780> flexes<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:06.030> clamps<00:02:07.030> onto

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
just screws up it flexes and clamps onto

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.730 
just screws up it flexes and clamps onto
this<00:02:07.329> spacer<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.850> what<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:10.690> do<00:02:10.840> just<00:02:11.319> cut<00:02:11.590> out

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
this spacer so what you do just cut out

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.130 
this spacer so what you do just cut out
it<00:02:11.920> goes<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.880> front<00:02:13.180> where<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.720> legs<00:02:13.930> up

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
it goes to the front where the legs up

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.730 
it goes to the front where the legs up
so<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:15.670> put<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.030> over<00:02:16.120> your<00:02:16.240> right<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:17.590> your

up you can see the white flexi pipe come

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.190 
up you can see the white flexi pipe come
in<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.310> clamp<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.820> up<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.660> just<00:02:47.870> make<00:02:48.020> sure

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
in and clamp it up and just make sure

it's in the middle lutely from each side

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.550 
it's in the middle lutely from each side
a<00:02:53.600> little<00:02:53.720> bit<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:54.320> slide<00:02:59.170> jumped<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.260> up<00:03:00.350> to

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
a little bit that slide jumped it up to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.280 
a little bit that slide jumped it up to
tight<00:03:00.800> plea<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.850> need<00:03:02.060> it's<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.990> lock<00:03:03.110> it

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
tight plea you need it's just to lock it

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.780 
tight plea you need it's just to lock it
up<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:03.710> it<00:03:04.570> doesn't<00:03:05.570> move<00:03:05.660> her<00:03:05.780> anymore<00:03:06.170> I

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
up so it doesn't move her anymore I

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.060 
up so it doesn't move her anymore I
usually<00:03:07.790> leave<00:03:07.910> mine<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:08.600> just<00:03:08.750> up<00:03:09.110> so<00:03:10.040> I

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
usually leave mine so it's just up so I

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.960 
usually leave mine so it's just up so I
can<00:03:10.250> just<00:03:10.490> move<00:03:10.670> around<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.120> little<00:03:11.180> bit<00:03:12.970> that's

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
can just move around a little bit that's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.870 
can just move around a little bit that's
that's<00:03:14.510> seem<00:03:14.720> tight<00:03:14.930> now<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:16.640> can<00:03:16.730> just

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
that's seem tight now so you can just

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.250 
that's seem tight now so you can just
move<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.240> still<00:03:20.170> okay<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:22.900> it's<00:03:23.900> basically

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
buddy now it's got a cutout where the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.890 
buddy now it's got a cutout where the
previous<00:03:43.610> version<00:03:44.120> would<00:03:44.209> have<00:03:44.270> just<00:03:44.570> a<00:03:44.660> swap

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
previous version would have just a swap

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.250 
previous version would have just a swap
with<00:03:45.080> a<00:03:45.110> little<00:03:45.410> liquid<00:03:45.709> sitting<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:47.330> with

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
with a little liquid sitting and with

with a little liquid sitting and with
the<00:03:48.350> new<00:03:48.470> version<00:03:48.709> that<00:03:48.920> legs<00:03:49.100> more<00:03:49.340> secure

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
the new version that legs more secure

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.930 
the new version that legs more secure
than<00:03:50.209> what<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:50.420> used<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.630> be<00:03:51.640> so<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:52.730> can't

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
than what it used to be so you can't

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.070 
than what it used to be so you can't
actually<00:03:53.090> accidentally<00:03:53.690> knock<00:03:53.870> them<00:03:53.989> off

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
actually accidentally knock them off

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.740 
actually accidentally knock them off
from<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.320> back<00:03:54.470> anymore<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.940> odd<00:03:56.060> one<00:03:56.300> with<00:03:56.720> a

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
from the back anymore the odd one with a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.900 
from the back anymore the odd one with a
slope<00:03:57.080> it<00:03:57.920> was<00:03:58.040> fine<00:03:58.280> while<00:03:58.519> you<00:03:58.580> put<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:58.820> on

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
slope it was fine while you put it on

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.630 
slope it was fine while you put it on
the<00:03:59.030> rocks<00:03:59.239> but<00:04:00.110> you<00:04:00.200> could<00:04:00.350> also<00:04:00.890> knock<00:04:01.519> the

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
the rocks but you could also knock the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.250 
the rocks but you could also knock the
legs<00:04:01.790> off<00:04:02.030> with<00:04:02.180> this<00:04:02.300> new<00:04:02.450> version<00:04:02.690> that

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
legs off with this new version that

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.970 
legs off with this new version that
doesn't<00:04:03.410> happen<00:04:03.590> anymore

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.229 

so<00:04:06.980> you're<00:04:07.130> basically<00:04:07.340> sits<00:04:07.850> on<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.060> rocks

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
so you're basically sits on the rocks

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.120 
so you're basically sits on the rocks
like<00:04:08.480> this<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:11.350> put<00:04:12.350> a<00:04:12.380> fair<00:04:12.590> bit<00:04:12.680> of<00:04:12.769> drag<00:04:12.980> on

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
like this and put a fair bit of drag on

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.630 
like this and put a fair bit of drag on
if<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.340> want<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:13.760> doesn't<00:04:14.660> move<00:04:14.870> sideways

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.159 

there's<00:04:19.640> no<00:04:19.790> there's<00:04:20.419> no<00:04:20.510> edges<00:04:20.930> anywhere

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
there's no there's no edges anywhere

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.840 
there's no there's no edges anywhere
where<00:04:21.530> your<00:04:21.680> line<00:04:21.799> can<00:04:22.070> actually<00:04:22.340> get<00:04:22.460> tangled

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
where your line can actually get tangled

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.490 
where your line can actually get tangled
which<00:04:22.970> which<00:04:23.419> is<00:04:23.570> an<00:04:23.690> issue<00:04:23.810> with<00:04:24.080> some<00:04:24.260> of<00:04:24.290> the
