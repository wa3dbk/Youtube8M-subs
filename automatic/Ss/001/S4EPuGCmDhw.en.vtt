we've been collaborating for nearly 10
years<00:00:29.759> now<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.240> met<00:00:30.509> at<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> Royal<00:00:30.869> College<00:00:30.960> of

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
years now we met at the Royal College of

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.860 
years now we met at the Royal College of
Art<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.919> really<00:00:32.879> the<00:00:33.000> premise<00:00:33.360> behind<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
Art and really the premise behind the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.299 
Art and really the premise behind the
bulk<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.379> projects<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.160> is

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
bulk of the projects that we do is

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.790 
bulk of the projects that we do is
questioning<00:00:35.760> technology<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.110> use<00:00:37.290> design

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
questioning technology so we use design

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.369 
questioning technology so we use design
as<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> medium<00:00:38.400> to<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.699> that<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.720> device

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
as a medium to do that this is a device

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.110 
as a medium to do that this is a device
that<00:00:41.930> we're<00:00:42.930> all<00:00:43.019> familiar<00:00:43.199> with<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:44.220> lot<00:00:45.089> of

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that we're all familiar with it a lot of

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.450 
that we're all familiar with it a lot of
us<00:00:45.239> end<00:00:45.449> up<00:00:45.540> in<00:00:45.720> one<00:00:45.839> but<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.830> this<00:00:46.980> does<00:00:47.280> is

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
us end up in one but what this does is

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.930 
us end up in one but what this does is
it<00:00:47.610> harnesses<00:00:48.180> our<00:00:48.949> chemical<00:00:49.949> potential<00:00:50.519> once

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it harnesses our chemical potential once

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.420 
it harnesses our chemical potential once
we<00:00:51.120> die<00:00:51.409> when<00:00:52.409> we<00:00:52.530> die<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.979> are<00:00:53.010> chemically

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
we die when we die we are chemically

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.549 
we die when we die we are chemically
disorganized<00:00:54.119> but<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.869> we<00:00:55.019> do<00:00:55.229> is<00:00:55.409> we

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
disorganized but what we do is we

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.570 
disorganized but what we do is we
harness<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.540> chemical<00:00:57.540> potential<00:00:58.080> of

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
harness the chemical potential of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.660 
harness the chemical potential of
somebody<00:00:59.580> who's<00:00:59.699> died<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:01.519> turn<00:01:02.519> them

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
somebody who's died and we turn them

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.670 
somebody who's died and we turn them
into<00:01:02.790> a<00:01:02.879> battery<00:01:03.299> during<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> process<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
into a battery during the process of

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.740 
into a battery during the process of
decomposition<00:01:06.680> acids<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.799> produced<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
decomposition acids are produced and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.450 
decomposition acids are produced and
underneath<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> microbial<00:01:10.830> fuel<00:01:11.100> cell

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
underneath here is a microbial fuel cell

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.990 
underneath here is a microbial fuel cell
but<00:01:12.150> through<00:01:12.570> an<00:01:12.659> electrochemical<00:01:14.000> reaction

but through an electrochemical reaction

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.450 
but through an electrochemical reaction
creates<00:01:15.330> electricity<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.100> it's

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
creates electricity so it's it's it's

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.219 
creates electricity so it's it's it's

acid<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.189> decomposes<00:01:20.659> with<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.990> have

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
acid as it decomposes with this you have

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.500 
acid as it decomposes with this you have
a<00:01:22.140> something<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> function<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.210> Jimmy

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
a something as a function it's as Jimmy

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.180 
a something as a function it's as Jimmy
said<00:01:24.690> it's<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.050> it's<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.470> form<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.800> life<00:01:26.040> after

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
said it's it's it's a form of life after

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.450 
said it's it's it's a form of life after
death<00:01:26.370> and<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.660> as<00:01:28.470> we're<00:01:28.800> contained<00:01:29.220> within

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
death and so as we're contained within

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.590 
death and so as we're contained within
this<00:01:29.610> battery<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.420> with<00:01:30.570> that

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
this battery what we do with that

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.670 
this battery what we do with that
battery<00:01:31.020> becomes<00:01:31.410> extremely<00:01:31.860> poignant<00:01:33.680> to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
battery becomes extremely poignant to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.260 
battery becomes extremely poignant to
make<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.159> point<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:36.000> communicate

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
make that point to really communicate

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.230 
make that point to really communicate
that<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:36.840> we've<00:01:36.960> done<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.260> invited<00:01:37.830> 13<00:01:38.670> or<00:01:38.820> 14

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that what we've done is invited 13 or 14

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.300 
that what we've done is invited 13 or 14
people<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:40.200> propose<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.830> they<00:01:40.980> would<00:01:41.130> like

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
people to propose what they would like

people to propose what they would like
to<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.580> with<00:01:41.730> the<00:01:41.790> battery<00:01:42.150> some<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.140> some

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
to do with the battery some of the some

to do with the battery some of the some
of<00:01:43.620> the<00:01:43.740> help<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.010> ideas<00:01:44.340> are<00:01:44.520> kind<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.360> fairly

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
of the help the ideas are kind of fairly

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.320 
of the help the ideas are kind of fairly
obvious<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.980> vibrator<00:01:47.760> there<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.120> lot<00:01:48.300> of

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
obvious the vibrator there a lot of

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.840 
obvious the vibrator there a lot of
people<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.810> said<00:01:48.990> they'd<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.350> continue

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
people have said they'd like to continue

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.280 
people have said they'd like to continue
somehow<00:01:50.850> loving<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.330> pleasing<00:01:51.750> their<00:01:51.900> partner

somehow loving or pleasing their partner

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
somehow loving or pleasing their partner
after<00:01:52.409> they<00:01:52.680> go<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.580> some<00:01:53.760> other<00:01:53.909> ones<00:01:54.060> are

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
after they go but some other ones are

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.780 
after they go but some other ones are
extremely<00:01:54.780> subtle<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:56.400> Cocula

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
extremely subtle so this is on Cocula
