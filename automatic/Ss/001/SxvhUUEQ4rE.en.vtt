00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.400
 they are all positive memories and maybe 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.470
 of the best memories I've had 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.690
 in my career and in my life, earn by 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.790
 first time the world cup for our country 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.000
 It was fantastic and something we will not forget 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.000
 never 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.060
 good one when it comes always tries to 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.600
 play as many minutes 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.700
 can and in that I'm trying to train 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.160
 to my best level and to take advantage of 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.080
 opportunities to have a role 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.610
 most important in this in this selection 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.090
 which is quite difficult because there 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.090
 many players 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.720
 it's been five months very good for me 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.180
 since I arrived in Manchester the player 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.300
 I enjoyed regularly I can 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.470
 make goals and give assists and good is 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.540
 what I have to try to do as 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.830
 offensive player I am and what 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.400
 I always try to do also here in 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.400
 the selection 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.920
 Well, I think because of the characteristics 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.720
 of the players that we have 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.340
 we like to play with the ball and 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.009
 have the possession of the ball to create 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.450
 occasions and I think that knowing each other 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.580
 also in carrying so many years playing 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.979
 together most of us do that 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.659
 we are a team that plays as 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.869
 practically with an almost 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.869
 memory 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.649
 Well, you have to think about Brazil when 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.509
 we think of the best team in history 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.180
 which is the one that more world has but 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.950
 yes it is true that nobody has done that 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.509
 sequence of victories with world and 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.789
 eurocopas and we could continue doing 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.890
 story you have to enjoy the moment 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.539
 I hope we can say that one day 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.539
 we are the best in history 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.510
 of course brazil that is the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.729
 organizer and good for the capacity that 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.830
 it has a staff I think they can win 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.270
 and then the elections that are always 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.790
 competing in argentina italy france 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.280
 germany holland i think england 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.140
 I can also try 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.760
 Uruguay will be complicated good 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.760
 many selections with level 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.840
 good the players present always 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.560
 they are very talented players 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.060
 maybe the greatest number of players in 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.769
 first level that has come out in football 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.080
 have come from Brazil are a country that 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.720
 historically they have led football in 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.430
 the blood and they are in that selection 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.209
 of them like many others who have 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.519
 that Brazilian talent and that makes them be 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.299
 different and that's why they are the country that 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.299
 world has won 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.040
 it's complicated to choose because every 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.020
 season they overcome each other and they 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.620
 they demand maybe the last season 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.780
 Christian has been at a better level and 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.630
 has been more regular but in the past 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.000
 Messi years has also been a level of 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.310
 another planet I do not believe that they two and their 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.310
 competitiveness make football good 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.060
 I would like that some Spanish I 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.080
 would like for example that andrÃ© iniesta 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.450
 keep screaming at the world with football 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.100
 what's inside and hopefully we can 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.090
 win and one of ours is also 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.090
 the best of the tournament 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.190
 yes I think they have a very good 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.330
 generation of players of 20 22 23 years 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.879
 that maybe they have not played any world 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.370
 but that in the premier already has many 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.830
 parties and have level experience and 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.570
 I believe that 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.120
 that's not a coach that gives confidence 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.840
 to young people and that surely that 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.840
 makes it perform better 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.480
 well that happened with Spain too and 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.000
 we get to change the story and I think 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.489
 that they can do it they have great 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.750
 players and for example my partner 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.120
 wayne rooney I think he's a player 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.509
 world class that can take them to the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.509
 triumph 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.780
 well I do not know him personally 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.580
 obviously 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.260
 I know when I was little and I was 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.450
 in barcelona then it was the bayern of 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.090
 Munich and has always won titles is a 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.300
 coach who has always been a winner and 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.710
 seems very demanding and hopefully in this 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.690
 new stage in which the club is and in 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.090
 the one that we are all the players we 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.510
 bring triumphs and successes for the 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.510
 manchester united 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:56.969
 Well, I've been collaborating with them 

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:59.489
 you already several years and I feel very 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:02.489
 proud to be able to contribute my granite 

00:04:59.489 --> 00:05:04.739
 arena in every act and in every event what 

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:06.989
 you do especially helping children who 

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:09.839
 I think it 's the most important thing in the 

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:12.239
 future of this world and try to 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.589
 help those who can not 

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:16.679
 relate to others that no 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:20.299
 they have sufficient means to live 

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:20.299
 Normally, it fills me with pride 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.990
 I stayed with the effort of the 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.650
 people who work in the center 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.630
 We visited Luis Figo and today with the 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.150
 people who dedicate their lives to others and 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.100
 will help in this case autistic children who 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.460
 they can not relate to normal 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.800
 with the other children and those people who 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.110
 try to improve your relationships and that 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 try to help them left me shocked and 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.700
 It makes me feel happy and proud of 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.700
 them and what they do
