faster reaction time and the way we get

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.790 
faster reaction time and the way we get
that<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.420> by<00:02:28.660> keeping<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.050> body<00:02:29.170> stable<00:02:29.650> and

moving the feet underneath we can

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.320 
moving the feet underneath we can
practice<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.680> statically<00:02:33.489> or<00:02:33.760> standing<00:02:34.239> on

with<00:03:39.830> my<00:03:40.040> shin<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.550> front<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.030> booty

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
with my shin to the front of the booty

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.240 
with my shin to the front of the booty
that's<00:03:41.810> gonna<00:03:42.020> let<00:03:42.290> me<00:03:42.410> know<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.010> have

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
that's gonna let me know that I have

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.949 
that's gonna let me know that I have
access<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.000> ability<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.300> turn<00:03:44.540> my<00:03:44.750> legs

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
access to the ability to turn my legs

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.770 
access to the ability to turn my legs
and<00:03:45.170> tip<00:03:45.350> my<00:03:45.500> feet<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.070> much<00:03:46.190> as<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.430> need<00:03:46.640> to

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
and tip my feet so much as I need to

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.300 
and tip my feet so much as I need to
this<00:03:47.780> simulates<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.770> feeling<00:03:49.100> what<00:03:49.220> the

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
this simulates the feeling what the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.070 
this simulates the feeling what the
bumps<00:03:49.520> are<00:03:49.730> gonna<00:03:49.850> do<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.270> me<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.900> thing

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
bumps are gonna do to me and the thing

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.420 
bumps are gonna do to me and the thing
is<00:03:51.170> that<00:03:51.200> I'm<00:03:51.380> going<00:03:51.560> need<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:51.890> do<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.100> recover

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
is that I'm going need to do to recover

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.650 
is that I'm going need to do to recover
as<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:52.700> get<00:03:52.880> them<00:03:54.910> now<00:03:55.910> let's<00:03:56.120> take<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:56.450> into

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
as I get them now let's take this into

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.540 
as I get them now let's take this into
the<00:03:56.720> bumps<00:03:57.050> just<00:03:57.709> like<00:03:57.860> we<00:03:57.980> did<00:03:58.130> on<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.250> grim

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
the bumps just like we did on the grim

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.920 
the bumps just like we did on the grim
terrain<00:03:58.820> we're<00:03:59.000> going<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.270> traverse<00:03:59.450> some

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
terrain we're going to traverse some

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.350 
terrain we're going to traverse some
bumps<00:04:00.230> but<00:04:00.680> I'm<00:04:00.800> not<00:04:00.980> gonna<00:04:01.190> need<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.940> push<00:04:02.150> my

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
bumps but I'm not gonna need to push my

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.270 
bumps but I'm not gonna need to push my
feet<00:04:02.540> back<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:02.810> forth<00:04:03.020> because<00:04:03.440> as<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.920> hit<00:04:04.130> the

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
feet back and forth because as I hit the

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.949 
feet back and forth because as I hit the
bump<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.880> bumps<00:04:05.180> gonna<00:04:05.360> put<00:04:05.540> skis<00:04:05.780> are<00:04:05.870> gonna

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
bump the bumps gonna put skis are gonna

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.660 
bump the bumps gonna put skis are gonna
go<00:04:06.110> uphill<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.770> my<00:04:06.950> feet<00:04:07.190> are<00:04:07.280> gonna<00:04:07.370> slow

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
go uphill and my feet are gonna slow

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.020 
go uphill and my feet are gonna slow
down<00:04:07.880> as<00:04:08.180> they<00:04:08.930> go<00:04:09.050> back<00:04:09.230> down<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.860> bump<00:04:10.070> if<00:04:10.610> my

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
down as they go back down the bump if my

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.490 
down as they go back down the bump if my
feet<00:04:11.270> are<00:04:11.300> going<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.660> speed<00:04:11.900> up<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.200> that's

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
feet are going to speed up and that's

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.410 
feet are going to speed up and that's
gonna<00:04:12.650> simulate<00:04:13.010> feet<00:04:13.730> moving<00:04:14.090> back<00:04:14.239> and

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
gonna simulate feet moving back and

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.539 
gonna simulate feet moving back and
forth<00:04:14.630> underneath<00:04:14.900> what<00:04:15.890> I'm<00:04:16.010> going<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:16.370> try

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
forth underneath what I'm going to try

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.310 
forth underneath what I'm going to try
to<00:04:16.609> do<00:04:16.790> is<00:04:16.940> limit<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.419> amount<00:04:17.810> they<00:04:17.989> slow<00:04:18.290> down

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
to do is limit the amount they slow down

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.400 
to do is limit the amount they slow down
by<00:04:18.830> pushing

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
by pushing

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.199 
by pushing
bored<00:04:19.950> over<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.220> bump<00:04:20.400> I'm<00:04:20.820> gonna<00:04:20.970> try<00:04:21.150> to

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
bored over the bump I'm gonna try to

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.490 
bored over the bump I'm gonna try to
limit<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.630> amount<00:04:21.900> feet

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
limit the amount feet

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.350 
limit the amount feet
speed<00:04:22.980> up<00:04:23.190> by<00:04:23.370> pulling<00:04:23.610> them<00:04:23.850> back<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.120> little

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
speed up by pulling them back a little

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.890 
speed up by pulling them back a little
bit<00:04:24.480> as<00:04:24.660> they<00:04:24.780> go<00:04:24.900> over<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.230> bump

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
bit as they go over the bump

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.300 
bit as they go over the bump
now<00:04:27.900> let's<00:04:28.110> put<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.380> into<00:04:28.560> some<00:04:28.710> basic<00:04:28.830> turns

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
now let's put that into some basic turns

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.860 
now let's put that into some basic turns
we're<00:04:29.760> not<00:04:29.910> gonna<00:04:30.000> worry<00:04:30.180> too<00:04:30.420> much<00:04:30.450> about<00:04:30.720> the

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
we're not gonna worry too much about the

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.570 
we're not gonna worry too much about the
line<00:04:31.080> or<00:04:31.380> where<00:04:31.650> we<00:04:31.770> turn<00:04:31.980> but<00:04:32.370> we're<00:04:32.490> gonna

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
line or where we turn but we're gonna

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.930 
line or where we turn but we're gonna
try<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.880> keep<00:04:33.120> centered<00:04:33.660> on<00:04:33.840> our<00:04:34.020> feet<00:04:34.290> by

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
try to keep centered on our feet by

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.550 
try to keep centered on our feet by
adapting<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.120> terrain<00:04:36.420> through<00:04:37.350> some

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
adapting to the terrain through some

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.830 
adapting to the terrain through some
medium-sized<00:04:38.220> turns<00:04:38.580> as<00:04:38.850> we<00:04:39.360> feel<00:04:39.510> our<00:04:39.660> feet

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
medium-sized turns as we feel our feet

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.270 
medium-sized turns as we feel our feet
go<00:04:39.990> up<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.260> bumps<00:04:40.500> we're<00:04:40.650> gonna<00:04:40.740> let<00:04:40.980> our<00:04:41.010> feet

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
go up the bumps we're gonna let our feet

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.490 
go up the bumps we're gonna let our feet
rock<00:04:41.520> forward<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:42.000> little<00:04:42.120> bit<00:04:42.330> as<00:04:42.480> we<00:04:43.140> come

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
rock forward a little bit as we come

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.020 
rock forward a little bit as we come
over<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:43.980> bumps<00:04:44.220> we're<00:04:44.370> gonna<00:04:44.460> pull<00:04:44.730> our<00:04:44.850> feet

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
over the bumps we're gonna pull our feet

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.150 
over the bumps we're gonna pull our feet
back<00:04:45.210> trying<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.810> eat<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:45.990> consistent<00:04:46.650> size

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
back trying to eat the consistent size

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.450 
back trying to eat the consistent size
of<00:04:47.430> trim<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.820> entire<00:04:48.150> time

of trim the entire time

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.860 
of trim the entire time
now<00:04:50.460> that<00:04:50.640> we<00:04:50.700> have<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:50.850> stronger<00:04:51.210> ability<00:04:51.510> to

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
now that we have a stronger ability to

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.660 
now that we have a stronger ability to
stay<00:04:52.110> centered<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.680> manage<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.370> for<00:04:53.640> a

reasonably skiddy and taking that
undulating<00:05:08.790> motion<00:05:09.120> of<00:05:09.420> toe<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:09.990> heel<00:05:10.230> and

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
undulating motion of toe to heel and

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.490 
undulating motion of toe to heel and
heel<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.770> toe<00:05:10.950> just<00:05:11.550> in<00:05:11.730> one<00:05:12.060> turn<00:05:12.360> each<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:13.380> as

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
heel to toe just in one turn each so as

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.930 
heel to toe just in one turn each so as
I<00:05:13.590> hit<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.800> bump<00:05:14.100> and<00:05:14.250> my<00:05:14.370> feet<00:05:14.550> get<00:05:14.730> pushed

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
I hit the bump and my feet get pushed

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.820 
I hit the bump and my feet get pushed
forward<00:05:15.270> I'm<00:05:15.480> gonna<00:05:15.630> start<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.260> turn<00:05:16.500> and

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
forward I'm gonna start the turn and

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.040 
forward I'm gonna start the turn and
then<00:05:17.190> as<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.490> accelerate<00:05:18.390> down<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.600> bump<00:05:18.870> I'm

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
then as a accelerate down the bump I'm

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.900 
then as a accelerate down the bump I'm
gonna<00:05:19.170> pull<00:05:19.410> them<00:05:19.530> back<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.740> little<00:05:19.860> bit<00:05:20.130> repeat

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
gonna pull them back a little bit repeat

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:30.470 
gonna pull them back a little bit repeat
that<00:05:28.130> so<00:05:29.130> guys<00:05:29.310> in<00:05:29.520> summary<00:05:29.880> what<00:05:30.120> we've<00:05:30.270> done

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
that so guys in summary what we've done

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.050 
that so guys in summary what we've done
today<00:05:30.690> is<00:05:31.100> develop<00:05:32.100> stronger<00:05:32.640> for<00:05:32.910> apt

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
today is develop stronger for apt

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.090 
today is develop stronger for apt
ability<00:05:33.510> to<00:05:33.870> get<00:05:33.990> us<00:05:34.110> off<00:05:34.290> to<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.650> grim<00:05:34.830> snow

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
ability to get us off to the grim snow

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.180 
ability to get us off to the grim snow
and<00:05:35.370> into<00:05:35.610> some<00:05:35.820> basic<00:05:35.970> bumps<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:37.190> conquering

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
and into some basic bumps and conquering

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.250 
and into some basic bumps and conquering
the<00:05:38.340> challenges<00:05:38.850> that<00:05:39.060> bumps<00:05:39.390> give<00:05:39.600> us<00:05:39.750> within

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
the challenges that bumps give us within

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.810 
the challenges that bumps give us within
that<00:05:40.470> realm<00:05:40.710> of<00:05:40.890> fore/aft<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.640> getting

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
that realm of fore/aft and getting

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.420 
that realm of fore/aft and getting
thrown<00:05:42.090> around<00:05:42.120> we<00:05:43.110> strengthen<00:05:43.590> the<00:05:43.680> core<00:05:43.890> we

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
thrown around we strengthen the core we

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.340 
thrown around we strengthen the core we
lowered<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:44.910> stance<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:45.419> learn<00:05:45.870> to<00:05:46.080> move<00:05:46.200> our

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
lowered the stance and learn to move our

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.830 
lowered the stance and learn to move our
feet<00:05:46.650> under<00:05:47.310> our<00:05:47.340> center<00:05:47.700> of<00:05:47.760> mass<00:05:47.880> versus<00:05:48.690> our

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
feet under our center of mass versus our

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.830 
feet under our center of mass versus our
center<00:05:49.080> of<00:05:49.110> mass<00:05:49.230> over<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:50.070> top<00:05:50.250> of<00:05:50.280> our<00:05:50.550> feet

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
center of mass over the top of our feet

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.240 
center of mass over the top of our feet
so<00:05:51.840> that<00:05:51.900> we<00:05:52.050> can<00:05:52.200> manage<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:52.590> terrain<00:05:52.710> you

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
so that we can manage the terrain you

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.740 
so that we can manage the terrain you
took<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:53.610> skiing<00:05:53.880> and<00:05:54.060> some<00:05:54.210> shorter<00:05:54.510> turns

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
took that skiing and some shorter turns

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.320 
took that skiing and some shorter turns
and<00:05:54.960> bumps<00:05:55.250> going<00:05:56.250> forward<00:05:56.580> keep<00:05:56.790> practicing

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
and bumps going forward keep practicing

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.420 
and bumps going forward keep practicing
that<00:05:57.360> move<00:05:57.720> it<00:05:58.350> to<00:05:58.440> some<00:05:58.560> steeper<00:05:58.919> terrain<00:05:59.070> and

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
that move it to some steeper terrain and

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.730 
that move it to some steeper terrain and
keeping<00:05:59.790> it<00:05:59.910> skitty<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.419> round<00:06:00.630> turns<00:06:00.930> as<00:06:01.200> you

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
keeping it skitty and round turns as you

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.860 
keeping it skitty and round turns as you
get<00:06:01.890> more<00:06:02.130> advanced<00:06:02.669> go<00:06:03.060> a<00:06:03.090> little<00:06:03.300> faster<00:06:03.780> and

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
get more advanced go a little faster and

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.630 
get more advanced go a little faster and
start<00:06:04.080> increasing<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.620> range<00:06:04.890> of<00:06:05.040> motion<00:06:05.100> so

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
start increasing the range of motion so

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.090 
start increasing the range of motion so
that<00:06:05.820> you<00:06:05.880> can<00:06:06.060> stay<00:06:06.600> centered<00:06:07.100> absorbing

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
that you can stay centered absorbing

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.410 
that you can stay centered absorbing
