00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.690
 pokémon platinum and everything started well with 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.180
 the week teacher intro chose a 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.059
 lung and went out checks his objects and 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.039
 he had only one call daily when using it 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.560

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.689
 more mysterious in this pokemon 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.909
 his name was in Japanese being that 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.950
 the game was in Spanish and when fighting 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.909
 against him he realized that his only 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.189

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.090

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.719
 it came out that he had been captured 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.340
 he immediately went to see the pokemon but 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.109
 everything was in Japanese so 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.780
 He stopped to find out about the 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:42.090
 followed with the strange ones because vice but 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.099

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.890

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.020

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:11.069
 village without the appearance of any other 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.129

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.380

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.780
