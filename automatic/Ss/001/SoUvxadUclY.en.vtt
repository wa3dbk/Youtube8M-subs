I've made with madden 15 to me this
speaks<00:00:25.039> volumes<00:00:26.039> about<00:00:26.400> how<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.570> game

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
speaks volumes about how this game

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.900 
speaks volumes about how this game
allows<00:00:28.260> animations<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.130> dictate<00:00:29.580> everything

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
allows animations to dictate everything

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.690 
allows animations to dictate everything
and<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.779> difficult<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.679> play<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> game<00:00:32.099> after

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
and it's difficult to play a game after

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.250 
and it's difficult to play a game after
seeing<00:00:33.000> something<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.690> occur<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
seeing something like this occur and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.380 
seeing something like this occur and
knowing<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> animation<00:00:35.760> sequence<00:00:36.210> is

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
knowing that the animation sequence is

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.729 
knowing that the animation sequence is
all<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.690> matters<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> rare

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
all that matters and this is a rare

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.260 
all that matters and this is a rare
situation<00:00:38.430> i<00:00:38.460> want<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> point<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.940> out<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
situation i want to point that out it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.910 
situation i want to point that out it
doesn't<00:00:39.450> happen<00:00:39.690> all<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:39.960> often<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.829> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
doesn't happen all that often but you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.380 
doesn't happen all that often but you
know<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.280> shouldn't<00:00:41.610> happen<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
know what it shouldn't happen on a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.020 
know what it shouldn't happen on a
next-gen<00:00:42.870> console<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.620> what<00:00:44.190> starts<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.820> is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
next-gen console and what starts this is

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
next-gen console and what starts this is
mosley<00:00:45.809> comes<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.320> he's<00:00:46.739> getting

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
mosley comes in he's getting

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.650 
mosley comes in he's getting
double-teamed<00:00:47.489> blocked<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> full

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
double-teamed blocked you see the full

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.810 
double-teamed blocked you see the full
back<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> background<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.100> mostly

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
back there in the background and mostly

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.430 
back there in the background and mostly
gets<00:00:51.059> pushed<00:00:51.360> down<00:00:51.449> into<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> ground<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
gets pushed down into the ground and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
gets pushed down into the ground and
then<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.370> actually<00:00:53.670> an<00:00:53.730> online<00:00:54.030> game

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
then this is actually an online game

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.970 
then this is actually an online game
with<00:00:54.360> BB<00:00:54.629> resurrect<00:00:55.199> he<00:00:55.320> takes<00:00:55.559> control<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
with BB resurrect he takes control of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.860 
with BB resurrect he takes control of
jones<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.699> starts<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.120> come<00:00:57.329> into<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> pile

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
jones and starts to come into the pile

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.479 
jones and starts to come into the pile
to<00:00:58.140> pressure<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> quarterback<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:59.219> as<00:00:59.340> you

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to pressure the quarterback as as you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.610 
to pressure the quarterback as as you
see<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.760> back<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.270> my<00:01:00.390> end<00:01:00.570> zone<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.989> then

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
see them back in my end zone and then

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.219 
see them back in my end zone and then
this<00:01:01.890> sets<00:01:02.550> up<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:03.090> series<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.480> animations

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
this sets up a series of animations

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.000 
this sets up a series of animations
where<00:01:04.470> number<00:01:04.830> 99<00:01:05.369> gets<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.590> then<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
where number 99 gets up and then the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.370 
where number 99 gets up and then the
full-back<00:01:08.549> pushes<00:01:09.210> right<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:09.869> pushes

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
full-back pushes right there pushes

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.310 
full-back pushes right there pushes
number<00:01:10.710> 63<00:01:11.490> forward<00:01:11.970> garza<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.170> see

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
number 63 forward garza so you can see

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200 
number 63 forward garza so you can see
Garza<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:14.220> forward<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.850> point<00:01:15.119> in

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
Garza is going forward at this point in

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.620 
Garza is going forward at this point in
the<00:01:15.299> game<00:01:15.330> apparently<00:01:15.900> doesn't<00:01:16.170> expect<00:01:16.740> this

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
the game apparently doesn't expect this

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.120 
the game apparently doesn't expect this
slauson<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:19.159> gets<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:21.000> double-team<00:01:21.600> block

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
slauson then gets in a double-team block

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.120 
slauson then gets in a double-team block
with<00:01:23.130> Mosley<00:01:23.400> where<00:01:24.150> his<00:01:24.479> arm<00:01:24.930> there<00:01:25.619> his<00:01:25.890> hand

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
with Mosley where his arm there his hand

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.740 
with Mosley where his arm there his hand
is<00:01:26.250> supposed<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.880> his<00:01:27.119> shoulder<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
is supposed to be up on his shoulder and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.740 
is supposed to be up on his shoulder and
it<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.829> now<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.610> game<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.909> registering

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
it is but now the game is registering

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.319 
it is but now the game is registering
that<00:01:31.470> Mosley<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.130> being<00:01:32.430> blocked<00:01:32.729> by<00:01:32.970> Garza

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that Mosley is being blocked by Garza

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.719 
that Mosley is being blocked by Garza
but<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.960> fact<00:01:34.200> he's<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.770> they're<00:01:35.189> not<00:01:35.400> even

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
but in fact he's not they're not even

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.300 
but in fact he's not they're not even
touching<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.420> instead<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:37.590> stand<00:01:38.040> there

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
touching and instead they stand there

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.640 
touching and instead they stand there
and<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:39.090> through<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.600> blocking<00:01:40.079> animations

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and go through the blocking animations

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.069 
and go through the blocking animations
and<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.430> know<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.729> looks<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.840> short

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and I know this looks like it's a short

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.960 
and I know this looks like it's a short
period<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.380> time<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.860> not<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.670> go

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
period of time but it's not they go

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.819 
period of time but it's not they go
through<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> blocking<00:01:45.869> animations<00:01:46.409> as<00:01:46.560> if

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
through the blocking animations as if

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.740 
through the blocking animations as if
they<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.070> touching<00:01:47.490> even<00:01:48.479> though<00:01:48.570> they're

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
they are touching even though they're

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.880 
they are touching even though they're
not<00:01:48.780> right<00:01:49.140> now<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.590> nothing

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
not right now there is nothing
