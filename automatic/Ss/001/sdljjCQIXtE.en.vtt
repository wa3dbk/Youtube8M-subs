00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
to do a whole bunch it takes pretty much

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.529 
to do a whole bunch it takes pretty much
all<00:00:52.620> right<00:00:55.850> one<00:00:56.850> second<00:00:58.280> all<00:00:59.280> right<00:00:59.670> let's<00:01:00.270> get

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
see i have screw every so often every to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.420 
see i have screw every so often every to
whatever<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.570> know<00:01:12.720> they're<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.430> holding

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
whatever you know they're just holding

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.240 
whatever you know they're just holding
the<00:01:14.729> fan<00:01:14.909> into<00:01:15.210> place<00:01:15.479> there's<00:01:16.380> no<00:01:16.530> vibration

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the fan into place there's no vibration

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.940 
the fan into place there's no vibration
from<00:01:17.520> them<00:01:17.729> at<00:01:17.909> all<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:19.110> i<00:01:19.140> don't<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> need

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
from them at all so i don't see the need

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.270 
from them at all so i don't see the need
to<00:01:20.250> put<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> whole<00:01:20.729> bunch<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:21.000> screws<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:22.280> so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
to put a whole bunch of screws in so

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.980 
to put a whole bunch of screws in so
though<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> top<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.840> then<00:01:27.840> of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
though they are at the top and then of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.230 
though they are at the top and then of

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
bit like that then I would take a hex

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.870 
bit like that then I would take a hex
nut<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:17.630> just<00:02:18.650> screw<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.740> in<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:20.310> like
