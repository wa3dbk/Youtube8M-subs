00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
second attack all right he blocked it

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.420 
second attack all right he blocked it
but<00:05:31.330> we<00:05:31.600> were<00:05:31.750> still<00:05:32.139> able<00:05:32.380> to<00:05:32.710> do<00:05:33.010> it<00:05:33.130> at<00:05:33.280> least

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
but we were still able to do it at least

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.580 
but we were still able to do it at least
him<00:05:33.699> well<00:05:34.660> I'll<00:05:34.720> let<00:05:34.840> you<00:05:34.900> get<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.229> see<00:05:35.410> what

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
happens when uh he blocks it but I think

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.680 
happens when uh he blocks it but I think
we<00:05:39.130> should<00:05:39.160> take<00:05:39.460> some<00:05:39.610> hits<00:05:39.910> until<00:05:40.270> we<00:05:40.389> can<00:05:40.510> do

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
we should take some hits until we can do

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.960 
we should take some hits until we can do
