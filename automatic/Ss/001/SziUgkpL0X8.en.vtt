00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.919
 Tell me guys, I'm going to teach here. 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:14.910
 how do you repair the servant of the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:17.850
 was 120 of 0 2s good first thing 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.850
 So taking out the servo is having a problem. 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.640
 So I took the serginho, you must insist, it's the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 Support servo brake on the pickled 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.660
 hand what happens sometimes when 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.239
 people fall with him or sometimes even 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 of forcing the servant he gets a contest 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.800
 he does not move all he does not move 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.219
 Up he moves down and hangs up. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.410
 generally the gears and voice 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.600
 It will do is not take part 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.250
 sound then you have to take 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.890
 careful not to take this part of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.289
 back here she'll want to get out more 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.620
 easy then I'll hold her I 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.579
 tell us and we're going to pick up the top 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.530
 here o 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.790
 I'll take a forÃ§adinha she still says 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 want to leave 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:18.770
 put a little effort here to open and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.130
 I'm going to take off that right symbol cap. 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:26.000
 You will see the servo gears 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.000
 and you 'll see 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:40.120
 so you can see that the gear here 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:46.500
 underneath it is forced some 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:49.390
 Then I'm going to make me pull a 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.920
 A little bit up here that one. 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.530
 neighboring gear and I will spin alone 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 Gear up'll turn it skipped 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.000
 here a little I'll pull her aside 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.000
 and I will turn her 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:12.490
 180graus in a way and the food part of the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:18.190
 gear looks up from the table goes 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:23.770
 staying there from the opposite side is good 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.920
 two shares food that we do not see 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.130
 the money was clear then the Serbian will 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:36.489
 to overcome 60 degrees than his stroke 30 with 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:39.459
 one side and the other 30 and will not go any more 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.500
 pick up on the part that's crashing 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.200
 gearbox will still run until the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:50.860
 next rough start 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:54.220
 then put it on the helicopter 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.620
 again to fly ok so that's how it goes 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.290
 to seize and the servants the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.510
 120 servo gears are well 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.700
 fragile are this way we can give 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.370
 this one has already been repaired twice 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.530
 podium has two 3rd time repairing 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.450
 he will now the next time possibly 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:16.959
 will have to change but can repair 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:19.239
 three times if you change one is a good reason 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.769
 for us to make this change is good 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.260
 galley thanks 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.680
 I hope it's taken advantage of more 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.680
