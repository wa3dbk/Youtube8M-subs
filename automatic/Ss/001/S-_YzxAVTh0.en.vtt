00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.170
 i 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello everyone with a video they have asked 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.490
 some subscribers and that's how I have 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.080
 customized my device and how 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.709
 I have sorted the icons so 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.709
 let's start 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.770
 well let's start with what they would be 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.510
 the first impressions is to say how 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.050
 let's see everything what I have what 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.880
 I wrote there they see it and well this would be 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.890
 we see what is queen the cover the 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.590
 which I have already made a video and everything and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.360
 then when we slide we will have this 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.820
 main screen without any page 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.680
 the icons that I use the most and good 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.500
 then the application drawer and the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.900
 widget with this functionality too 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.060
 added by the lock screen I also have 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.220
 this two-touch functionality and that 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.809
 I get the notifications bar like this 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.809
 Let's start with the logo screen 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.490
 good what I 'm using in these 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.530
 moments is one that is called cover is 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.870
 one of the most intelligent looks greens 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.330
 what's in what would be the world play 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.970
 we see there is I will not talk much about 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.130
 she that I made a video and 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.979
 you can look for it in the description of 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.960
 this same video to be able to see there and 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.910
 shows you all the functionalities 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.660
 it also comes with this widget now and 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.920
 of the date and they're going to get some 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.560
 options 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.960
 added to what is this what he writes 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.330
 as good we see that by blocking and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.159
 unblock directly we get this 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.080
 screen so let's continue with 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.080
 what is the launcher 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.740
 ok let's start with the launcher that I 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.350
 I have in a personalization and in this 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.170
 case is the launcher is not going this is a 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.040
 launcher really that uses a lot 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.650
 people both on their mobile devices 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.819
 like your tablets because it's optimized 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.549
 for both 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.010
 investments I have in the cold online and 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.930
 can also download a prize that 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.400
 you have to these among other things the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.370
 application has more than 10 million 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.129
 downloads weighs little more than 3 megabytes per 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.560
 what is not so heavy so to speak 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.049
 and it has many aspects for 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.010
 customize and a score 4 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.109
 with 6 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.510
 based on five stars in the lawsuit 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.939
 so let's see what part of icons 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.730
 I'm using and how I have the 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.030
 changed the launcher itself so let's 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.030
 to put 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.650
 good the compact I'm using in 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.130
 these moments is colors square is a 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.310
 payment icons pack 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.390
 Install the play store to buy it 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.520
 good to me the truth that I liked 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.440
 quite is this that is here this one 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.840
 located did not leave us what they would all be 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.090
 the icons like squares which 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.100
 we will be able to change if it is what we 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.420
 like so for example I do not know if 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.060
 we have some application that we 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.430
 I would like you to have another design what 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.780
 we can change between hundreds and hundreds 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.100
 of other icons that already comes with the pack 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.600
 remember that all the links for 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.700
 you can download even in the description 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.740
 so you can download it there 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.420
 directly we are going to cost what 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.750
 would be the changes that I have made in the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.750
 car 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.690
 good the changes that have been made in the 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.720
 launcher are enough for example let's 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.190
 to go now would be the options 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.740
 nova configuration and here we're going 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.319
 a desk was the most 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.959
 big we go to grids and we put in 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.520
 nine rows and six columns and this is going to 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.250
 be what will define the size of 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.110
 the icons that I have so much towards 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.240
 up as to the sides 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.250
 then what he has also done let's go 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.730
 to what would be a new configuration 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.670
 from the desk and here we give the 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.769
 margins we have to put the null 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.480
 that is to say in none so that it does not have 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.050
 no type of margin or anything for the 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.210
 style 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.550
 well we could also remove what is 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.860
 the navigation bar 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.180
 going to the options below the effect 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.220
 of scrolling like a lot of 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.530
 letters or you can put any and for 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.450
 what then we are going to change it and screen 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.260
 only because it's one that's why 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.070
 It does not matter what we have since we never 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.360
 let's scroll between screens 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.669
 then we are going to change what they would be 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.690
 all these icons we should put them 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:56.900
 us to our liking and good is 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.940
 also what I have changed would come to 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.370
 be budgets from right to left 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.590
 those that I use the most and top down those that 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.390
 you are going to tell us right down there 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.630
 are those who will use it and above the 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.760
 that less and then the change of the fund 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.800
 screen by which predefined in 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.020
 the course is which is the only one that comes 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.670
 so I've decided to place that because 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.390
 the truth 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.830
 I liked it a lot and then I put it 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.230
 a 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.340
 option of this widget here with 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.639
 a lot of data such as the battery or 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.400
 The time 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.759
 I 've done that in the store 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:38.300
 applications that is called x widget the 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.449
 We have here is a mixed store 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.580
 times and where we can download 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.080
 a lot of widgets we see that I have 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.449
 Discharged 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.460
 directly in the description will be the 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.110
 name so they can look for them they give 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.810
 to the options and directly there what 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.490
 search and download it for free 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.610
 then I put him here and he has not 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.680
 resized to fit the size 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.189
 that he would be left over with the circles and 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.080
 placed so good so far what 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:09.080
 that would be my good personalization then 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.270
 I have changed what is the aspect of 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.729
 home button is that I have changed it for 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.599
 the good application drawer and the 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.599
 icons that you have 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.419
 is the appearance and then the gestures and 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.400
 buttons in Boston start you by 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.289
 the applications drawer there 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.979
 select the one they like with 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:31.449
 the divisions and lists so good 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.120

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.580
