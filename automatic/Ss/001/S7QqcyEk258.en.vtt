like a little bit under an hour and

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.260 
like a little bit under an hour and

after I got that first tattoo that's how

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.760 
after I got that first tattoo that's how
everything<00:01:20.600> started<00:01:20.780> that's<00:01:21.290> how<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.500> ball

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
everything started that's how the ball

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.649 
everything started that's how the ball
started<00:01:22.159> rolling<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:22.820> saw<00:01:23.030> how<00:01:23.150> easy<00:01:23.450> that

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
started rolling and I saw how easy that

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.910 
started rolling and I saw how easy that
one<00:01:23.870> wasn't<00:01:24.080> my<00:01:25.540> yeah<00:01:26.540> see<00:01:27.200> those<00:01:27.290> wings<00:01:27.530> this

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
one wasn't my yeah see those wings this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.040 
one wasn't my yeah see those wings this
wing<00:01:28.220> looks<00:01:28.700> different<00:01:29.120> from<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:29.510> wing<00:01:29.780> so

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
wing looks different from that wing so

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.350 
wing looks different from that wing so
my<00:01:30.260> whole<00:01:30.470> theory<00:01:30.800> behind<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.400> tattoo<00:01:32.030> was

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
my whole theory behind that tattoo was

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.140 
my whole theory behind that tattoo was
we<00:01:32.659> all<00:01:32.810> have<00:01:33.080> two<00:01:33.440> sides<00:01:33.740> split<00:01:34.400> personality

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
we all have two sides split personality

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.959 
we all have two sides split personality
alter<00:01:35.750> ego<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:36.619> I<00:01:36.649> feel<00:01:36.979> like<00:01:37.009> this<00:01:37.460> side<00:01:37.759> is

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
alter ego so I feel like this side is

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.240 
alter ego so I feel like this side is
the<00:01:38.210> good<00:01:38.719> side<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.259> me<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:39.649> know<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.009> art

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
is obviously the spiritual side and the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.990 
is obviously the spiritual side and the
other<00:01:54.500> side<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.829> me<00:01:54.950> is<00:01:55.130> like<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.549> worldly

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000
