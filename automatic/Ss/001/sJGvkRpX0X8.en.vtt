 with this new project that is 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.590
 'operation triumph' what expectations 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.850
 look first I'm very grateful with 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.789
 God because that's how I tell you this is 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.200
 something that has happened to me and that looks today 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:33.490
 I had not counted only had 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.850
 producer does as I think 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.619
 this year there are 14 something like that when it was launched 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.409
 the first 'triunfo operation' in Spain 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.450
 and it was pink and it 's the 'operation 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.970
 triumph of that david david bisbal 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.840
 participated I was in Spain and I 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.729
 I stayed there for three weeks but I saw everything 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.350
 the time 'operation triumph' and almost not 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.240
 I moved because if I started and said no 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.850
 I do not go out I have to see it I do not 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.190
 I knew the participants was a subject 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.050
 purely Spanish but it was so pretty 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.570
 but it looked so good that I said I have 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.300
 to see the other week when I came back 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.709
 I have seen all of them that they had 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.230
 already recorded with the boys of 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.540
 'operation triumph' but you know me 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.750
 I always said that it's a pity that my country 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.600
 be this who as he was carlos lush 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.860
 the one who drove and said who like him and 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.860
 it seems like that got into my head 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.819
 I believe in God I believe God but 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.750
 at that moment I think that effectively 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.840
 I sent 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.150
 a desire 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.900
 he dies looking at the ship could it be that I 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.019
 I could not imagine that years later I was going to 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.510
 to be 'triumph operation' and that Carlos 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:50.019
 lozano was going to be invited by us 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.150
 to be the jury and you know not to 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.560
 delayed was in the exact time because 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.710
 'operation triumph' is a program that 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.910
 have 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.890
 so many technical requirements 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.840
 you have to put together an academy you have to take 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.020
 to the best ones so that 's one 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.460
 academy in which 18 students enter 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.550
 we could not have done 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.110
 5 years this still could not be no no no 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.820
 no we were not prepared just 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.850
 we are prepared with the equipment 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.490
 we learned with reality does this is 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.830
 saying god is perfect says and there is something 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.930
 that we are going to present here in the format 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.660
 Peruvian or is the format exactly 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.550
 equal to the international good when 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.410
 when you do 'dancing for a dream' 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.410
 or american idol 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.950
 'Triumph operation' 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.930
 there is a strategy that from the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.629
 strategy enter 18 participants 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.879
 who enter are Peruvians perfect of 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.470
 9,000 that was the case and they were 9000 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.319
 people who showed up and in addition to 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.290
 all the peru not exact then what 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.829
 passes is already fully Peruvian and already 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.530
 it has to do with what we read and 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.329
 why but the stories the dreams the 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.069
 way in which he directs denis is not the 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.989
 same way in which he directs direct 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.370
 others the way he directs my 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.109
 producer is not the same as us 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.040
 producers then everyone is going to 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.040
 put and of gisela 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.389
 and I've also had the luck to tell 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.789
 Carlos is going to be here knows 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.370
 much the format comes david bisbal this 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.380
 Saturday to be like our first 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.289
 guest is saying everyone is giving what 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.460
 that we really want some some 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.090
 have said today is a super program 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.490
 ambitious if it is in the event that 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.620
 we have worked hard but what we are is 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.570
 what we want is to go out and have fun 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.300
 that makes us be super fun and that 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.190
 you and many people say ok I have to 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.009
 but I'm going to do it later I'm going to 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.430
 prepare it out in the house we see the 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.259
 program that I think that's going to happen 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.460
 very naturally and then we do what 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.650
 what we have to do we want the 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.690
 people gather from their the houses that the 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.000
 family meets that the boys are 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.000
 have fun but the jury that are two 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.919
 international and I think a Peruvian 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.720
 who they are and what mission do they have 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.069
 they are those who disqualify or the 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.460
 public also has something to do there 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:12.009
 not the jury is who you say you go to the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.710

 it's so regal it's not just sport 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.080
 I do not lie to you because women 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.750
 men foundations operations 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.240

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.580
 they make it here you can erase it there 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.520

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:29.260
 truth and I still say because in some 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.900
 safe moment 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.360
 and I should do it but I want to postpone 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.740
 there is some love there in the heart 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.800

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.650
 will be a better man than me will be a 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.720
 man that has a more spirit 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.560
 advanced that I will be a man who 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.930
 I can really lead my house 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.150
 any not any person not 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.140

 a lot and that starts with finding 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:21.860
 just do not expect anyone to love you if 

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:24.260
 you do not start to love and you know maybe 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.210
 these five years of my life alone have 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.690
 been the years the best years of my 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:32.330
