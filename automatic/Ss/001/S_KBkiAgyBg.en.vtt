the hook on the side and just note with

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.260 
the hook on the side and just note with
my<00:01:48.509> finger<00:01:48.930> exactly<00:01:49.170> where<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.670> hook<00:01:50.880> should

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
my finger exactly where the hook should

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.030 
my finger exactly where the hook should
come<00:01:51.659> out<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.890> that's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
come out so that it's so that's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.160 
come out so that it's so that's
perfectly<00:01:53.399> straight<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.299> pinched<00:01:54.869> off<00:01:54.990> with

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
perfectly straight so I pinched off with

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.319 
perfectly straight so I pinched off with
my<00:01:55.290> finger<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.950> I'll<00:01:56.520> twist<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.909> off<00:01:57.000> here<00:01:57.149> so

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
my finger and I'll twist it off here so

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
my finger and I'll twist it off here so
you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.570> hopefully<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.049> camera<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.009> then

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
you can hopefully see on camera and then

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.100 
you can hopefully see on camera and then
I'll<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.369> down<00:01:59.399> through<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.270> very<00:02:00.479> bottom<00:02:00.899> and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I'll go down through the very bottom and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.139 
I'll go down through the very bottom and
then<00:02:01.439> straight<00:02:01.799> up<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.070> top<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.759> has

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
then straight up the top it really has

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.870 
then straight up the top it really has
to<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.500> straight<00:02:04.560> out<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.250> top<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.700> can

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to be straight out of the top so you can

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.850 
to be straight out of the top so you can
see<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.420> actually<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:07.710> has<00:02:07.829> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
see this was actually this one has a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.040 
see this was actually this one has a
line<00:02:08.399> down<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.789> middle<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.539> hook<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.869> not

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
line down the middle and the hook is not

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.540 
line down the middle and the hook is not
going<00:02:10.410> out<00:02:10.530> through<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.860> line<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.370> I'm<00:02:11.430> going

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
going out through that line so I'm going

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.320 
going out through that line so I'm going
to<00:02:11.580> redo<00:02:11.879> it

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
to redo it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.480 
to redo it
again<00:02:13.140> it's<00:02:13.320> if<00:02:13.470> it's<00:02:13.620> not<00:02:13.770> hooked<00:02:13.950> perfect

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
again it's if it's not hooked perfect

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.840 
again it's if it's not hooked perfect
don't<00:02:15.300> use<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.810> redo<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:16.650> we'll<00:02:17.550> have<00:02:17.700> to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
don't use it and redo so we'll have to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.300 
don't use it and redo so we'll have to
hope<00:02:18.120> for<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.540> second<00:02:18.960> round<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.290> better<00:02:19.470> that

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
hope for the second round is better that

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.770 
hope for the second round is better that
one<00:02:20.430> fell<00:02:20.640> good<00:02:20.820> right<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.360> can<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:21.630> this

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
one fell good right so you can see this

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.690 
one fell good right so you can see this
hook<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.050> coming<00:02:22.560> straight<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.430> middle

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
hook is coming straight out the middle

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.910 
hook is coming straight out the middle
this<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.870> now<00:02:25.080> hooked<00:02:25.350> properly

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
this is this is now hooked properly

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.850 
this is this is now hooked properly
there's<00:02:26.580> no<00:02:26.790> there's<00:02:27.420> no<00:02:27.480> side<00:02:28.380> action<00:02:28.680> this

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
there's no there's no side action this

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.160

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
bad things about these baits is that you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.800 
bad things about these baits is that you
know<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:41.520> pufferfish<00:02:42.120> are<00:02:42.420> around<00:02:42.660> they're

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
know if pufferfish are around they're

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.180 
know if pufferfish are around they're
going<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.990> chop<00:02:43.290> off<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.560> tail<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:44.100> have

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
going to chop off the tail and you have

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.190 
going to chop off the tail and you have
to<00:02:44.280> redo<00:02:44.550> them<00:02:44.700> but<00:02:45.420> but<00:02:45.810> other<00:02:45.960> than<00:02:46.050> that

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
to redo them but but other than that
