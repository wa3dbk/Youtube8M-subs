wherever there's light right where these
are<00:00:15.630> seems<00:00:16.630> to<00:00:16.779> be<00:00:16.869> growing<00:00:17.489> just<00:00:18.489> fine

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
are seems to be growing just fine

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
from this one a little bit of roots but

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.880 
from this one a little bit of roots but
it's<00:00:36.580> not<00:00:36.730> like<00:00:36.910> this<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.530> I'm<00:00:38.590> just<00:00:38.710> hoping

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
these get a little stronger look at that

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.080 
these get a little stronger look at that

watt<00:01:15.729> digital<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:18.729> one<00:01:18.880> of<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.030> switchable

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
watt digital it's one of the switchable

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.139 
watt digital it's one of the switchable
black<00:01:19.659> ballasts<00:01:21.149> so<00:01:22.149> there<00:01:22.840> it<00:01:22.960> is<00:01:23.020> 80<00:01:23.649> spot

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
black ballasts so there it is 80 spot

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.359 
black ballasts so there it is 80 spot
vertical<00:01:25.149> hydroponic<00:01:25.539> system<00:01:26.109> this<00:01:27.009> is<00:01:27.189> just

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
vertical hydroponic system this is just

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.789 
vertical hydroponic system this is just
an<00:01:27.460> experiment<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:29.049> full-size<00:01:29.560> will

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
an experiment the full-size will

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.859 
an experiment the full-size will
actually<00:01:30.100> be<00:01:30.249> double<00:01:30.670> well<00:01:31.479> I'm<00:01:31.749> actually

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
actually be double well I'm actually

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.719 
actually be double well I'm actually
quadruple<00:01:32.590> because<00:01:32.829> you'll<00:01:32.979> have<00:01:33.130> 10<00:01:33.459> feet

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
quadruple because you'll have 10 feet

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.969 
quadruple because you'll have 10 feet
these<00:01:33.880> are<00:01:33.939> only<00:01:34.119> five<00:01:34.420> feet<00:01:34.719> and<00:01:34.929> then<00:01:35.709> the

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
these are only five feet and then the

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.559 
these are only five feet and then the
other<00:01:36.219> it'll<00:01:36.579> have<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.700> whole<00:01:36.909> nother<00:01:37.030> side<00:01:37.299> to

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
other it'll have a whole nother side to

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.080 
other it'll have a whole nother side to
it<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.770> this<00:01:39.100> is<00:01:39.219> four<00:01:39.429> feet<00:01:39.609> from<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:39.939> wall

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
it so this is four feet from the wall

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.239 
it so this is four feet from the wall
it'll<00:01:40.539> actually<00:01:40.630> be<00:01:40.869> eight<00:01:41.079> feet<00:01:41.249> full

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
it'll actually be eight feet full

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:58.830 
it'll actually be eight feet full
triangle<00:01:44.340> take<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.369> look<00:01:45.549> here

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.600 

all<00:01:59.840> right<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:00.590> if<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.220> haven't<00:02:01.399> subscribed

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
already you want to follow the Grove

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.540 
already you want to follow the Grove
follow<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.880> experiment<00:02:06.220> feel<00:02:07.220> free<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:09.550> you

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
follow the experiment feel free and you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.210 
follow the experiment feel free and you
can<00:02:10.729> see<00:02:10.970> how<00:02:11.150> how<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.840> ends<00:02:12.110> up<00:02:12.200> thanks<00:02:13.160> a
