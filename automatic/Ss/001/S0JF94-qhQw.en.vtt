there's several parts well first let me
say<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.130> has<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.840> it<00:00:36.840> rotates<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> shaft

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
say this one has a it rotates on a shaft

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.270 
say this one has a it rotates on a shaft
like<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.000> spin<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.590> want<00:00:40.860> one<00:00:41.070> like

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
like if I I spin this you want one like

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
like if I I spin this you want one like
this<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> lot<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.910> them<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.210> solid<00:00:42.870> shafts<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
including let the tool rotate in your

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.690 
including let the tool rotate in your

and wrapping it around that thread and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.590 
and wrapping it around that thread and
it's<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.059> more<00:00:54.239> variable

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
it's just it's just one more variable

it's just it's just one more variable
you<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:54.989> eliminate<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.660> basically<00:00:57.660> let's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you can eliminate so basically let's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.420 
you can eliminate so basically let's
just<00:00:58.109> run<00:00:58.289> through<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.649> spots<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.309> is

just a little hook and a top where you
were<00:01:01.949> actual<00:01:02.370> wrapping<00:01:03.239> takes<00:01:03.510> place<00:01:03.840> it's

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
were actual wrapping takes place it's

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.440

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
just let the tool rotate in your hand

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.139 
just let the tool rotate in your hand
and<00:01:42.079> then<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.110> bring<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.770> around<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.399> bring

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
and then just bring it around and bring

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.510 
and then just bring it around and bring
it<00:01:45.270> around<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.810> what's<00:01:46.619> actually<00:01:46.799> happening

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
it around and what's actually happening

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.450 
it around and what's actually happening
if<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.240> set<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.570> down<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.259> why<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.130> is

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
if I can set this down and why this is

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.609 
if I can set this down and why this is
so<00:01:50.670> good

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
so good

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.800 
so good
is<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.860> what's<00:01:53.009> happening<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:54.390> thread

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
is that what's happening is this thread

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.959 
is that what's happening is this thread
is<00:01:55.140> actually<00:01:55.350> wrapping<00:01:55.770> around<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.520> thread

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
is actually wrapping around this thread

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.929 
is actually wrapping around this thread
and<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.810> basically<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:59.250> will<00:01:59.640> pull

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and when basically this will pull

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.569 
and when basically this will pull
through<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.630> kind<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.409> encapsulate<00:02:02.159> itself

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
through and kind of encapsulate itself

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.399 
through and kind of encapsulate itself
so<00:02:02.850> no<00:02:03.030> matter<00:02:03.149> which<00:02:03.420> way<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.719> pulls<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.259> or

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
so no matter which way it pulls in or

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.029 
so no matter which way it pulls in or
out<00:02:04.579> you<00:02:05.579> still<00:02:06.320> basically<00:02:07.320> can't<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.890> off

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
out you still basically can't get it off

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.800 
out you still basically can't get it off
so<00:02:08.929> we'll<00:02:09.929> go<00:02:10.050> around<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.410> couple<00:02:10.709> more<00:02:10.830> times

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
so we'll go around a couple more times

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.000 
so we'll go around a couple more times
okay<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.849> let<00:02:15.849> that<00:02:16.060> go<00:02:16.769> now<00:02:17.769> what

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
okay like that let that go now what

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.500 
okay like that let that go now what
you're<00:02:18.160> gonna<00:02:18.220> do<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.730> you're<00:02:19.150> gonna<00:02:19.239> bring

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
this up take it and you'll hear it

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.110 
this up take it and you'll hear it
tink<00:02:22.420> let<00:02:23.069> tink<00:02:24.069> right<00:02:24.250> out<00:02:24.400> of<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.640> bottom

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
tink let tink right out of that bottom

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.020 
tink let tink right out of that bottom
hook<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.599> then<00:02:26.280> take<00:02:27.280> your<00:02:27.400> hand<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.790> pull

the bobbin and compensate as you pull

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.180 
the bobbin and compensate as you pull
that<00:02:30.400> thread<00:02:30.730> down<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.590> let<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.680> go<00:02:32.830> right<00:02:32.860> off

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
that thread down and let it go right off

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.449 
that thread down and let it go right off
in<00:02:33.430> there<00:02:34.440> one<00:02:35.440> more<00:02:35.530> time<00:02:35.680> I'll<00:02:36.069> show<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.370> and

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
in there one more time I'll show it and

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.180 
in there one more time I'll show it and
actually<00:02:36.549> on<00:02:36.849> my<00:02:36.879> flies<00:02:37.269> I<00:02:38.010> always<00:02:39.010> whip

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
actually on my flies I always whip

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.150 
actually on my flies I always whip
finished<00:02:39.549> couple<00:02:39.849> you<00:02:40.269> know<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.390> couple<00:02:40.660> times

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
finished couple you know a couple times

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.309 
finished couple you know a couple times
so<00:02:42.160> hook<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.879> in<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.060> bottom<00:02:43.510> hook<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.049> that

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
so hook it in that bottom hook and that

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.520 
so hook it in that bottom hook and that
bottom<00:02:44.650> bump<00:02:44.860> let<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.880> get<00:02:46.060> around<00:02:46.329> catch<00:02:47.290> that

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
bottom bump let it get around catch that

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.890 
bottom bump let it get around catch that
top<00:02:47.829> make<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.489> triangle<00:02:49.090> right<00:02:49.269> there<00:02:49.299> and

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
top make that triangle right there and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.350 
top make that triangle right there and
let<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:50.980> just<00:02:51.010> go<00:02:51.220> around<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.790> don't<00:02:51.970> don't

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
let it just go around and don't don't

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.819 
let it just go around and don't don't
try<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.690> do<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:52.870> too<00:02:53.079> tight<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.319> lot<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.590> people

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
pulling on it so hard you're disrupting

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.479 
pulling on it so hard you're disrupting
yourself<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:02.560> know<00:03:02.650> fooling<00:03:03.250> with

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
to just loosen up a little bit

anyway take that let it tink out of

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.030 
anyway take that let it tink out of
there<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:15.280> bottom<00:03:15.670> one<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.660> let<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.109> pull<00:03:17.410> it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
there that bottom one and let it pull it

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.340 
there that bottom one and let it pull it
up<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.370> compensate<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.239> pull<00:03:20.019> that<00:03:20.170> little

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
going to get is a fish vicious tooth

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.690 
going to get is a fish vicious tooth
cuts<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.130> or<00:03:33.250> something<00:03:33.609> it<00:03:33.670> won't<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:35.019> know
