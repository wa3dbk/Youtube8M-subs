00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.390
 in his life a presentation of the group in 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.420
 concrete and short radio 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.559
 in concrete solutions to build a 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.559
 future of robots 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.599
 for the channel 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.810
 competent 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.810
 What is it 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.350
 basically 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:43.280
 and the panorama 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.170
 what is this why 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.760
 how many projects 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.750
 we can identify 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.750
 Y 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.350
 we can be worried 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.670
 reality 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.649
 in the exit of the credits the enormous 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.880
 advantage that we have is everything that 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.440
 can help outgoing is the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.150
 combination of itself 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.830
 in the case of banks with the 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.030
 co-financing will leave more 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:02:00.300
 calm of what originally 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:02:00.300
 I was at risk 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.370
 this comes hand in hand with the theme of 5 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.840
 finally it is the grain with the infonavit 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.900
 fortunately, its income capture 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.820
 in the big part of 70 80 percent 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.260
 comes from what for the people themselves 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.810
 you already have to put is paying 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.990
 monthly payments then that practically 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.670
 yes it does not assure us that until the institute 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.450
 profit union but yes 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.450
 it will surely be 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.000
 then we have practically 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.770
 assured the seeds that this 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.720
 individual 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.720
 and on the other hand that is very good 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.840
 first people are accredited more 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.500
 I could buy an apartment of 600 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.900
 thousand pesos 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.900
 I have spent to buy about 900 thousand pesos 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.730
 with the 25 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.220
 as well 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.480
 is described 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.280
 once we are every day 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.379
 especially to know the homes 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.239
 as much of the milian goddess as in others 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.569
 delegations for workers of 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.569
 tourist 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.410
 is a sector that is very difficult for the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:43.000
 state people have a budget and 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.000
 although there is a little more crisis 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.870
 during 2009 surely 2010 is going to 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.020
 be directly from the outputs as 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.020
 this 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.819
 dressed as with 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:22.340
 where is going to complicate the issue of 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:29.570
 credits for which only takes six 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:33.790
 months and a little more aggressive a 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.790
 knowledge like santander very little 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.059
 they will continue to do it but every time 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.699
 they are more selective and a 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:42.289
 moment when you as a promoter if 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.539
 you have a certain volume and you are going to 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.550
 can request a reciprocity banks 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.949
 that before I had told them if you 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.479
 you want 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:53.529
 200 300 percent departments 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.849
 individual I need I support when 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:58.270
 he was a developer that has to win 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.110
 two buildings or 40 departments 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.669
 It will hardly be attractive for the 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.770
 boat that's why they have a return when 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.689
 in credit and second because it's not 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.009
 attractive in the number of units as 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.009
 so he does not say 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.410
 we go 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.900
 friends 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.560
 Ok let's go 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.140
 for him 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.140
 to me 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.990
 specific
