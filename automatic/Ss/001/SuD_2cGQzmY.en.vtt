off how to do it on the bike you get a

suggest<00:01:49.380> doing<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.149> problem<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
suggest doing that problem with that is

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.800 
suggest doing that problem with that is
you<00:01:52.320> bend<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.740> rotor<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:54.060> right<00:01:54.299> way<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> do

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you bend your rotor the right way to do

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.810 
you bend your rotor the right way to do
it<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.079> take<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.619> caliper<00:01:56.040> off<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.399> bike<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
it is take the caliper off the bike and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.450 
it is take the caliper off the bike and
go<00:01:57.570> from<00:01:57.810> there<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.619> let's<00:01:58.829> take<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.189> off<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
go from there so let's take it off the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.139 
go from there so let's take it off the
