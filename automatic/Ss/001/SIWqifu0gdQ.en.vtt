00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:07.580
 induction capacitor motor 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:14.179
 2-speed two modes 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:17.430
 2840 turns and the second mode 420 turn 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.109
 the motor has a terminal strip at the terminal block again 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.779
 pin bottom pin 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.650
 total we price it directly 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:30.960
 network truth from the wire goes mean 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:35.250
 network and cremics see two red and two 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.579
 black, these wires are connected 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.489
 directly to capacitor capacitor 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.340
 have a capacity of 14 microfarads and working 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.230
 voltage 450 volts 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:53.360
 second capacitor one predatory 14 micra 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:56.280
 450 volt parade 2 power cord 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.620
 I hold it in my hands I will 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.570
 connect 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:06.020
 to run here by this wire which 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.020
 mean goes red from cream not to 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.020
 capacitor 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.490
 here 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.720
 now to the second capacitor lead i 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.720
 I will save 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.820
 the second capacitor we connect our 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.820
 the wire 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.650
 it's just about another capacitor 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.330
 socially confused 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.020
 sidelnikova works fine thanks 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.020
 all for attention
