00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.320
 to the conclusion of the strategy I was 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.510
 do to get to it come on 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.939
 well let's start there the first 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.680
 left the map I took the right and it was 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.290
 rolling the map making a whole stroke 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.630
 counter-clockwise let's say around the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.659
 central patio because so it has a 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.850
 central park that has one more 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.000
 Teddy is the fifth by itself what I 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.100
 I get on this map always clear following 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.350

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.950

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.960

 He has the teddies you catch looks 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.750

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.060
 hook and tucked into the back of your neck is one thing 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.700
 tenebrous you see a teddy bear like that 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.149
 one primary school 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.329
 full of blood and bodies 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.780
 several things broken inside the school 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.360
 really makes me a little distressed 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.619

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.600

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.700
 Possible way to arrest do not get me 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.790

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.790

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.230

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.480

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.720
 And how are you realizing now? 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.810
 I just got the fifth teddy bear there. 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.440
 no pat now that thing starts getting 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.280

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.080
 very strong pink cable now the slider with 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.319
 that appears all the time 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.390
 Of course if you start picking up some 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.660
 wrong paths but as I already had the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.030
 Way all traced in my head I 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.160
 I already knew exactly what I wanted to do. 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.680
 so I did not have many problems not with 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.319
 slayer only the moment I got it 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.680
 the seventh teddy I stayed a little 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.910
 desperate and after I took the eighth 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.720
 also because I did not know they had 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.910

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.870

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:15.329

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.049
