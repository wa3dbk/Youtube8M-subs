00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
short cut which is a four-way slider you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.990 
short cut which is a four-way slider you
can<00:02:16.230> have<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.100> lot<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.430> options<00:02:17.610> them

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
can have that so a lot of options them

can have that so a lot of options them
actually<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.450> widget<00:02:18.660> clock<00:02:19.350> widget<00:02:19.530> which

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
actually one widget clock widget which

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.110 
actually one widget clock widget which
is<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.100> C<00:02:20.280> clock<00:02:20.490> which<00:02:20.700> comes<00:02:20.970> with

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
is the C clock which comes with

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.820 
is the C clock which comes with
challenging<00:02:21.570> mode<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.990> do<00:02:22.110> have<00:02:22.140> less<00:02:22.440> you

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
challenging mode so you do have less you

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.670 
challenging mode so you do have less you
do<00:02:22.950> have<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.340> also<00:02:24.080> interface<00:02:25.080> settings<00:02:25.290> is

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
do have that also interface settings is

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.790 
do have that also interface settings is
the<00:02:25.950> best<00:02:26.730> feature<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.180> size<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.990> guess<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.500> you

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the best feature of size I guess so you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.620 
the best feature of size I guess so you
do<00:02:28.950> have<00:02:29.100> status<00:02:29.490> bar<00:02:29.640> options<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.240> can

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
do have status bar options you can

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.810 
do have status bar options you can
enable<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.200> disabled<00:02:31.590> clock<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.490> have<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
enable a disabled clock you can have the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.000 
enable a disabled clock you can have the
battery<00:02:33.120> status<00:02:33.330> style<00:02:34.050> as<00:02:34.320> icon<00:02:34.650> portrait

battery<00:02:39.090> status<00:02:39.330> percentage<00:02:39.960> so<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.230> is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
battery status percentage so it is

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.740 
battery status percentage so it is
showing<00:02:40.560> eighty-seven<00:02:41.100> percentage<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.940> yeah

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
showing eighty-seven percentage and yeah

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.810 
showing eighty-seven percentage and yeah
I'll<00:02:43.200> get<00:02:43.410> into<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.770> later<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.550> battery

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
I'll get into that later the battery

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.910 
I'll get into that later the battery
life<00:02:44.970> show<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> notification<00:02:46.230> count<00:02:46.710> that's

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
pretty neat quick setting panel it does

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.060 
pretty neat quick setting panel it does
have<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.960> Sandra's<00:02:52.350> energy<00:02:52.680> mode

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
quick setting with the camera which is

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.930 
quick setting with the camera which is
well<00:02:55.260> probably<00:02:55.680> my<00:02:56.010> favorite<00:02:56.370> feature<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.790> it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
well probably my favorite feature of it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.150 
well probably my favorite feature of it
but<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.570> does<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.320> Styles<00:02:58.680> option<00:02:59.010> you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
but it does like the Styles option you

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.010 
but it does like the Styles option you
cannot<00:02:59.430> change<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.000> number<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.570> times<00:03:00.810> per

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
cannot change the number of times per

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.420 
cannot change the number of times per
row<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.530> that's<00:03:01.650> something<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.250> turn-off

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
row so that's something of a turn-off

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.850 
row so that's something of a turn-off
for<00:03:02.580> me<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.150> do<00:03:03.480> have<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.860> notification

good<00:05:57.629> well<00:05:58.349> if<00:05:58.620> I<00:05:59.009> had<00:05:59.159> to<00:05:59.189> prove<00:05:59.520> I<00:05:59.909> had<00:06:00.089> a

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
good well if I had to prove I had a

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.510 
good well if I had to prove I had a
preference<00:06:00.569> for<00:06:00.839> a<00:06:01.020> stock<00:06:01.379> fast<00:06:01.949> word<00:06:02.219> this

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
preference for a stock fast word this

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.459 
preference for a stock fast word this
would<00:06:02.729> have<00:06:02.879> been<00:06:03.000> the<00:06:03.150> one<00:06:03.330> so<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:03.990> can<00:06:04.289> have

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
would have been the one so you can have

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.110 
would have been the one so you can have
that<00:06:04.680> it<00:06:04.830> does<00:06:05.009> come<00:06:05.189> with<00:06:05.219> titanium<00:06:05.879> backup

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
that it does come with titanium backup

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.839 
that it does come with titanium backup
so<00:06:06.539> that's<00:06:07.050> really<00:06:07.229> good<00:06:07.469> it<00:06:08.339> does<00:06:08.550> have<00:06:08.699> the

here is the boot animation which I

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.429 
here is the boot animation which I
absolutely<00:06:37.759> love<00:06:38.759> this<00:06:39.060> is<00:06:39.240> a<00:06:39.270> minimal

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:40.439 
absolutely love this is a minimal

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:42.469 
absolutely love this is a minimal
boot<00:06:40.739> animation<00:06:41.279> which<00:06:41.459> is<00:06:41.610> really<00:06:42.089> cool<00:06:42.300> it

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
boot animation which is really cool it

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.179 
boot animation which is really cool it
shows<00:06:42.839> you<00:06:42.989> the<00:06:43.110> name<00:06:43.319> of<00:06:43.469> the<00:06:43.589> ROM<00:06:43.769> so<00:06:44.009> that's

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:44.189 
shows you the name of the ROM so that's

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:47.239 
shows you the name of the ROM so that's
really<00:06:44.339> cool<00:06:44.580> so<00:06:45.149> yeah<00:06:45.479> I<00:06:45.779> guess<00:06:46.619> that<00:06:46.889> much<00:06:47.069> is

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:47.249 
really cool so yeah I guess that much is

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:49.519 
really cool so yeah I guess that much is
it<00:06:47.489> about<00:06:47.789> the<00:06:47.969> ROM<00:06:48.239> this<00:06:48.839> is<00:06:48.899> it<00:06:49.080> there<00:06:49.319> isn't

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:49.529 
it about the ROM this is it there isn't

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:51.529 
it about the ROM this is it there isn't
much<00:06:49.919> to<00:06:50.129> show<00:06:50.339> in<00:06:50.580> this<00:06:50.699> form<00:06:50.969> basic<00:06:51.419> because

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
much to show in this form basic because

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.659 
much to show in this form basic because
it's<00:06:52.110> a<00:06:52.259> team<00:06:52.469> signage<00:06:52.860> and<00:06:52.979> more<00:06:53.039> ROM<00:06:53.399> which

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
it's a team signage and more ROM which

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:54.739 
it's a team signage and more ROM which
is<00:06:53.789> really<00:06:53.999> cool

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:54.749
