 renovating your home painting is a task that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.989
 it requires a lot of preparation work 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.660
 take the time to leave the room 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.730
 ready to remove the covers 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.309

 Wet to remove dust 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.690
 make sure the walls are dry 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.960
 completely before beginning to paint 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.759
 also extend a protective canvas of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.670
 wall to wall to avoid staining the 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.830
 floor the list of painting tools 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.320
 It will vary depending on the size of the 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.000
 room in which I must work have 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.460
 by hand a copy of the book improvements 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.229
 for the place 1 2 and 3 I leave type for 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.180
 get more advice on 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.280
 necessary tools and selection 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.259
 of the paint previously print your 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.149
 walls to achieve an optimal finish 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.280
 with type offers several products that 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.500
 combine paint and print d'or in a

 only article start working for the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.000
 ceiling or at some point of union 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.039
 between the wall and the crown molding 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.280
 a good quality angular brush 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:45.810
 it is essential to touch up the edges 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.810
 and the corners of a room 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.670
 I worked along the masked frame 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.200
 until you reach the tape without staining the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.060
 otherwise the paint could 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.060
 filter below the tape 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.170
 Try to work by moving your arm and 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.159
 wrist to ensure optimal control and 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.590
 reduce your effort 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.319
 Hold the handle of the brush between your 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.530
 thumb and forefinger surrounding the with cloth 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.569
 metal with the rest of the fingers for 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.519
 prevent the paint from drying out leaving 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.739
 protuberances gently rub the 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.000
 paint around the corners and 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.610
 on the adjacent walls 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.160
 [Music] 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.260
 start working around the edge 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.730
 the area you plan to paint before 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.250
 scatter the paint 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.159
 I used a 9-inch roller to 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.620
 the most extensive extensions to achieve 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:41.409
 a smooth and uniform finish without lumps 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.409
 start working from a corner and 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:48.340
 paint a 3 x 3 foot section 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:50.920
 describing the shape of a w so that 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.379
 the paint is mixed with long strokes 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.750
 and soft change the direction slightly 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.840
 of the roller in each pass until both 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.849
 disappear the w 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.220
 Take as much time as necessary with 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.920
 the roller and move it at a steady pace 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.200
 and moderate to avoid splashing 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.700
 if paint is spilled clean the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.680
 Immediate with a damp cloth 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.719
 [Music] 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.820
 continue doing the same 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:26.470
 procedure on the entire wall 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:28.780
 [Music] 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.330
 If you must reach high points in the 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.520
 walls place an elongated handle to your 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.100
 roller also has the option of 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.170
 use a ladder in that case a 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.390
 6-foot ladder is the most 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.390
 versatile painting projects 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.650
 to work the smaller areas that 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.530
 surround the windows doors and moldings 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.290
 use a 4-inch roller or a 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.689
 good brush 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.969
 I let the painted surface dry 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:04.269
 a few hours before applying the 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:06.310
 second coat of paint the procedure 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.829
 to pass a second or third layer of 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.950
 paint is the same as was explained for 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:14.230
 the first layer let the last 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.470
 layer before removing the painter's tape 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.220
 and replace the covers now your 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.380
 Room has a renovated appearance 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.229
 besides saving that is the power of 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.360
 wagon type here you can find a 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.280
 reminder list of tools and 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.000
 materials you will need to perform 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.000
