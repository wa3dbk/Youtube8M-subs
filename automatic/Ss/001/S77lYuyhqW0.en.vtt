00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
um the second bus the bus of the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.380 
um the second bus the bus of the
fountain<00:00:17.310> dome<00:00:19.520> just<00:00:20.520> got<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.820> get<00:00:20.880> over<00:00:21.029> here

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
fountain dome just got to get over here

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.870 
fountain dome just got to get over here
and<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.619> told<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.980> before<00:00:23.010> if<00:00:23.609> you're

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
and like I told you before if you're

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.240 
and like I told you before if you're
running<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.720> press<00:00:24.930> Z<00:00:25.199> than<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
running and you press Z than a you do a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.390 
running and you press Z than a you do a
long<00:00:26.490> jump<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.470> that<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.590> very<00:00:28.830> useful<00:00:29.369> for

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
long jump and that is very useful for

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.659 
long jump and that is very useful for
things<00:00:29.789> some<00:00:30.269> people<00:00:30.439> like<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.650> used<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.489> wonder

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
things some people like I used to wonder

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.120 
things some people like I used to wonder
how<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.480> some<00:00:34.140> levels<00:00:34.559> there<00:00:34.770> were<00:00:34.860> places

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
how in some levels there were places

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.970 
how in some levels there were places
that<00:00:35.670> looks<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.899> expected<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.710> jump

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that looks like it expected you to jump

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.090 
that looks like it expected you to jump
that<00:00:38.190> far<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.760> wondered<00:00:39.090> how<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.100> didn't

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
that far and I wondered how so I didn't

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.180 
that far and I wondered how so I didn't
figure<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.370> out<00:00:41.520> until<00:00:41.790> later<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:43.980> one

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
figure that out until later and this one

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.500 
figure that out until later and this one
is<00:00:44.309> bowser<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:45.149> bowser<00:00:45.420> jr.<00:00:46.969> Bowser's<00:00:47.969> star

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
is bowser not bowser jr. Bowser's star

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.930 
is bowser not bowser jr. Bowser's star
reactor<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:52.739> what<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.309> point<00:00:53.520> out<00:00:53.699> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
reactor and what I like to point out to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.389 
reactor and what I like to point out to
all<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.239> people<00:00:54.570> out<00:00:54.660> there<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.230> me<00:00:56.190> my

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
didn't and I just fell um that is a bad

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.790 
didn't and I just fell um that is a bad
example<00:01:39.160> of<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.900> to<00:01:41.200> do<00:01:41.380> on<00:01:41.740> this<00:01:42.010> bus<00:01:43.800> it's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
example of what to do on this bus it's

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.859 
example of what to do on this bus it's
kind<00:01:45.010> of<00:01:45.070> hard<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.340> see<00:01:45.670> because<00:01:45.940> it's<00:01:46.330> hard<00:01:46.540> to

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
kind of hard to see because it's hard to

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.450 
kind of hard to see because it's hard to
tape<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:49.060> hard<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.479> film<00:01:50.340> games<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.820> this<00:01:53.460> or

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
tape it's hard to film games on this or

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.620 
tape it's hard to film games on this or
TV<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.250> just<00:01:57.430> got<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:57.610> life<00:01:57.850> anyway<00:01:58.270> so<00:01:58.330> it

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
TV and I just got a life anyway so it

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.060 
TV and I just got a life anyway so it
doesn't<00:01:58.690> really<00:01:58.960> matter<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.350> I<00:01:59.530> just<00:01:59.830> died

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
doesn't really matter that I just died

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.560 
doesn't really matter that I just died
kind<00:02:03.070> of<00:02:03.130> hard<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.369> maneuver<00:02:03.670> yourself<00:02:03.910> when

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
kind of hard to maneuver yourself when

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.980 
kind of hard to maneuver yourself when
you're<00:02:04.810> burnt<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:07.090> he's<00:02:07.450> jumping<00:02:07.869> around

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
you're burnt because he's jumping around

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:17.479 
you're burnt because he's jumping around
and<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:10.270> almost<00:02:10.899> got<00:02:11.230> squashed<00:02:11.650> right<00:02:12.100> there

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.040 

gravity<00:02:18.489> here<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.880> all<00:02:19.060> out<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.239> whack<00:02:19.510> check

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
gravity here is all out of whack check

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.390 
gravity here is all out of whack check
out<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.800> arrows

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400

for you numbskulls out there the arrows
are<00:02:26.489> where<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.540> gravity<00:02:27.989> goes<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.670> see<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
are where the gravity goes you see the

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.240 
are where the gravity goes you see the
pink<00:02:30.150> arrows<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:31.049> means<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.769> gravity

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
pink arrows that means that the gravity

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.910 
pink arrows that means that the gravity
is<00:02:32.540> going<00:02:33.540> down<00:02:34.280> yeah<00:02:36.170> hope<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.500> all<00:02:37.530> know
