00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.370
 There are times when we can anticipate the future and know exactly 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.469
 what is going to happen 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.439
 as a curious fact to tell you that this sixth sense 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:12.929
 only views 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.929
 when we are on high risk occasions 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.679
 the freedom of each strong 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.679
 your own destiny 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.280
 I want to overcome that destiny 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.420
 it is freedom itself 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.420
 but what role does life play? 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.410
 the days 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.710
 the rule regulates the forwards should be stronger 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.900
 1 government house 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.190
 but none 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.850
 not only with you on 2 of this month a coin hand 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.030
 not anybody 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.370
 of the words of more than two hands 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.500
 I'm going to go around 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.210
 I want you to put the coin the wonders when the magazines 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.450
 somehow he tries to know where you are 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.650
 more quickly 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.650
 Perez 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.320
 the rest belong 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 look me in the eyes 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.190
 Andres Iniesta 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.190
 on the other hand more 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 the area of ​​the angels 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 if he is not 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 it is a subject to which it backs 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.440
 I was alone in front of a challenge that I could only overcome 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.400
 if I can calm my mind despite the danger
