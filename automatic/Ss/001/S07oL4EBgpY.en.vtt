and<00:05:18.650> this<00:05:18.889> led<00:05:19.220> us<00:05:19.400> to<00:05:19.639> rethink<00:05:20.419> everything

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
and this led us to rethink everything

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.409 
and this led us to rethink everything
about<00:05:21.500> our<00:05:21.710> process<00:05:22.240> everything<00:05:23.240> about

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
about our process everything about

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.559 
about our process everything about
what's<00:05:23.630> essential<00:05:24.319> to<00:05:24.620> a<00:05:24.650> notebook

what's essential to a notebook

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:28.989 
what's essential to a notebook
and<00:05:26.779> that<00:05:27.199> meant<00:05:27.529> that<00:05:28.159> we<00:05:28.309> could<00:05:28.339> design<00:05:28.639> the

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:28.999 
and that meant that we could design the

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.019 
and that meant that we could design the
very<00:05:29.360> best<00:05:29.689> computer<00:05:30.259> for<00:05:30.439> today<00:05:30.770> and<00:05:31.099> for<00:05:31.999> the

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
very best computer for today and for the

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:38.239 
very best computer for today and for the
