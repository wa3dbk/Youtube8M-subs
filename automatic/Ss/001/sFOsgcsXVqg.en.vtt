00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.540
 hello girls find themselves for a 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.070
 very little video so that buzze a 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.320
 demonstration of the little night light that 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.540
 I bought that is too beautiful too 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.300
 nice so that's the one that's the 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.240
 quiet turtle sacred like that for that 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.990
 it's the little note to go too much 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.920
 beautiful head of small turtles sleeping 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.300
 small shell and small button for 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.280
 light the tents to put 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.050
 music and to choose it actually if 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.410
 we want the projected image to remain 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:48.530
 stable where she's moving and then 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.699
 soul his little belly and the 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.350
 places to put the batteries and a 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.430
 place to actually adjust the intensity 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.120
 of the light that we want I put 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.750
 the intensity of the light thoroughly already he 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.199
 must light it 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.199
 here a lung remake a little belly 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:13.280
 but then we limit it like that 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:17.210
 makes a light like that so I'm going 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.439
 turn off the light progresses so has 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.100
 that's what it does at the level of 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:28.149
 ceiling and wall projections 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.439
 so this is super great bar 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.259
 so we can actually choose whether it's 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:37.579
 in motion a movement like that or 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.869
 fixed and we can if we want to add some 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.289
 music so I'm going to do a little bit 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.289
 streamed 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.369
 so this one is the right music of 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.369
 sea ​​water 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.720
 but second choice 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.420
 hop so by actually stabilizing the image 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.920
 and in fact it makes a music and 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.220
 lights for 23 minutes and after that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.220
 it's you 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.800
 so the best is to put it in a 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.709
 flat place for it to diffuse well 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.260
 on the ceiling and on the walls because 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.140
 no longer want to approach in fact that we have 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.379
 more to spread light near 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.379
 the place 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.710
 what does it look like in the dark black 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.070
 here I hope that my little last 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.230
 station on the quiet turtle has you 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.050
 So I find it too much 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.150
 beautiful this moment i love limiting fine to 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.950
 put in my room 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.050
 and apparently kids love it too 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.670
 so I hope this little demo you 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.180
 liked you big kisses and I 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.180
 tell you very soon
