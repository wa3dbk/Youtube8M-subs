of<00:00:16.170> came<00:00:16.320> up<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.920> don't<00:00:17.340> really<00:00:17.550> know<00:00:17.730> if

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
of came up with I don't really know if

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.460 
of came up with I don't really know if
anyone<00:00:18.119> else<00:00:18.210> uses<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.750> but<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.050> haven't<00:00:19.350> seen

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
anyone else uses this but I haven't seen

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.890 
anyone else uses this but I haven't seen
any<00:00:19.680> other<00:00:19.740> big<00:00:20.160> youtubers<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.779> have

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
any other big youtubers that that have

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.929 
any other big youtubers that that have
tried<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.230> out<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.710> basically<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.519> strategy

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
tried this out so basically the strategy

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.300 
tried this out so basically the strategy
is<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.180> i'm<00:00:24.269> only<00:00:24.420> running<00:00:24.660> UAV<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:26.099> call

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
is that i'm only running UAV and I call

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.400 
is that i'm only running UAV and I call
the<00:00:26.400> strategy<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> unlimited<00:00:27.240> UAV<00:00:27.900> strategy

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the strategy the unlimited UAV strategy

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.349 
the strategy the unlimited UAV strategy
because<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:29.310> you're<00:00:29.490> only<00:00:29.609> running<00:00:29.789> UAV

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
because if you're only running UAV

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.240 
because if you're only running UAV
basically<00:00:31.260> only<00:00:31.439> need<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.710> get<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:31.920> three<00:00:32.160> or

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
basically only need to get like three or

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.590 
basically only need to get like three or
four<00:00:32.309> kills<00:00:32.730> depending<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.510> have

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
four kills depending on if you have

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.389 
four kills depending on if you have
hardline<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.320> if<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.980> capture

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
hardline and if you get like a capture

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.639 
hardline and if you get like a capture
kill<00:00:35.640> or<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> killed<00:00:36.780> attacker<00:00:37.110> or<00:00:37.260> killed

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
kill or a killed attacker or killed

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.860 
kill or a killed attacker or killed
defender<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.340> those<00:00:38.520> things<00:00:38.820> basically<00:00:39.480> it's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
defender all those things basically it's

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.240 
defender all those things basically it's
like<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.989> three<00:00:40.260> or<00:00:40.379> four<00:00:40.590> kill<00:00:40.829> streak<00:00:41.040> though

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
like a three or four kill streak though

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.790 
like a three or four kill streak though
which<00:00:41.610> isn't<00:00:42.000> very<00:00:42.030> hard<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.809> if

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
which isn't very hard to get and if

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.779 
which isn't very hard to get and if
you're<00:00:43.920> getting<00:00:44.129> those<00:00:44.250> skills<00:00:44.550> quickly

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
you're getting those skills quickly

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.549 
you're getting those skills quickly
while<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.420> UAV<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.930> still<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.469> air

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
while your UAV is still up in the air

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.410 
while your UAV is still up in the air
you<00:00:47.250> should<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:47.610> able<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.879> earn<00:00:47.969> another<00:00:48.210> one

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
you should be able to earn another one

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.510 
you should be able to earn another one
really<00:00:48.629> quickly<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.309> basically<00:00:50.309> when<00:00:50.430> i'm

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
really quickly so basically when i'm

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.740 
really quickly so basically when i'm
bringing<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.760> guys<00:00:50.820> today<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.239> two<00:00:51.570> different

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
bringing you guys today is two different

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.290 
bringing you guys today is two different
streaks<00:00:52.199> from<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> same<00:00:52.739> match<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:54.180> in

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
streaks from the same match and I in

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.229 
streaks from the same match and I in
this<00:00:54.449> first<00:00:54.690> week<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.989> get<00:00:55.199> five<00:00:55.379> UAVs<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.239> I

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
this first week I get five UAVs and I

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.520 
this first week I get five UAVs and I
run<00:00:57.390> out<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> ammo<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> pick<00:00:58.440> up

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
run out of ammo so I have to pick up

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.860 
run out of ammo so I have to pick up
multiple<00:00:58.949> weapons<00:00:59.100> but<00:01:00.090> basically<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.660> get

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
multiple weapons but basically I get

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
multiple weapons but basically I get
five<00:01:01.050> UAVs<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> since<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.280> hardline<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
five UAVs and since I have hardline I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.390 
five UAVs and since I have hardline I
think<00:01:03.149> that's<00:01:03.359> about<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:05.280> know<00:01:05.369> like

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
think that's about like you know like

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.030 
think that's about like you know like
2000<00:01:06.180> score<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.600> 1500<00:01:07.229> score<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:07.650> something

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
2000 score or 1500 score or something

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
2000 score or 1500 score or something
i'm<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.340> entirely<00:01:08.580> sure<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:10.229> in

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
i'm not entirely sure but and then in

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.770 
i'm not entirely sure but and then in
the<00:01:10.409> second<00:01:10.740> streak<00:01:10.920> i<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.189> 3<00:01:11.430> UAVs<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.150> my

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the second streak i get 3 UAVs and my

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.510 
the second streak i get 3 UAVs and my
record<00:01:13.170> doing<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> strategy<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.040> actually

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
record doing the strategy is actually

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.359 
record doing the strategy is actually
eight<00:01:14.700> or<00:01:14.880> nine<00:01:15.030> UAVs<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:15.869> life<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
eight or nine UAVs in one life and the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
eight or nine UAVs in one life and the
point<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.790> strategy<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.750> you're<00:01:18.869> not

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
point of this strategy is if you're not

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.260 
point of this strategy is if you're not
good<00:01:19.200> enough<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.740> me<00:01:20.000> personally<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.119> this

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
good enough like me personally in this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.429 
good enough like me personally in this
game<00:01:21.420> i'm<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.810> good<00:01:21.900> enough<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.409> earn

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
game i'm not really good enough to earn

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.109 
game i'm not really good enough to earn
like<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> lodestar<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> dogs<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
like the lodestar on the dogs and the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.480 
like the lodestar on the dogs and the
swarm<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.540> everything<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.530> basically<00:01:26.159> how<00:01:26.460> i

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
swarm and everything so basically how i

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.950 
swarm and everything so basically how i
played<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.909> game<00:01:27.119> now<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.509> only<00:01:27.780> run<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
played this game now is I only run the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.190 
played this game now is I only run the
UAV<00:01:28.500> kill<00:01:28.740> streak<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:31.020> good

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
UAV kill streak and that is really good

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.300 
UAV kill streak and that is really good
because<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:32.009> see<00:01:32.189> where

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
because you know you can see where

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.830 
because you know you can see where
everyone<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:33.030> too<00:01:33.240> many<00:01:33.329> people<00:01:33.689> run

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
everyone is not too many people run

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.350 
everyone is not too many people run
ghost<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.409> game<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.820> been<00:01:36.000> working

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
ghost in this game and it's been working

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
times in one life so basically you can

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.699 
times in one life so basically you can
just<00:02:16.090> keep<00:02:16.269> cycling<00:02:16.689> through<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.049> ticket<00:02:17.530> to

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709

just keep cycling through the ticket to
keep<00:02:18.040> getting<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.430> UAV<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:20.110> works<00:02:20.290> really

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
keep getting the UAV and it works really

keep getting the UAV and it works really
well<00:02:20.620> guys<00:02:20.950> if<00:02:21.159> you<00:02:21.280> have<00:02:21.370> never<00:02:21.459> tried<00:02:21.610> this

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
well guys if you have never tried this

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.240 
well guys if you have never tried this
out<00:02:22.090> just<00:02:22.450> try<00:02:22.659> it<00:02:22.720> out<00:02:22.840> for<00:02:23.079> me<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.409> right

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
out just try it out for me and right

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.920 
out just try it out for me and right
here<00:02:24.280> they<00:02:24.549> have<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.700> counter<00:02:25.000> UAV<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.689> the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
here they have the counter UAV so the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.539 
here they have the counter UAV so the
strategy<00:02:26.110> kind<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:26.950> doesn't<00:02:27.129> work<00:02:27.310> right<00:02:27.489> now

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
strategy kind of doesn't work right now

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.420 
strategy kind of doesn't work right now
but<00:02:28.510> basically<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.260> get<00:02:29.439> five<00:02:29.650> UAVs<00:02:30.099> in<00:02:30.310> this

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
just like running UAV you know it's more

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.910 
just like running UAV you know it's more
fun<00:02:43.599> to<00:02:43.629> me<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.989> get<00:02:44.109> a<00:02:44.140> lot<00:02:44.260> more<00:02:44.290> gun<00:02:44.620> kills

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
fun to me to get a lot more gun kills

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.610 
fun to me to get a lot more gun kills
and<00:02:45.159> just<00:02:45.310> play<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.579> game<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.760> way<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.930> that

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620

and just play the game that way and that
the<00:02:47.709> strategy<00:02:48.099> is<00:02:48.129> just<00:02:48.370> working<00:02:48.640> really<00:02:48.670> good

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
the strategy is just working really good

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.720 
the strategy is just working really good
guys<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.890> let<00:02:50.890> me<00:02:50.980> see<00:02:51.099> what<00:02:51.220> else<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.519> wrote

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
guys and let me see what else I wrote

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.059 
guys and let me see what else I wrote
down<00:02:51.760> um<00:02:53.819> hold<00:02:54.819> on<00:02:54.909> guys<00:02:55.090> um<00:02:55.420> oh<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.739> basically

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
down um hold on guys um oh so basically

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.460 
down um hold on guys um oh so basically
the<00:02:57.190> UAV<00:02:57.519> is<00:02:57.609> a<00:02:57.639> 425<00:02:58.629> scorestreak<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.349> know

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
the UAV is a 425 scorestreak you know

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.440 
the UAV is a 425 scorestreak you know
and<00:02:59.680> I<00:03:00.250> with<00:03:00.400> hardline<00:03:00.849> that's<00:03:01.120> twenty

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
and I with hardline that's twenty

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.030 
and I with hardline that's twenty
percent<00:03:01.750> less<00:03:02.019> so<00:03:02.230> basically<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.739> becomes

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
percent less so basically it becomes

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.300 
percent less so basically it becomes
like<00:03:03.989> 323<00:03:04.989> 30<00:03:05.230> something<00:03:05.650> like<00:03:05.769> that<00:03:05.950> guys<00:03:06.129> so

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
like 323 30 something like that guys so

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.890 
like 323 30 something like that guys so
basically<00:03:06.700> like<00:03:06.849> three<00:03:07.060> kills<00:03:07.299> are<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.599> like<00:03:07.780> I

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
basically like three kills are so like I

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.440 
basically like three kills are so like I
said<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.489> just<00:03:09.489> try<00:03:09.639> the<00:03:09.700> strategy<00:03:10.150> out<00:03:10.239> guys

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
said and just try the strategy out guys

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.330 
said and just try the strategy out guys
you<00:03:10.690> just<00:03:10.930> keep<00:03:11.109> cycling<00:03:11.560> through<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.920> UAVs

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
you just keep cycling through the UAVs

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.430 
you just keep cycling through the UAVs
if<00:03:13.329> you're<00:03:13.540> good<00:03:13.720> enough<00:03:13.750> at<00:03:14.079> the<00:03:14.230> game<00:03:14.409> and
