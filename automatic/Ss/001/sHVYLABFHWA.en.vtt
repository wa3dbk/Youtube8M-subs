00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.640
 I hope everyone is well and in 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.430
 this time I will leave you in the background 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.490
 little of deadly kombat online nothing 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.260
 special is from my first games 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.510
 I'm just learning to play this 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.939
 title the same as the opponents that I 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.970
 I found but good as was generous 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.949
 they start and because this video wanted it 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.220
 occupy to tell them something 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.310
 interesting something that called a lot the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.579
 attention because it's a topic that generates 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.969
 controversy and the genre of nothing is a 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.660
 subject a bit confusing because it turns out that 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:45.340
 in mortal kombat x well it seems that 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.880
 there is a homosexual character 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.490
 it's a strange medium question me when 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.250
 I played the campaign I did not notice it I thought 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.430
 it was a kind of translation error 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.940
 in the dialogues already imagined is something 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.250
 that has happened in many places but one 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.830
 association does not write that it is then according to 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.740
 they noticed in the dialogues that a 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.500
 character implied that it was 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.530
 homosexual because he is talking 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.649
 with reid in and tells him to leave 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.899
 with shaolin monks or before blogs 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.930
 I remember the name well and this one says that 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.479
 they will not accept it but reid in it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.090
 insists that they are only interested in what 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.229
 that contains your heart and not whom 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.759
 want your heart this is a clear 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.800
 reference to a crush 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.910
 as a preference for a person 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.650
 etcetera et cetera but this sentence is not 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.170
 it is taken as something 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.030
 by saying they will not accept me it's as if 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.850
 my preference or who I fell in love with 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.460
 It was frowned upon because I'm leaving 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.930
 this sequence and well you tell me 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.930
 what do you think 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.570
 blood from a side descendant of 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.280
 grab a side a vulgar thief you thought 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.310
 that you could calmly enter my 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.550
 temple and go out again without me 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.550
 consent 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.950
 you wanted me to attack you because for 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.300
 release your anger and be receptive 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.060
 to reason 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.290
 and make me feel like garbage that you 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.970
 hates has always been a part 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.970
 deplorable of your personality 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.600
 there is a brighter path one that 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.970
 will give or not to your ancestors one that 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.480
 it is worthy of you 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.430
 go to the academy cuchi join the link 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.719
 as he did before one side 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.670
 I can not not accept them only 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:55.610
 they are interested in what you have in your heart 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.590
 not here in your heart you want 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.620
 it's late for me 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.739
 Well I left the whole sequence because 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.519
 I feel that there is a lot of background as 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.950
 for nothing else to leave the final part well 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.190
 I could have done nothing else where 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.489
 makes the difference that whoever 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.590
 he wants his heart as if it were something wrong 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.830
 seen and that people are not going to 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.190
 accept but then there are interesting things 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.400
 that it would be worth analyzing because this 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.680
 I would not have reached as much or had not 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.260
 called so much attention if it were not 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.110
 because one of the managers of the game or 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.940
 those who participated in the game 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.910
 via twitter, they did this 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.370
 question and he replies that then he 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.829
 it's nice to see that they have fans so 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.680
 observers hinting at what 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.239
 is that observation or that assumption of 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.520
 the people are something true then 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.010
 what this character says of what 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.020
 they will not accept to go to understand that 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.690
 it is frowned upon what you want your 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.500
 who wants your heart for they take it 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.000
 immediately as something homosexual but 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.280
 Not only loving relationships 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.980
 homosexuals are bad views what happens if 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.830
 it was a romeo and julieta type story 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:24.270
 what happens is call someone from the side 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:27.480
 opposite what happens is called for example 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.530
 some family etc. etcetera things 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.100
 that are also badly seen at the level 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.890
 relationship 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.950
 it will depend on the taboos of each 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.500
 person but does not mean that nothing 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.500
 more due to the fact that they do not accept 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.920
 what is in your heart you want 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.530
 it automatically has to be a 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.750
 homosexual relationship however 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.810
 remember that the homosexual theme 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.150
 inside the video games so little 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.120
 little by little it becomes more common begins to have 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.460
 more weight characters like in grand theft 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.280
 4 car gay ballad 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.889
 and between the troops with him and he had a 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.050
 story very well made for 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.259
 justify his homosexuality and in fact 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.750
 when you play in that part of him or 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.349
 you even see it as something bad catches you 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.110
 the story you want to know more but by 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:24.389
 what causes this mode for evil but then 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.810
 there are also the cases of characters 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:30.720
 who are accused of homosexuality 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.389
 to draw attention that people 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.509
 put your eyes on those titles in 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.430
 special that they start talking about it 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.099
 just as I am doing in this 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.020
 video a lot of people will do it in others or in 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.289
 forums internet sites and so on 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.840
 etcetera the joke is to draw attention 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.900
 of the people so to give you more 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.500
 advertising to the game as they say there is no 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.220
 bad advertising there is only advertising 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.910
 and if this were the case that this 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.070
 true character is homosexual 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.860
 would change the way you see the game of 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.620
 people at least in one case do not not 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.310
 I see something relevant the game is still 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.260
 very good that character although I do not 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.750
 like your style or rather it has not 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.770
 accommodated yet I'm sorry a good 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.259
 something different 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.849
 the character looks good enough so that 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:27.340
 someone wants to dominate it 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:31.599
 but have homosexual preferences 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.849
 or not, I just do not see it 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:37.300
 relevant but good me with this I 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:40.240
 near the end of this video this is 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.870
 something that I love very much my attention I do not know 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.750
 that you think about it if this 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.020
 can create a lot of controversial people in favor 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.120
 or against, you know how people are already 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.870
 you know how internet is there are people 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.409
 tolerant 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.690
 there are people who just are not good 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:01.300
 thank you very much keep an eye on the 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:04.259
 next things and see you in another 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.259
 chance
