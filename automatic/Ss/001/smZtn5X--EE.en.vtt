almost a bigger state and dance you know

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.990 
almost a bigger state and dance you know
what<00:02:51.800> I<00:02:51.860> mean<00:02:52.010> they're<00:02:52.160> just<00:02:52.190> they're<00:02:52.970> just

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
what I mean they're just they're just

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.180 
what I mean they're just they're just
tapped<00:02:53.450> off<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.500> looks<00:02:54.680> like<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:54.980> can't

tapped off and it looks like you can't

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.740 
tapped off and it looks like you can't
even<00:02:55.370> get<00:02:55.550> him<00:02:55.670> off<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:55.880> there<00:02:56.060> when<00:02:56.570> they're

even get him off of there when they're

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.900 
even get him off of there when they're
you<00:02:56.840> theoretically<00:02:57.380> there's<00:02:58.160> no<00:02:58.340> reason<00:02:58.760> why

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
you theoretically there's no reason why

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.370 
you theoretically there's no reason why
they<00:02:59.090> should<00:02:59.330> be<00:02:59.360> able<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.720> fail<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.200> bull

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
they should be able to fail that bull

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.410 
they should be able to fail that bull
it's<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:01.010> gravity<00:03:01.250> they<00:03:01.640> get<00:03:01.790> in<00:03:01.940> grab<00:03:02.120> it<00:03:02.330> and

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
it's a gravity they get in grab it and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.540 
it's a gravity they get in grab it and
get<00:03:02.570> in<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.780> bubble<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.230> they're<00:03:03.740> 90<00:03:04.070> points

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
get in the bubble and they're 90 points

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.430 
get in the bubble and they're 90 points
that's<00:03:04.880> what<00:03:05.090> bull<00:03:05.240> riding<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.630> me<00:03:05.810> is<00:03:06.110> all
