now let's practice on the board put the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.010 
now let's practice on the board put the
point<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.759> needle<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.149> contact<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.690 
dot that you made on the suture board
now<00:01:15.630> gently<00:01:16.200> rotate<00:01:16.620> your<00:01:16.770> hand<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
now gently rotate your hand so that the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.730 
now gently rotate your hand so that the
tip<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.150> needle<00:01:18.300> will<00:01:18.690> follow<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.110> curving

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
tip of the needle will follow a curving

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.130 
tip of the needle will follow a curving
motion<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.520> replicates<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.330> curve<00:01:21.600> built

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
motion that replicates the curve built

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.190 
motion that replicates the curve built
into<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> needle<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:24.330> needle<00:01:24.659> comes<00:01:24.960> out

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
into the needle as the needle comes out

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.620 
into the needle as the needle comes out
of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> phone<00:01:25.710> rotate<00:01:26.580> further<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.420> two
