00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:19.220
 the subject of this film are the 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.840
 carnivorous plants in the 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.550
 Technical language is called the 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.530
 extraordinary plants carnivores 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 With funny tricks you bait yours 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.400
 booty once in a while there is for 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.120
 insect spiders and other small animals 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.430
 no escape 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.180
 but why do carnivores eat at all? 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.750
 meat which distinguishes them from 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.750
 planting others 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.840
 carnivores grow mainly in warm 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.239
 temperate zones as well as in tropical areas 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.800
 high mountains on nutrient-poor places 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:07.280
 such as in moors on sand surfaces 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.190
 on water surfaces or on trees 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.680
 Her root-work is very resistant 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.630
 against the difficult soil conditions 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.850
 however , it is poorly formed 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.399
 as the carnivorous plants 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.680
 mainly feed on their leaves 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.470
 they relate the necessities of life 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.840
 Minerals such as nitrogen or iron 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.840
 Potassium from your animal prey 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.060
 nevertheless carnivores operate like all 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.310
 plant photosynthesis only 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.710
 limited as her leaves in the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.970
 compared to normal leaves only 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.240
 bad for it 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.310
 therefore carnivores need extra 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.649
 a lot of light and water around the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.800
 photosynthesis at least a little bit 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.380
 to gain energy 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.050
 Depending on the species , the meat hungry 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.450
 plant different starting methods 1 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.830
 Let's look at the three most common ones 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.289
 types fall closer to type 1 the club 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.690
 cases 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.300
 she is one of the best known 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.260
 rarest species and is only from the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.350
 waterfalls and the Venus trap used 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.300
 the two halves of the venous trap 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.239
 feature on their inside threw one 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.220
 full of hair 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.040
 as soon as an insect either one of these 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.620
 feel more or more 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.970
 Hair strips within 30 seconds 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.880
 close the leaves lightning fast 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.260
 through this irritation restriction works 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.580
 the trap only for worthwhile loot 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.250
 then the carnivore separates 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.500
 Digestive secretion from and digests the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.800
 animal prey within one to 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.690
 about two weeks left over 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.390
 indigestible remnants type 2 the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.100
 Cling Traps the best known representatives 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.080
 This trip is the sun dew plants 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.720
 these plants but over tiny ones 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.300
 glands on their leaves or out of the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.740
 tips of her tentacles a fragrant 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.020
 Secretly the insect attracts these 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.010
 stay with the replica of that 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.800
 glue droplets 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.810
 trying to get free again 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.230
 their predicament worsens 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.330
 nor the insect dies either 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.280
 exhaustion or stifling at the 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.650
 sticky substance of whalers of 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.780
 Sundew enzymes from the prey 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.080
 slowly decompose and those in it 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.120
 releasing nutrients 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.920
 this is a passive one 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:53.730
 Kleptalle catch some sundew species 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.130
 their prey but also actively they react 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.100
 on the egg whites and the movements of the 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.800
 Insects automatically lead their others 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.930
 tentacles towards the bodywork until the 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:12.810
 finish the leaf all around the prey 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:15.060
 wrapped type 3 the pitfalls trap 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.919
 This type of fall can be found in the 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.980
 kernel shrubs or the 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.260
 hose plants form their leaves 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.950
 a mostly long funnel-shaped 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.919
 cavity 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.639
 in it is a nectar of the 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.440
 Booty lures the fly sits up 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.450
 the maw of the plant and slips 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.970
 at the same time down her smooth edge 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.110
 into the digestive system filled with gastric juice 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.419
 chamber the prey can neither the smooth 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.180
 high with wax coated inner wall 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.419
 still crawl due to the hose shape 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.130
 They also run away drowning in the sour 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.130
 gastric juice and is dissolved 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.660
 Some can be up to five 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.310
 liter of digestive liquid and 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.310
 even eat a mouse 

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:07.149
 which fall art also comes to use 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:11.520
 the animal victims rarely have one 

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:11.520
 chance against the cunning green robbers
