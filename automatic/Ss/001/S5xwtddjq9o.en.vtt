00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
pollak biology video this time we're

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.079 
pollak biology video this time we're
looking<00:00:04.140> at<00:00:04.380> gas<00:00:04.589> exchange<00:00:04.859> insects<00:00:05.460> from<00:00:05.640> aq

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
looking at gas exchange insects from aq

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.770 
looking at gas exchange insects from aq
AAS<00:00:06.540> level<00:00:06.930> unit<00:00:07.290> two<00:00:07.790> as<00:00:08.790> our<00:00:09.120> objectives

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
AAS level unit two as our objectives

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.299 
AAS level unit two as our objectives
we're<00:00:09.990> going<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.230> understand<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.889> structure

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
we're going to understand the structure

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.549 
we're going to understand the structure
of<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.550> tracheal<00:00:11.969> system<00:00:12.290> we're<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.469> to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
of the tracheal system we're going to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.230 
of the tracheal system we're going to
describe<00:00:13.980> how<00:00:14.280> insects<00:00:14.670> ventilate

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
describe how insects ventilate

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240 
describe how insects ventilate
themselves<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.929> we're<00:00:16.470> going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.650> identify<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
themselves and we're going to identify a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.250 
themselves and we're going to identify a
couple<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.760> limitations<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.900> tracheal

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
couple of limitations of the tracheal

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.269 
couple of limitations of the tracheal
system<00:00:19.850> so<00:00:20.850> here's<00:00:21.029> our<00:00:21.180> model<00:00:21.449> insect<00:00:22.279> mainly

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
system so here's our model insect mainly

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.269 
system so here's our model insect mainly
we<00:00:23.400> use<00:00:23.430> locusts<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.330> biology<00:00:25.279> because

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
we use locusts in biology because

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.890 
we use locusts in biology because
they're<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> great<00:00:27.000> example<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> an<00:00:27.570> insect

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
they're a great example of an insect

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.929 
they're a great example of an insect
they've<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> small<00:00:28.500> surface<00:00:28.949> area<00:00:29.310> they've

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
they've got a small surface area they've

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.630 
they've got a small surface area they've
got<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> relatively<00:00:30.630> large<00:00:30.990> volume<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.830> that's

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
got a relatively large volume so that's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.360 
got a relatively large volume so that's
a<00:00:32.820> small<00:00:33.570> surface<00:00:34.050> area<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.380> volume<00:00:34.410> ratio<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
a small surface area to volume ratio and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.119 
a small surface area to volume ratio and
they<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.820> no<00:00:36.059> transport<00:00:36.750> system<00:00:37.170> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
they have no transport system and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.280 
they have no transport system and
because<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.460> these<00:00:38.700> reasons<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:39.750> need<00:00:39.780> an

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
because of these reasons they need an

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.280 
because of these reasons they need an
exchange<00:00:41.040> system<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:42.180> takes<00:00:42.450> oxygen

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
exchange system that takes oxygen

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.049 
exchange system that takes oxygen
directly<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:44.340> their<00:00:44.550> tissues<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:46.910> thus<00:00:47.910> we

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
directly to their tissues and thus we

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.850 
directly to their tissues and thus we
have<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.690> tracheal<00:00:49.050> system<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.590> we'll<00:00:49.710> get

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
have the tracheal system but we'll get

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.369 
have the tracheal system but we'll get
to<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.270> here's<00:00:51.270> our<00:00:51.480> insect<00:00:51.899> again<00:00:52.199> our

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to that here's our insect again our

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.110 
to that here's our insect again our
friendly<00:00:52.800> locust<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.399> got<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> couple<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.940> key

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
friendly locust it's got a couple of key

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.400 
friendly locust it's got a couple of key
feeds<00:00:54.420> which<00:00:54.629> should<00:00:54.750> look<00:00:54.930> at<00:00:55.050> here's<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
feeds which should look at here's the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.990 
feeds which should look at here's the
head<00:00:55.620> that's<00:00:55.829> pretty<00:00:56.100> obvious<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.850> some

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
head that's pretty obvious here are some

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.330 
head that's pretty obvious here are some
wings<00:00:57.239> they're<00:00:57.690> pretty<00:00:57.960> cool<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> bits

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
wings they're pretty cool but the bits

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.400 
wings they're pretty cool but the bits
we<00:00:59.520> need<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.730> know<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.390> are<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.840> abdomen

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
we need to know really are the abdomen

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
we need to know really are the abdomen
which<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> back<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
which is this bit at the back here and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.759 
which is this bit at the back here and
the<00:01:03.149> thorax<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> chest<00:01:04.290> which<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.680> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the thorax or the chest which is this

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.010 
the thorax or the chest which is this
bit<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> middle<00:01:05.420> now<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.659> look<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
bit in the middle now if we look at a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.200 
bit in the middle now if we look at a
cross-section<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.830> inside<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.640> insect<00:01:09.000> we

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
cross-section of inside this insect we

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.700 
cross-section of inside this insect we
can<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.510> how<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.780> tracheal<00:01:10.229> system<00:01:10.439> is

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
can see how the tracheal system is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.910 
can see how the tracheal system is
broken<00:01:10.950> down<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> tricky<00:01:13.080> whether

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
broken down we have the tricky whether

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.310 
broken down we have the tricky whether
it<00:01:14.100> true<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.700> tracheas<00:01:15.299> down<00:01:15.659> either<00:01:15.930> side<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
it true to tracheas down either side of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.580 
it true to tracheas down either side of
the<00:01:16.500> insects<00:01:16.890> body<00:01:17.450> we<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.110> trachea

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
the insects body we have the trachea

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.370 
the insects body we have the trachea
which<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:20.159> smaller<00:01:20.549> branch<00:01:21.000> tubes<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
which are smaller branch tubes and the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.920 
which are smaller branch tubes and the
take<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.220> oxygen<00:01:23.939> directly<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> muscle

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
take the oxygen directly to the muscle

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.749 
take the oxygen directly to the muscle
tissues<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> outside<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
tissues and then on the outside of the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.640 
tissues and then on the outside of the
body<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.360> sphericals<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.470> are<00:01:28.619> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
body we have sphericals which are a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.410 
body we have sphericals which are a
little<00:01:28.860> bit<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.130> stomata<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.850> plants

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
little bit like stomata in plants

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420 
little bit like stomata in plants
let's<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> look<00:01:31.650> at<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.159> bit

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
let's have a look at this a little bit

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.800 
let's have a look at this a little bit
closer<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:34.040> we<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.430> spherical<00:01:35.939> again

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
closer here we have the spherical again

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.569 
closer here we have the spherical again
look<00:01:37.020> how<00:01:37.140> similar<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.799> us<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.430> us

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
look how similar it is to us to us

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.270 
look how similar it is to us to us
tomorrow<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:39.299> stoma<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.930> plants<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
tomorrow or stoma in plants that's to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.030 
tomorrow or stoma in plants that's to
control<00:01:41.700> water<00:01:41.909> loss<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.450> we'll<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> that

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
control water loss but we'll get to that

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.830 
control water loss but we'll get to that
here's<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.280> trachea<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.939> main<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.810> main

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
here's the trachea the main the main

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.499 
here's the trachea the main the main
oxygen<00:01:46.320> carrying<00:01:46.950> tube<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:48.329> are<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
oxygen carrying tube here are the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.810 
oxygen carrying tube here are the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
trachea look how they branch towards the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.149 
trachea look how they branch towards the
muscle<00:01:51.329> fibers<00:01:51.720> now<00:01:52.500> at<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> bottom<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.070> those

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
muscle fibers now at the bottom of those

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.010 
muscle fibers now at the bottom of those
tracheas<00:01:53.759> there<00:01:54.000> will<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.270> small<00:01:54.630> amount<00:01:54.840> of

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
tracheas there will be a small amount of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
tracheas there will be a small amount of
fluid<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> oxygen<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.159> dissolve<00:01:56.460> in

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
fluid that the oxygen can dissolve in

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.520 
fluid that the oxygen can dissolve in
and<00:01:56.880> thus<00:01:57.060> make<00:01:57.450> diffusion<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> muscle

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and thus make diffusion to the muscle

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.600 
and thus make diffusion to the muscle
fibers<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.070> little<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.640> easier<00:02:00.119> um<00:02:01.460> but<00:02:02.460> how

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
fibers a little bit easier um but how

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.670 
fibers a little bit easier um but how
does<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.939> insect<00:02:03.689> actually<00:02:04.049> ventilate<00:02:04.560> its

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
does the insect actually ventilate its

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.429 
does the insect actually ventilate its
body<00:02:04.920> well<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.880> pumps<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.360> abdomen<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
body well it pumps the abdomen in and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.279 
body well it pumps the abdomen in and
out<00:02:07.619> which<00:02:08.009> draws<00:02:08.340> air<00:02:08.670> into<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.509> out<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
out which draws air into and out of the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.600 
out which draws air into and out of the
trachy<00:02:10.770> via<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.580> spiracles

trachy via the spiracles

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.150 
trachy via the spiracles
now<00:02:13.880> air<00:02:14.120> moves<00:02:14.510> into<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.410> trachea<00:02:15.650> lung

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
now air moves into the trachea lung

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.400 
now air moves into the trachea lung
there<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.730> arrives<00:02:17.180> directly<00:02:17.870> at<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.080> muscle

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
there and arrives directly at the muscle

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.850 
there and arrives directly at the muscle
tissue<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:20.390> really<00:02:20.900> really<00:02:21.110> simple<00:02:21.470> system

why<00:02:24.860> aren't<00:02:25.310> insects<00:02:25.820> bigger<00:02:26.240> well<00:02:27.020> this<00:02:27.230> is

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
why aren't insects bigger well this is

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.810 
why aren't insects bigger well this is
to<00:02:27.500> do<00:02:27.650> with<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.950> limitations<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.730> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
to do with the limitations of the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.760 
to do with the limitations of the

we<00:02:31.460> get<00:02:31.610> bigger<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.120> bigger<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.660> bigger<00:02:32.840> we

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
we get bigger and bigger and bigger we

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.400 
we get bigger and bigger and bigger we
find<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.830> we<00:02:34.280> have<00:02:34.430> more<00:02:34.640> cells<00:02:35.080> more<00:02:36.080> cells

find that we have more cells more cells

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.080 
find that we have more cells more cells
means<00:02:36.710> more<00:02:37.010> demand<00:02:37.370> for<00:02:37.460> oxygen<00:02:37.640> for

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
means more demand for oxygen for

you<00:02:54.260> know<00:02:54.350> insects<00:02:54.860> could<00:02:55.130> be<00:02:55.310> bigger<00:02:55.520> but

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
you know insects could be bigger but

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.940 
you know insects could be bigger but

as it is it simply can't happen also as

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.800 
as it is it simply can't happen also as
we<00:03:01.820> get<00:03:01.970> bigger<00:03:02.180> than<00:03:02.390> mass<00:03:02.570> of<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
exoskeleton increases and that would

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.540 
exoskeleton increases and that would
cause<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.660> insect<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.140> be<00:03:06.590> able<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.860> move<00:03:07.190> less

cause the insect to be able to move less

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.610 
cause the insect to be able to move less

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.660 
with all those holes along the side the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
sphericals so they have to limit water

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.520 
sphericals so they have to limit water
loss<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.209> what<00:03:20.630> they<00:03:20.750> do<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.050> they<00:03:21.200> close

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
loss and what they do is they close

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.470 
loss and what they do is they close
spiracles<00:03:22.070> as<00:03:22.190> often<00:03:22.730> as<00:03:22.850> they<00:03:23.000> can<00:03:23.030> to

spiracles as often as they can to

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.540 
spiracles as often as they can to
minimize<00:03:23.660> water<00:03:24.170> loss<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.950> they<00:03:25.130> have<00:03:25.250> hairs

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
minimize water loss and they have hairs

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.580 
minimize water loss and they have hairs
around<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.060> spiracles<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.690> trap<00:03:26.930> humid<00:03:27.410> air

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
around the spiracles to trap humid air

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.040 
around the spiracles to trap humid air
which<00:03:28.310> therefore<00:03:28.640> results<00:03:29.330> in<00:03:29.450> less<00:03:29.630> water

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
which therefore results in less water

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.300 
which therefore results in less water
loss<00:03:31.209> also<00:03:32.209> what<00:03:32.870> they<00:03:33.050> will<00:03:33.200> do<00:03:33.410> is<00:03:33.620> they<00:03:34.040> if

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
loss also what they will do is they if

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.949 
loss also what they will do is they if
they<00:03:34.610> need<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.790> close<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.269> spiracles<00:03:35.750> for<00:03:35.930> a

air sacs along the trachea which allow
them<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.030> stall<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.480> small<00:03:41.900> amount<00:03:42.110> of<00:03:42.290> oxygen

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
them to stall a small amount of oxygen

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.070 
them to stall a small amount of oxygen
just<00:03:43.340> in<00:03:43.489> case<00:03:43.670> they<00:03:43.910> can't<00:03:44.330> ventilate<00:03:44.780> for

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
just in case they can't ventilate for

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.320 
just in case they can't ventilate for
whatever<00:03:45.200> reason<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.580> let's<00:03:46.760> summarize<00:03:46.970> this

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
whatever reason so let's summarize this

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.900 
whatever reason so let's summarize this
whole<00:03:47.390> thing<00:03:47.840> it's<00:03:48.260> not<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.650> great<00:03:49.160> massive

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
whole thing it's not a great massive

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
long as you know that the tracheal

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.090 
long as you know that the tracheal
system<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.600> series<00:03:53.959> of<00:03:53.989> tubes<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.620> supply

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
system is a series of tubes that supply

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.050 
system is a series of tubes that supply
the<00:03:55.160> muscles<00:03:55.700> with<00:03:55.910> oxygen<00:03:56.300> directly<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:58.580> if

the muscles with oxygen directly and if
you<00:03:59.209> know<00:03:59.360> that<00:03:59.600> pumping<00:04:00.019> of<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.140> abdomen

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
you know that pumping of the abdomen

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.070 
you know that pumping of the abdomen
ventilates<00:04:01.070> the<00:04:01.220> body<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:02.150> sphericals<00:04:02.780> open
