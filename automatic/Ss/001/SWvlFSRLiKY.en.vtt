edification and that combined with an

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.000 
edification and that combined with an
extra<00:00:47.539> third<00:00:47.839> element<00:00:48.109> but<00:00:48.589> I<00:00:48.649> don't<00:00:48.859> think

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
extra third element but I don't think

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.410 
extra third element but I don't think
anyone's<00:00:49.429> ever<00:00:49.550> really<00:00:49.909> been<00:00:50.030> able<00:00:50.179> to

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
anyone's ever really been able to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.049 
anyone's ever really been able to
describe<00:00:50.839> and<00:00:51.229> that<00:00:52.039> really<00:00:52.309> lends<00:00:52.579> a<00:00:52.729> lot<00:00:52.760> of

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
describe and that really lends a lot of

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.840 
describe and that really lends a lot of
its<00:00:53.539> magic<00:00:53.929> to<00:00:54.139> but<00:00:54.769> I<00:00:54.799> guess<00:00:55.249> the<00:00:55.429> best<00:00:55.609> way<00:00:55.789> to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
its magic to but I guess the best way to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.299 
its magic to but I guess the best way to
describe<00:00:56.149> it<00:00:56.359> as<00:00:56.420> a<00:00:56.449> sense<00:00:56.719> of<00:00:56.809> community

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
describe it as a sense of community
