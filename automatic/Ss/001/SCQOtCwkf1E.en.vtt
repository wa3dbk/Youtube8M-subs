 on the assembly line of the largest factory of the italian automaker fiat and in the world in the 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.230
 Betim neighbor city of Belo Horizonte 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.870
 the effort of man to join the precision of huge robberies 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.070
 between highs 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.550
 and the billions of reais invested in machinery 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.039
 the workers produce about a quarter of the cars sold in the country 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.140
 and there's a car 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.080
 only in 2007 Brazilians bought almost two million and a half 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.960
 automobiles 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.250
 a record that helped Fiat to bill more than $ 13 billion 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.840
 and stand out in the sector that has become a symbol of the current phase of consumption 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.839
 accelerated and fat credit 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.660
 the ability to turn opportunity into high results 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.179
 made fiat and the best company of the year in the best and biggest prize 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.849
 in recognition of the names of the companies most relevant to the 

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:54.920
 national economy 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.370
 this fiat arrival and to the top of the list of successful companies so good 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.879
 measured by the precedent decisions of the company-- cledorvino belini the first 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.550
 Brazilian to administer fiat 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.360
 since she settled in the country 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.070
 were choices such as renewing the product line 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.170
 which helped the company achieve the best rate of profitability in the industry and 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.820
 to the network and its finances 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.860
 one of the great achievements not only last year were precisely 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.430
 keep pace with the market 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.820
 the wing imos at the front in terms of increase of productive capacity 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 creation of the third shift 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.270
 what we 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.350
 provided 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.990
 at the moment our market share reached almost 26% of the market 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.150
 Brazilian 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.390
 I assume with market leadership and especially also launching new 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.899
 products on the market 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.770
 mainly I or not a new bull that we launched from cassano really 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.000
 a great success in the Brazilian market 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.270
 after getting back on track and being recognized for it 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.200
 the company has as its latest challenge a counter-attack in the same currency 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.840
 with the launching of new products by traditional competitors such as 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.920
 volkswagen nothing that shakes but the confidence of the main executive of the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.999
 company's ability to grow even more 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:16.700
 the Brazilian dog domestic marker has enormous potential 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.909
 just see that we have one car for every eight inhabitants 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.319
 while in Europe as to put one car for every 1 thousand inhabitants 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.070
 so we have a very large pent-up demand 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.349
 at brazil level 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.669
 exists at the moment one with the increase of the power of income and the 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:39.560
 class c of class b this has really accelerated there is the demand for 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.609
 automobiles 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.330
 the risk is that this new increased a lot of interest 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.279
 stand on your foot 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.090
 in this period increase inflation 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.160
 lower purchasing power is undoubtedly a risk of 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.260
 the growth rate we believe that Brazil understood there is a growth 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.030
 in the automotive sector and we expect that by 2010 we will be 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.150
 pressed the so-dreamed 5 million of the whole month for the domestic market
