00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.379
 all this efe 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.119
 that occurred on the eve 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.539
 there are still cultures mostly in america 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.119
 as a novelty 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.140
 I would like to say that there is mobility 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.880
 the united states trade 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.070
 it's a problem 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.270
 and since then 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.310
 This sheet 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.310
 the governor 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.450
 as expressed 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.880
 one hundred percent 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 but of course it is not like that 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.530
 at least 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.860
 for rossi j 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.390
 does not reach 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.390
 of course these lares 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.550
 no no 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.730
 organizers 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.730
 had not been successful society 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.350
 and the energy 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.830
 the aggressor 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.030
 it does 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.470
 a vega but empty eye 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.860
 villa and towers 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.910
 they can use their private plots 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.220
 but low 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.670
 obama 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.670
 who knows 2010 all of us 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.220
 the left 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.180
 same 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.440
 this one heeded 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.440
 the party forward the system 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.880
 He talked about the whole house 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.410
 very excited 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.520
 everywhere 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.940
 the litigation 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.940
 in hundreds of soldiers 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.460
 yes yes xii your 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.710
 g 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.970
 I like it 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.010
 the ine 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.050
 two 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.889
 earthquakes 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.889
 those promotions 10 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.599
 2 all of them 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.909
 thanks to the popular but I think there are no more bites because 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.929
 a success but good there we will be and in the afternoon 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:14.089
 he continued to the days with a talk on food sovereignty 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.889
 it was about him combined altitude 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:47.079
 given the sales days and a cataclysm - they will stop at the construction of a 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.139
 social movement to sustain command maybe is not sovereignty 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:52.929
 food is being lost 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:55.449
 and he is losing 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.429
 him what to go out and culture and nutrition for the policies 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.980
 agrarias silva meza is where it is at the moment nor is it 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.280
 expo agriculture 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.359
 so 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.849
 globalization has started to peta for agriculture and I say everything until 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.049
 in the middle 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.850
 because the myth of the model is showing the limits 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.919
 I experienced it from this nature 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.219
 and the activity of the man who most worries all this agriculture 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:20.940
 acting food to produce kilocalories 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.819
 p in dryland consume them 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.059
 ain irrigated in consumption 4 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.669
 in freedom between greenhouses 120 then we are very dependent 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.589
 energetically oil iron all these finish we're all going to go to the 

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:38.580
 Green chemistry and agrofuels is just the beginning of what's coming 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.099
 I do not think there are two themes 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.189
 which are the ones that can modify us 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.699
 certainly transgenics supermarkets or we are not going to a workshop or 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.940
 a talk or whatever about supermarket 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.290
 has a lot of new people and with more action-hungry contributions the 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.699
 consumption at the end and trade is a political battle 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.180
 the former director of deaths 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.360
 is the institute on food and development policies 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.280
 with a radical position especially in a context in united states of 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.020
 together looking for how to sell the product and expand the market through the 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.550
 big chains 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.499
 melgar 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:16.990
 percent 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.550
 it was scarce 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.469
 problems the ship fell 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:21.599
 what 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.849
 The Ministry of the Interior will not bring more benefits 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.389
 more peasants 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.530
 this vox for 100 pesos sell through the big campaign or police 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.809
 inscribed 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:34.770
 forced to accept 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.699
 just two months ago stores 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.729
 but they only up to 6 percent 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.499
 despite the fact that legally 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:46.509
 it was incorporated as a policy the new change the market percent 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.759
 I would say that we do not act like capitalism as some said 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.419
 entered the fair trade room ed did not want to raise the price 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.349
 because to raise the price 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:59.169
 they could not participate 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.240
 in the sale in the big chains the big chains all the hotel maracay 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.220
 then to quantify sales while keeping prices low 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.100
 clear the peasants hit the scream laughs we are here and they put us 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.200
 Equal weight equal 18 years also had to anoint their pesitos guessed 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.930
 there is no investigation to deliver it to alp it seems 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.100
 his impression and still 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.210
 they asked for 15 cents of dollars they gave 5 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.289
 you make it happen good obviously 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.919
 Efron is not democratic 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.840
 but I think we have a rough confrontation here 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.669
 the division leader and the clash of paradigms 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:41.370
 obviously hour on the wall and I market and other 1 paradigm of change 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.040
 Social 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.839
 the social movements 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:47.919
 one or believes that the world changes through the market touch with world changes to 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.899
 through the intentions of the people the feeling of the people and the 

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:54.710
 political positions of the people and instead of transformer 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.419
 the conventional market 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:59.419
 the market started the session in which he seized 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.360
 we demand taste I do not want to generalize too much because there are many 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.559
 organizations 

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:09.169
 who trade in vienne mp fair trade 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.059
 is 100% fair trade for example 

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:16.309
 and they have fought very hard and have good relationships and pay much better 

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:18.219
 The minimum price 

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:21.219
 but they are a minority 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.889
 takashi creates let's end these interesting pantries days 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:35.899
