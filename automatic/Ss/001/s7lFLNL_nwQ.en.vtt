hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.249 
hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:03.000> we're<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.540> talk<00:00:03.659> about<00:00:03.689> how<00:00:04.230> to

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
segment we're going to talk about how to

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.099 
segment we're going to talk about how to
grow<00:00:04.529> lucky<00:00:05.130> bamboo<00:00:05.540> now<00:00:06.540> lucky<00:00:06.899> bamboo

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
grow lucky bamboo now lucky bamboo

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.589 
grow lucky bamboo now lucky bamboo
really<00:00:07.740> isn't<00:00:07.980> even<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.700> bamboo<00:00:08.880> it's<00:00:09.450> a

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
really isn't even a bamboo it's a

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.039 
really isn't even a bamboo it's a
Dracaena<00:00:10.230> it's<00:00:11.040> more<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.550> house<00:00:11.820> plant<00:00:12.210> so

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
Dracaena it's more of a house plant so

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.930 
Dracaena it's more of a house plant so
it<00:00:13.170> grows<00:00:13.320> very<00:00:13.740> different<00:00:14.309> from<00:00:14.519> bamboo

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
it grows very different from bamboo

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.870 
it grows very different from bamboo
bamboo<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.719> grow<00:00:15.900> outside<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.980> full<00:00:17.580> hot<00:00:17.850> Sun

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
bamboo can grow outside in full hot Sun

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.960 
bamboo can grow outside in full hot Sun
and<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:19.199> grows<00:00:19.380> like<00:00:19.710> grass<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.070> multiplies

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
and it grows like grass and multiplies

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.330 
and it grows like grass and multiplies
whereas<00:00:21.750> lucky<00:00:22.199> bamboo<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.830> more<00:00:23.160> like<00:00:23.310> a

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
whereas lucky bamboo is more like a

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.400 
whereas lucky bamboo is more like a
house<00:00:23.670> plant<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.180> grows<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> jungles<00:00:25.230> of

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
house plant it grows in the jungles of

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.099 
house plant it grows in the jungles of
the<00:00:25.470> tropics<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.939> does<00:00:27.090> not<00:00:27.210> like<00:00:27.539> full<00:00:27.869> hot

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the tropics so it does not like full hot

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.769 
the tropics so it does not like full hot
Sun<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.769> will<00:00:28.830> get<00:00:29.010> sunburned<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.510> best

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
Sun it will get sunburned so it's best

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.440 
Sun it will get sunburned so it's best
to<00:00:30.960> put<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.410> part<00:00:31.769> shade<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> house

easy<00:00:45.809> way<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> grow<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.399> water

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
easy way to grow it is right in water

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.880 
easy way to grow it is right in water
you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.210> start<00:00:48.539> them<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:49.320> from<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.620> little

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
you can start them just from a little

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.770 
you can start them just from a little
start<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.399> put<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.940> water<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.360> it'll

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
start you just put it in water and it'll

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.170 
start you just put it in water and it'll
grow<00:00:51.989> roots<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.160> leave<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.610> water<00:00:53.879> or

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
grow roots you can leave it in water or

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.850 
grow roots you can leave it in water or
you<00:00:54.449> could<00:00:54.629> put<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.899> right<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.260> soil<00:00:55.590> either

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860

you could put it right in soil either
way<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.399> it'll<00:00:56.550> grow<00:00:56.789> really<00:00:57.090> well<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> lot

way and it'll grow really well so a lot

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.080 
way and it'll grow really well so a lot
of<00:00:58.500> times<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.949> buy<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.370> from<00:00:59.699> these<00:00:59.910> little

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
of times you buy them from these little

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.619 
of times you buy them from these little
stems<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.949> particular<00:01:02.309> plant<00:01:03.059> I've<00:01:03.390> had

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
stems and this particular plant I've had

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.230 
stems and this particular plant I've had
for<00:01:03.960> about<00:01:03.989> five<00:01:04.470> years<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.939> put<00:01:06.150> it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
for about five years and I put it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.179 
for about five years and I put it
outside<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.229> summer<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.100> I

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
outside for the summer and then I

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.730 
outside for the summer and then I
brought<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.580> back<00:01:08.729> inside<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.439> had<00:01:10.560> gotten

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
brought it back inside and it had gotten

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.590 
brought it back inside and it had gotten
a<00:01:10.890> little<00:01:10.979> bit<00:01:11.220> too<00:01:11.250> cold<00:01:11.640> outside<00:01:11.939> because<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
a little bit too cold outside because it

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.810 
a little bit too cold outside because it
got<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.229> frost<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.950> I've<00:01:14.549> lost

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
got a little bit of frost and I've lost

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.870 
got a little bit of frost and I've lost
part<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> plants<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> best<00:01:17.220> part

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
part of the plants but the best part

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.390 
part of the plants but the best part
about<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.600> lucky<00:01:18.960> bamboo<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.680> even<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
about the lucky bamboo is even when you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.280 
about the lucky bamboo is even when you
think<00:01:20.670> you've<00:01:20.909> lost<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.479> most<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> time

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
think you've lost it most of the time

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.219 
think you've lost it most of the time
you<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.159> lost<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.810> periodically

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
you have not lost it and so periodically

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.280 
you have not lost it and so periodically
I<00:01:25.890> will<00:01:26.100> check<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.939> stems<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:28.080> they're

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
I will check the stems and if they're

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.460 
I will check the stems and if they're
really<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:29.000> broken<00:01:30.000> or<00:01:30.479> brown<00:01:30.840> I'll<00:01:31.200> take

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
really really broken or brown I'll take

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.490 
really really broken or brown I'll take
them<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.070> saying<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.750> example<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
them out but saying that for example the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.080 
them out but saying that for example the
stem<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:35.009> here<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:37.340> brown<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> top<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
stem right here is brown on the top it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.960 
stem right here is brown on the top it
looks<00:01:39.180> dead<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.470> roots<00:01:40.820> themselves<00:01:41.820> are

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
looks dead but the roots themselves are

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.130 
looks dead but the roots themselves are
still<00:01:42.299> alive

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
still alive

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.770 
still alive
so<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.890> lucky<00:01:44.310> bamboo<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.970> still<00:01:45.240> alive<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
so this lucky bamboo is still alive the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.230 
so this lucky bamboo is still alive the
roots<00:01:46.020> are<00:01:46.259> still<00:01:46.290> growing<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> could<00:01:48.030> cut

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
