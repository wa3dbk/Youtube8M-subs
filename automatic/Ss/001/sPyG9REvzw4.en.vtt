 Hello to you here I Ruslan 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.500
 tell you how fast you can draw 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.929
 anime characters but by example naruto in 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.900
 profile somehow done just quick and 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.309
 clear or otherwise everyone will 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.460
 only give zenith quality to 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.990
 Unfortunately, the participants could not like you 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.720
 see first we draw such 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.000
 a blank of lines is easy enough 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.550
 memorize and i'm drawing a character now with 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.840
 open as you see therefore below 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.390
 my chin will be tilted 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.940
 little right here if you need to 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.530
 terrota just do one single 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.210
 lines in a straight line from the forehead to the chin 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.010
 I almost forgot to say that the most important and 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.690
 when you do the workpiece you are not 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.420
 press hard with a pencil that is 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.190
 lightly press it all slightly to 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.050
 you could safely erase to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.409
 the paper did not remain what they are 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.289
 beautiful lines of a dent so click 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.960
 slightly later when to be and draw 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.460

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.179
 Slightly what then when stroking is all 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.179

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.200

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.200
