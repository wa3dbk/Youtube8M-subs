with<00:00:37.200> my<00:00:37.320> phantom<00:00:37.710> dancer<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.149> like

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
with my phantom dancer so this is like

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.020 
with my phantom dancer so this is like
the<00:00:39.600> old<00:00:39.780> build<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.350> gives<00:00:40.649> us<00:00:40.890> 40<00:00:41.640> cooldown

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the old build it gives us 40 cooldown

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.970 
the old build it gives us 40 cooldown
reduction<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:42.870> get<00:00:43.050> boots<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.680> lucidity

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
reduction so we get boots of lucidity

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.979 
reduction so we get boots of lucidity
and<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.610> must<00:00:44.850> gos<00:00:45.000> plate<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.390> 25

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and you must gos plate that's 25

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
and you must gos plate that's 25
cooldown<00:00:46.379> reduction<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:47.250> get<00:00:47.460> five<00:00:47.820> from

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
cooldown reduction we get five from

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.799 
cooldown reduction we get five from
masteries<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.079> if<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.280> use<00:00:50.520> runes<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.570> blue

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
masteries and if we use runes so blue

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.380 
masteries and if we use runes so blue
cooldown<00:00:52.230> runes<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:53.160> use<00:00:53.309> those<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.879> get<00:00:54.090> 10

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
cooldown runes if we use those we get 10

cooldown runes if we use those we get 10
from<00:00:54.629> those<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.500> overall<00:00:55.949> gives<00:00:56.280> us<00:00:56.430> 40

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
from those and that overall gives us 40

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.670 
from those and that overall gives us 40
cooldown<00:00:57.090> reduction<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:58.260> gives<00:00:58.469> us

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
cooldown reduction and this gives us

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.220 
cooldown reduction and this gives us
like<00:00:58.890> huge<00:00:59.280> damage<00:00:59.579> burst<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:01.020> one-shot

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
like huge damage burst we can one-shot

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.560 
like huge damage burst we can one-shot
squishies<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.340> all<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.579> stuff<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.000> these

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
squishies and all that stuff so these

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.190 
squishies and all that stuff so these
are<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.809> pros<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.920> build<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.180> cons<00:01:06.780> are

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
are the pros of this build the cons are

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.469 
are the pros of this build the cons are
you're<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.130> fast<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.880> example<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
you're not that fast for example if you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.539 
you're not that fast for example if you
want<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.750> gank<00:01:09.930> you're<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.500> fast<00:01:10.830> we

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
want to gank you're not that fast we

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.789 
want to gank you're not that fast we
don't<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.060> early<00:01:12.750> magic<00:01:13.320> resistance

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
don't get that early magic resistance

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.280 
don't get that early magic resistance
because<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.340> use<00:01:14.520> cooldowns<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.869> know<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.140> use

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
because we use cooldowns you know we use

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.950 
because we use cooldowns you know we use
a<00:01:16.409> glyph<00:01:17.009> cooldown<00:01:17.520> glyphs<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.689> get

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
a glyph cooldown glyphs so we don't get

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.749 
a glyph cooldown glyphs so we don't get
that<00:01:19.020> early<00:01:19.619> magic<00:01:19.950> resistance<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.610> you're

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
that early magic resistance so if you're

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.609 
that early magic resistance so if you're
playing<00:01:21.030> against<00:01:21.390> rise<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.930> example<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.409> top

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
playing against rise for example on top

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.190 
playing against rise for example on top
lane<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.220> know<00:01:23.369> you're<00:01:23.670> gonna<00:01:23.790> struggle<00:01:24.210> so

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.539 
lane you know you're gonna struggle so
this<00:01:25.409> build<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:26.040> good<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.340> one

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549

build<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.720> great<00:01:48.960> because<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.380> gives<00:01:49.409> us<00:01:49.710> huge

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
build is great because it gives us huge

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
build is great because it gives us huge
movement<00:01:50.310> speed<00:01:50.700> because<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> know

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
movement speed because we are you know

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.300 
movement speed because we are you know
you<00:01:52.020> are<00:01:52.259> assessed<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.890> gotta<00:01:53.100> move

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you are assessed and you gotta move

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.859 
you are assessed and you gotta move
around<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> map<00:01:53.759> really<00:01:54.210> fast<00:01:54.420> catch<00:01:54.689> your

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
around the map really fast catch your

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.389 
around the map really fast catch your
targets<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.890> gives<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> lot<00:01:56.340> of

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
targets so it gives you a lot of

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
targets so it gives you a lot of
movement<00:01:56.880> speed<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.780> course<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.439> not

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
movement speed but of course you are not

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.709 
movement speed but of course you are not
getting<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.250> much<00:01:59.579> burst<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.570> not

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
getting that much burst like it's not

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.020 
getting that much burst like it's not
really<00:02:00.990> huge<00:02:01.530> difference<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.189> example<00:02:02.880> in

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
really huge difference for example in

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.670
