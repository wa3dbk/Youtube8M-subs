00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.140
 this adventure but certainly the 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:06.500
 research to overcome personal limitations 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.770
 plus a passion, a strong passion 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.490
 for the two wheels is that pinch of 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.979
 sportiness that is my lifestyle 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.620
 I thought about trying to do 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.860
 this venture surely 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.280
 you can't plan everything a lot 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.710
 must be addressed at the moment e 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.190
 improvise as happens in many trips 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.860
 this has so many it has so many unknowns 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.180
 when you asked wanted to make calls 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.340
 this trip you told me at eicma mt 09 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.660
 they said you try and Succeed 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.520
 with this bike 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.650
 according to you and to show reliability 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.540
 of the product that is not discussed anyway 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.880
 the bike in short, exceptional but still 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.620
 a further challenge because it is not a motorcycle 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.620
 conceived precisely for this type of 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.170
 travel yes i know the name 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.110
 Trans-Siberian record 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.800
 is exactly why do a 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.530
 journey of the kind of 12 thousand and broken km 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.700
 on a naked motard 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:16.980
 this already underlines a great deal of 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:20.519
 the record factor is called my Italy 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.110

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:27.480

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.519
 cigarette lighter socket for the navigator 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.799

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.390
 this collaboration with friends e 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:47.390
 Practice bikers started last year 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.910
 when I returned from the tavern desert 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.740
 together with francesco we decided to 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.740
 do something strong 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.700
 with this business that I believe will have a 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.280
 international prominence if not worldwide 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.810
 we will even be able to promote 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.600
 what are the good initiatives of 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.080
 these defending practice bikers mentioned 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.750
 I am a part of spreading their own 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.660
 humanitarian aid for Africa including 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.360
 main ones to build in the wells 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.720
 of drinking water 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.850
 there where alas is not possible 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.459
 find not even a glass of water 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.680
 I couldn't wait to leave sincerely 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.660
 that is, they are so loaded that 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.580
 even if I forgot something at home 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.550
 I don't care what they are now 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.410
 left and I go to the destination 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.540
