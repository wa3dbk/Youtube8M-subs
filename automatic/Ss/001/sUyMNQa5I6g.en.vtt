that's<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> think<00:00:41.309> my<00:00:41.399> current<00:00:41.730> build

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
that's what I think my current build

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.510 
that's what I think my current build
video<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.329> over<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.500> Jax<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.370> fun

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520

champion he's also not super difficult

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.380 
champion he's also not super difficult
so<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:47.250> should<00:00:47.460> give<00:00:47.610> him<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.850> shot<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.300> you've

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
so you should give him a shot if you've

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
so you should give him a shot if you've
never<00:00:48.539> played<00:00:48.660> him<00:00:48.989> before<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.860> next

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
lot of damage with it so you should try

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.020

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
my final pick this week it's gonna be

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.070 
my final pick this week it's gonna be
lissandra<00:02:09.060> I'm<00:02:09.330> gonna<00:02:09.479> go<00:02:09.599> with<00:02:09.720> her<00:02:09.899> because

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
lissandra I'm gonna go with her because

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.570 
lissandra I'm gonna go with her because
I<00:02:10.319> think<00:02:10.530> she's<00:02:10.709> really<00:02:11.009> strong<00:02:11.250> throughout

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
I think she's really strong throughout

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.630 
I think she's really strong throughout
the<00:02:11.819> game<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
the game as a

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.400 
the game as a
goes<00:02:12.760> on<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.060> think<00:02:13.480> she's<00:02:13.600> got<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.780> good<00:02:13.960> laning

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
goes on I think she's got a good laning

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.100 
goes on I think she's got a good laning
phase<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.950> think<00:02:15.220> she<00:02:15.420> converts<00:02:16.420> over<00:02:16.900> really

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
phase I think she converts over really

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.990 
phase I think she converts over really
well<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.500> team<00:02:17.709> fights<00:02:18.010> with<00:02:18.640> her<00:02:18.790> and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
well to team fights with her and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.400 
well to team fights with her and
vulnerable<00:02:19.420> or<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:19.900> if<00:02:19.990> she<00:02:20.020> needs<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
vulnerable or just if she needs the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.960 
vulnerable or just if she needs the
locks<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.740> went<00:02:20.950> down<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.250> find<00:02:21.700> her<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.790> be<00:02:21.880> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
locks and went down I find her to be a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.610 
locks and went down I find her to be a
lot<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.150> fun<00:02:22.330> he'd<00:02:22.510> also<00:02:22.630> hold<00:02:22.959> whole<00:02:23.170> teams<00:02:23.440> in

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
lot of fun he'd also hold whole teams in

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.010 
lot of fun he'd also hold whole teams in
place<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.490> so<00:02:24.940> are<00:02:25.240> with<00:02:25.420> her<00:02:25.540> kit<00:02:25.750> so

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
place to with it so are with her kit so

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.390 
place to with it so are with her kit so
she<00:02:26.319> just<00:02:26.470> works<00:02:26.709> out<00:02:26.860> really<00:02:27.010> well<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.280> think

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
she just works out really well I think

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.710 
she just works out really well I think
she's<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.670> strong<00:02:27.880> champion<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.330> don't<00:02:28.510> see

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
she's a strong champion you don't see

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.360 
she's a strong champion you don't see
too<00:02:28.750> often<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.800> think<00:02:30.010> she<00:02:30.130> should<00:02:30.160> be

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
too often and I think she should be

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.830 
too often and I think she should be
utilized<00:02:30.760> more<00:02:31.060> because<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.570> so<00:02:31.690> if<00:02:31.750> you've

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
utilized more because of it so if you've

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.820 
utilized more because of it so if you've
never<00:02:31.959> tried<00:02:32.080> her<00:02:32.350> out<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.680> should

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
never tried her out you should

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.980 
never tried her out you should
definitely<00:02:32.860> give<00:02:33.520> her<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.820> shot<00:02:34.209> this<00:02:34.390> week<00:02:34.600> you

definitely give her a shot this week you

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.180 
definitely give her a shot this week you
might<00:02:35.140> want<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.350> end<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.590> picking<00:02:35.770> her<00:02:35.920> up<00:02:35.980> in
