00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.789 
thought that the whole you know thing
with<00:01:48.270> Kane<00:01:48.540> was<00:01:48.810> basically<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.470> he<00:01:49.619> wasn't

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
with Kane was basically that he wasn't

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.340 
with Kane was basically that he wasn't
going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.130> able<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.490> harm<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.479> superstars

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.139 
going to be able to harm the superstars
but<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:52.740> he<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:52.950> naming<00:01:53.430> himself<00:01:53.729> in

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
but here he is just naming himself in

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.789 
but here he is just naming himself in
the<00:01:54.270> matches<00:01:54.689> sort<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.140> with<00:01:55.320> Vince<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799

the matches sort of like with Vince and
Triple<00:01:56.070> H<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.369> they've<00:01:56.520> had<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> put

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
Triple H and they've had to put

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.219

themselves<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.420> two<00:01:57.479> matches<00:01:57.600> they've<00:01:57.990> had<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
themselves in two matches they've had to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.230 
themselves in two matches they've had to
step<00:01:58.439> off<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> board<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.969> Ted<00:02:00.149> of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
step off of the board and this Ted of

step off of the board and this Ted of
the<00:02:00.299> others<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.689> makes<00:02:00.899> no<00:02:01.079> sense<00:02:01.110> at<00:02:01.500> all

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729
