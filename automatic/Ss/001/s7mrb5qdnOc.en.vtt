want to get done so i figured i do an
unboxing<00:00:13.980> video<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.730> motherboard<00:00:15.030> so

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
unboxing video of this motherboard so

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.439 
unboxing video of this motherboard so
let's<00:00:15.870> get<00:00:15.990> into<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.640> so<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.760> open<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.060> up<00:00:18.210> and

liquid cooling you know don't know how

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.670 
liquid cooling you know don't know how

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
much air flowing through the case then

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.970 
much air flowing through the case then
you<00:01:58.799> got

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
you got

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.160 
you got

Oh 3-way SLI bridge never seen aces do

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.100

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
this before again from Los boards oh god

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.070 
this before again from Los boards oh god
I've<00:02:08.290> never<00:02:08.440> had<00:02:08.619> anything<00:02:08.890> like<00:02:09.010> this<00:02:09.130> but<00:02:09.700> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
I've never had anything like this but I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.030 
I've never had anything like this but I
guess<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.170> reason<00:02:11.290> they<00:02:11.500> do<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.860> because

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
guess the reason they do that is because

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.300 
guess the reason they do that is because
it<00:02:12.220> does<00:02:12.400> support<00:02:12.640> 3-way<00:02:13.270> SLI<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.230> nice<00:02:15.130> we'll

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
it does support 3-way SLI so nice we'll

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.080 
it does support 3-way SLI so nice we'll
throw<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.630> I'm<00:02:16.690> guessing<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.060> a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
throw it in so I'm guessing this is a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.530 
throw it in so I'm guessing this is a
regular<00:02:19.300> SLI<00:02:19.840> bridge<00:02:19.990> that's<00:02:20.620> cool<00:02:21.040> like<00:02:21.940> that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.290 

right<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:27.160> let<00:02:27.790> me<00:02:27.820> show<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.030> another

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
right on so let me show you another

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.680 
right on so let me show you another
board<00:02:28.600> now<00:02:30.810> got<00:02:31.810> like<00:02:31.960> this<00:02:32.080> plastic<00:02:33.690> cover

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
regular USB Ethernet this is nice this

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.290 
regular USB Ethernet this is nice this
board<00:03:30.250> yeah<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:31.060> comes<00:03:31.360> with<00:03:31.540> USB<00:03:32.080> 3.0<00:03:33.300> defour

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
board yeah it comes with USB 3.0 defour

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.090 
board yeah it comes with USB 3.0 defour
the<00:03:34.390> future<00:03:34.720> that's<00:03:35.230> 10<00:03:35.440> times<00:03:35.650> faster<00:03:36.070> than

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
the future that's 10 times faster than

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.850 
the future that's 10 times faster than
the<00:03:36.280> normal<00:03:36.910> USB<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.510> point<00:03:37.720> out<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.050> it

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
the normal USB to point out that it

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.229 
the normal USB to point out that it
gives<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.160> full<00:03:39.459> mouse<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:40.030> keyboard

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
gives you a full mouse and keyboard

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.030 
gives you a full mouse and keyboard
input<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:42.030> 0<00:03:43.030> reset<00:03:43.810> CMOS<00:03:44.110> which<00:03:44.290> that's<00:03:44.830> nice

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
input and 0 reset CMOS which that's nice

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.100 
input and 0 reset CMOS which that's nice
so<00:03:45.640> instead<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:45.880> having<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.120> go<00:03:46.270> in<00:03:46.450> take<00:03:46.900> off

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
so instead of having to go in take off

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.560 
so instead of having to go in take off
the<00:03:47.290> side<00:03:47.470> panel<00:03:47.860> of<00:03:47.950> your<00:03:48.100> case<00:03:48.390> then<00:03:49.390> has<00:03:49.510> to

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
the side panel of your case then has to

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.210 
the side panel of your case then has to
go<00:03:49.660> in<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.020> take<00:03:50.140> out<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.440> battery<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:51.010> just

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
go in and take out the battery you just

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.979 
go in and take out the battery you just
hit<00:03:51.610> this<00:03:51.730> button<00:03:51.790> resets<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.480> seamless<00:03:52.810> for

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
hit this button resets the seamless for

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:00.150 
hit this button resets the seamless for
you<00:03:54.330> there<00:03:55.330> is<00:03:55.420> 24-pin<00:03:56.170> ATX<00:03:58.350> then<00:03:59.350> here's

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
you there is 24-pin ATX then here's

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.280 
you there is 24-pin ATX then here's
something<00:04:00.520> new<00:04:00.670> they<00:04:00.820> did<00:04:00.970> again<00:04:01.209> this<00:04:02.020> is

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
something new they did again this is

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.270 
something new they did again this is
actually<00:04:02.950> sada<00:04:03.610> 3<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:04.480> that's<00:04:04.660> 68<00:04:05.140> per<00:04:05.830> second

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
actually sada 3 so that's 68 per second

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.190 
actually sada 3 so that's 68 per second
opposed<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.060> regular<00:04:07.450> set<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.810> 2<00:04:07.959> which<00:04:08.170> is

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
opposed to the regular set of 2 which is

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.199 
opposed to the regular set of 2 which is
three<00:04:08.920> gigabit<00:04:09.340> per<00:04:09.519> second<00:04:09.850> so<00:04:09.940> 2<00:04:10.090> times

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
three gigabit per second so 2 times

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.000 
three gigabit per second so 2 times
faster<00:04:10.720> that's<00:04:10.900> awesome<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:12.100> you<00:04:12.190> have

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
faster that's awesome so you have

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.270 
faster that's awesome so you have
two<00:04:13.700> four<00:04:13.909> six<00:04:13.939> and<00:04:14.780> then<00:04:15.500> two<00:04:15.680> more<00:04:15.860> so<00:04:16.070> eight

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
two four six and then two more so eight

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.129 
two four six and then two more so eight
set<00:04:16.669> up<00:04:16.850> imports<00:04:17.479> and<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.720> nice<00:04:17.900> thing<00:04:17.930> about

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
set up imports and the nice thing about

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.000 
set up imports and the nice thing about
SATA<00:04:18.530> 6<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:18.979> it's<00:04:19.430> not<00:04:19.579> like<00:04:19.790> you<00:04:19.910> can<00:04:20.030> only<00:04:20.180> put

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
SATA 6 is it's not like you can only put

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.310 
SATA 6 is it's not like you can only put
sata3<00:04:22.010> stuff<00:04:22.820> on<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.540> can<00:04:23.780> actually<00:04:23.960> it's

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
sata3 stuff on it you can actually it's

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.860 
sata3 stuff on it you can actually it's
interchangeable<00:04:25.070> so<00:04:25.669> you<00:04:25.760> can<00:04:26.000> connect<00:04:26.780> to

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
interchangeable so you can connect to

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.980 
interchangeable so you can connect to
sada<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.410> device<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.900> obviously<00:04:29.900> you

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
sada to device to that obviously you

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.670 
sada to device to that obviously you
can't<00:04:30.320> go<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.460> other<00:04:31.490> way<00:04:32.229> and<00:04:33.229> you're<00:04:33.440> into

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
can't go the other way and you're into

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.629 
can't go the other way and you're into
