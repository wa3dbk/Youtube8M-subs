 this sector that is the podium sector 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.210
 where the 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.040

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.480
 village to the enclosed park that is in the

 which is the official start day 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.770
 just in this sector that goes with 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.140
 to be able to find people in terms of 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.420
 proposals and have already started to 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.040
 get tourists and tourists already 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.140
 They came and they begin arriving too 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.630
 the journalists teams is already all in 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.790
 march did not arrive the alluvium that we expect 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.730
 still but if they went to díaz kas 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.500
 basically in the village is that the 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.720
 people will be able to find sponsor is 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.390
 this one no tent we have with the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.980
 city where we have made a quantity 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.700
 well you will see there will be permanently 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.310
 be alive uploaded to internet reportages 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.660
 we have an allegory about monuments the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.930
 flag on the issues that we 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.570
 they seem fundamental in the future for 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.120
 the great axes of the city and good the 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.030
 we 're seeing how they're going to see 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.319
 are already the dakar climate is the people going to 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.780
 enjoy not only the dakar climate but 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.280
 it's the weather and we think that the 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.900
 transcendence also that you will have is 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.790
 very important because they will see it 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.590
 divisions of people and this is the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.969
 image that you will see billion 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.499
 people and we are proud 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.329
 also of all this but how is it going to 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:21.299
 be the transit in this area during 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.129
 these previous days for 2 and 3 is going to 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.109
 be cut avenida belgrano from the 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.299
 from the roundabout the rioja but with 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.920
 circulation roundabout Rioja until the 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.290
 descent sergeant cabral also with 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.450
 circulation and on day 4 there will be a 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.629
 cut from here to oroño everything for the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.609
 side of the avenue is the river that goes to 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.980
 be part of the symbolic journey to 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.329
 from about from 8 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.530
 the morning until you start making the cut 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.699
 definitive because you have to mount a 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.199
 heap of fence 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.699
 when we talk about the face some 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.980
 remember some kind of vehicles but 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:51.629
 There are several which are those vehicles or 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.370
 which are the ones that impact them the most 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.959
 look people raise that trucks 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.579
 they are the most impressive because in fact 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.730
 they are much higher than what 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.769
 I want the rest much wider and much 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.079
 more colorful also the bikes because 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.389
 have had a series of technologies in 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.270
 its screen that is big and the cars 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.220
 they have a particularity let's say they're 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.990
 conventional common cars and they're 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.000
 the buggies that are these cars that 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.800
 they seem like crazy cars , that's where the 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.510
 career history where they are 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.459
 all cars modified for the race 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.320
 the videos as is the theme of the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.180
 beach security and with respect to 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.830
 boys sometimes families are well 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.660
 accustomed what are the collections to 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.430
 take face when they are here 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.480
 vehicles already work good in 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.180
 principle all safety regulations 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.850
 is that they are very pre-established 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.670
 visible this obviously is not the 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.230
 problem may not be so much right here 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.540
 where everything is very well organized 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.700
 fenced as there may be many people 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.560
 but the problem is that these trucks 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.350
 for example they discharge naphtha in 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.450
 service stations then it's there 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.300
 where you have to be careful that the 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.420
 truck driver does not see down but 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.060
 overflowing more than anything is in the 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.970
 urban spaces we already saw cars with the 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.680
 city ​​is circulating normally is yes 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.840
 people have to keep in mind that 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.290
 outside of where the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.550
 security in some way security 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.340
 guarantees the citizen himself 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.630
 this but here I think it's all very 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.510
 well organized has worked very well 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.730
 the entire commission headed by Diego and 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.590
 by silvana and I think all the 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.010
 principality the province has put 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.410
 much much interest in that accuracy 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.940
 of security is assured to go 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.080
 closing there is a place that also 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.610
 will be part of what is the 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.140
 organization that is the city center 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.690
 rosary there that we tell people 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.420
 can go can not go with the reality that 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.830
 that place is restricted access 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.450
 because it's really the center of 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.830
 press and it's all part of 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.850
 verification is the whole part where 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.770
 the requirements are taken sportingly 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.090
 both the vehicle's are fixed that 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.560
 have for example all the measures of 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.570
 security of internal fire extinguishers and 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.460
 external and others and also the whole part 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.840
 administrative of these teams some 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.790
 keep in mind that for example for a 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.440
 truck come 3 more trucks are 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.660
 around 50 people who are 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.560
 behind that team customs papers from 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.680
 a lot of administrative issues 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.080
 that work in that place along with a 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.370
 operational base if you go through 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.680
 circumvallation for example are going to have 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.660
 a lot of blocked trucks that are 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.700
 the operational base of the event is 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.920
 Arming here for two weeks 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.050
 the platform for later during the 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.380
 travel from here jumps on the 11th and 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.050
 Valparaíso finishing 18 will sustain 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.880
 the race then there is all the 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.350
 Super complete information I would dream 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.970
 recommendation then to the people who 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.500
 get closer to the flag park here 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.330
 only to enjoy the same fate 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.580
 also to begin to see what the 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.990
 organization of this space and also 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.090
 if you want to see the vehicles remember 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.680
 that tomorrow you can see here in 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.050
 the rosario racetrack now we're going to 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.210
 be reviewing then 31 first 2 and 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.920
 3 so in the racetrack is going to be armed as 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.900
 a great city ​​where all the 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.550
 vehicles there as a city in the 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.550
 Desert organizers said
