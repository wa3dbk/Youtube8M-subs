beating<00:00:39.570> them<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.809> absorb<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.320> yeah<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
beating them to absorb that yeah it's a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.860 
beating them to absorb that yeah it's a
little<00:00:41.790> bit<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> bait<00:00:42.180> there's<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.450> small

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
little bit of a bait there's a small

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.389 
little bit of a bait there's a small
window<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.500> invincibility<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.160> game<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
window of like invincibility on game and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.770 
window of like invincibility on game and
watch<00:00:44.489> when<00:00:44.640> he<00:00:44.700> absorbs<00:00:45.000> something<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.480> can

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
watch when he absorbs something but can

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.990 
watch when he absorbs something but can
he<00:00:45.870> timed<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> out<00:00:46.230> very<00:00:46.379> nicely<00:00:46.620> though<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
he timed it out very nicely though the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.580 
he timed it out very nicely though the
one<00:00:48.210> problem<00:00:48.420> about<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.110> matchup<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.530> I

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
one problem about this matchup like I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.080 
one problem about this matchup like I
was<00:00:49.739> saying<00:00:49.890> earlier<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.550> lot<00:00:50.730> harder<00:00:50.910> for

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
was saying earlier it's a lot harder for

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
was saying earlier it's a lot harder for
Pikachu<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.690> combo<00:00:52.050> game<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.350> watch<00:00:52.469> Game<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
Pikachu to combo game and watch Game and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.650 
Pikachu to combo game and watch Game and
Watch<00:00:53.010> flies<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.489> little<00:00:54.059> bit<00:00:54.180> farther<00:00:54.420> than

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
Watch flies a little bit farther than

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.790 
Watch flies a little bit farther than
you'd<00:00:54.840> expect<00:00:55.170> them<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> through<00:00:55.620> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
you'd expect them to through and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.650 
you'd expect them to through and
therefore<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.640> gets<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.120> little<00:00:57.300> bit<00:00:57.510> earlier

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
therefore like gets a little bit earlier

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.299 
therefore like gets a little bit earlier
of<00:00:58.020> our<00:00:58.140> time<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.500> air<00:00:58.649> dodge<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> never

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
of our time to air dodge so you never

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.560 
of our time to air dodge so you never
expected<00:00:59.850> even<00:00:59.969> though<00:01:00.120> he<00:01:00.210> flies<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
expected even though he flies on the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.849 
expected even though he flies on the
same<00:01:00.899> trajectory<00:01:01.109> has<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.500> lot<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.680> other

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
same trajectory has a lot of other

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.709 
same trajectory has a lot of other
characters<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:03.030> yeah<00:01:03.210> he<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.449> get<00:01:03.570> out<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
characters but yeah he can get out of

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.270 
characters but yeah he can get out of
combos<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.409> how<00:01:04.500> light<00:01:04.710> he<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.920> give

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
combos because of how light he is give

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.740 
combos because of how light he is give

her playing this matchup super well so
far<00:01:06.780> though<00:01:07.310> let's<00:01:08.310> keep<00:01:08.549> them<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.880> fours

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
far though let's keep them all fours

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.440 
far though let's keep them all fours
right<00:01:09.450> there<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:11.939> right<00:01:11.970> there<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
right there you see right there that's a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.240 
right there you see right there that's a
down<00:01:12.659> throw<00:01:12.840> at<00:01:12.960> 60<00:01:13.409> where<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.890> know<00:01:13.950> gamer

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
down throw at 60 where you know gamer

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.980 
down throw at 60 where you know gamer
just<00:01:14.400> went<00:01:14.549> flying<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:15.150> all<00:01:15.299> arranged<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.720> can

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
just went flying it's all arranged I can

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.359 
just went flying it's all arranged I can
see<00:01:16.140> how<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:16.890> difficult<00:01:17.130> all

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
see how that would be very difficult all

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.710 
see how that would be very difficult all
and<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.119> multi-hit<00:01:18.509> back

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and that's up for that multi-hit back

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.390 
and that's up for that multi-hit back
here<00:01:18.960> makes<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.560> hard<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.799> tech<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.220> Kenny

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
here makes it so hard to tech and Kenny

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.679 
here makes it so hard to tech and Kenny
just<00:01:20.640> could<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.909> find<00:01:21.119> him<00:01:21.240> right<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:21.540> as

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
just could not find him right there as

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.149 
just could not find him right there as
gimmer<00:01:22.140> pulls<00:01:22.350> ahead<00:01:22.470> right<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.130> think

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
gimmer pulls ahead right now and I think

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.800 
gimmer pulls ahead right now and I think
Kenny<00:01:23.520> expected<00:01:24.030> himself<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.450> hit<00:01:24.600> by<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
Kenny expected himself to get hit by the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.420 
Kenny expected himself to get hit by the
Thunder<00:01:25.200> through<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> stage<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.250> would

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
Thunder through the stage that would

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.740 
Thunder through the stage that would
have<00:01:26.520> actually<00:01:26.700> saved<00:01:27.090> them<00:01:27.299> had<00:01:27.420> he<00:01:27.509> been<00:01:27.600> hit

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
have actually saved them had he been hit

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.390 
have actually saved them had he been hit
by<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.380> hit<00:01:28.560> gamer<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:28.950> instead<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
by that and it hit gamer but instead the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.740 
by that and it hit gamer but instead the
multi-hit<00:01:29.759> came<00:01:29.939> out<00:01:30.060> first<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.509> thunder

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
multi-hit came out first the thunder

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.120 
multi-hit came out first the thunder
went<00:01:30.840> through<00:01:31.110> him<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.530> that's<00:01:31.860> why<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:31.979> ended

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
went through him and that's why I ended

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.859 
went through him and that's why I ended
up<00:01:32.280> dying<00:01:32.490> overall<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.360> bit<00:01:33.450> bad<00:01:33.630> luck

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
up dying overall little bit bad luck

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.410 
up dying overall little bit bad luck
right<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.439> my<00:01:34.530> mechanic<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.400> mean<00:01:36.299> like

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
right there for my mechanic I mean like

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.420 
right there for my mechanic I mean like
you<00:01:36.810> see<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.290> weird<00:01:37.619> trajectory<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.250> givers

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you see that weird trajectory and givers

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.310 
you see that weird trajectory and givers
actually<00:01:38.670> been<00:01:38.790> dying<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.509> every<00:01:39.689> time<00:01:39.869> but

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
actually been dying it every time but

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.840 
actually been dying it every time but
because<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.860> gimmer<00:01:41.310> will<00:01:41.460> actually<00:01:41.729> die

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
because of that gimmer will actually die

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.249 
because of that gimmer will actually die
too<00:01:41.909> after<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> thunder<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> lot<00:01:42.780> earlier<00:01:43.079> as

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
too after a thunder a lot earlier as

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.020 
too after a thunder a lot earlier as
well<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:43.950> if<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.159> merge<00:01:44.310> eyes<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.790> gonna<00:01:44.909> be

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
well but if you merge eyes it's gonna be

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
well but if you merge eyes it's gonna be
very<00:01:45.060> hard<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> killing<00:01:46.259> combo<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.590> them

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
very hard to get a killing combo on them

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.800 
very hard to get a killing combo on them
grow
