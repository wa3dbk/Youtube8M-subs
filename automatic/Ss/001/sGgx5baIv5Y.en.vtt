00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:05.149
 we will begin by studying the concept of god and then study 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:06.669
 in detail 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:09.669
 the bios configuration of our computers 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.189
 to md appealed I tried a 4 3 points 0 6 gigahertz 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.579
 concept 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.179
 bios is commonly known as lips 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:28.130
 but the correct thing from the grammatical point of view is to name it the videos and 

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:29.330
 that the bios 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.820
 it has a masculine gender because the bios is a system 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.950
 and a system is masculine 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.730
 god is the initials of de visita inputs pop-up system 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.560
 that is to say 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.680
 basic entry and exit system 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.729
 so incorrect is grammatically speaking say lips 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:50.730
 like the tree 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.430
 but as long as there will be liver so much this grammatical error from the beginning 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.520
 most people are no more familiar and comfortable saying lips than 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.470
 the virus 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.740
 in order that each one calls it as best he pleases 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.630
 to us what interests us to know what is 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.140
 what is the bios 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.540
 what is bios for? 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.660
 what types of videos are there 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.850
 how the bios is configured 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.850
 as he went towards the pesetera videos 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.110
 we already know what is caja had artist of war 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.060
 lips is a kind of hybrid between jadwat and software 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.240
 and the result is known as signed four 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.200
 that is to say 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.410
 lips is not a simple physical component sheet act 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.650
 nor to that only a set of instructions are four 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.190
 the bios hello friends 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.690
 both parts closely united as the body and the soul 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.320
 already that union is given the name of signed play 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.830
 the computer without operating system or programs is a set of scrap that 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.410
 it is useless 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.490
 but when the computer is booted, the operating system does not work yet 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.209
 so 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.610
 as the computer starts up and knows what it has to do and allows us to use the 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.929
 keyboard 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.849
 and it makes all the components work 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.490
 that does thanks to Allah 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.580
 as we have already said lips is a component jabugo arc software included 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.459
 in a rom memory 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.139
 that is, a read-only and non-volatile memory 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.060
 that contains some microprograms 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.950
 that allow to define the parameters that will control the equipment 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:42.739
 but the billo's 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.730
 not only allows the boot and load of the operating system but it continues 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.110
 working in the background and we can affirm without fear of error that his 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:58.620
 configuration is what most influences both the benefits and the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.620
 stability and correct equipment configuration 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.500
 the best-known brands 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.090
 they are the fao war 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.379
 and the family 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.519
 we have already studied it in previous editions 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:17.839
 in this chapter we will also study another aguar corresponding to the country measured 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:18.810
 ashton wolf 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.689
 xp 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.849
 we will also study brand lips to me 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.209
 as if between lips 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.329
 The most commonly used mode is to keep the key pressed 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.849
 suppress a few seconds after the boot of the computer just 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.449
 immediately after a message that appears on the screen telling us that 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.230
 key we have to press 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.189
 To enter it, cover your lips 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:53.609
 the main menu of the lips zp immediately appears on the screen 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:08.659
 brick functions 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.200
 through the code 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.389
 today low level instructions 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.549
 that is, the one that best understands the lips machine takes control of the 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.549
 computer since we press the start button 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.640
 your microprograms have enough intelligence to allow interaction 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.259
 with the keyboard the monitor the floppy disk drive of the cd room or dvd rom 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.970
 and other devices 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.570
 leaving the computer ready for the loading of the operating system 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:41.300
 through lipstick recipe 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.020
 we can configure the lower level parameters including the routines 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.120
 of initialization that and testing 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.930
 also allows us there the jaguar of the show to for example we can 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.220
 deactivate the sound card 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.689
 oprahics integrated into the motherboard 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:06.440
 mostly modern lips have the functionality tnt ie plague ample 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.199
 click and ready 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:13.740
 this functionality is a dynamic method of allocating resources in 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.550
 this sense lips tracks the entire system to look for emea channels 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.839
 that is, devices with direct access to memory 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:25.480
 lines of interruptions and I have recovered 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.969
 and directions of entry and exit 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.360
 All these configuration data are stored in a database called 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.979
 ee scd 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.020
 to assign those resources later 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.480
 to different devices without conflicts 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:47.169
 finally we are going to quote another very important function of lips 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.169
 post 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.169
 what is the pos 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.509
 the acronym post derives from the power concert 3 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.000
 and means 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 3 self-test during startup 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:10.080
 the post is a typical and essential function of the bios 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.280
 consists of a test that performs lips after pressing the start button 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.709
 in order to verify that all the devices are connected and 

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:19.860
 working 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.029
 if during the lips it detects any anomaly 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.369
 the wind a code of beeps or through a network 

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:29.610
 since still 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.950
 since the graphic card was not wrong 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.570
 the monitor can not present any warning image 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.020
 during the post 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.270
 lips creates the so-called diagnostic code post this code in 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.930
 hexadecimal language 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.210
 it puts lips in a port of entry exit there are some cards of 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.680
 diagnosis or post cards 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.530
 who present this lip information on the monitor screen 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:01.279
 these cards carry a small display 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:05.789
 which shows the error code that occurs in the post 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:09.830
 it is as we can see from a petrolÃ­n card with a small 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.830
 display 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:21.399
 to interpret that code we would have to use the manual of 

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:24.399
 codes of each god model 

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:28.300
 summarizing 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.319
 we could say that the bios is the computer's starter 

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:35.319
 as every starter must have a battery 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.060
 The Billo's battery is a small button-type battery that 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.190
 allows to keep the memory information we do 

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:46.199
 and it usually lasts about five years
