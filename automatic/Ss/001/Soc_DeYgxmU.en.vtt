00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.440
 Hi everybody, we're here today with more 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.510
 a video of plants and today I 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.400
 talk a little bit how to implant moro 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.889
 this shrubby plant for the fruits 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.990
 how much coconut red does it look like 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.330
 similar to raspberry as well as 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.220
 produce blackberries are 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.290
 found naturally increasing in 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.990
 throughout southeastern Brazil and are 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.590
 grown for ornamental purposes as well 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.660
 as the elderly homeopathic fruits of 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.449
 leaves of plants and roots 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.289
 Let's learn how to plant it first. 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.110
 step 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.960
 prepare the sun and sea in which the yard or 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.030
 garden that received several hours of light 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.220
 direct sunlight every day 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.649
 use one to break the dirt so 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.579
 deep as possible at least 30 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.770
 centimeters 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.320
 you can also get blackberry seedlings 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.530
 through tree branches or in 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.020
 floriculturas the outstanding changes are 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.300
 preferable to planting seeds 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.370
 blackberry because these seeds are 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.979
 rarely commercially available 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.219
 This is much harder to cultivate. 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.109
 dig a hole in the plot just preparing 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:13.619
 which is large enough to accommodate 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:16.889
 whole blackberry plant or stake put it 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.560
 lives in the hole in show with earth beating 

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:21.889
 again around the base of the plant if 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.539
 mulberry bush grows more than one 

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:25.590
 put the plants four feet of 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.479
 distance 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.149
 water the plants so that the soil 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.770
 slightly moist consider the addition 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.469
 of a layer of some cover 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.799
 plant around the base of the plant 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.599
 keeping the unit is important. 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.209
 this so that later you can reap 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:45.329
 Great fruits too. 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:47.729
 produced as we make mistakes you can use 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.729
 fences to shape it as it goes 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.770
 grow naturally you can also 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.649
 have a tree model that a 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.249
 big yes but does not have a beautiful shadow 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.709
 is a real estate than 34 meters and she 

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:03.119
 also does beautiful work and beyond giving 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.739
 good fruits 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.779
 good each of a lot of plants stands for 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.280
