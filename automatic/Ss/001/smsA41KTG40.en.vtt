the<00:01:53.369> grease<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.850> pool<00:01:54.180> down<00:01:54.540> here<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the grease to pool down here on the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.080 
the grease to pool down here on the
bottom<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.040> then<00:01:56.159> pour<00:01:56.520> off<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
bottom which you can then pour off and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.359 
bottom which you can then pour off and
you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.020> gets<00:01:58.200> taken<00:01:58.469> away<00:01:58.710> from<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
you know it gets taken away from the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.179 
you know it gets taken away from the
bacon<00:01:59.729> itself<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.990> we're<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.560> my<00:02:01.649> kitchen<00:02:01.860> now

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
bacon itself so we're in my kitchen now

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.709 
bacon itself so we're in my kitchen now
we're<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> head<00:02:02.880> over<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> counter

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
we're going to head over to the counter

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.050 
we're going to head over to the counter
on<00:02:03.840> my<00:02:03.930> microwave<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.680> put<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.040> bacon<00:02:05.340> wave<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
on my microwave to put the bacon wave to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.449 
on my microwave to put the bacon wave to
the<00:02:06.180> test<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.320> deal<00:02:07.619> or<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.220> dud

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the test is it a deal or is it a dud

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.210 
the test is it a deal or is it a dud
let's<00:02:09.090> go<00:02:09.270> find<00:02:09.509> out<00:02:09.770> alright<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:10.830> I've<00:02:11.039> got<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
let's go find out alright so I've got a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.910 
let's go find out alright so I've got a
pound

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
pound

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.370 
pound
just<00:02:12.160> regular<00:02:12.520> old<00:02:12.730> store-bought<00:02:13.569> bacon<00:02:14.110> hair

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
just regular old store-bought bacon hair

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.020 
just regular old store-bought bacon hair
and<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.830> think<00:02:15.069> for<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.250> purpose<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.819> test

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
and I think for the purpose of the test

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.630 
and I think for the purpose of the test
we're<00:02:16.239> going<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.450> try<00:02:16.690> eight<00:02:16.959> slices<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:18.430> see

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
we're going to try eight slices to see

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.120 
we're going to try eight slices to see
how<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.940> bacon<00:02:19.480> wave<00:02:19.690> works<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.860> I'm<00:02:20.920> going<00:02:21.099> to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
how the bacon wave works so I'm going to

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.800 
how the bacon wave works so I'm going to
take<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.489> eight<00:02:21.730> slices<00:02:22.030> out<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.480> package

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
take the eight slices out of the package

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:45.309 
take the eight slices out of the package
and<00:02:22.989> place<00:02:23.349> them<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.370> bacon<00:02:24.700> wave

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.690 

all<00:02:46.319> right<00:02:46.500> now<00:02:46.620> I've<00:02:46.740> got<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:46.950> eight<00:02:47.370> slices

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
all right now I've got all eight slices

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.400 
all right now I've got all eight slices
in<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.270> next<00:02:48.510> step<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.959> place<00:02:49.140> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
in and the next step is to place the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.100 
in and the next step is to place the
skewers<00:02:49.920> all<00:02:50.250> along<00:02:50.520> each<00:02:50.820> side<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.720> already

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
skewers all along each side I already

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.900 
skewers all along each side I already
have<00:02:52.290> one<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:52.650> here<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.370> I'll<00:02:53.640> do<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.880> other

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
have one on here and I'll do the other

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.449 
have one on here and I'll do the other
one<00:02:54.270> now<00:02:54.540> it's<00:02:55.050> really<00:02:55.230> easy<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.860> skewers

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
one now it's really easy the skewers

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.360 
one now it's really easy the skewers
slide<00:02:56.820> through<00:02:57.330> quite<00:02:57.690> easily<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:59.280> know

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
slide through quite easily and you know

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.920 
slide through quite easily and you know
there's<00:02:59.520> little<00:02:59.670> resistance<00:03:00.300> from<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.630> bacon

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
there's little resistance from the bacon

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.970 
there's little resistance from the bacon
you<00:03:01.020> just<00:03:01.170> have<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.350> make<00:03:01.500> sure<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.860> you

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
you just have to make sure that you

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.970 
you just have to make sure that you
actually<00:03:02.130> get<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:03.120> bacon<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:04.080> know<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.530> to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
actually get the bacon you know on to

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.220 
actually get the bacon you know on to
the<00:03:05.160> skewer<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:06.300> rests<00:03:06.810> along<00:03:07.050> this

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
the skewer and it rests along this

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.290 
the skewer and it rests along this
little<00:03:07.380> groove<00:03:07.800> right<00:03:08.070> here<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.790> there<00:03:08.970> we<00:03:09.090> go

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
little groove right here so there we go

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.960 
little groove right here so there we go
it's<00:03:09.810> ready<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.200> cooking<00:03:10.739> all<00:03:11.670> right<00:03:11.790> so

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
we're ready for cooking I'm at my

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.050 
we're ready for cooking I'm at my
microwave<00:03:13.739> now<00:03:13.980> we're<00:03:14.280> gonna<00:03:14.370> take<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.760> bacon

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
microwave now we're gonna take the bacon

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.850 
microwave now we're gonna take the bacon
wave<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.450> put<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.720> into<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.019> microwave<00:03:16.350> again

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
wave and put it into the microwave again

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.680 
wave and put it into the microwave again
remember<00:03:17.310> we're<00:03:17.459> using<00:03:17.489> eight<00:03:17.850> slices<00:03:18.180> I

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
remember we're using eight slices I

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.750 
remember we're using eight slices I
think<00:03:19.200> just<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:20.280> know<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.519> first

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
think just for you know the first

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.270 
think just for you know the first
initial<00:03:21.180> test<00:03:21.480> sake<00:03:21.959> I'm<00:03:22.230> going<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.890> instead

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
initial test sake I'm going to instead

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.740 
initial test sake I'm going to instead
of<00:03:23.370> doing<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.670> for<00:03:23.730> eight<00:03:24.030> minutes<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.570> George

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
of doing it for eight minutes of George

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.360 
of doing it for eight minutes of George
it<00:03:24.870> says<00:03:25.050> on<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.320> package<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.830> minute<00:03:26.190> per

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
it says on the package a minute per

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.250 
it says on the package a minute per
slice<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.910> have<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.209> pretty<00:03:27.420> powerful<00:03:27.600> microwave

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
slice I have a pretty powerful microwave

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.890 
slice I have a pretty powerful microwave
I'm<00:03:28.560> going<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.070> set<00:03:29.250> my<00:03:29.400> microwave<00:03:29.760> for<00:03:30.239> seven

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
I'm going to set my microwave for seven

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.280 
I'm going to set my microwave for seven
minutes<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.920> let<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.760> cook<00:03:33.000> all<00:03:33.540> eight<00:03:34.019> pieces

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
minutes and let it cook all eight pieces

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.759 
minutes and let it cook all eight pieces
for<00:03:34.769> seven<00:03:35.250> minutes<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:35.900> here<00:03:36.900> we<00:03:36.989> go<00:03:37.140> we'll<00:03:37.680> be

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
for seven minutes so here we go we'll be

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.710 
for seven minutes so here we go we'll be
back<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:37.980> seven<00:03:38.489> minutes<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:39.060> see<00:03:39.239> how<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.690> all

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
back in seven minutes to see how it all

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.949 
back in seven minutes to see how it all
comes<00:03:39.870> out<00:03:40.790> all<00:03:41.790> right<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.120> our<00:03:42.150> seven<00:03:42.660> minutes

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
comes out all right so our seven minutes

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.050 
comes out all right so our seven minutes
are<00:03:43.170> up<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.769> just<00:03:44.010> pulled<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.489> bacon<00:03:44.880> wave

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
are up and I just pulled the bacon wave

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.729 
are up and I just pulled the bacon wave
out<00:03:45.329> of<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> microwave<00:03:46.079> and<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.350> can<00:03:46.530> see

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
out of the microwave and you can see

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:47.930 
out of the microwave and you can see
exactly<00:03:46.890> how<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.489> looks

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
exactly how it looks

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.870 
exactly how it looks
we're<00:03:48.780> already<00:03:49.140> immediately<00:03:49.950> very<00:03:50.340> impressed

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
we're already immediately very impressed

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.210 
we're already immediately very impressed
I<00:03:51.180> must<00:03:51.420> say<00:03:51.570> all<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.079> slices<00:03:52.290> look<00:03:52.739> perfectly

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
I must say all the slices look perfectly

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.789 
I must say all the slices look perfectly
cooked<00:03:53.610> they're<00:03:54.060> uniformly<00:03:54.900> cooked<00:03:55.410> as<00:03:55.530> well

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
cooked they're uniformly cooked as well

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.370 
cooked they're uniformly cooked as well
so<00:03:56.400> they're<00:03:56.519> very<00:03:56.670> consistent<00:03:57.329> so<00:03:57.480> what<00:03:58.230> I'll

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
so they're very consistent so what I'll

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.289 
so they're very consistent so what I'll
do<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.860> will<00:03:58.890> use<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.579> skewers<00:04:00.030> to

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
do is I will use the skewers to

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.259 
do is I will use the skewers to
hopefully<00:04:00.810> pop<00:04:01.110> this<00:04:01.320> right<00:04:01.590> out<00:04:01.769> like<00:04:02.730> so

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
hopefully pop this right out like so

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.330 
hopefully pop this right out like so
probably<00:04:03.810> one<00:04:03.930> side<00:04:04.200> at<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.410> time<00:04:04.650> maybe<00:04:04.890> yeah

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
probably one side at a time maybe yeah

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.479 
probably one side at a time maybe yeah
there<00:04:05.610> we<00:04:05.730> go<00:04:05.959> one<00:04:06.959> side<00:04:07.230> then<00:04:07.920> another<00:04:08.160> side

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
there we go one side then another side

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.600 
there we go one side then another side
and<00:04:09.380> you<00:04:10.380> know<00:04:10.500> all<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.980> grease<00:04:11.250> has

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
and you know all the grease has

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.420 
and you know all the grease has
collected<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.750> bottom<00:04:13.110> of<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.650> bacon

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
collected in the bottom of the bacon

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.979 
collected in the bottom of the bacon
waves<00:04:14.610> so<00:04:14.880> I'll<00:04:15.120> move<00:04:15.299> this<00:04:15.450> off<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.870> side

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
waves so I'll move this off to the side

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.610 
waves so I'll move this off to the side
and<00:04:16.700> then<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.789> can<00:04:17.820> take<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.660> bacon<00:04:19.229> wave<00:04:19.380> just

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
and then I can take the bacon wave just

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.099 
and then I can take the bacon wave just
to<00:04:19.829> show<00:04:20.039> you<00:04:20.100> I'm<00:04:21.060> going<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.269> pour<00:04:21.570> off<00:04:21.780> the

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109
