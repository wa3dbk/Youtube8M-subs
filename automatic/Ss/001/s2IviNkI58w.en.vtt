00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.230
 so hello I am claudia then in 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.869
 singing I tell myself that to change and 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.189
 to show you also how to make a 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.349
 pretend play me cut the hair 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.910
 but in fact I do not cut them how 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.920
 eventually shorten all seven 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.260
 lengths in bath attachment version and 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.720
 so that in the end result you are a 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.940
 mind a little wave y tapas where he lives 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.199
 rather notched which then appear 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.550
 not necessarily the guts so 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.830
 conventional but the bigger the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.290
 version a little bit retro with why 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.480
 not what you have a pretty fair face 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.329
 clear part of the ear and come 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.920
 place lengths roughly at this 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.930
 level there someone foccart is 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.670
 now a little fasteners that 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.629
 allows you to change according to your desires 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.090
 anyway 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.950
 already we will create correctly the 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.469
 side separation so I'm going to keep 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.570
 your natural movement but just redo 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.360
 a beautiful separation the part of the small 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.550
 side we take everything we gather all and 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.880
 the part of the big side we stop at 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.009
 done at the end of the dowser all that 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.009
 I will be isolated to start 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.380
 we 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.090
 we will create all of your material I 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.280
 do not know if you're used to repeating 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.860
 no hair I never complain to you 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.200
 had explained the idea you started 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.539
 root you entered 12 countries you 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.850
 inches and you come out helping peg or 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.860
 capturing you shoot this spelled out rendering 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 pushed you come out will kill all and thurso 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.009
 and that until the end of your mother you see 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.009
 the gesture csii peloton loses its phase 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.619
 so once we're here I 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.789
 brings together all the material created p I 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.569
 gather and I place them to 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.569
 horizontally 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.520
 okay okay and here I'm coming 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.560
 with a little elastic that come back 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.560
 fixed on the tip 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.709
 in fact what will allow me to 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.450
 gather all the stuff like that ok 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.569
 and then to roll there matter to 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.420
 the inside make a roll and create 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.840
 my semblance of flat calm we manage the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.010
 site 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.630
 the lengths agree together and there 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.880
 with a big big pump 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.730
 if the schools that are curved that get 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.799
 goes so fast actually holding me 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.799
 come set in my neck 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.719
 and then I release all the rest of 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.829
 the matter and here it is we will come 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:46.569
 do our loops work so we 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.530
 go on we start with the top we do 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.200
 that they are trying to do a little bit like 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.659
 a styling like rolls has 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.430
 styling I come with blacks 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:59.430
 all gently created modulation 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.520
 Alas 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.800
 come 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:21.490
 put it all on my two fingers 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:25.050
 like that and I'm not m pliers 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.050
 black obviously to make the loop 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.030
 more to work directly with 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.830
 our taxes and also that it gives you a 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.180
 very smooth and very cosmetic material 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.360
 is very bright 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.130
 a little bit vlad its together and 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.900
 why not dried a little that 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.910
 these choices a little heat is left 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.890
 cool a little bit you can very well 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.239
 do that and then consider why not 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.620
 others made up aprons time 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.910
 that it's cool and stay that way 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.180
 admit m meanwhile the language 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.380
 adds barely two minutes not even 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.250
 so I'm going to start removing the 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.220
 first loops 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.040
 this one the first ones that I did 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:13.510
 here and there naturally you come 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.510
 dishevel quite naturally 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.810
 are you there woods not too much it's okay 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.120
 dÃ©coiffer own finger all your 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.720
 pointy has just gone up and the fixed and 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.410
 badens of inked page we created just 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.410
 unfair 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.450
 even if it changes 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:47.820
 a car and a little trapeze on the whole 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.820
 here you are, thank you
