00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.169 

so<00:00:01.079> far<00:00:01.439> we've<00:00:01.770> really<00:00:02.250> been<00:00:02.399> focusing<00:00:03.060> on

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
so far we've really been focusing on

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.990 
so far we've really been focusing on
developing<00:00:03.750> good<00:00:04.110> techniques<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:05.000> learning

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
developing good techniques and learning

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.789 
developing good techniques and learning
how<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.299> bring<00:00:06.660> all<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.960> these<00:00:07.140> different

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
how to bring all of these different

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.730 
how to bring all of these different
elements<00:00:08.309> together<00:00:09.500> hopefully<00:00:10.500> with

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
elements together hopefully with

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.799 
elements together hopefully with
practice<00:00:11.370> you've<00:00:11.670> seen<00:00:11.969> improvements<00:00:12.719> in

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
practice you've seen improvements in

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.870 
practice you've seen improvements in
your<00:00:13.019> own<00:00:13.170> technique<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.549> you're<00:00:14.730> now

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
your own technique and that you're now

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.180 
your own technique and that you're now
starting<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.509> feel<00:00:15.900> much<00:00:16.320> more<00:00:16.590> confident

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
starting to feel much more confident

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.730 
starting to feel much more confident
when<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.550> pick<00:00:17.730> up<00:00:17.880> your<00:00:18.060> base

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
when you pick up your base

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.800 
when you pick up your base
please<00:00:19.740> remember<00:00:20.279> though<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.699> your<00:00:21.150> overall

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
please remember though that your overall

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.320 
please remember though that your overall
technique<00:00:22.380> will<00:00:22.859> always<00:00:23.580> continue<00:00:24.300> to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
technique will always continue to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.349 
technique will always continue to
develop<00:00:24.930> as<00:00:25.109> long<00:00:25.769> as<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.330> continue<00:00:27.330> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
develop as long as you continue to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.980 
develop as long as you continue to
challenge<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.310> so<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> motivational

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
challenge it so with the motivational

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.830 
challenge it so with the motivational
speech<00:00:31.260> over<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.830> now<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.059> introduce<00:00:33.390> you

speech over I now like to introduce you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.650 
speech over I now like to introduce you
to<00:00:34.050> our<00:00:34.079> next<00:00:34.590> area<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:34.980> study<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:36.120> world<00:00:36.420> of

to our next area of study the world of
scales<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.350> why<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.160> personally<00:00:39.030> feel<00:00:39.270> that

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
scales and why I personally feel that

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
scales and why I personally feel that
they're<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.020> fundamentally<00:00:40.980> important<00:00:41.520> to

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
they're so fundamentally important to

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
they're so fundamentally important to
every<00:00:42.480> bass<00:00:42.690> player<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:44.360> scale<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.690> be

every bass player a scale can be

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.380 
every bass player a scale can be
described<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> series<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> notes<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:48.210> can

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
described as a series of notes that can

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.750 
described as a series of notes that can
be<00:00:48.480> played<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.899> sequence<00:00:49.140> either<00:00:49.860> ascending

or descending in pitch when it comes to
playing<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.600> scale<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.469> typically<00:00:55.980> play<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
playing a scale we typically play the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.540 
playing a scale we typically play the
notes<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.000> order<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:58.520> starting<00:00:59.520> from

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
notes in order like this starting from

notes in order like this starting from
the<00:00:59.820> lowest<00:00:59.969> pitch<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.629> ending<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.530> the

of their original sequence to create

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.030 
of their original sequence to create

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
melodies and more importantly to us to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.230 
melodies and more importantly to us to
create<00:01:17.369> baselines<00:01:22.190> scales<00:01:23.190> differ<00:01:23.790> by

containing different sequences of notes

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.270 
containing different sequences of notes
and<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.630> turn<00:01:27.899> gives<00:01:27.930> each<00:01:28.500> scale<00:01:28.979> its

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and this in turn gives each scale its

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.899 
and this in turn gives each scale its
own<00:01:29.520> individual<00:01:30.270> sound<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.930> character<00:01:31.909> now

with<00:01:33.210> time<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.930> focus<00:01:34.470> practice<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.490> can

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
with time and focus practice we can

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.300 
with time and focus practice we can
successfully<00:01:36.210> train<00:01:36.869> our<00:01:37.110> musical<00:01:37.649> ear<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
successfully train our musical ear to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.730 
successfully train our musical ear to
identify<00:01:39.179> the<00:01:39.240> sound<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.810> any<00:01:40.050> particular

identify the sound of any particular
scale<00:01:41.119> for<00:01:42.119> example<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:43.200> might<00:01:43.440> have

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
scale for example you might have

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.320 
scale for example you might have
actually<00:01:44.039> recognizes<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.850> sound<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.240> the

actually recognizes the sound of the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.900 
actually recognizes the sound of the
scale<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.750> I've<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.140> been<00:01:46.259> using<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
scale that I've just been using so to

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.490 
scale that I've just been using so to
some<00:01:48.179> extent<00:01:48.210> you've<00:01:48.840> already<00:01:49.140> been

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
some extent you've already been

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.910 
some extent you've already been
developing<00:01:50.039> in<00:01:50.160> this<00:01:50.280> skill<00:01:50.840> now<00:01:51.920> hopefully

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
developing in this skill now hopefully

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.340 
developing in this skill now hopefully
I'm<00:01:53.130> sure<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.090> appreciate<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.750> just

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
I'm sure you can appreciate that just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
I'm sure you can appreciate that just
being<00:01:55.590> able<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.920> identify<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.729> sound<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.509> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
being able to identify the sound of a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.139 
being able to identify the sound of a
scale<00:01:57.869> isn't<00:01:58.470> really<00:01:59.039> all<00:01:59.190> that<00:01:59.280> useful<00:02:00.030> on

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
scale isn't really all that useful on

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.719 
scale isn't really all that useful on
its<00:02:00.300> own<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:01.350> sort<00:02:01.679> of<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:01.950> saying<00:02:02.220> yet

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
its own it's sort of like saying yet

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.219 
its own it's sort of like saying yet
well<00:02:03.060> I've<00:02:03.149> heard<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.390> before

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
well I've heard that before

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.080 
well I've heard that before
but<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> haven't<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:05.009> clue<00:02:05.039> what<00:02:05.429> to<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:05.789> it

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
but I haven't a clue what to do with it

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.290 
but I haven't a clue what to do with it
so<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:07.560> get<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> most<00:02:08.190> out<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.519> this

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so to get the most out of this

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.600 
so to get the most out of this
we<00:02:09.569> eventually<00:02:09.929> need<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.590> start<00:02:11.009> linking<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
we eventually need to start linking the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.690 
we eventually need to start linking the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
is how we can link the use of scales

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.220 
is how we can link the use of scales
with<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> chord<00:03:14.300> what<00:03:15.300> you'll<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.600> pleased<00:03:16.020> to

number<00:04:44.289> the<00:04:44.470> notes<00:04:44.710> in<00:04:44.889> sequence<00:04:45.400> as<00:04:45.610> I<00:04:45.970> play

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
number the notes in sequence as I play

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.969 
number the notes in sequence as I play
up<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.539> scale<00:04:47.190> so<00:04:48.190> now<00:04:48.729> we<00:04:48.789> have<00:04:49.210> one<00:04:49.979> two

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
up the scale so now we have one two

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:59.629 
up the scale so now we have one two
three<00:04:52.470> four<00:04:53.819> five<00:04:55.139> six<00:04:56.550> seven<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:57.729> eight

three four five six seven and eight

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.610 
three four five six seven and eight
hopefully<00:05:00.639> you<00:05:01.000> can<00:05:01.150> hear<00:05:01.479> that<00:05:01.659> the<00:05:01.780> 1st<00:05:02.319> and

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
hopefully you can hear that the 1st and

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.339 
hopefully you can hear that the 1st and
the<00:05:02.650> eighth<00:05:03.220> note<00:05:03.729> are<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.360> same<00:05:04.630> but<00:05:05.319> just

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
the eighth note are the same but just

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.240 
the eighth note are the same but just
played<00:05:05.889> an<00:05:06.099> octave<00:05:06.460> apart<00:05:06.580> in<00:05:07.560> fact<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:09.009> term

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
played an octave apart in fact the term

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.760 
played an octave apart in fact the term
a<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.030> which<00:05:10.810> is<00:05:10.960> often<00:05:11.380> written<00:05:11.560> on

a to the a which is often written on
musical<00:05:12.310> notation<00:05:12.909> is<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.419> simple<00:05:13.960> way<00:05:14.169> of

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
musical notation is a simple way of

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.050 
musical notation is a simple way of
telling<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.830> musician<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:15.550> play<00:05:15.580> what's

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
telling the musician to play what's

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.860 
telling the musician to play what's
written<00:05:16.360> but<00:05:16.930> an<00:05:17.080> octave<00:05:17.440> higher<00:05:17.969> so<00:05:18.969> if<00:05:19.270> we

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
written but an octave higher so if we

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.339 
written but an octave higher so if we
discount<00:05:20.469> the<00:05:20.590> octave<00:05:21.039> as<00:05:21.280> a<00:05:21.340> repeated<00:05:21.969> note

discount the octave as a repeated note

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.110 
discount the octave as a repeated note
we've<00:05:23.349> actually<00:05:23.650> only<00:05:24.430> got<00:05:24.580> 7<00:05:25.090> different

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.070 
we have to use notes to develop this

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.760
