00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.779
 and his 24 May is doing well 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.289
 point 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.949
 the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.570
 the 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.669
 all 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.550
 the event is bond bush which can change the head before the crisis 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.240
 works were there within four or five times per hp 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.490
 the and a moderate then we go to the outside through the herd that the 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.659
 open car market there 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.229
 the large pye boxes appear conjuring a screen to the outside dark 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:46.570
 has a display 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.410
 parts of the pitchers on top of the roof the two pieces before a flight the fireball 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.340
 one can bump from one to three meters a room one and a half meters 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.620
 section 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.640
 because flights under the stock exchange therefore 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.610
 we are one and two 40 large displays in one the large 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.530
 vidiwall are linked to each other 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.610
 we have internet on board digitally for two years 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.340
 supersonic the legs what is in it but too much list is also the chance 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.540
 makes mistakes 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.480
 handed out 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.480
 the 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.000
 the first for the technology of this whole bus why 22 with nothing 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.440
 the mek mini died the control here especially screen in the bus and the eu 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.890
 to control the whole from 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.860
 and the neck mini has the great advantage that it is very compact 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.170
 terminate individual components internally 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.490
 because we are going to bus printers it goes there is more 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.200
 since low power consumption reformation it paid very well 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.079
 and of course also of all sex it drives course I would kick and 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.939
 consistent and in addition we drive and a program that is called heretic list and 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.800
 that is specially made to 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.840
 knows the video between multiple machines across a network 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.960
 let them get to the end what if we all need these buses 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.410
 to keep trains 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.270
 and then we start with the tension 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.750
 with six actors 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.189
 those who drive like the bus let those on carien play a strong game of sound 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.579
 this is an inverter from the light protocol to ethernet 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.269
 and from the internet others do not see 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.590
 the whole concept is built on stilts in the day a few on sharp on screens and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.230
 called for content so you start with 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.499
 also with him on the 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:32.499
 We'll start with the screens here on the side 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.579
 then to the sea from one side and the 8 on the other 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.129
 then we have 13 on the ground 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.599
 to protect 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.729
 which we can make a video full of 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.589
 and therefore also allow things to roll through so that a can from one side 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.219
 can roll to the other side 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:54.339
 I forget that we have 2 almost full lectures here and I forget the 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:56.649
 screen one 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.229
 they are of course also included 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:04.149
 and then there is in the sale celebrate there are 4000 channels leds 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.859
 and there are also LED lighting under the seats 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.090
 why the econimical pastry box, for example, PCs with fiesta 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:23.519
 yes then you know the answer yourself I think 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.650
 there were very self here very stable it is very nice the 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.129
 driveways system ashton had video editing 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.439
 I still see a very secretive role in the eastern city 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.680
 amount to that and secretly in vende beneath in Ostend 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.969
 namely the problem if a windows machine had been used as voltage 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.530
 goes off for tension further on then maybe he is ever on or 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.319
 at least then close slowly 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.179
 did not stand the program but once what we have made is a brand 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:53.489
 mini but we turn around but turn there it became so far known what 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.039
 you can only get one for windows 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:59.689
 but as a result I anticipate that we will make shortcuts there 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:04.309
 that can be done by automatically starting up and that it is automatically in that to gap to one 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:05.289
 screen goes 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:08.549
 this became 22 every day with a mini cymbal in a bus 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.440
 and no not in the bus normally does not run events theater tv 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.959
 and there is also my light sound and video 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.180
 afterwards and for the video image we therefore use arranged pearls 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.800
 individuals here in this case file that off simply because of stealing mattel 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.490
 physically does not fit 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.029
 to close the bus with a mini tour 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:31.169
 I have seen a lot of equipment and how much does it cost me to build this into my 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.069
 own best example 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.279
 a lot of 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:39.439
 an estimate derijck i think you are cheering we have everything about a tuna 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.939
 together with screens and all the technology behind it there is atmosphere 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:44.129
 completely strange 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.069
 as I after all 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.590
 this bill of law 2 March is going to cost 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.020
 both were already for 12,000 euros or 3,000 euros 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.230
 no need of the market all day long, the question is who expects 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.889
 the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.150
 k
