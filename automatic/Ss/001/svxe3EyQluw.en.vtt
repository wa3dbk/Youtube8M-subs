00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.160
 This year everything is going fine 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.230
 It's been a great year getting good. 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.970
 is practically all my 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.630
 objectives that I have outlined since the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.980
 season is I think it owes a lot to 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.350
 my sponsors because they 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.320
 believe in my work then so 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.809
 both the high end equipment has all 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.059
 structure that interfered with this 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.629
 the athlete does not have that 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.850
 safety is always in the tests and have 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.420
 that support I think this year is 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.840
 one being the best year to date my 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.960
 career also passes through a great year 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.870
 they serve each other and that also last year 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.329
 boy son cured half desperate to 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.719
 three times and get me that it was going to be 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.030
 my first half and pierce for 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:07.310
 first time a last cup step 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.860
 here and what is it for me is such a dream 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.889
 International Cup title canopy us 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.359
 Do not dream for me, I always said that. 

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:18.079
 in my career since when I 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:19.700
 I started when I was in 2009 when I was 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.689
 for the first time a cup step 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.999
 I would say that I would win and 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.760
 Who knows, this year has nothing. 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:30.160
 guaranteed on the way 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.770
 sauÃ­pe coast that will decide 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.770
 but I will do everything my goal 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.980
 It's the international cup I'm getting. 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.800
 quite who knows if god willing 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.870
 conquer the title but have nothing 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.960
 still decided and will be there 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.500
 the female elite at a very strong pace 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:56.200
 I left strong and we went 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.600
 the joints is hollow and roberta 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.560
 half of the test was everyone together 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.560
 and erika attacked on a climb that I 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.160
 I thought she would leave and leave and real 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.460
 from patras get back to touch 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.630
 on her again and this was good for me 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.480
 because it gave that hey I'm still 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.440
 live in the test is as the boys 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.990
 have passed I thought it is now wise in the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.900
 wow, why do not we work 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.110
 able to do has the lowest is 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.410
 waste of energy and I went there 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.860
 with the boys, I managed to open a little 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.570
 Girls after aimar I 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.450
 I thought now I have to do strength. 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.540
 because if you do not get close to me there 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.030
 It will complicate and thanks God I got it. 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.030
 I took the boys' wheel to the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.350
 end and then at the end here in the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.760
 Asphalt I thought the now has to 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.030
 to arrive 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.640
 It's coming, it 's almost got to be already. 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.150
 table hurts me again thank god gave 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.840
 All right, you had an unforeseen 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.579
 eat bike with me doing great 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.760
 Happy and I only have to thank everyone. 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:17.220
 who twisted with me before fame where 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.230
 sponsors who believe in the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.209
 my work in this trust in me and 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.760
 My family, my mother went crazy. 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.959
 was calling me here on this mazda 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.689
 telephone 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.359
 and then when I called that happens these 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:33.180
 in this tone this happiness that they 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:36.120
 pass by from messi it was she who won 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.769
 so for me this is one of the main 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.599
 reasons I do is I love the bike 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.930
 for now no door to your family 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:49.049
 that I date that almost cried tournament 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.099
 coming then so to me is that 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:57.720
 reason that makes me train more and 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:00.120
 to believe more than I can is was to 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.040
 logic was the Canada stage 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.099
 it was my first world test 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.950
 I had never run with the girls before 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:12.889
 had run only Pan-American, but out of the 12 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:16.289
 13 this year occurs in the elite the pace there is 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:19.970
 This hallucinatory laurel but in the rear or 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:23.699
 motorbike and butter in the evening that we come 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.370
 creating and I think I'm missing a bit 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.220
 This is how you get used to this. 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.669
 rhythm than the rhythm is too intense 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.949
 this start and is the one I paid with 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.220
 almost I can not go wrong 44 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:41.520
 girls that were on the list and that's how it is 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.139
 You breathe, it's sweet, but first you're going to take 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.380
 water plus workout 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.350
 are thus missing this rhythm and with a 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.570
 huge experience for me and I go 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.260
 Are you Brazilian with a lot of luggage? 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.020
 great of learning rcts in the next 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.070
 Today's stage may occur is going to be 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.650
 different 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.930
 was half lost knew nothing will 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.680
 Olympic champion looks another champion 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.210
 the world of kogi was then defined as 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.200
 best in the world here 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.030
 so it was was was very good for me 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.350
 I think it was very valid 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.490
 is the proof is very intense the very track 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.590
 technical 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.530
 I think there is a little bit of this simple 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.140
 Brazilian athletes need to be running 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.330
 because it's different very different here 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:34.590
 because the rhythm is also there 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:37.530
 strong that there are many athletes 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.530
 so you have that battle time 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.030
 whole because if you miss you lose 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.790
 three positions 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.380
 Just for you, I do not see it for me. 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.060
 being very large both world-wide 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.940
 now in south africa 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.150
 it will also be much more difficult there 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.850
 Why are the girls even use the workshop? 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.440
 in preparation for the world that is 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.350
 single proof 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.350
 then who wins the world champion then 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.630
 I also came in with a win to win 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.510
 experience to try to enter 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.030
 to gain more technique because the track 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.020
 in France is one of the most 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.570
 world 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.690
 so I'm going to and fro 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.970
 to improve is to gradually the same people have 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.460
 who try to run outside and if god 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.250
 I want to run next year. 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.770
 more steps of the world kan if it is are the 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.710
 more difficult and after the world 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:36.330
 fight back as much as possible give the 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:38.260
 my maximum to scratch if God wants to give 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.770
 all right too 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.770
 leaves
