00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
I think San Fox thought he was going

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.510 
I think San Fox thought he was going
over<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.380> parry<00:02:07.590> yeah<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.950> started<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> throw

over the parry yeah I started to throw
and<00:02:08.729> then<00:02:08.790> got<00:02:08.940> even<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.270> high<00:02:09.450> counter

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
and then got even with high counter

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.570 
and then got even with high counter
damage<00:02:09.990> yeah<00:02:10.290> and<00:02:10.530> being<00:02:10.679> at<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:11.130> less<00:02:11.400> than

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
damage yeah and being at like less than

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.070 
damage yeah and being at like less than
2<00:02:11.700> percent<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:12.030> your<00:02:12.090> life<00:02:12.150> left<00:02:12.510> that's<00:02:12.600> it's

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
2 percent of your life left that's it's

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.200 
2 percent of your life left that's it's
pretty<00:02:13.470> much<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.620> guess<00:02:13.860> which<00:02:14.130> way<00:02:14.370> you

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
pretty much a guess which way you

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.340 
pretty much a guess which way you
believe<00:02:15.540> your<00:02:15.690> opponent's<00:02:16.020> going<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.260> go

match<00:03:01.920> where<00:03:02.250> sonic<00:03:02.519> box<00:03:02.760> chose<00:03:03.000> not<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.209> bite

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
match where sonic box chose not to bite

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.380 
match where sonic box chose not to bite
on<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.080> first<00:03:04.769> gun<00:03:05.070> there<00:03:05.340> whereas<00:03:06.000> before<00:03:06.090> he

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
on the first gun there whereas before he

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.940 
on the first gun there whereas before he
held<00:03:06.600> from<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.560> handstand<00:03:08.160> attack<00:03:09.709> going<00:03:10.709> for

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
held from the handstand attack going for

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.830 
held from the handstand attack going for
the<00:03:11.010> marionette<00:03:11.340> wheel<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:12.540> could<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.750> been

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
the marionette wheel it could have been

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.020 
the marionette wheel it could have been
a<00:03:12.900> bat<00:03:13.290> turn<00:03:13.500> set<00:03:13.739> up<00:03:13.860> I'm<00:03:14.550> sure<00:03:14.700> many<00:03:14.880> will

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
a bat turn set up I'm sure many will

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.280 
a bat turn set up I'm sure many will
take<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.269> into<00:03:15.390> louder<00:03:15.630> than<00:03:16.050> that<00:03:16.140> again

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
take that into louder than that again

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.630 
take that into louder than that again
that<00:03:16.500> was<00:03:16.590> because<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.220> marionette<00:03:17.550> we

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that was because the marionette we

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.710 
that was because the marionette we
always<00:03:17.820> uses<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.090> free<00:03:18.239> stepping<00:03:18.570> system

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
always uses the free stepping system

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.449 
always uses the free stepping system
which<00:03:19.050> can<00:03:19.200> we<00:03:19.290> make<00:03:19.410> hair<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.739> go<00:03:19.860> off<00:03:20.010> axes

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
which can we make hair just go off axes

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.100 
which can we make hair just go off axes
yeah<00:03:20.790> more<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.300> than<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.480> normal<00:03:21.720> side<00:03:21.870> steps

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
yeah more so than the normal side steps

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.020 
yeah more so than the normal side steps
commands<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.500> said<00:03:22.709> yeah<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:23.190> he<00:03:23.580> kept<00:03:23.850> going

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
commands I said yeah so he kept going

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.400

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.770 
interesting changes made to Hayabusa is
with<00:04:05.950> this<00:04:06.069> quarter<00:04:06.340> circle<00:04:06.609> back<00:04:06.819> punch

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
with this quarter circle back punch

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.110 
with this quarter circle back punch
attack<00:04:08.109> it<00:04:08.469> used<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.829> leave<00:04:08.980> him<00:04:09.129> at<00:04:09.250> plus<00:04:09.549> or

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
attack it used to leave him at plus or

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.020 
attack it used to leave him at plus or
advantage<00:04:10.689> and<00:04:10.900> now<00:04:11.019> he's<00:04:11.260> negative<00:04:11.909> so<00:04:12.909> it's

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
advantage and now he's negative so it's

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.429 
advantage and now he's negative so it's
a<00:04:13.150> different<00:04:13.510> type<00:04:13.540> of<00:04:13.659> meta<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.109> he<00:04:14.199> has<00:04:14.349> to

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
a different type of meta that he has to

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.140 
a different type of meta that he has to
deal<00:04:14.650> with<00:04:14.859> him<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.219> sonic<00:04:15.669> Fox<00:04:15.819> takes<00:04:16.030> that

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
deal with him and sonic Fox takes that

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.199

I'm<00:04:29.560> gonna<00:04:29.680> say<00:04:29.830> I<00:04:29.860> was<00:04:30.040> about<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.280> say<00:04:30.430> that

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
master could still come back but I think

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.860 
master could still come back but I think
the<00:04:33.010> stage<00:04:33.630> yeah

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
the stage yeah

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.570 
the stage yeah
the<00:04:35.560> stage<00:04:35.740> is<00:04:35.860> gonna<00:04:35.950> dictate<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:36.370> match

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
the stage is gonna dictate this match

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.670 
the stage is gonna dictate this match
honestly<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:37.180> lot<00:04:37.390> more<00:04:37.600> than<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.080> characters

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
honestly a lot more than the characters

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.240 
honestly a lot more than the characters
match<00:04:38.830> up

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
match up

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.980 
match up
I<00:04:39.280> think<00:04:39.760> Manny's<00:04:40.240> always<00:04:40.450> hoping<00:04:40.720> they<00:04:40.840> get

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
I think Manny's always hoping they get

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.870 
I think Manny's always hoping they get
that<00:04:41.110> random<00:04:41.530> luck<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.830> getting<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.160> dragon

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
to be very very difficult for for sonic

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.390 
to be very very difficult for for sonic

box to make it out alive and of course

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.650 
box to make it out alive and of course
you<00:04:51.490> again<00:04:51.700> we<00:04:51.850> didn't<00:04:52.030> get<00:04:52.090> a<00:04:52.150> ceiling<00:04:52.390> stage

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
though so we'll see interesting

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.690 
though so we'll see interesting
Constitution<00:04:59.110> that's<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.950> superhero<00:05:00.460> pack<00:05:00.610> I

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
Constitution that's the superhero pack I

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.070 
Constitution that's the superhero pack I
believe<00:05:00.880> I<00:05:01.470> think<00:05:03.690> Manny's<00:05:04.690> got<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:04.900> make<00:05:05.020> an

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
believe I think Manny's got to make an

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.020 
believe I think Manny's got to make an
adjustment<00:05:05.170> here<00:05:05.560> when<00:05:05.860> he's<00:05:06.040> he's<00:05:06.760> in<00:05:06.970> a

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
adjustment here when he's he's in a

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.260 
adjustment here when he's he's in a
situation<00:05:07.180> where<00:05:07.810> he's<00:05:08.050> minus<00:05:08.380> 2<00:05:08.530> or<00:05:08.650> minus<00:05:08.770> 1

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.830 

he's<00:05:13.840> not<00:05:14.050> falling<00:05:14.380> for<00:05:14.410> that<00:05:14.650> well<00:05:15.009> he's<00:05:15.370> not

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
he's not falling for that well he's not

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.240 
he's not falling for that well he's not
and<00:05:16.840> I<00:05:16.900> think<00:05:16.930> sometimes<00:05:17.289> it's<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:17.889> bit<00:05:18.069> of<00:05:18.160> a

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
and I think sometimes it's a bit of a

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.620 
and I think sometimes it's a bit of a
reactive<00:05:18.699> thing<00:05:18.970> when<00:05:19.150> you<00:05:19.240> can<00:05:19.419> see<00:05:19.539> it

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
reactive thing when you can see it

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.499 
reactive thing when you can see it
offline<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:21.009> mix-up<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:21.669> was<00:05:22.180> just<00:05:22.449> a

offline the mix-up I was just a

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.290 
offline the mix-up I was just a
sidestepping<00:05:22.960> in<00:05:23.110> that<00:05:23.229> point<00:05:23.410> but<00:05:23.710> yeah

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
sidestepping in that point but yeah
