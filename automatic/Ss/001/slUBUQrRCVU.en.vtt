00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.170
 cloudy 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.740
 this photo has been digitalized with a rgb color photo 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.609
 although they are black and white 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.020
 this is because you want to use the color information of the file 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.839
 stop the color truth or the photo 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.660
 if you are not working in rgb color is to say if you have a photo in scale of 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:32.129
 grays you can easily convert the image to increase depth of color 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.410
 color rgb 8 10 per channel 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.250
 as you can see this new part this option because the photo is already in 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.510
 colour 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.620
 next we are going to paint the picture Pablo that I recommend to use a 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.850
 graphical tablet sensitive to pressure as this will greatly facilitate the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.090
 paint the photos by hand 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.520
 then we select the brush 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.540
 and with the graphic tablet we click on a green 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.440
 If you start painting the sheets you will see that all the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.940
 details of the leaves 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.810
 how I do not want them to hide 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 let's go to edition 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.890
 to approach excel 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.830
 we need to change the mix mode found here in the bar 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.650
 options 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.650
 and select color 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.530
 the only aspect that will be affected now is the color 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.050
 we painted this area 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.460
 but as you can see the result is too bright and 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.480
 gaudy 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.110
 so we will use edition 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.070
 undo brush paint 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.280
 what I need is to increase the sensitivity to the pressure of the pencil 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.250
 for this we are going to see 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.370
 pallets and we select brush variation 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.670
 and now I can select the options associated with the graphic tablet 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.870
 in fact I'm just going to change the saturation to the pressure 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.860
 the thing that we are going to do now 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.610
 is to go to the materials palette and select a better green 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.570
 in the sample I already have a green 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.280
 but it is very easy to define the colors you want, just create a 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.280
 new sample and assign it a unique name 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.339
 let's call extend four 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.039
 we click on accept 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.879
 and now I can choose a green from among my favorite greens 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.099
 I'm here 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.099
 and accept 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.339
 is added to the sample list and is highlighted in it 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:38.269
 Click to activate it so you can paint and increase saturation 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.269
 varying the pressure exerted on the brush 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.640
 if we make a light stroke decreases the transat duration 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.129
 It is quite laborious to paint everything by hand but it is convenient to avoid using the same 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.970
 colour 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.629
 in a uniform way 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.059
 just like what I did here 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:04.609
 it is much better to slightly vary the pressure on the brush in tocoa 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:05.480
 section 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.480
 to create a little more texture 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:13.959
 you need to practice a bit to do it well add also more parts 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.149
 dark here and there 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.149
 to provide shading 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.869
 here we can use another baby to vary 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.509
 and darken the background 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:28.369
 You can also paint the other section with the new green 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.639
 and so use different tonalities in the same area 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:37.859
 if you check the photo checked that you're really just improving the tone 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.499
 and that the area of ​​the image is not affected 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.499
 it's just the color 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:49.119
 now let's also paint the girl's blue dress 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.290
 so I'm going to choose a blue and chop several light brush strokes 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:08.229
 if the hue that is too dark uses somewhat lighter strokes 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:11.780
 all this takes a long time but it is a matter 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.780
 to insist a little 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.489
 if you do not have a graphic tablet 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.990
 you can vary the opacity and reduce the 48 and use the mouse to add some 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.999
 scissors shadows 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:27.999
 I'm going to apply a golden color to the mass as well 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.860
 we can vary the size of the brush if we keep pressing the key to the tpi 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.860
 move the pencil up or down 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:53.069
 in areas like this where we have left, we can zoom in and choose another 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.969
 color with which to write the errors 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.620
 we are not destroying the image at all this color is dark peace 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.620
 but just to give a general idea 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.809
 another way of doing it would be by selecting first 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:15.439
 archive 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:19.999
 discard changes to return the image to its original state 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:22.879
 and then create new layers 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:27.249
 I'm going to use less pressure and set the normal and use the opacity with the 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:29.400
 graphic tablet 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.350
 Now we are going to create a new raster layer that we will call trees 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.400
 click on accept select the green 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.409
 and paint the trees of the new layer 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.710
 we will zoom out a bit to see better what we are doing 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:58.360
 we've covered the bottom a bit because 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.969
 the blend mode of the layer must also be set 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.210
 in color 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.479
 you will see what once this is done 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.969
 again the background 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:13.789
 The biggest advantage of using layers is that you can make constant adjustments 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.869
 if you want to create another raster layer over 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:19.990
 what are we going to call trees 2 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.189
 you can define the mix mode here 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:26.189
 and then add more color in certain areas 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.780
 it's a much better method of working than painting on the original image 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.750
 since the draft can be used to eliminate errors and return to 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.369
 paint from scratch 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:51.449
 we can create a new layer for each of the elements of the photo 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:08.399
 the girl's dress her face the table 

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.500
 the bottom 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.539
 the carpet 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:12.439
 etc 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:15.879
 It will take us a long time but the results will be worth it
