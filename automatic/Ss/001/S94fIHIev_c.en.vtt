hurricane here it is it's still in the

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.880 
hurricane here it is it's still in the
box<00:00:14.000> I<00:00:14.300> just<00:00:14.330> pulled<00:00:14.780> it<00:00:14.960> out<00:00:17.710> supposedly<00:00:18.710> it's

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
box I just pulled it out supposedly it's

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.749 
box I just pulled it out supposedly it's
got<00:00:19.130> this<00:00:20.590> button<00:00:21.590> here<00:00:22.040> that<00:00:22.070> when<00:00:22.340> you<00:00:22.399> click

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.580 
got this button here that when you click
it's<00:00:22.970> supposed<00:00:23.270> to<00:00:23.390> do<00:00:23.570> tricks<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.320> don't<00:00:24.500> know

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
it's supposed to do tricks I don't know

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.819 
it's supposed to do tricks I don't know
exactly<00:00:24.710> what's<00:00:25.189> supposed<00:00:25.279> to<00:00:25.610> do<00:00:25.779> but<00:00:26.829> we'll

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
exactly what's supposed to do but we'll

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.139 
exactly what's supposed to do but we'll
find<00:00:28.009> out<00:00:28.570> okay<00:00:29.570> so<00:00:29.630> like<00:00:30.559> all<00:00:30.739> the<00:00:30.770> other

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:31.149 
find out okay so like all the other

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.660 
find out okay so like all the other
aeroplanes<00:00:32.149> and<00:00:32.419> just<00:00:32.689> this<00:00:33.290> one's<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.800> one

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
aeroplanes and just this one's a one

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.130 
aeroplanes and just this one's a one
motor<00:00:34.940> prop<00:00:36.010> with<00:00:37.010> your<00:00:37.190> charge<00:00:37.780> port<00:00:38.780> and

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
motor prop with your charge port and

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.310 
motor prop with your charge port and
this<00:00:40.039> one<00:00:40.190> comes<00:00:40.429> with<00:00:40.519> a<00:00:40.670> router<00:00:41.449> a<00:00:41.809> real

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
this one comes with a router a real

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.750 
this one comes with a router a real
working<00:00:42.739> rudder<00:00:42.980> in<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.250> back<00:00:44.410> your<00:00:45.410> Tanna

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
working rudder in the back your Tanna

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.910 
working rudder in the back your Tanna
and<00:00:47.410> of<00:00:48.410> course<00:00:48.710> your<00:00:49.039> transmitter<00:00:49.670> I<00:00:50.800> turn<00:00:51.800> it

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
and of course your transmitter I turn it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.639 
and of course your transmitter I turn it
on<00:00:52.039> I<00:00:52.100> was<00:00:52.609> really<00:00:52.640> excited<00:00:53.210> to<00:00:53.269> see<00:00:53.469> what<00:00:54.469> this

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
on I was really excited to see what this

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.049 
on I was really excited to see what this
trick<00:00:55.100> thing<00:00:55.309> they're<00:00:55.550> talking<00:00:55.760> about

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
trick thing they're talking about

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.549 
trick thing they're talking about
supposed<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.539> do<00:00:56.690> or<00:00:56.899> do<00:00:58.420> rolls<00:00:59.420> loops<00:00:59.989> and

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
supposed to do or do rolls loops and

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.540 
supposed to do or do rolls loops and
that<00:01:00.920> kind<00:01:01.159> of<00:01:01.190> thing

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
that kind of thing

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.270 
that kind of thing
so<00:01:01.699> I<00:01:02.170> kind<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.230> found<00:01:03.350> out<00:01:03.559> what<00:01:03.739> it<00:01:03.829> does<00:01:03.859> all

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
so I kind of found out what it does all

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.510 
so I kind of found out what it does all
it<00:01:04.309> does<00:01:04.550> is<00:01:04.699> when<00:01:04.850> you're<00:01:05.000> flying<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.449> it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
it does is when you're flying it it

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.050 
it does is when you're flying it it
really<00:01:07.520> really<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:09.220> propeller<00:01:10.220> on<00:01:10.369> it<00:01:10.430> the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
really really the propeller on it the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.690 
really really the propeller on it the
thrust<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:11.509> just<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.680> throttle<00:01:13.100> just<00:01:13.310> goes<00:01:13.490> up

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
thrust I just the throttle just goes up

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.039 
thrust I just the throttle just goes up
a<00:01:13.939> lot<00:01:14.149> here's<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.020> max<00:01:15.320> on<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.680> throttle<00:01:16.070> and

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
a lot here's the max on the throttle and

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.880 
a lot here's the max on the throttle and
then<00:01:18.049> when<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:18.320> use<00:01:18.469> the<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:19.159> little<00:01:19.369> orange

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
then when you use the that little orange

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.960 
then when you use the that little orange
button

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.480 

so<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:26.960> can<00:01:27.170> hear<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.470> difference<00:01:27.920> throttle

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
so you can hear the difference throttle

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.960 
so you can hear the difference throttle
just<00:01:28.670> increases<00:01:29.480> probably<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:29.960> good<00:01:30.970> 30%

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
just increases probably a good 30%

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:40.180 
just increases probably a good 30%
throttle<00:01:32.480> so<00:01:32.990> we'll<00:01:33.140> see<00:01:33.320> how<00:01:33.440> it<00:01:33.560> flies<00:01:39.190> this

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
throttle so we'll see how it flies this

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.180 
throttle so we'll see how it flies this
is<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.520> Air<00:01:40.700> Hogs<00:01:41.260> stunt<00:01:42.260> flyer<00:01:42.590> we're<00:01:42.920> known

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
is the Air Hogs stunt flyer we're known

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:55.960 
is the Air Hogs stunt flyer we're known
as<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.810> hurricane

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.640 

I've<00:01:56.970> gone<00:01:57.120> to<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:58.280> orange<00:01:59.280> bun

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:21.330 

but<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.010> more<00:02:03.220> fun<00:02:03.550> on<00:02:03.760> their<00:02:04.030> dog<00:02:04.330> loose

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:43.650 

again

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.760 

this<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.440> actually<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.890> first<00:02:46.770> aeroplanes

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
this is actually the first aeroplanes

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.530 
this is actually the first aeroplanes
out<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.190> box<00:02:48.520> that<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:48.910> can<00:02:49.120> actually<00:02:49.240> do

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
out of the box that I can actually do

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.290 
out of the box that I can actually do
trick<00:02:49.870> list<00:02:50.190> actually<00:02:51.190> very<00:02:51.610> cool<00:02:51.880> plane<00:02:52.150> to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
trick list actually very cool plane to

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.839 
trick list actually very cool plane to
fly

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.199 

controls<00:03:00.780> are<00:03:00.900> not<00:03:01.079> bad<00:03:01.730> better<00:03:02.730> than<00:03:03.030> most

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
controls are not bad better than most

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.860 
controls are not bad better than most
aeroplanes<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.319> flow<00:03:04.939> and<00:03:05.939> there's<00:03:06.569> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
aeroplanes that I flow and there's the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:23.990 
aeroplanes that I flow and there's the
warrant<00:03:07.530> fun

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.730 

when<00:03:24.570> I'm<00:03:24.660> in<00:03:24.690> trouble<00:03:24.960> I<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.470> skip<00:03:25.620> that

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
when I'm in trouble I just skip that

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.680 
when I'm in trouble I just skip that
warranty<00:03:26.130> button<00:03:26.490> and<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.150> picks<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.450> plane

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
warranty button and it picks the plane

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:49.220 
warranty button and it picks the plane
right<00:03:27.900> up<00:03:28.820> there<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:29.910> go<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:31.500> loop
