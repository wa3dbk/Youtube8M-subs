know<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.250> think<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.029> season<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.390> harder<00:00:27.779> to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
know I think this season is harder to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.470 
know I think this season is harder to
predict<00:00:28.380> because<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.760> votes<00:00:30.210> from

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
predict because it's this votes from

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.940 
predict because it's this votes from
last<00:00:30.810> week<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:34.500> weird<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.860> see

last week so you know it's weird to see

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.319 
last week so you know it's weird to see
if<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.130> might<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.370> killed<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.760> tonight<00:00:35.880> and

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
if you might have killed it tonight and

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.400 
if you might have killed it tonight and
then<00:00:36.390> you're<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.930> go<00:00:36.989> home<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
then you're like and you go home and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.709 
then you're like and you go home and
wait<00:00:37.559> wait<00:00:38.070> what<00:00:38.309> happened<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.450> them<00:00:39.540> because

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
wait wait what happened but them because

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.330

for<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.140> week<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:44.309> hard<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.579> predict

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
for this week so it's hard to predict

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.270
