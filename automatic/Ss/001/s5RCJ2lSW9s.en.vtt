how<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.739> become<00:02:09.920> leaner<00:02:10.399> not<00:02:10.789> just<00:02:11.060> skinny

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
how to become leaner not just skinny

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.360 
how to become leaner not just skinny
because<00:02:11.690> skinnies<00:02:12.470> not<00:02:12.650> necessarily<00:02:13.190> healthy

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
because skinnies not necessarily healthy

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.369 
because skinnies not necessarily healthy
being<00:02:13.910> lean<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.390> what<00:02:14.569> matters<00:02:14.870> most

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
being lean is what matters most

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.229 
being lean is what matters most
improving<00:02:15.830> lean<00:02:16.010> body<00:02:16.340> mass<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.940> that

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
improving lean body mass and that

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.270 
improving lean body mass and that
happens<00:02:17.569> by<00:02:17.720> either<00:02:17.900> increasing<00:02:18.230> muscle<00:02:19.099> mass

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
happens by either increasing muscle mass

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.790 
happens by either increasing muscle mass
reducing<00:02:20.180> fat<00:02:20.420> mass<00:02:20.690> or<00:02:21.019> a<00:02:21.050> combination<00:02:21.440> of

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
reducing fat mass or a combination of

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.890 
reducing fat mass or a combination of
both<00:02:21.860> now<00:02:22.640> why<00:02:22.819> do<00:02:22.879> I<00:02:23.030> say<00:02:23.060> it's<00:02:23.300> an<00:02:23.569> important

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
both now why do I say it's an important

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.800 
both now why do I say it's an important
to<00:02:23.989> become<00:02:24.160> leaner<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.459> not<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:25.940> skinnier

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
to become leaner and not just skinnier

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.080 
to become leaner and not just skinnier
