tutorial for you guys how to do it so
well<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.980> looks<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.579> got<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> normal

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
well it looks like we just got a normal

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.790 
well it looks like we just got a normal
room<00:00:33.360> here<00:00:33.540> nothing<00:00:33.899> really<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.620> on

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
room here nothing really going on

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160 
room here nothing really going on
special<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.670> then<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.210> take<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> piece<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
special here and then we take a piece of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
special here and then we take a piece of
cobblestone<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.860> chuck<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.489> over<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.820> side

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
cobblestone and chuck it over the side

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.930 
cobblestone and chuck it over the side
and<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.899> will<00:00:40.800> fall<00:00:41.040> through<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> floor<00:00:41.340> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
and we will fall through the floor so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 
and we will fall through the floor so
I'm<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
I'm just like that and we have like a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.389 
I'm just like that and we have like a
secret<00:00:44.789> room<00:00:45.149> or<00:00:45.360> whatever<00:00:45.510> down<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
secret room or whatever down here and

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.860 
secret room or whatever down here and
yeah<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.420> probably<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.680> most<00:00:49.890> simple

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
yeah that it's probably the most simple

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.400 
yeah that it's probably the most simple
trap<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:52.140> secret<00:00:52.590> door<00:00:52.920> I've<00:00:53.160> ever<00:00:53.489> seen<00:00:53.969> in

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
trap or secret door I've ever seen in

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.939 
trap or secret door I've ever seen in
Minecraft<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.770> um<00:00:56.059> yeah<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.739> let's<00:00:58.739> take<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
Minecraft so um yeah so let's take a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
Minecraft so um yeah so let's take a
look<00:00:59.100> at<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.329> x-ray<00:01:00.930> version

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
look at it this is the the x-ray version

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
look at it this is the the x-ray version
of<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.620> whatever<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.949> want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> call<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
of it or whatever you want to call it

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.320 
of it or whatever you want to call it
and<00:01:02.579> what<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.159> picture<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and what it is it's just a picture and a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.140 
and what it is it's just a picture and a
pressure<00:01:06.840> plate<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.830> torch<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.850> sticky

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
pressure plate the torch and a sticky

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
pressure plate the torch and a sticky
piston<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.689> that's<00:01:09.869> literally<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
piston and that's literally all it is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.609 
piston and that's literally all it is
once<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.310> put<00:01:11.549> something<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:14.299> the

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
once you put something on the the

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.969 
once you put something on the the
pressure<00:01:16.619> plate<00:01:17.150> show<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.979> it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
pressure plate show you know it

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.490 
pressure plate show you know it
completely<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:21.110> presses<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.290> pressure

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
completely just presses the pressure

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.469 
completely just presses the pressure
plate<00:01:22.650> once<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.580> actually<00:01:23.790> pick<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
plate once and you actually pick up the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.210 
plate once and you actually pick up the
items<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:24.990> never<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.380> lose<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> items

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
items so you never really lose the items

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.190 
items so you never really lose the items
like<00:01:26.369> put<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.610> torch<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.810> see<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> won't

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
like put the torch you can see I won't

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.300 
like put the torch you can see I won't
get<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> torch<00:01:28.650> back<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:30.799> then<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.979> will<00:01:32.130> fall

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
get the torch back and then I will fall

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
get the torch back and then I will fall
through<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.549> floor<00:01:32.610> also<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.780> that's<00:01:33.930> pretty

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
through the floor also so that's pretty

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.539 
through the floor also so that's pretty
cool<00:01:34.350> um<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.159> yeah<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.770> so<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.070> then<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.369> all

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
cool um so yeah and so and then it all

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.370 
cool um so yeah and so and then it all
resets<00:01:39.090> itself<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> everything<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.200> it's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
resets itself and everything and it's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.050 
resets itself and everything and it's
just<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.920> most<00:01:41.100> simplest<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.970> I've

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
just the most simplest when I think I've

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.780 
just the most simplest when I think I've
ever<00:01:42.240> seen<00:01:42.630> before<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.560> yeah<00:01:43.799> let's<00:01:44.399> go<00:01:44.549> build

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
ever seen before so yeah let's go build

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.910 
ever seen before so yeah let's go build
it<00:01:44.909> right<00:01:45.060> now<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:45.810> actually<00:01:46.439> show<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it right now I will actually show you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.969 
it right now I will actually show you
guys<00:01:47.070> how<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.310> build<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.649> really<00:01:49.649> don't<00:01:49.829> need

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
guys how to build if I really don't need

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.880 
guys how to build if I really don't need
to<00:01:50.130> show<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.340> guys<00:01:50.460> tutorial<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.960> give

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
me building it so your place this is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.050 
me building it so your place this is
will<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> floor<00:01:56.159> right<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:57.030> you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
will be the floor right here and you

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.850 
will be the floor right here and you
place<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.450> sticky<00:01:57.810> piston<00:01:58.200> actually<00:01:58.649> one

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
place the sticky piston actually one

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.570 
place the sticky piston actually one
more<00:01:58.890> back

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
more back

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.630 
more back
oh<00:02:02.480> then<00:02:03.480> you<00:02:03.600> place<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:05.060> lock<00:02:06.060> right<00:02:06.090> there<00:02:06.300> a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
oh then you place a lock right there a

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.200 
oh then you place a lock right there a
torch<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:08.790> here<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:10.310> right<00:02:11.310> there<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.730> then
