00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
AQA GCSE computer science course it's

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.700 
AQA GCSE computer science course it's
all<00:00:11.070> about<00:00:11.250> query<00:00:11.639> methods<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.360> about<00:00:13.320> SQL

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
all about query methods and about SQL

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.829 
all about query methods and about SQL
and<00:00:14.099> how<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.610> certain<00:00:14.969> things<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.240> SQL<00:00:15.660> so

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
and how to do certain things in SQL so

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.320 
and how to do certain things in SQL so
that's<00:00:16.020> very<00:00:16.170> very<00:00:16.440> exciting<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.730> well

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
that's very very exciting I have well

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.960 
that's very very exciting I have well
and<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.350> how<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.650> look<00:00:19.859> at<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.850> I'd

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
and and how you look at it and but I'd

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.279 
and and how you look at it and but I'd
recommend<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> check<00:00:21.539> out<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> last<00:00:22.020> few

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
recommend you to check out the last few

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.650 
recommend you to check out the last few
videos<00:00:22.320> or<00:00:22.740> like<00:00:22.859> databases<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.730> because

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
videos or like databases and because

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.000 
videos or like databases and because
some<00:00:24.869> things<00:00:24.900> may<00:00:25.199> be<00:00:25.260> confusing<00:00:25.800> if<00:00:25.980> you

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
some things may be confusing if you

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.330 
some things may be confusing if you
don't<00:00:26.130> already<00:00:26.550> know<00:00:27.500> what<00:00:28.500> what<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.220> were

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
don't already know what what we were

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.730 
don't already know what what we were
talking<00:00:29.609> about<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.090> let's<00:00:30.990> first<00:00:31.199> look<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
talking about so let's first look what a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.530 
talking about so let's first look what a
query<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.340> obviously<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> topic

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
query is obviously it's in the topic

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.299 
query is obviously it's in the topic
title<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.110> very<00:00:34.290> important<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> note<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
title so very important to note is and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.850 
title so very important to note is and
it's<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.120> question<00:00:36.420> posed<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.440> database

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it's a question posed to the database

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.430 
it's a question posed to the database
obviously<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> query<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.480> database

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
obviously this is a query in a database

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.130 
obviously this is a query in a database
scenario<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.370> database<00:00:41.790> context<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:43.020> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
scenario the database context this is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.110 
scenario the database context this is
done<00:00:43.350> using<00:00:43.500> SQL<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.250> SQL<00:00:44.640> stands<00:00:45.000> for

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
done using SQL and SQL stands for

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.810 
done using SQL and SQL stands for
structured<00:00:45.600> query<00:00:46.050> language<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
structured query language and it's a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.220 
structured query language and it's a
programming<00:00:48.270> language<00:00:48.300> designed<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.020> manage

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
programming language designed to manage

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.459 
programming language designed to manage
like<00:00:49.610> they're<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:51.239> manage<00:00:51.570> data<00:00:51.809> within<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
like they're to manage data within a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.950 
like they're to manage data within a
relational<00:00:52.949> database<00:00:53.660> again<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.780> talked

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
relational database again we talked

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.139 
relational database again we talked
about<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:56.010> last<00:00:56.160> topic<00:00:56.399> especially<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:57.030> all

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
about the last topic especially is all

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.560 
about the last topic especially is all
about<00:00:57.300> relational<00:00:57.690> databases<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.469> so

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
about relational databases and so

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.340 
about relational databases and so
example<00:01:00.570> requires<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.820> free<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
example requires you to know and free a

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.899 
example requires you to know and free a
free<00:01:04.640> sort<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.990> statements<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.200> SQL<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.850> we

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
free sort of statements in SQL and so we

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.179 
free sort of statements in SQL and so we
look<00:01:09.060> at<00:01:09.180> them<00:01:09.299> now<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.799> there's<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.159> know

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
look at them now and there's you know

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.370 
look at them now and there's you know
SQL<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> complete<00:01:12.270> language<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.110> loads

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
SQL is a complete language so it's loads

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.899 
SQL is a complete language so it's loads
and<00:01:13.590> loads<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.830> statements<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.369> use<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and loads of statements you can use and

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.060 
and loads of statements you can use and
but<00:01:15.570> fortunately<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.320> example<00:01:16.770> doesn't

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
but fortunately the example doesn't

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.410 
but fortunately the example doesn't
require<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.520> know<00:01:17.759> most<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> hard

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
require you to know most of the hard

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.440 
require you to know most of the hard
ones<00:01:18.659> these<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.380> fairly<00:01:19.530> simple<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.880> by

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
ones these are fairly simple and and by

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.570 
ones these are fairly simple and and by
the<00:01:21.479> way<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.990> ask<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.860> exam<00:01:23.250> to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the way they can ask you in the exam to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.600 
the way they can ask you in the exam to
just<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.680> they'll<00:01:26.310> just

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
just you know just do this they'll just

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.270 
just you know just do this they'll just
give<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> scenario<00:01:27.720> asks<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.500> write<00:01:28.979> some

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
give you scenario asks you to write some

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.920 
give you scenario asks you to write some
of<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.430> code<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.420> important<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.810> know

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
of this code so it's important you know

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.749 
of this code so it's important you know
it<00:01:31.079> don't<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.350> assume<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.280> they<00:01:32.400> won't<00:01:32.549> ask

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
it don't just assume that they won't ask

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.670 
it don't just assume that they won't ask
you<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.360> probably<00:01:33.810> will<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.290> it'd

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
you because they probably will and it'd

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.990 
you because they probably will and it'd
probably<00:01:34.799> work<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.430> full<00:01:35.579> marks<00:01:35.880> at

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
probably work for your full marks at

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.740 
probably work for your full marks at
least<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.810> em<00:01:37.579> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.820> select<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.509> fetch

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
least so em you can select and fetch

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.469 
least so em you can select and fetch
data<00:01:39.990> using<00:01:40.680> SQL<00:01:41.100> from<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> database<00:01:41.850> using

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
data using SQL from the database using

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.170 
data using SQL from the database using
the<00:01:42.630> Select<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.619> from<00:01:43.890> clause<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.790> this

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the Select and the from clause so this

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.069 
the Select and the from clause so this
an<00:01:45.329> example<00:01:45.799> every<00:01:46.799> finger<00:01:47.070> miss<00:01:47.189> video<00:01:47.490> in

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
an example every finger miss video in

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.609 
an example every finger miss video in
italics<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.619> calabria<00:01:50.070> fonts<00:01:50.579> will<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.119> a

section<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.710> SQL<00:01:53.159> code<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.229> retrieves

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
section of SQL code so this retrieves

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.350 
section of SQL code so this retrieves
all<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.740> information<00:01:56.219> from<00:01:56.340> table<00:01:56.820> 1<00:01:56.850> so

for it represents everything so select
everything<00:02:03.329> from<00:02:03.799> table<00:02:04.799> 1<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.219> the

everything from table 1 this is the
table<00:02:05.549> name<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.270> relational

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
table name you know in relational

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.020 
table name you know in relational
databases<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.829> multiple<00:02:08.310> tables<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
databases there are multiple tables and

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
databases there are multiple tables and
this<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> name<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.140> table<00:02:10.410> and

this is the name of that table and
another<00:02:11.700> example

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
another example

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.640 
another example
is<00:02:12.360> where<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.870> actually<00:02:13.019> not<00:02:13.319> select

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
is where you actually not select

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.229 
is where you actually not select
everything<00:02:13.980> I'm<00:02:14.220> selecting<00:02:14.610> just<00:02:14.909> several

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
everything I'm selecting just several

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.839 
everything I'm selecting just several
columns<00:02:15.599> so<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:17.099> talked<00:02:17.400> about<00:02:17.459> columns

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
columns so and we talked about columns

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.059 
columns so and we talked about columns
in<00:02:17.970> otros<00:02:18.299> so<00:02:18.629> this<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.930> selecting<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.769> column

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
in otros so this is selecting the column

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.789 
in otros so this is selecting the column
name<00:02:20.280> name<00:02:20.700> column<00:02:21.510> name<00:02:21.690> ID<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.470> column

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
name name column name ID and the column

name name column name ID and the column
name<00:02:23.010> DOB<00:02:23.849> from<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.659> table<00:02:25.049> one<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:26.519> like<00:02:27.299> I

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
name DOB from the table one and like I

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.759 
name DOB from the table one and like I
say<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.659> retrieves<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.140> data<00:02:28.319> from<00:02:28.650> these

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
say it retrieves the data from these

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.069 
say it retrieves the data from these
columns<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:30.060> columns<00:02:30.390> will<00:02:30.569> be<00:02:30.659> shown<00:02:30.900> in

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
columns and the columns will be shown in

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.300 
columns and the columns will be shown in
this<00:02:31.170> order<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:32.760> will<00:02:32.940> show<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.590> VM<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
this order so it will show you VM the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.880 
this order so it will show you VM the
data<00:02:35.519> you're<00:02:35.790> requesting<00:02:36.180> from<00:02:36.329> table<00:02:36.690> one

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
data you're requesting from table one

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.680 
data you're requesting from table one
with<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.310> name<00:02:38.519> column<00:02:38.760> first<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.450> data

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
with the name column first in this data

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.050 
with the name column first in this data
the<00:02:39.989> ID<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.440> its<00:02:40.560> data<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.430> data<00:02:41.459> burthen

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the ID in its data and the data burthen

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
the ID in its data and the data burthen
is<00:02:42.150> data<00:02:42.360> like<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.590> wanted<00:02:43.860> it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
is data like that so if you wanted it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.140 
is data like that so if you wanted it
the<00:02:44.099> other<00:02:44.220> way<00:02:44.310> around<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.760> had<00:02:44.879> just<00:02:45.000> have

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
the other way around you had just have

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.509 
the other way around you had just have
to<00:02:45.239> switch<00:02:45.480> them<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.260> statement<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.099> so

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
to switch them in this statement and so

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.770 
to switch them in this statement and so
it<00:02:47.579> can<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:47.730> used<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.060> conjunction<00:02:48.209> with<00:02:48.629> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
it can be used in conjunction with the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.190 
it can be used in conjunction with the
where<00:02:49.079> clause<00:02:49.349> if<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.980> actually<00:02:50.340> want<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
where clause if you actually want to and

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.009 
where clause if you actually want to and
specify<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.260> query<00:02:52.620> slightly<00:02:53.629> slightly<00:02:54.629> more

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
specify the query slightly slightly more

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.649 
specify the query slightly slightly more
will<00:02:55.500> make<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.829> more<00:02:55.950> specific<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:56.609> so<00:02:57.299> you

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
will make it more specific and so you

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.960 
will make it more specific and so you
can<00:02:57.870> use<00:02:58.379> operators<00:02:58.950> boolean<00:02:59.489> operators

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
can use operators boolean operators

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.309 
can use operators boolean operators
which<00:03:00.120> we<00:03:00.239> looked<00:03:00.390> at<00:03:00.569> right<00:03:00.810> we'll<00:03:00.989> start<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
which we looked at right we'll start the

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.020 
which we looked at right we'll start the
course<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.829> to<00:03:01.859> do<00:03:02.549> this<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:02.819> we're<00:03:02.970> doing

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
course and to do this so we're doing

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.580 
course and to do this so we're doing
exactly<00:03:03.359> the<00:03:03.659> same<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:03.989> we're<00:03:04.109> retrieving<00:03:04.290> all

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
exactly the same so we're retrieving all

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.729 
exactly the same so we're retrieving all
the<00:03:04.680> data<00:03:04.859> from<00:03:05.099> these<00:03:05.250> columns<00:03:05.670> except<00:03:06.739> they

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
the data from these columns except they

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.559 
the data from these columns except they
were<00:03:07.890> only<00:03:08.040> retrieving<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.579> data<00:03:08.730> where<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
were only retrieving the data where the

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.069 
were only retrieving the data where the
ID<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.500> values<00:03:11.400> are<00:03:11.670> not<00:03:12.030> equal<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.599> 10<00:03:12.870> so

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
ID and values are not equal to 10 so

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.440 
ID and values are not equal to 10 so
though<00:03:13.859> this<00:03:14.280> request<00:03:14.670> will<00:03:14.940> not

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
though this request will not

this the the two greater and less

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.300 
this the the two greater and less
fansigns<00:03:27.269> equal<00:03:27.690> together<00:03:28.200> means<00:03:28.799> not<00:03:29.069> equal

fansigns equal together means not equal

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.800 
fansigns equal together means not equal

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
to which isn't actually the same in most

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.509 
to which isn't actually the same in most
languages<00:03:31.200> but<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.769> would<00:03:32.040> recommend<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.489> know

languages but I would recommend you know

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.650 
languages but I would recommend you know
that<00:03:32.760> because<00:03:32.910> they<00:03:33.000> could<00:03:33.180> trick<00:03:33.359> you<00:03:33.419> by

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
that because they could trick you by

that because they could trick you by
asking<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.989> about<00:03:34.079> it<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:36.030> I'd<00:03:36.269> recommend<00:03:36.389> you

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.819 
asking you about it so I'd recommend you
know<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.989> but<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.290> can<00:03:37.440> use<00:03:37.530> any<00:03:37.739> other

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.599 
ability and upward operator like more
than<00:03:40.290> less<00:03:40.500> than<00:03:40.769> equal<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:43.190> yeah<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.400> can't

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
than less than equal to yeah I can't

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.369 
than less than equal to yeah I can't
really<00:03:44.699> think<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.910> any<00:03:45.060> more<00:03:45.269> but<00:03:45.449> it'd<00:03:46.349> be

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
really think of any more but it'd be

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.650 
really think of any more but it'd be
like<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.310> just<00:03:47.819> specifies<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.449> slightly

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
like that I just specifies it slightly

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.140 
like that I just specifies it slightly
more<00:03:48.810> now<00:03:49.290> look<00:03:49.590> at<00:03:49.680> how<00:03:49.799> you'd<00:03:49.980> add<00:03:50.250> data<00:03:50.760> and

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
more now look at how you'd add data and

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.589 
more now look at how you'd add data and
to<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.599> table<00:03:51.989> using<00:03:52.349> SQL<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:53.099> I<00:03:53.359> only<00:03:54.359> really

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
to the table using SQL so I only really

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.240 
to the table using SQL so I only really
want<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.810> statement<00:03:55.049> for<00:03:55.290> doing<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.889> it's

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
want a statement for doing this and it's

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.280 
want a statement for doing this and it's
the<00:03:56.400> insert<00:03:56.849> into<00:03:57.180> statement<00:03:57.799> so<00:03:58.799> this

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
the insert into statement so this

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.750 
the insert into statement so this
inserts<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.470> value<00:04:01.769> Jim<00:04:02.040> into<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.579> name

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
inserts of value Jim into the name

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.759 
inserts of value Jim into the name
column<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.299> table<00:04:03.810> 1<00:04:03.959> but<00:04:04.379> nothing<00:04:04.680> is

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
column in table 1 but nothing is

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.949 
column in table 1 but nothing is
inserted<00:04:05.250> feted<00:04:05.519> for<00:04:05.669> a<00:04:05.760> column<00:04:06.060> ID<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.629> date

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
inserted feted for a column ID and date

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.809 
inserted feted for a column ID and date
of<00:04:06.989> birth<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:08.250> um<00:04:09.139> no<00:04:10.139> in<00:04:10.500> SQL<00:04:11.400> literatures

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
of birth so um no in SQL literatures

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.280 
of birth so um no in SQL literatures
means<00:04:12.000> there's<00:04:12.209> nothing<00:04:12.359> in<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:12.930> field<00:04:13.199> so

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
means there's nothing in that field so

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.800 
means there's nothing in that field so
maybe<00:04:13.590> for<00:04:14.280> Jim<00:04:14.519> you'd<00:04:14.849> actually<00:04:15.030> know<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.660> ID

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
maybe for Jim you'd actually know the ID

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.170 
maybe for Jim you'd actually know the ID
or<00:04:16.229> is<00:04:16.410> data<00:04:16.650> birth<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:18.000> would<00:04:18.150> just

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
or is data birth and so you would just

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.930 
or is data birth and so you would just
leave<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.539> null<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:19.049> this<00:04:19.229> case<00:04:19.470> or<00:04:19.739> not

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
leave that null in this case or not

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.860 
leave that null in this case or not
actually<00:04:20.940> split<00:04:21.180> whoops<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.570> will<00:04:21.750> not

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
actually split whoops and will not

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.620 
actually split whoops and will not
actually<00:04:22.019> specify<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.620> column<00:04:23.010> but

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
actually specify the column but

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.250 
actually specify the column but
just<00:04:23.780> doing<00:04:23.990> this<00:04:24.050> as<00:04:24.470> an<00:04:24.650> example<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:26.260> so

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
just doing this as an example and so

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.490 
just doing this as an example and so
obviously<00:04:27.940> Jim<00:04:28.940> is<00:04:29.180> ality<00:04:29.630> name<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.170> now<00:04:30.440> we

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
obviously Jim is ality name and now we

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.470 
obviously Jim is ality name and now we
learn<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.980> ID<00:04:31.130> in<00:04:31.340> data<00:04:31.520> but<00:04:31.730> again<00:04:32.150> it's<00:04:32.360> in

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
learn to ID in data but again it's in

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.390 
learn to ID in data but again it's in
the<00:04:32.510> order<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:32.930> your<00:04:33.020> is<00:04:33.170> important<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:33.920> it

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
the order of your is important and it

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.360 
the order of your is important and it
inserts<00:04:34.730> into<00:04:35.060> Table<00:04:35.720> one<00:04:35.930> so<00:04:36.770> now<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:36.950> do<00:04:37.190> this

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
inserts into Table one so now to do this

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.030 
inserts into Table one so now to do this
and<00:04:37.730> also<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.450> can<00:04:38.570> edit<00:04:38.780> data<00:04:39.080> using<00:04:39.410> SQL<00:04:39.800> so

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
and also you can edit data using SQL so

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.810 
and also you can edit data using SQL so
for<00:04:40.610> example<00:04:41.000> if<00:04:41.240> you<00:04:41.810> if<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:42.950> then<00:04:43.520> real

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
for example if you if you then real

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.770 
for example if you if you then real
there<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:46.280> didn't<00:04:46.520> know<00:04:46.610> at<00:04:46.880> this<00:04:47.120> stage<00:04:47.180> and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
there you didn't know at this stage and

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.110 
there you didn't know at this stage and
for<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.830> ID<00:04:49.010> and<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.370> data<00:04:49.550> buffer<00:04:49.790> if<00:04:50.030> you

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
for the ID and the data buffer if you

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.330 
for the ID and the data buffer if you
know<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.390> later<00:04:50.570> on<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:51.080> can<00:04:51.200> update<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.560> using

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
know it later on you can update it using

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.410 
know it later on you can update it using
the<00:04:52.430> update<00:04:52.880> statement

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
the update statement

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.570 
the update statement
so<00:04:53.990> we're<00:04:54.080> updating<00:04:54.170> table<00:04:54.830> one<00:04:54.950> here<00:04:55.190> and

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
so we're updating table one here and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.210 
so we're updating table one here and
we're<00:04:55.730> setting<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:56.150> ID<00:04:56.360> as<00:04:56.780> 51<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:58.010> date

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
we're setting the ID as 51 and the date

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.030 
we're setting the ID as 51 and the date
of<00:04:58.400> birth<00:04:58.640> is<00:04:59.410> 12<00:05:00.410> 12<00:05:00.890> June<00:05:01.310> 1985<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.450> and<00:05:03.170> we

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
of birth is 12 12 June 1985 and and we

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.370 
of birth is 12 12 June 1985 and and we
know<00:05:04.520> we're<00:05:04.760> selecting<00:05:05.210> four<00:05:05.360> correct<00:05:05.570> row<00:05:05.750> by

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
know we're selecting four correct row by

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.200 
know we're selecting four correct row by
we're<00:05:06.620> using<00:05:07.390> the<00:05:08.390> printed<00:05:09.380> jim<00:05:10.160> under<00:05:11.120> the

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
we're using the printed jim under the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.270 
we're using the printed jim under the
name<00:05:11.390> column<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:12.020> select<00:05:12.470> four<00:05:12.830> correct<00:05:13.070> row

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
name column to select four correct row

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.370 
name column to select four correct row
which<00:05:13.820> is<00:05:13.910> quite<00:05:14.090> important<00:05:14.540> to<00:05:14.720> use<00:05:15.080> so<00:05:15.260> we're

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
which is quite important to use so we're

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.590 
which is quite important to use so we're
using<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.740> where<00:05:15.950> clause<00:05:16.250> again<00:05:16.760> in<00:05:17.000> this

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
using the where clause again in this

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.230 
using the where clause again in this
example<00:05:18.110> so<00:05:18.530> xavius<00:05:19.280> edits<00:05:19.730> for<00:05:19.850> data<00:05:20.030> in

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
example so xavius edits for data in

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.090 
example so xavius edits for data in
table<00:05:20.570> one<00:05:20.720> by<00:05:20.900> setting<00:05:21.260> the<00:05:21.350> ID<00:05:21.500> on<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:21.920> date

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
table one by setting the ID on the date

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.180 
table one by setting the ID on the date
of<00:05:22.130> birth<00:05:22.430> field<00:05:22.760> where<00:05:23.330> jim<00:05:23.630> is<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:23.990> name<00:05:24.230> 251

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
of birth field where jim is the name 251

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.300 
of birth field where jim is the name 251
and<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:26.090> date<00:05:26.440> respectively<00:05:27.440> I<00:05:27.590> think<00:05:28.220> this

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
and the date respectively I think this

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.130 
and the date respectively I think this
is<00:05:28.430> very<00:05:28.460> simple<00:05:29.090> and<00:05:29.270> lots<00:05:29.660> of<00:05:29.780> videos<00:05:30.110> and

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
is very simple and lots of videos and

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.290 
is very simple and lots of videos and
lots<00:05:30.590> of<00:05:30.770> resources<00:05:31.640> on<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:31.940> internet<00:05:32.240> about
