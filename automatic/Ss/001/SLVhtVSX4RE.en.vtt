00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
patchy at all it doesn't stink it smells

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.060 
patchy at all it doesn't stink it smells
really<00:01:57.000> nice<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.659> very<00:01:57.750> moisturizing<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
really nice it's very moisturizing and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.399 
really nice it's very moisturizing and
it's<00:01:59.969> all<00:02:00.090> natural<00:02:00.270> ingredients<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.259> it's

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
it's all natural ingredients so it's

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.039 
it's all natural ingredients so it's
actually<00:02:01.890> good<00:02:02.340> for<00:02:02.369> your<00:02:02.579> skin<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.090> it

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
actually good for your skin and it

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.730 
actually good for your skin and it
doesn't<00:02:04.350> look<00:02:04.590> orange<00:02:04.979> at<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:06.740> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
doesn't look orange at all it's just the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.229 
doesn't look orange at all it's just the
perfect<00:02:08.160> tan<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.610> bottle<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.060> only

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
perfect tan in a bottle the only

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.440 
perfect tan in a bottle the only
downside<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.989> washes<00:02:10.140> off<00:02:10.440> so

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
downside is that it washes off so

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.030 
downside is that it washes off so
and<00:02:11.540> it's<00:02:11.660> Irish<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:12.410> if<00:02:12.680> you're<00:02:12.860> in<00:02:12.980> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
and it's Irish so if you're in the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.390 
and it's Irish so if you're in the
market<00:02:13.190> for<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.610> new<00:02:13.940> wash<00:02:14.599> off<00:02:14.900> tan<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:16.190> one

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
market for a new wash off tan this one

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.619 
market for a new wash off tan this one
is<00:02:16.519> really<00:02:16.670> good<00:02:16.879> for<00:02:17.120> like<00:02:17.150> special

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
is really good for like special

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.089 
is really good for like special
occasions<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.200> stuff<00:02:18.440> like<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:18.739> this<00:02:18.950> would

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
occasions and stuff like that this would

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.330 
occasions and stuff like that this would
work<00:02:19.280> pretty<00:02:19.400> well<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:20.540> that's<00:02:21.500> number<00:02:22.160> one

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
work pretty well so that's number one

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.530 
work pretty well so that's number one
and<00:02:22.670> then<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.180> second<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:23.959> last<00:02:24.019> thing<00:02:24.470> is

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
and then the second and last thing is

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.240 
and then the second and last thing is
these<00:02:26.540> sleepin<00:02:27.260> rollers<00:02:27.560> which<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.800> hadn't

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250

these sleepin rollers which I hadn't
talked<00:02:28.459> about<00:02:28.670> before<00:02:29.319> but<00:02:30.319> I<00:02:30.380> think<00:02:30.620> these

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
talked about before but I think these

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.650 
talked about before but I think these
are<00:02:30.800> same<00:02:31.489> thing<00:02:31.760> for<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.209> wedding<00:02:32.330> I

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
feel of them I just think they're they

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.449 
I think I could probably sleep a whole
night<00:03:32.630> with<00:03:32.750> them<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:33.109> just<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.709> never<00:03:34.250> got

around to doing that because I was
always<00:03:36.109> doing<00:03:36.410> it<00:03:36.650> kind<00:03:36.920> of<00:03:36.980> like<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.340> did<00:03:37.549> it

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
definitely have to like at the very last

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.450 
definitely have to like at the very last
one<00:04:54.810> so<00:04:54.930> I'm<00:04:55.020> kind<00:04:55.260> of<00:04:55.350> putting<00:04:55.590> bigger<00:04:56.070> chunks

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
one so I'm kind of putting bigger chunks

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.629 
one so I'm kind of putting bigger chunks
of<00:04:56.610> hair<00:04:56.760> but<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.690> just<00:04:57.900> grabbed<00:04:58.139> like<00:04:58.320> about

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
of hair but I just grabbed like about

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.640 
of hair but I just grabbed like about
two<00:04:59.639> inch<00:04:59.850> sections<00:05:00.450> maybe<00:05:00.840> one<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.500> half

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
two inch sections maybe one and a half

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.530 
two inch sections maybe one and a half
inch<00:05:01.830> sections<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:02.490> just<00:05:02.790> roll<00:05:03.060> them<00:05:03.270> all

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
inch sections and just roll them all

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.620 
inch sections and just roll them all
away<00:05:04.200> from<00:05:04.770> my<00:05:05.160> face<00:05:05.370> or<00:05:05.700> like<00:05:05.880> upwards<00:05:06.419> if

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
away from my face or like upwards if

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.430 
away from my face or like upwards if
that<00:05:06.780> makes<00:05:06.990> sense

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
that makes sense

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.500 
that makes sense
because<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.740> want<00:05:08.010> it<00:05:08.130> to<00:05:08.250> be<00:05:08.370> away<00:05:08.850> from<00:05:09.150> like

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
because I want it to be away from like

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.890 
because I want it to be away from like
up<00:05:09.720> from<00:05:10.139> the<00:05:10.290> root<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:11.400> I<00:05:12.389> think<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.750> works

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
up from the root and I think it works

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.690 
up from the root and I think it works
really<00:05:13.020> well<00:05:13.260> and<00:05:13.410> it<00:05:13.680> did<00:05:13.860> give<00:05:14.100> me<00:05:14.250> a<00:05:14.280> lot<00:05:14.580> of

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
really well and it did give me a lot of

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.420 
really well and it did give me a lot of
volume<00:05:14.970> so<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.360> definitely<00:05:15.570> recommend<00:05:15.810> these

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
volume so I definitely recommend these

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.620 
volume so I definitely recommend these
apparently<00:05:17.430> they<00:05:17.550> have<00:05:17.700> tutorials<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.450> stuff

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
apparently they have tutorials and stuff

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.320 
apparently they have tutorials and stuff
on<00:05:18.780> YouTube<00:05:19.139> as<00:05:19.290> well<00:05:19.320> so<00:05:20.000> which<00:05:21.000> they<00:05:21.180> have
