00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 i 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.490
 hello chic and today we are going to make a recipe 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.530
 that I teach in instagram and that I have 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.120
 recorded for quite some time 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.640
 it's about stuffed aubergines 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.260
 meat that in my house triumph recently 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
 me the cadista and on twitter so 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.620
 decided to upload the recipe and said that to 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.870
 cooking has been said we will need oil 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.880
 olive a brick tomato fried wine 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.860
 white to cook three eggplants 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.530
 medium-sized four cloves garlic onion 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.290
 chopped about 400 grams of minced meat 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.839
 of beef and pork or whatever you want 6 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.839
 or 7 tranchettes oregano pepper and salt 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.110
 we will start by removing the head of the 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.710
 eggplant that later we will leave by the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.500
 half 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.880
 so on both sides we will make incisions 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 verticals like the ones I saw 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:08.369
 then and then we will do other 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.810
 so many horizontally it 's as if 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.320
 was and doing a kind of 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.320
 Grid 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.369
 done this we will cut the edges without 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.020
 get to the skin from the inside 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.130
 because we want the aubergine to be 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.080
 intact on the outside then we will take out the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.970
 pulp with a spoon cuts not 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.740
 they make this task easier to be able to 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.240
 leave our eggplant as if it were 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.729
 a marquita just like that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.350
 in a large pan we will put oil of 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.110
 olive to heat and we will add two 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.030
 cloves of garlic cut when they are 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.100
 we will incorporate the meat of all 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.070
 the aubergines and let's poach about 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.070
 minutes later we will talk to taste 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.560
 we will repeat the process in another pan 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.120
 smaller but this time adding a 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.570
 half chopped onion that we will leave 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.570
 poach 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.330
 and to which we will later incorporate the 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.490
 meat 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:10.750
 we will cook until it is limp and 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.750
 we pepper to taste 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.980
 we will also add half a glass of wine 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.980
 white and let reduce to simmer 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.870
 on the other hand we will put a glass of water 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.240
 to the eggplant so that they soften 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.040
 little and when the 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.100
 excess of liquid we will incorporate the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.310
 meat and let cook a few minutes 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.310
 plus 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.819
 ah 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:47.400
 ah 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.400
 we will add the fried tomato and the oregano 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.330
 ah 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.680
 and we will cook 1 2 or 3 extra minutes 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.450
 impregnate we have a baking tray with 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.040
 olive oil everywhere for 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.910
 prevent eggplants from sticking 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.700
 we will place our marquitas in it 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.890
 and fill them with 3 or 4 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.360
 heaped tablespoons of our stew is 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.020
 better not done much because if you do not 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.020
 it comes out below 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.760
 we will cover them with tranchetes and oregano 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.670
 and we'll put them in the oven for 10 minutes 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.409
 180 degrees and that's that way we would be left 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.879
 assured that they are delicious and is a 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.980
 dish that even children eat without 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.750
 to complain and well up here the recipe 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.280

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.790

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.790
 until next time 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.920
 plus 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.870
