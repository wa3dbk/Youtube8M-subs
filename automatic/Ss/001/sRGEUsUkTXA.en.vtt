00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.260 
polyphonic tuner that allows you to tune
all<00:03:45.050> strings<00:03:45.440> at<00:03:45.590> once<00:03:45.770> which<00:03:46.460> you<00:03:46.940> couldn't

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
all strings at once which you couldn't

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.030 
all strings at once which you couldn't
do<00:03:47.450> before<00:03:48.110> so<00:03:48.740> that's<00:03:48.920> very<00:03:49.220> cool<00:03:49.490> I<00:03:50.530> also<00:03:51.530> I

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
do before so that's very cool I also I

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.910 
do before so that's very cool I also I
have<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.120> have<00:03:53.270> a<00:03:53.300> delay<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:54.590> know<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:54.800> always

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
have to have a delay you know you always

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.490 
have to have a delay you know you always
need<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.220> delay<00:03:55.520> and<00:03:55.760> this<00:03:55.910> one<00:03:56.120> basically<00:03:57.110> has

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
need a delay and this one basically has

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.550 
need a delay and this one basically has
everything<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.850> need<00:03:59.030> in<00:03:59.150> one<00:03:59.350> anything<00:04:00.350> from

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
everything you need in one anything from

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.730 
everything you need in one anything from
this<00:04:00.740> regular<00:04:01.130> digital<00:04:01.280> delay<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.870> reverse

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
this regular digital delay to reverse

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.199 
this regular digital delay to reverse
analog<00:04:04.700> slapback<00:04:05.770> it's<00:04:06.770> got<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.459> tape<00:04:07.760> you

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
analog slapback it's got the tape you

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.410 
analog slapback it's got the tape you
can<00:04:08.300> even<00:04:08.450> do<00:04:08.900> loops<00:04:09.200> with<00:04:09.500> it<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.850> covers

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
can even do loops with it so it covers

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.620 
can even do loops with it so it covers
all<00:04:11.690> my<00:04:11.840> needs<00:04:12.370> as<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.430> delay<00:04:13.760> pedal<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:14.270> it's

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
all my needs as a delay pedal so it's

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:44.429 
all my needs as a delay pedal so it's
wonderful<00:04:15.250> but<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:16.280> love<00:04:16.670> all<00:04:16.820> these<00:04:16.910> pedals

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:44.439 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:47.219 

thank<00:04:45.039> you
