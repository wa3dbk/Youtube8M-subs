that<00:07:04.550> they<00:07:04.669> put<00:07:04.910> in<00:07:05.030> there<00:07:05.300> for<00:07:05.509> you<00:07:05.690> but<00:07:06.349> I

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
that they put in there for you but I

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.110 
that they put in there for you but I
mean<00:07:06.770> there's<00:07:07.460> nothing<00:07:07.639> like<00:07:07.940> the<00:07:08.090> original

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
mean there's nothing like the original

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.850 
mean there's nothing like the original
but<00:07:08.780> then<00:07:08.960> again<00:07:09.080> I<00:07:09.289> can't<00:07:09.500> really<00:07:09.590> blame<00:07:09.740> them

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
but then again I can't really blame them

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.120 
but then again I can't really blame them
because<00:07:10.160> the<00:07:10.460> tech<00:07:10.849> limitations<00:07:11.539> are<00:07:11.720> stuff

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.130 
because the tech limitations are stuff

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.150 
because the tech limitations are stuff

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 
so yes it's great and it's only away but

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.980
