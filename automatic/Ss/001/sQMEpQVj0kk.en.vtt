 speak the truth but what I like 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.630
 You 've always dreamed of the 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.400
 teams from the first since the 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.220
 first day always defend this 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.260
 Samba flag I'm going to sing samba 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.900
 as opposed to some others that 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.789
 came singing other things and were 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.010
 changing the middle segment 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.660
 you have not always been always defending me 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.419
 I think the artist's conviction in that 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.919
 which is great and you have it from the beginning 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.360

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.550

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.840
 I already told the princess of the pagoda that she 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.570
 do you want to be right? 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.120

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.770
 What are you gracious would you say in the word? 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.020
 always so a feminine thing a 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.539
 It's a nice thing to watch 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.700
 has a nice dialogue with the public 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.410
 public always participates in its 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.539
 and I thought it was cool. 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.190
 It was not the best but I think it went well. 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.500

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.960

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:03.080

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.750

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.210
