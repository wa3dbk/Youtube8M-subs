so because I don't really want to lose
any<00:01:37.810> money<00:01:38.049> this<00:01:39.040> is<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.220> very<00:01:39.580> safe<00:01:39.909> way<00:01:39.940> to

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.859 
gain money so let's load that up again
and<00:01:43.000> choose<00:01:43.390> another<00:01:43.659> stock<00:01:44.049> value

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and choose another stock value

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.899 
and choose another stock value
okay<00:01:46.869> now<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.080> we<00:01:47.380> reloaded<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.040> now<00:01:48.549> let's

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
okay now that we reloaded it now let's

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.039 
okay now that we reloaded it now let's
choose<00:01:49.299> another<00:01:50.049> stock<00:01:50.770> value<00:01:51.189> and<00:01:51.369> buy<00:01:51.549> it

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
hopefully this time to plot the price

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.710 
hopefully this time to plot the price
will<00:01:54.759> rise<00:01:54.820> up<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:57.280> all<00:01:57.490> depends<00:01:58.060> on<00:01:58.180> your<00:01:58.360> luck

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
basically I haven't found a good way to

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.130 
basically I haven't found a good way to
know<00:02:02.289> which<00:02:02.830> stock<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.399> choose<00:02:03.700> as<00:02:04.539> far<00:02:04.840> as<00:02:04.960> I

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
know which stock to choose as far as I

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.340 
know which stock to choose as far as I
know<00:02:05.200> as<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:06.460> right<00:02:06.640> now<00:02:06.700> it's<00:02:07.180> totally<00:02:07.509> normal

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
know as of right now it's totally normal

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.930 
know as of right now it's totally normal
some<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.709> them<00:02:08.800> will<00:02:08.950> go<00:02:09.130> up<00:02:09.250> some<00:02:09.489> will<00:02:09.759> go

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
some of them will go up some will go

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.150 
some of them will go up some will go
down<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:10.569> let's<00:02:11.170> randomly<00:02:11.650> choose<00:02:11.890> another

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
down so let's randomly choose another

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.320
