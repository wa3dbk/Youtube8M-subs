to hold it there and turn it not a deal

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.250 
to hold it there and turn it not a deal
breaker<00:04:31.669> but<00:04:32.240> and<00:04:32.540> you<00:04:32.810> definitely<00:04:32.990> notice

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
breaker but and you definitely notice

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.310 
breaker but and you definitely notice
that<00:04:33.560> you<00:04:33.770> know<00:04:33.890> you<00:04:33.980> do<00:04:34.130> get<00:04:34.280> tired<00:04:34.460> um<00:04:35.320> now

that you know you do get tired um now
one<00:04:37.250> pretty<00:04:38.030> big<00:04:38.360> problem<00:04:38.810> in<00:04:38.960> my<00:04:39.169> opinion<00:04:39.470> is

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
one pretty big problem in my opinion is

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.650 
one pretty big problem in my opinion is
the<00:04:39.740> price<00:04:40.190> this<00:04:40.730> is<00:04:40.880> this<00:04:41.120> application<00:04:41.270> is

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
the price this is this application is

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.380 
the price this is this application is
299<00:04:42.169> and<00:04:42.590> i<00:04:43.040> think<00:04:43.100> that's<00:04:43.520> that's<00:04:43.940> that's<00:04:44.210> a

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
299 and i think that's that's that's a

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.880 
299 and i think that's that's that's a
little<00:04:44.630> too<00:04:44.750> much<00:04:44.930> i<00:04:45.080> think<00:04:45.260> this<00:04:45.530> should<00:04:45.740> be<00:04:45.860> a

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
little too much i think this should be a

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.340 
little too much i think this should be a
99-cent<00:04:46.310> application<00:04:47.060> now<00:04:47.630> of<00:04:47.720> course<00:04:47.780> I<00:04:48.169> mean

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
99-cent application now of course I mean

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.720 
99-cent application now of course I mean
you<00:04:48.680> know<00:04:48.770> they<00:04:48.980> can<00:04:49.160> charge<00:04:49.310> whatever<00:04:49.550> they

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
you know they can charge whatever they

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.760 
you know they can charge whatever they
want<00:04:50.030> but<00:04:50.390> I<00:04:50.660> definitely<00:04:51.230> think<00:04:51.470> they<00:04:51.650> would

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
want but I definitely think they would

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.650 
want but I definitely think they would
get<00:04:51.890> a<00:04:51.919> lot<00:04:52.010> more<00:04:52.070> people<00:04:52.460> if<00:04:52.550> it<00:04:52.669> was<00:04:52.790> 99<00:04:53.210> cents

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
get a lot more people if it was 99 cents

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.230 
get a lot more people if it was 99 cents
um<00:04:53.840> now<00:04:54.710> if<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.310> are<00:04:55.460> interested<00:04:55.760> there<00:04:56.090> is<00:04:56.210> a
