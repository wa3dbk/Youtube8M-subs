 joão peixoto free at the edge of the box 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.810
 produced the disadvantage at 40 minutes 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.530
 is a minute of the game take the end girl 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.380
 took advantage of the confusion in the area of ​​the sim fans 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.319
 to head for the goal that gave the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.860
 equality and is also a fair division of 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.629
 points 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.729
 yes but in the first part it made better 

00:01:55.629 --> 00:02:00.789
 ours were more expressive in the demand 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.799
 of the goal and also had an efficacy 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.200
 needed to get 20 or however 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.670
 back in the second part we have corrected some 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.220
 errors were the farm during 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.220
 first part in terms of society 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.870
 the first flight of the ball and improved his 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.720
 style and went through what we did 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.670
 in the second part the result ends up 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.579
 to be unfair because he was not defeated. 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.500
 is because fans so fans during the 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.730
 first part was winning 20 and already 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.269
 had expressed another two or three 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.560

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.410
 field team 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.389
 let's just earn that number until 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.799
 I was looking for the first part 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.019
 At the beginning of the second half we had more 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.769
 two clear opportunities to make 3 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.769
 0 and end with
