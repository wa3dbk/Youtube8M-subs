this burn for yeah miss Dietz number if

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.010 
this burn for yeah miss Dietz number if
it's<00:01:25.729> kerosene<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:26.870> it's<00:01:27.170> Harrison<00:01:27.800> and<00:01:29.020> I

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
it's kerosene if it's Harrison and I

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.609 
it's kerosene if it's Harrison and I
would<00:01:30.500> guess<00:01:30.950> probably<00:01:32.080> half-full<00:01:33.080> probably

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
would guess probably half-full probably

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.260 
would guess probably half-full probably
about<00:01:33.860> nine<00:01:34.580> hours

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
about nine hours

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.249 
about nine hours
mmm<00:01:36.190> eight<00:01:37.190> or<00:01:37.340> nine<00:01:37.490> hours<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.390> 20<00:01:38.990> liter

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
mmm eight or nine hours so a 20 liter

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.609 
mmm eight or nine hours so a 20 liter
jug<00:01:39.710> would<00:01:39.950> last<00:01:40.160> you<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:42.580> 20<00:01:43.580> liter<00:01:43.820> jug<00:01:44.619> well

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
jug would last you a 20 liter jug well

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.530 
jug would last you a 20 liter jug well
look<00:01:46.490> at<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:46.790> way<00:01:46.850> two<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.360> half

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
look at it this way two and a half

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.900 
look at it this way two and a half
gallons<00:01:48.140> or<00:01:48.410> about<00:01:48.860> ten<00:01:49.130> liters<00:01:49.490> would<00:01:49.700> last

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
gallons or about ten liters would last

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.930 
gallons or about ten liters would last
150<00:01:50.840> hours<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:53.380> that's<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:54.920> 20<00:01:55.250> liters<00:01:55.610> so

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
150 hours so that's this is 20 liters so

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.020 
150 hours so that's this is 20 liters so
this<00:01:56.090> would<00:01:56.240> be<00:01:56.390> about<00:01:56.509> 300<00:01:57.110> hours<00:01:57.259> of<00:01:57.850> light

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.350 

and<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.149> deeds<00:02:03.009> about<00:02:04.009> that<00:02:04.250> yeah<00:02:04.490> okay

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
and the deeds about that yeah okay

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.150 
and the deeds about that yeah okay
we<00:02:07.840> getting<00:02:08.080> close<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.380> letting<00:02:08.620> this<00:02:08.710> just

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
we getting close to letting this just

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:23.260 
we getting close to letting this just
waiting<00:02:09.430> for<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.729> wick<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.910> absorb

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.810

a heresy no well you never know I

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.200 
a heresy no well you never know I
thought<00:02:43.620> one<00:02:43.830> might<00:02:43.980> need<00:02:44.190> stove<00:02:44.490> oil<00:02:44.700> that's

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.800 
thought one might need stove oil that's
true<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.720> could<00:02:46.020> sell<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.290> stove<00:02:46.500> oil<00:02:47.600> if<00:02:48.600> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
true I could sell the stove oil if the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.510 
true I could sell the stove oil if the
grid<00:02:48.960> goes<00:02:49.200> down<00:02:49.470> for<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> few<00:02:50.040> weeks<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.490> the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
grid goes down for a few weeks in the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.480 
grid goes down for a few weeks in the
wintertime<00:02:51.740> or<00:02:52.740> maybe<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.010> can<00:02:53.160> just<00:02:53.310> sell<00:02:53.460> it

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
wintertime or maybe I can just sell it

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.710 
wintertime or maybe I can just sell it
now<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:54.450> course<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.930> won't<00:02:54.990> have<00:02:55.230> any<00:02:55.440> use<00:02:55.470> for

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
now of course it won't have any use for

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.640 
now of course it won't have any use for
stove<00:02:57.720> oil<00:02:57.900> if<00:02:58.170> they<00:02:58.290> don't<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.500> any

hmm was it metal tank or feet long oval
on<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.250> ends<00:03:27.610> yeah<00:03:27.820> why<00:03:28.090> still<00:03:28.540> one<00:03:28.750> no<00:03:29.580> a

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
on the ends yeah why still one no a

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.790 
on the ends yeah why still one no a
little<00:03:31.450> waste<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.870> time<00:03:32.050> is<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.040> new<00:03:33.250> tank<00:03:34.800> no

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.370 
little waste of time is it a new tank no
those<00:03:36.310> tanks<00:03:36.820> have<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.090> be<00:03:37.210> replaced<00:03:37.480> by<00:03:38.110> law

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
those tanks have to be replaced by law

those tanks have to be replaced by law
library<00:03:38.830> I<00:03:38.860> think<00:03:39.130> it's<00:03:39.220> 10<00:03:39.460> years<00:03:39.730> probably

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
library I think it's 10 years probably

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.650 
library I think it's 10 years probably
in<00:03:41.020> close<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.410> 10<00:03:41.620> or<00:03:41.740> more<00:03:41.890> than<00:03:42.840> stove<00:03:43.840> oil

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
in close to 10 or more than stove oil

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.710 
in close to 10 or more than stove oil
drag

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.670 

unless<00:03:51.470> it<00:03:52.130> burns<00:03:52.430> well<00:03:52.610> on<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.790> deets<00:03:53.680> it's

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
unless it burns well on the deets it's

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.600 
unless it burns well on the deets it's
almost<00:03:54.980> up<00:03:55.220> there

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.650 

so<00:04:02.610> what's<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.849> difference<00:04:02.970> between<00:04:03.239> lamp

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
so what's the difference between lamp

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.729 
so what's the difference between lamp
oil<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.250> kerosene

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
oil and kerosene

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.940 
oil and kerosene
um<00:04:09.379> not<00:04:10.379> much

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
um not much

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.410 
um not much
my<00:04:11.580> oil<00:04:11.610> is<00:04:12.090> kerosene<00:04:12.709> but<00:04:13.709> stove<00:04:14.099> oil<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:15.360> a

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
my oil is kerosene but stove oil is a

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.219 
my oil is kerosene but stove oil is a
much<00:04:15.840> less<00:04:16.169> refined<00:04:16.650> product<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:21.720> it'll<00:04:22.049> have

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
much less refined product so it'll have

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.650 
much less refined product so it'll have
a<00:04:22.290> I'm<00:04:23.220> going<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.460> smoke<00:04:23.700> an<00:04:23.940> odor<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.389> would

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
a I'm going to smoke an odor I would

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:33.680 
a I'm going to smoke an odor I would
imagine<00:04:31.669> it's<00:04:32.669> will<00:04:32.880> be<00:04:33.000> easier<00:04:33.450> with<00:04:33.600> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
imagine it's will be easier with the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:48.490 
imagine it's will be easier with the
management

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.219 

well

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.309 

so<00:04:52.800> far<00:04:53.009> so<00:04:53.159> good<00:04:53.580> so<00:04:54.060> far<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:54.479> good<00:04:54.960> don't<00:04:55.139> see

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
so far so good so far so good don't see

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:56.659 
so far so good so far so good don't see
a<00:04:55.349> whole<00:04:55.499> lot<00:04:55.680> of<00:04:55.710> smoke<00:04:55.889> let's<00:04:56.310> take<00:04:56.550> it

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
a whole lot of smoke let's take it
