00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
firstly in is right-click on it and

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.000 
firstly in is right-click on it and
place<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> jar<00:00:23.510> which<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.859> potential<00:00:25.859> inside

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
place a jar which of potential inside

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.069 
place a jar which of potential inside
like<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:30.080> it's<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.949> lightning<00:00:32.809> you<00:00:33.809> will

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
like this it's the lightning you will

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.340 
like this it's the lightning you will
can<00:00:34.410> get<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.680> from<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.340> cowl<00:00:35.809> cocoa<00:00:36.809> beans<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
can get it from a cowl cocoa beans and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.420 
can get it from a cowl cocoa beans and
some<00:00:37.980> other<00:00:38.160> stuff<00:00:39.620> then<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.890> put<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.190> on

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.810 

it<00:00:44.430> gives<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> little<00:00:45.059> bit<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.210> armor<00:00:45.620> and

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
it gives you a little bit of armor and

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.750 
it gives you a little bit of armor and
you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.289> fly<00:00:50.660> it's<00:00:51.660> slower<00:00:52.020> than<00:00:52.289> creative

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
you can fly it's slower than creative

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.170 
you can fly it's slower than creative
but<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:54.059> hover<00:00:54.270> that's<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.530> creative

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
but you can hover that's in creative

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.140 
but you can hover that's in creative
let's<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.360> how<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.539> -<00:00:57.960> Peters

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.570 

so<00:01:04.840> you<00:01:04.960> might<00:01:05.140> have<00:01:05.290> slower<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:07.590> know<00:01:08.590> I<00:01:08.890> miss

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
so you might have slower to know I miss

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.440 
so you might have slower to know I miss
this<00:01:09.730> in<00:01:10.320> my<00:01:11.320> with<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:11.800> about<00:01:12.750> paving<00:01:13.750> stone

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
but they increase the speed of

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.220 
but they increase the speed of
everything<00:01:18.190> over<00:01:18.940> them<00:01:19.120> so<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:19.990> can<00:01:20.110> even<00:01:20.350> fly

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
everything over them so you can even fly

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:32.910

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
have a new bar of energy it's how much

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.900 
have a new bar of energy it's how much
fuel<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:16.390> has<00:02:16.870> left<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.550> have<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.880> a
