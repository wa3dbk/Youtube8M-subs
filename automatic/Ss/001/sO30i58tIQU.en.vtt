00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.100
 let's prepare the strawberry side the 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.769
 ingredients we need are 400 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.050
 grams of cleaned and cut strawberries 150 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.420
 grams of sugar 200 milliliters of cream 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.640
 or cream of milk and 20 milliliters of juice 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.869
 of lemon 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.689
 we start with our strawberries and 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.910
 clean and divided into pieces adding 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.180
 the on saucepan with the sugar 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.850
 and the lemon juice and we're going to heat it 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.850
 everything and we will cook it until we are 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.460
 it is like a kind of thick purÃ©e 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.289
 the sugar will cause the strawberries to come loose 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.000
 all the game that they have and make us like 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.000
 a kind of jam 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.410
 when they have been practically undone 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.579
 in a crusher or blender what 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.579
 we will beat everything well 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.829
 it does not have to be the termomix vale 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.829
 anyone 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.190
 and now we 're going to put it in a bowl in 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.070
 which we can cool the mixture during 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.570
 a long time at least a couple of 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.940
 hours 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.409
 when it has cooled we will throw it in 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.800
 a tupper that we can put into 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.800
 freezer and we will add the cream 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.210
 always squeezing well so that it falls 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.549
 all the fat of it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.820
 and with some rods we mix it very 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.820
 all right 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.270
 actually we already have the ice cream 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.220
 prepared what happens is that now the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.100
 technique so that we stay creamy is 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.950
 important we put it in the freezer a 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.110
 couple of hours and it will not have frozen by 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.810
 full therefore we have to 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.730
 remove it and move it again we can be 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.130
 well for a whole day every two hours 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.440
 taking it out or we can also let it 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.110
 freeze completely and with the crusher or 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.570
 blender give it a tap before 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.910
 serve it or a couple of hours before 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.640
 serve it in such a way that it remains 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.520
 creamy and soft for when we have 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.740
 to make the balls and serve it for another 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.840
 side as you see we have prepared a 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.760
 white chocolate sauce to serve 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.760
 that makes it delicious
