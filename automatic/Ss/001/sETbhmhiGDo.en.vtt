a typical day my internship starts off
in<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> office<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.470> come<00:00:43.620> down<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
in the office and then we come down to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.890 
in the office and then we come down to
the<00:00:44.040> wet<00:00:44.220> lab<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.270> first<00:00:45.510> thing<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.810> do

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
the wet lab and the first thing we do

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.330 
the wet lab and the first thing we do
when<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.140> walk<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.500> wet<00:00:46.680> lab<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.070> checking

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
when we walk in the wet lab is checking

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.920 
when we walk in the wet lab is checking
on<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> fish<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.450> through<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.810> look

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
on all the fish we go through and look

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.480 
on all the fish we go through and look
at<00:00:49.080> every<00:00:49.350> aquarium<00:00:49.830> and<00:00:49.980> make<00:00:50.100> sure<00:00:50.280> there

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
at every aquarium and make sure there

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.790 
at every aquarium and make sure there
are<00:00:50.580> no<00:00:50.610> deaths<00:00:51.030> nobody's<00:00:51.930> sick<00:00:52.260> they're

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
are no deaths nobody's sick they're

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.410 
are no deaths nobody's sick they're
breathing<00:00:53.070> okay<00:00:53.520> because<00:00:53.880> sometimes<00:00:54.240> they

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
breathing okay because sometimes they

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.060 
breathing okay because sometimes they
breathe<00:00:54.660> heavily<00:00:54.900> when<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.380> water<00:00:55.560> gets<00:00:55.770> too

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
breathe heavily when the water gets too

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.120 
breathe heavily when the water gets too
hot<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.570> once<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.870> fed<00:00:58.110> everybody<00:00:58.560> we

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
hot and once we have fed everybody we

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.430 
hot and once we have fed everybody we
usually<00:00:59.550> go<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.060> check<00:01:00.330> traps<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:01.020> lilac

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
usually go and check traps on the lilac

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
usually go and check traps on the lilac
once<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.220> do<00:01:02.340> our<00:01:02.460> trap<00:01:02.670> checking<00:01:03.060> will<00:01:03.330> bring

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
once we do our trap checking will bring

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.240 
once we do our trap checking will bring
back<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.110> species<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.740> we<00:01:04.860> need<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.100> bring

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
back the species that we need to bring

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
back the species that we need to bring
back<00:01:05.430> today<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.390> example<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.870> our<00:01:06.960> traps<00:01:07.260> we

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
back today for example in our traps we

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.260 
back today for example in our traps we
caught<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:08.040> few<00:01:08.280> blue<00:01:08.490> crabs<00:01:08.760> that's<00:01:09.060> very

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
caught a few blue crabs that's very

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
caught a few blue crabs that's very
common<00:01:09.480> we<00:01:09.900> catch<00:01:10.170> blue<00:01:10.380> crabs<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> time

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
common we catch blue crabs all the time

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.070 
common we catch blue crabs all the time
we<00:01:11.580> usually<00:01:11.700> catch<00:01:12.030> male<00:01:12.300> blue<00:01:12.540> crabs<00:01:12.810> though

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
we usually catch male blue crabs though

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840 
we usually catch male blue crabs though
and<00:01:13.440> today<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:13.979> brought<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.310> female<00:01:14.640> back

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and today we brought the female back

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.990 
and today we brought the female back
because<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.270> don't<00:01:15.479> often<00:01:15.660> get<00:01:15.960> females<00:01:17.000> you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
because we don't often get females you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.520 
because we don't often get females you
hear<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> clicking<00:01:20.210> we<00:01:21.210> also<00:01:21.360> caught<00:01:21.660> a<00:01:21.960> spider

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.620 
hear a clicking we also caught a spider
crab<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.190> crab<00:01:23.369> pots<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.300> usually

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
crab out of the crab pots and we usually

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.660 
crab out of the crab pots and we usually
catch<00:01:24.810> females<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.710> species<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.460> today

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
catch females of that species and today

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.190 
catch females of that species and today
we<00:01:26.850> actually<00:01:27.150> caught<00:01:27.300> a<00:01:27.330> male<00:01:27.770> epilator<00:01:28.770> crab

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
we actually caught a male epilator crab

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.920 
we actually caught a male epilator crab
that's<00:01:31.200> good<00:01:31.530> news<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.600> purpose<00:01:33.900> for

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
that's good news the purpose for

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.570 
that's good news the purpose for
bringing<00:01:34.320> them<00:01:34.440> back<00:01:34.560> here<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.490> we

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
bringing them back here is so that we

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.340 
bringing them back here is so that we
can<00:01:35.729> study<00:01:35.970> them<00:01:36.210> mostly<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.960> our<00:01:37.170> fish

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
can study them mostly for our fish

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.990 
can study them mostly for our fish
ecology<00:01:37.500> study<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.280> document<00:01:38.820> everything

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
ecology study we document everything

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.670 
ecology study we document everything
that<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.570> pull<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> traps<00:01:40.440> whether

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that we pull up out of the traps whether

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.290 
that we pull up out of the traps whether
we<00:01:40.860> bring<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.160> back<00:01:41.280> or<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:42.150> always

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
we bring it back or not we always

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.990 
we bring it back or not we always
measure<00:01:42.690> its<00:01:43.140> size<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.560> documented<00:01:44.520> sex<00:01:44.820> if

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
measure its size and documented sex if

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120 
measure its size and documented sex if
it<00:01:45.120> matters<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.480> actually<00:01:46.410> really<00:01:46.800> lucked<00:01:47.010> out

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
it matters I actually really lucked out

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.710 
it matters I actually really lucked out
