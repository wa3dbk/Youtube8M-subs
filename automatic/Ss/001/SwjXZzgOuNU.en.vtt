to<00:01:18.990> at<00:01:19.439> least<00:01:19.590> learn<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.310> she<00:01:20.430> was

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

talking<00:01:20.790> about<00:01:20.850> how<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.360> lot<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.780> writers<00:01:21.990> wrote

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
talking about how a lot of writers wrote

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
talking about how a lot of writers wrote
like<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.250> they<00:01:23.369> didn't<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.700> speak

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
like that but they didn't really speak

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.520 
like that but they didn't really speak
like<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.869> kind<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.140> helps<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
like that and so it kind of helps you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.399 
like that and so it kind of helps you
understand<00:01:26.009> other<00:01:26.549> works<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.780> era<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
understand other works of that era and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.719 
understand other works of that era and
so<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.130> thought<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.640> cool

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
so I just thought that was really cool

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.940 
so I just thought that was really cool
