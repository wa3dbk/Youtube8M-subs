manufacturing facility in Cambridge it
is<00:00:23.010> very<00:00:23.250> difficult<00:00:23.550> for<00:00:23.910> me<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.210> describe<00:00:24.600> the

positive<00:00:26.189> energy<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.699> immediately<00:00:27.029> felt<00:00:27.689> when

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
positive energy I immediately felt when

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.830 
positive energy I immediately felt when
I<00:00:28.050> walked<00:00:28.410> into<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.099> plant<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:30.630> very

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
I walked into this plant it was very

implement and sustain it the question is

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.929 
implement and sustain it the question is
why<00:01:23.450> dps<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.960> Toyota's<00:01:25.350> DNA<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.430> built<00:01:26.729> on

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
why dps is Toyota's DNA and is built on

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.319

Japanese for continuous improvement and

not warming up to the whole hugging and
positive<00:01:52.619> work<00:01:52.860> environment<00:01:53.119> concept<00:01:54.350> really

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
positive work environment concept really

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.580 
positive work environment concept really
I<00:01:56.000> don't<00:01:57.000> understand<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> very<00:01:58.259> same

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
I don't understand because the very same

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.910 
I don't understand because the very same
companies<00:01:59.310> have<00:02:00.180> seemed<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.840> warm<00:02:01.290> up<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.740> lean

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
companies have seemed to warm up to lean

manufacturing<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:04.350> problem<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.969> is

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
manufacturing the problem is that it is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.529 
manufacturing the problem is that it is
very<00:02:06.329> difficult<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.229> implement<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:08.539> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
very difficult to implement and to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.650 
very difficult to implement and to
sustain<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.640> allow<00:02:11.640> me<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.879> illustrate<00:02:12.209> for
