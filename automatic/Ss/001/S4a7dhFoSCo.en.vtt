00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
been ripped off the main bar that we

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.969 
been ripped off the main bar that we
need<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.930> fix<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.170> well<00:01:25.410> so<00:01:25.590> we'll<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.890> out

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
dinar so we'll put a battery in and

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.560 
dinar so we'll put a battery in and
we'll<00:01:29.759> test<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.090> make<00:01:30.210> sure<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.540> everything

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
we'll test to make sure that everything

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.040 
we'll test to make sure that everything
is<00:01:30.960> our<00:01:31.259> main<00:01:31.560> bar<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.160> we're<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.610> making

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
is our main bar now we're just making

preparations for a new connector to be
sold<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.190> while<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.670> go<00:01:39.540> on

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
sold it in and I just while they go on

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.170 
sold it in and I just while they go on
the<00:01:40.740> reason<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.160> has<00:01:41.310> come<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:41.550> obviously

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the reason this has come up obviously

the reason this has come up obviously
it's<00:01:43.080> accidentally<00:01:43.830> been<00:01:44.009> taken<00:01:44.400> off<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.729> it

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
it's accidentally been taken off that it

it's accidentally been taken off that it
was<00:01:45.330> when<00:01:45.660> a<00:01:46.160> color<00:01:47.160> conversion<00:01:47.580> was<00:01:48.450> done<00:01:48.690> on

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
was when a color conversion was done on

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.930 
was when a color conversion was done on
the<00:01:49.200> phone<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:49.830> obviously<00:01:50.190> you<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.820> is

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
connector on an original white one is

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.999 
connector on an original white one is
actually<00:02:05.100> white<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.240> match<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.630> color<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.770> so

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
actually white to match the color but so

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.320 
actually white to match the color but so
anyway<00:02:08.340> that's<00:02:08.460> what's<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.090> that's

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
and then we'll sort out the problem with

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.440 
and then we'll sort out the problem with
the<00:02:41.370> missing

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
the missing

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.900 
the missing
site<00:02:42.780> for<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.709> battery<00:02:44.250> connector<00:02:44.640> valleys

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
site for the battery connector valleys

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.309 
site for the battery connector valleys
are<00:02:45.090> clean<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.629> we've<00:02:45.810> cleaned<00:02:46.020> up<00:02:46.200> the

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
are clean that we've cleaned up the

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.130 
are clean that we've cleaned up the
solder<00:02:46.650> joints<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.420> we're<00:02:49.050> going

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
solder joints but to that so we're going

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.199 
solder joints but to that so we're going
to<00:02:49.230> end<00:02:49.410> up<00:02:49.560> with<00:02:49.860> some<00:02:50.340> nice<00:02:50.519> strong<00:02:50.819> solder

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
to end up with some nice strong solder

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.990 
to end up with some nice strong solder
joints<00:02:51.510> from<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.930> next<00:02:52.800> we'll<00:02:52.980> see<00:02:53.400> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
joints from that next we'll see the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.949 
joints from that next we'll see the
connector<00:02:54.900> going<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.580> then<00:02:56.959> affecting

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
connector going in and then affecting

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.470 
connector going in and then affecting
the<00:02:58.080> problem<00:02:58.500> with<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.310> paddlers<00:02:59.730> missing<00:03:00.090> ok

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
the problem with the paddlers missing ok

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.800 
the problem with the paddlers missing ok
and<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.840> here<00:03:01.440> we<00:03:01.560> are<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:02.599> connector<00:03:03.599> is

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
and so here we are the connector is

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.250 
and so here we are the connector is
solid<00:03:04.349> back<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:05.099> see<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:06.260> three

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
solid back and you can see the three

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.309 
solid back and you can see the three
soldiers<00:03:07.800> there<00:03:08.459> are<00:03:08.640> looking<00:03:09.000> good<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:09.989> next

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
soldiers there are looking good so next

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.949 
soldiers there are looking good so next
I'm<00:03:10.590> going<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.390> sort<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.629> issue<00:03:12.750> out<00:03:13.019> with<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
I'm going to sort the issue out with the

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.990 
I'm going to sort the issue out with the
pad<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.170> isn't<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.830> board<00:03:17.069> here<00:03:17.340> by

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
pad that isn't on the board here by

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.580 
pad that isn't on the board here by
running<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.390> wire<00:03:18.720> from<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:20.150> pain<00:03:21.150> why<00:03:21.360> the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
running a wire from the pain why the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.280 
running a wire from the pain why the
paddock<00:03:22.590> should<00:03:22.799> be<00:03:22.980> into<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:24.060> main<00:03:24.420> Bob<00:03:24.690> to

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
paddock should be into the main Bob to

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.319 
paddock should be into the main Bob to
get<00:03:25.620> power<00:03:25.890> back<00:03:26.160> into<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.670> phone<00:03:26.880> ok<00:03:27.150> here<00:03:27.299> we

get power back into the phone ok here we

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.860 
get power back into the phone ok here we
are<00:03:27.450> them<00:03:27.720> we've<00:03:27.900> got<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.349> wire<00:03:29.069> in<00:03:29.489> place

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
are them we've got the wire in place

switch it up now this is after putting
in<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.900> new<00:04:06.930> battery<00:04:07.319> connector<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.850> new

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
in a new battery connector and a new

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.190 
in a new battery connector and a new
battery<00:04:10.880> so<00:04:11.880> this<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.180> all<00:04:12.359> looking<00:04:12.690> fine<00:04:12.989> up

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
battery so this is all looking fine up

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.870 
battery so this is all looking fine up
to<00:04:13.350> now

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
to now

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.340 
to now
so<00:04:15.880> what<00:04:16.239> we've<00:04:16.389> achieved<00:04:16.510> like<00:04:16.989> saying<00:04:17.290> you

so what we've achieved like saying you

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.140 
so what we've achieved like saying you
about<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.799> reconnect<00:04:18.160> are<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.430> new<00:04:18.579> battery

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
about to reconnect are in new battery

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.930 
about to reconnect are in new battery
the<00:04:19.780> battery<00:04:19.959> can<00:04:20.380> power<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:21.100> phone<00:04:21.130> as<00:04:21.760> we

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
the battery can power the phone as we

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.550 
the battery can power the phone as we
can<00:04:22.150> see<00:04:23.310> it's<00:04:24.310> just<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.580> case<00:04:24.730> now<00:04:25.090> of<00:04:25.560> going

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
can see it's just a case now of going

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.490 
can see it's just a case now of going
into<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.919> OS<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:30.750> battery<00:04:31.750> been<00:04:31.990> able<00:04:32.169> to

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
into the OS and the battery been able to

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.250 
into the OS and the battery been able to
be<00:04:32.620> charged<00:04:33.220> so<00:04:33.880> I'll<00:04:34.840> just<00:04:34.870> leave<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.139> here

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
be charged so I'll just leave it here

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.590 
be charged so I'll just leave it here
for<00:04:35.410> now<00:04:35.590> just<00:04:36.550> while<00:04:36.669> I<00:04:36.700> opens<00:04:37.120> often<00:04:37.419> goes

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
for now just while I opens often goes

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.510 
for now just while I opens often goes
into<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:37.990> OS<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.530> then<00:04:38.860> hopefully<00:04:39.250> we'll<00:04:39.400> see

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
into the OS and then hopefully we'll see

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.820 
into the OS and then hopefully we'll see
a<00:04:39.550> judge<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.090> say<00:04:40.150> okay<00:04:40.750> we<00:04:40.930> are<00:04:41.080> in<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.530> arse

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
a judge and say okay we are in the arse

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.430 
a judge and say okay we are in the arse
now<00:04:42.010> as<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.370> can<00:04:42.460> see<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:43.200> we've<00:04:44.200> got<00:04:44.350> the

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
now as you can see and we've got the
