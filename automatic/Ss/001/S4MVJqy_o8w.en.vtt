00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.319 
so what you're gonna do is you're going
to<00:01:49.380> go<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.740> find<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.250> major<00:01:50.490> choke<00:01:50.909> point<00:01:51.180> in

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
to go and find the major choke point in

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.109 
to go and find the major choke point in
the<00:01:51.420> map<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.470> there's<00:01:52.649> not<00:01:52.860> one<00:01:53.119> normally

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the map and if there's not one normally

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.959 
the map and if there's not one normally
one<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:54.540> appear<00:01:54.630> pretty<00:01:55.140> pretty<00:01:56.130> rapidly<00:01:56.670> if

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
one will appear pretty pretty rapidly if

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.280 
one will appear pretty pretty rapidly if
you<00:01:57.180> stay<00:01:57.420> conscious<00:01:57.750> with<00:01:58.170> your

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
you stay conscious with your

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.050 
you stay conscious with your
surroundings<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.130> watch<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.640> map<00:01:59.820> for

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
surroundings and just watch the map for

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.819 
surroundings and just watch the map for
one<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.990> normally<00:02:01.350> see<00:02:01.500> them<00:02:01.649> pretty

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
one you can normally see them pretty

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.560 
one you can normally see them pretty
well<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.250> mini-map<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.820> that's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
well on the mini-map and that's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.870 
well on the mini-map and that's
generally<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.070> battle<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.549> drawn

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
generally like all the battle is drawn

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.789 
generally like all the battle is drawn
towards<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.360> area<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.229> not<00:02:07.439> going<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
towards that area so it's not going to

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.889 
towards that area so it's not going to
be<00:02:07.890> hard<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> find<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.479> what<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.720> want<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
be hard to find it so what you want to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.890 
be hard to find it so what you want to
do<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.440> throw<00:02:10.709> boxes<00:02:11.400> everywhere

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
do is just throw boxes everywhere

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.520 
do is just throw boxes everywhere
towards<00:02:12.900> your<00:02:13.020> friendly

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
towards your friendly

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.380 
towards your friendly
teammates<00:02:14.130> when<00:02:14.700> they're<00:02:14.850> injured<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.360> you

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
teammates when they're injured so you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.610 
teammates when they're injured so you
just<00:02:15.630> want<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.840> throw<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.140> into<00:02:16.260> largely

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
just want to throw it into largely

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.160 
just want to throw it into largely
populated<00:02:17.220> areas<00:02:18.000> I'm<00:02:18.510> gonna<00:02:18.660> throw<00:02:18.840> your<00:02:18.959> med

very fast I got 35 in about half a game

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.830 
very fast I got 35 in about half a game
once<00:02:28.560> 20<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.640> that's<00:02:29.880> how<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.090> unlocked<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
once 20 and that's how I unlocked the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.890 
once 20 and that's how I unlocked the
ace23<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.040> was<00:02:32.400> pretty<00:02:32.640> ridiculous<00:02:33.090> like

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900
