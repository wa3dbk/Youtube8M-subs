00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.900 
pieces because this is about to get
there<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.500> wanted<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.129> something<00:00:59.370> with<00:00:59.609> ink

there I wanted to do something with ink

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.270 
there I wanted to do something with ink
really<00:01:00.120> bad<00:01:00.449> because<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.170> expresses<00:01:01.680> emotion

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
really bad because it expresses emotion

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.039 
really bad because it expresses emotion
like<00:01:02.640> dark<00:01:02.910> emotions<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.480> tentacles

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
like dark emotions and tentacles

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.109 
like dark emotions and tentacles
I<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.619> expresses<00:01:05.159> dark<00:01:05.369> emotion<00:01:05.880> too

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
I think expresses dark emotion too

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.820 
I think expresses dark emotion too
because<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.780> said<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.260> could<00:01:07.650> draw

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
because like I said I could draw

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.649 
because like I said I could draw
tentacles<00:01:08.400> all<00:01:08.640> day<00:01:08.850> every<00:01:09.150> day<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.299> don't<00:01:09.479> know

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
tentacles all day every day I don't know

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.149 
tentacles all day every day I don't know
I<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.869> love<00:01:10.260> them<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> reminds<00:01:10.950> me<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
I just love them and it reminds me of

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.130 
I just love them and it reminds me of
the<00:01:11.280> deep<00:01:11.430> ocean<00:01:11.610> well<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.689> course<00:01:12.720> because

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the deep ocean well of course because

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.440 
the deep ocean well of course because
it's<00:01:13.409> hooked<00:01:13.650> onto<00:01:13.830> an<00:01:14.040> octopus<00:01:14.580> usually<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it's hooked onto an octopus usually and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.179 
it's hooked onto an octopus usually and
the<00:01:15.930> ocean<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.409> very<00:01:16.530> mysterious

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the ocean is very mysterious

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.010 
the ocean is very mysterious
I<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:17.549> they've<00:01:17.729> discovered<00:01:18.180> more<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.689> Mars

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
I think they've discovered more on Mars

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.140 
I think they've discovered more on Mars
and<00:01:19.470> researched<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.189> more<00:01:20.430> than<00:01:20.549> they<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.909> in

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and researched it more than they have in

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.240 
and researched it more than they have in
the<00:01:21.299> actual<00:01:21.659> ocean<00:01:22.140> itself<00:01:22.530> throughout<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the actual ocean itself throughout the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.490 
the actual ocean itself throughout the
whole<00:01:23.400> world<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.479> first<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.170> want<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
whole world and at first like I want to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.670 
whole world and at first like I want to
do<00:01:25.710> my<00:01:25.890> whole<00:01:26.159> hair<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.820> all<00:01:27.330> tentacles<00:01:28.200> but

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
do my whole hair like all tentacles but

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.679 
do my whole hair like all tentacles but
it<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:28.950> gonna<00:01:29.040> look<00:01:29.250> too<00:01:29.490> cartoonish<00:01:30.270> because

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
it was gonna look too cartoonish because

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.140 
it was gonna look too cartoonish because
it'd<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.110> be<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.350> lot<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:32.040> tiny<00:01:32.460> tentacles

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it'd have to be a lot of tiny tentacles

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.819 
it'd have to be a lot of tiny tentacles
and<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:33.900> crazy<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.439> wouldn't<00:01:34.619> even<00:01:34.680> look

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
and that's crazy it wouldn't even look

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
drawing it because I think anybody could

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.400 
drawing it because I think anybody could
put<00:02:38.220> their<00:02:38.550> self<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.210> position<00:02:39.870> where

put their self in that position where

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.990 
put their self in that position where
they<00:02:40.500> feel<00:02:40.710> overwhelmed<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.670> like<00:02:41.730> there's

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
they feel overwhelmed and like there's

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.150 
they feel overwhelmed and like there's
too<00:02:42.210> much<00:02:42.330> negativity<00:02:42.870> around<00:02:43.320> them<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:43.980> that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
too much negativity around them and that

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.460 
too much negativity around them and that
maybe<00:02:44.640> they<00:02:44.850> need<00:02:45.030> change<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.450> their<00:02:45.570> life<00:02:45.750> so

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.270 
little joy and I think that's such a
cute<00:02:57.090> name<00:02:57.180> but<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.230> didn't<00:02:58.650> really<00:02:58.920> match<00:02:59.070> the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
cute name but it didn't really match the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.970 
cute name but it didn't really match the
band<00:02:59.490> it's<00:03:00.060> not<00:03:00.270> like<00:03:00.450> joyful<00:03:01.230> uppity<00:03:01.590> music

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980

band it's not like joyful uppity music
but<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:02.400> really<00:03:02.790> interesting<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.600> soothing

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
but just really interesting and soothing

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.170 
but just really interesting and soothing
and<00:03:04.320> it's<00:03:04.440> kind<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.680> like<00:03:04.830> alternative<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:06.150> I

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
and it's kind of like alternative and I

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
that but this one was actually good
