00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
Oh I got an accent, gross! I feel filthy!

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.200
Hello, wonderful people of the internet! I am here today with the lovely-
Sabrina

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.459
Of…
NerdyAndQuirky.

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:17.959
So, we are doing a rapid fire word conversation…
discussion association thing… you’ll see

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.520
what we mean.
We’re referencing a whole bunch of Facebook

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.240
comments
From her Facebook page, because such fame

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.980
and stuff.
Yeah, it’s just like one word suggestions.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.250
If you want, you should totally like my Facebook
page, not hers.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.110
I never use my Facebook page, it’s fine.
Just follow me on Twitter!

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.400
Who uses Facebook? I personally enjoy MySpace
the most, I think it’s like cutting edge technology.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.900
Bagged milk

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.130
Oh…. Canadians will never hear the end of
this. It’s not the entirety of Canada - it’s

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.910
actually only Ontario and Quebec, which are
provinces.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.490
Not states, they’re provinces.
Yeah we’re cooler, also we’re huge.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.300
Waffles!
Waffles - make me think of Leslie Knope. Waffles

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.840
are great, but I’m more a pancakes person
myself.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.370
But on the other hand, waffles are like pancakes
with cup holders.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:11.380
*pow* you just blew my mind! You just changed
my world view on waffles.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.720
You are welcome. You can also make them with
an iron, so it’s like the panini of-

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.850
It’s the panini of breakfast foods!
Yeah, basically!

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.420
Gender.
Gender. I identify as female.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.220
I identify as female, but gender is a spectrum.
Yeah, and you can identify as you.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.420
You be you.
Yes.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.800
Space.
Big.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.490
I love it.
Awesome.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.750
Cool.
Sparkly.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.939
Bueno.
Actually fun fact, space, uh-stars only appear

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.340
to sparkle due to the atmosphere and the light
refracts, so it looks like the stars are twinkling.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.140
Science!
In reality they’re kinda just like one big

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.090
fart.
Awesome.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.060
Me.
Accurate.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.490
I feel bad now, I should have said you.
You should have, but it’s fine. You're like

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.790
100% awesome, I’m like 99% awesome.
I’m gonna give you a 99.99.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.179
I’ll roll with that.
History. Favourite historical figure. Mary

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.390
Curie is mine, I love her.
Kate Sheppard.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.099
Who?
She was a woman from New Zealand who was part

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.560
of the women’s suffrage, and got women the
right to vote.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.670
That’s cool.
New Zealand was the first country that let

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.590
women vote.
Oh yeah that! I know that and that’s very

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.000
cool.
Yeah!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.340
On the other hand, Mary Curie - first woman
to win a Nobel Prize, first person ever to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.480
win two Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics.
Mmmm!

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.920
Women’s rights!
Yeah, go women!

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.400
YAAAAAA!
Pizza.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.920
I love it. Just ate it.
Yep, we had pizza for lunch because... pizza!

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.700
Okay, what is the best topping on pizza?
I was going to say pepperoni, but pepperoni

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.640
is a type of pizza, so salami... because pepperoni!
Well no, pepperoni is a topping on pizza.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.520
So what is the best topping on pizza, if you
could...

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.300
BACON! Bacon on everything.
But that's not a pizza anymore!

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.069
Bacon always!
Bacon...

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.310
Bacon always, man!
But just go straight bacon?

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.680
Yeah.
Oh my god, I would go pepperoni.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.120
Yeah pepperoni too, but...
I like a classic!

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.260
Yeah pepperoni's good, but also bacon. You
can never beat bacon. Preferably both!

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.020
Lego.
I have no thoughts on lego...

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.320
I didn't really play lego as much as duplo,
but...

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.500
What the hell is duplo?
Duplo is like the toddler's version of lego

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.269
because it's like bigger pieces.
Oh I know!

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:35.050
My main purpose of lego and duplo was to make
mazes and buildings for my mice to play in,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.970
because it was really easy to clean. So we'd
make these like cool and crazy mazes for our

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.159
mice, and afterwards we could just disinfect
it, it was great!

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:49.110
What I did, is that I made tiny guns and then
had little wars with myself, because I was

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.269
a loner. That got really dark and really sad!
Butts.

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.959
Good.
Great.

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.129
All butts are good.
Squishy.

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.940
My anaconda don't want none, unless you got
buns, hun.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.340
Hun.
Even though there's a double negative there.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.450
Double negative...
My anaconda wouldn't mind if you didn't have

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.659
buns, honestly. It's impartial.
Final word. Thank you to Jessie Lynn on Facebook,

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.759
is... sloths.
Just slowly drowning in slow motion!

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:24.449
So the other day, I went to the aquarium with
Connor, and he was going to show me some sloths,

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.029
because there are sloths in the aquarium in
Baltimore.

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:31.099
And it doesn't make sense, because sloths
don't belong in water. Like, they clearly

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:32.729
wouldn't survive in water.
And they'd be like... *ughhhh*

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.729
You're still moving too quickly, a sloth would
kinda be like.... okay then.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.939
So pretty much, maybe these sloths were a
figment of Connor's imagination.

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:51.369
Probably. But also, when you have the time,
I want you to overlay an image of a sloth

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:57.990
like with wet hair, because sloths have tiny
heads! They're like deceptively small headed

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.279
and you need to put it over this video. Just
like right now, SLOTH!

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:08.239
So thank you for listening to our rambley,
quick fire word discussion thingy-ma-jig.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.080
This is Sabrina, she's awesome. You should

That we did!

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.110
Yes!
What did we talk about, Sabrina?

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.879
We talked aboot tea and coffee. What is our
opinion on them? You'll have to click the

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.460
video to find out!
