00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
wheat before the update basically if you

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.020 
wheat before the update basically if you
combine<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:07.920> fishing<00:01:08.369> rod<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.640> get

the camera stick you can imagine the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
the camera stick you can imagine the
possibilities<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.000> combine<00:01:12.330> this

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
possibilities if you then combine this

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.660 
possibilities if you then combine this
with<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.930> saddle<00:01:13.229> let's<00:01:14.070> actually<00:01:14.220> show<00:01:14.610> you

because it's in front of his face it's a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.760 
because it's in front of his face it's a
really<00:01:51.149> really<00:01:51.360> cool<00:01:51.450> way<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.930> bout<00:01:52.140> this

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
really really cool way to get bout this

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.920 
really really cool way to get bout this
is<00:01:52.950> kind<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.460> horses<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.299> horses<00:01:54.630> if

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
is kind of like horses but for horses if

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you think about it because if you just

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.300 
you think about it because if you just
look<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.659> I'm<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> place<00:01:58.770> i<00:01:58.979> need<00:01:59.159> to

Knuckles<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> Echidna<00:02:10.250> riding<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.430> pic<00:02:11.790> for

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
Knuckles the Echidna riding a pic for

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.270 
Knuckles the Echidna riding a pic for
some<00:02:12.090> reason<00:02:12.319> it's<00:02:13.319> slightly<00:02:13.650> confused

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
some reason it's slightly confused

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.160 
some reason it's slightly confused
and<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.090> know<00:02:15.150> very<00:02:15.450> very<00:02:15.540> cool<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.050> look

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and it's you know very very cool to look

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.260 
and it's you know very very cool to look
at<00:02:16.350> but<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:17.010> cool<00:02:17.310> alternative<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.120> mine

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
at but it's a cool alternative to mine

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.940 
at but it's a cool alternative to mine
carts<00:02:18.569> because<00:02:18.840> mine<00:02:19.170> carts<00:02:19.440> only<00:02:19.650> go<00:02:19.770> along

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
carts because mine carts only go along

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.590 
carts because mine carts only go along
for<00:02:20.069> each<00:02:20.160> time<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.520> track<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.270> just<00:02:21.450> go

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
for each time and track this can just go

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.240 
for each time and track this can just go
wherever<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.900> want<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.319> obviously<00:02:23.190> I'm

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
wherever you want it to obviously I'm

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.710 
wherever you want it to obviously I'm
above<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.490> sea<00:02:23.760> right<00:02:23.940> now<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.420> has<00:02:24.600> to

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
above the sea right now so it has to

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.630 
above the sea right now so it has to
have<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> track<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.250> real<00:02:26.490> world

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
have a track to but in the real world

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.980 
have a track to but in the real world
you<00:02:26.819> can<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.120> take<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.450> wherever<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.900> want

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
you can just take it wherever you want

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.630 
you can just take it wherever you want
to<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.560> just<00:02:28.709> did<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.100> got<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.340> happens

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
to and it just did just got it happens

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.979 
to and it just did just got it happens
so<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.240> know<00:02:30.360> that's<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.569> cool<00:02:30.720> little<00:02:30.900> thing

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
so you know that's a cool little thing

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.620 
so you know that's a cool little thing
that<00:02:31.110> might<00:02:31.440> appeal<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.480> let's<00:02:33.480> go

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
that might appeal to you but let's go

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.420 
that might appeal to you but let's go
into<00:02:33.840> how<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.050> little<00:02:34.590> boost<00:02:34.800> mechanic<00:02:35.220> works

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
into how the little boost mechanic works

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.740 
into how the little boost mechanic works
because<00:02:35.850> if<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:35.970> look<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.209> bomb<00:02:36.540> right

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
because if you look in the bomb right

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.240 
because if you look in the bomb right
where<00:02:36.989> my<00:02:37.020> hunger<00:02:37.380> bar<00:02:37.500> usually<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.040> can

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
where my hunger bar usually is you can

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.309 
where my hunger bar usually is you can
see<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:39.390> actually<00:02:39.510> got<00:02:39.959> some<00:02:40.140> little

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
see that it's actually got some little

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.530 
see that it's actually got some little
things<00:02:40.560> there<00:02:40.770> that's<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.610> pigs<00:02:41.850> bar<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.360> if

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
things there that's the pigs bar and if

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.140 
things there that's the pigs bar and if
you<00:02:42.690> press<00:02:42.959> right<00:02:43.230> left<00:02:43.830> trigger<00:02:43.980> sorry<00:02:44.340> you

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
you press right left trigger sorry you

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
like sprinting but yeah you feed it some

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.720 
like sprinting but yeah you feed it some
and<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.709> goes<00:02:52.860> forwards<00:02:53.220> obviously<00:02:53.610> this

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
and it goes forwards obviously this

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.070 
and it goes forwards obviously this
weights<00:02:54.030> some<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.330> your<00:02:54.420> current<00:02:54.600> stick<00:02:54.900> and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
you only get few uses up it also well

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.720 
you only get few uses up it also well
running<00:02:58.230> around<00:02:58.500> in<00:02:58.590> circles<00:02:58.620> pretty<00:02:59.400> painful

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
running around in circles pretty painful

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.870 
running around in circles pretty painful

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
but it's still a really really cool

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.509 
but it's still a really really cool
thing<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.590> allows<00:03:04.739> you<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.950> go<00:03:05.040> faster

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
thing and it allows you to go faster

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.280 
thing and it allows you to go faster
over<00:03:05.700> flat<00:03:05.970> ground<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.840> then<00:03:06.989> when<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:07.170> need

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
over flat ground and then when you need

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.449 
over flat ground and then when you need
to<00:03:07.350> go<00:03:07.410> over<00:03:07.470> difficult<00:03:07.860> get<00:03:07.980> ground<00:03:08.250> like

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
to go over difficult get ground like

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.550 
to go over difficult get ground like
turns<00:03:08.730> like<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.390> can<00:03:09.600> unit<00:03:09.959> gun<00:03:10.230> normal

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
turns like this you can unit gun normal

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.199 
turns like this you can unit gun normal
speed<00:03:10.709> like<00:03:10.890> this<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.760> yeah<00:03:11.880> it's<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> really

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
speed like this so yeah it's a really

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.880 
speed like this so yeah it's a really
cool<00:03:12.450> thing<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.050> little<00:03:13.350> glitch<00:03:13.530> at<00:03:13.650> times

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
cool thing it's a little glitch at times

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.410 
cool thing it's a little glitch at times
i'll<00:03:14.100> show<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.370> if<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:14.700> tried<00:03:14.910> go<00:03:15.030> upstairs

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.030 
i'll show you if you tried go upstairs
which<00:03:15.600> sometimes<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.470> will<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.680> glitch<00:03:16.890> you

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
which sometimes it will just glitch you

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.259 
which sometimes it will just glitch you
into<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.400> block<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.790> didn't<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.180> time

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
into the block it didn't do it that time

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.729 
into the block it didn't do it that time
some<00:03:18.630> reason<00:03:19.820> but<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.030> little<00:03:21.329> glitchy<00:03:21.540> i

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
some reason but it is a little glitchy i

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.870 
some reason but it is a little glitchy i
doubt<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:23.010> will<00:03:23.100> actually<00:03:23.220> be<00:03:23.459> fixed<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:23.760> the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
doubt it will actually be fixed on the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.160 
doubt it will actually be fixed on the
xbox<00:03:24.209> but<00:03:24.420> it'll<00:03:24.540> still<00:03:24.750> be<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.840> really<00:03:25.140> fun
