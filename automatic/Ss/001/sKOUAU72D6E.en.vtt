00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 ben ammar live from the evening of 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.540
 launch of fifa 13 years old born with bruce 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.630
 grannec hi brussels and that's good guy 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.160
 it will necessarily bound again fia 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.710
 who comes out bush it's just 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 the most titled player in the world of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.770
 the history of the video game 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.869
 he was world champion on pes he has 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.830
 been world champion on fifa champion 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.619
 de france title 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.840
 Vice World Champion in title at ra 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.980
 Spanish on penalties is annoying 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.269
 pretty annoying especially Catherine alpes 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.520
 and nadal is not good but it's football 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.430
 it's like that no more about it at all 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.710
 if you support playing fifa 13 before 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.660
 his release I saw on twitter since I 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.059
 did you even go to vancouver 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.350
 where the game is developed for for 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.370
 participate a little bit at the end of 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.260
 development or in any case the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.210
 latest versions so after a few 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.800
 parties on this fifa 13 since you're there 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.899
 cheeks plus several weeks what is it 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.460
 what can we say about this version 2013 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.079
 I just think it's going to be 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.840
 the best fifa of the series simply 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.239
 and there they all saw again is what is said 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.440
 not that every year not there in a flourish 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.049
 me anyway I say not all the senses 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.890
 but there I really think they have 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.030
 really everything comes back to the level of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.409
 ball control is much more 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.060
 realistic the ball is really detached 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.380
 of the player so really take his 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.670
 time at the level do super attention 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.460
 at the ball checks and there we feel 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.689
 really the quality of a team's game 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.920
 like the barça for example who 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.030
 technically is way above the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.530
 mean they're going to have the ball too 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.670
 sticks to the feet unlike others 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.320
 players who are a little less good 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.240
 technically roof for the moment you're 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.759
 favorite version was what 2008 2009 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.320
 I believe I enjoyed 2008-2009 and 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.150
 then this one I think I'm going 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.829
 loved a lot so you played 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.200
 basically against the against the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.670
 machine like pals 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.740
 what is the profile a little bit of 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.380
 left you to discuss yeah I did 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.659
 a little of both and the computer looks 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.920
 very important role to play especially ctc quatela 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.539
 barça you do not see the ball must 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.520
 really wait for him to make a mistake 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.079
 even if you anticipate it 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.579
 anticipated they make the magic pass 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.149
 like debit and the playstation did some 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.590
 progress this year 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.729
 yeah I have the impression that at the level of 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.950
 eyecatching the high levels of interest 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.719
 artificial it was very very 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.610
 significantly improved and at the level of 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.140
 buddies it's a little easier for the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.060
 moment electing them not level yet 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.560
 tidy but well we'll see with the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.119
 time is it still going at the level of 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.709
 artificial intelligence I believe 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.869
 there is something new at the gorges 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.250
 or what yeah we see at the level of 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.680
 player calls and also at the level 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.299
 lanes the bad is just morning there 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.819
 aligns much better with the 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.590
 opposing defense we bites game what can we 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.450
 less stupid so we'll say so that's 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.410
 super fun to play what are 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.540
 really the call at the right time it 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.340
 also stops when it's nice 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.450
 seen as as supporters of the paris 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.560
 Saint Germain had to be delighted 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.599
 to learn that the team and 5 stars 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.150
 this year in the game you could play 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.470
 with paris is it competing with 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.319
 the biggest fifa clubs this 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.760
 year yeah pretty much anyway this c'en 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.840
 is really not far from one or two 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.430
 players let's say now they have 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.950
 really what to do in front of it is going 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.510
 super fast on the sides with lead with 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.370
 lavezzi then when you add cascade 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.829
 who will come even nene who is not bad 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.569
 also then there is especially zlatan a 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.769
 center in the surface you can send 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.780
 to the pipe breaker is no problem it's 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.250
 than go out with the balloon and then that's it 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.560
 but there is really something to do 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.870
 in any case you were the first 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.630
 winner of a tournament organized on fifa 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.459
 13 in Vancouver and was opposed to 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.540
 during this tournament so in fact at 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.530
 vancouver are invited the four 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.810
 last world champions 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.579
 so I was opposed to the Spanish ramos 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.769
 against whom I lost a penalty after 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:16.639
 last time to the American l-1 nacho 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.840
 kovic and portuguese yao cruz is so 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.609
 this time it smiled I could take 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.049
 my revenge against espanyol so at that 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.849
 will it go a little saw mean 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.799
 that you have season that starts with fifa 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.989
 13 since you too are changing 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.760
 game every year you feel good feel 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.340
 that it is a game that is captured by your 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.510
 gambling goes in any case to those who me 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.859
 know they say that games that 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.230
 favored me precisely 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.090
 build take his time and in all 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.709
 case that's what we find in fifa 13 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.689
 apparently the construction go through 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.849
 the sides so I hope in any case that 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.670
 it will be a game that corresponds to my 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.650
 it is 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.540
 a party we will say we will follow you all 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.220

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.480

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.670

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.140

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.209
