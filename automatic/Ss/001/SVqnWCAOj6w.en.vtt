00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.679
 hello together is the grill 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.770
 today there are in the second 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.500
 part of the eurochallenge filled pig 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:40.750
 Cheeky and as always smaller 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:44.559
 teaser the picture of the finished product we 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.589
 start with 150 grams of spinach leaves first 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:52.780
 Blanched for a moment, there are two 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:55.260
 tablespoon of cream cheese and a half 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.260
 onion 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.619
 next we need one 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.619
 teaspoon soy sauce 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.290
 and properly salt and pepper about 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.290
 a half teaspoon each 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.920
 then I have also given you some deliberately 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.800
 fries I have two krakauer here and 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.690
 demenz garage doors whom you are interested in 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.680
 after the sensational should be like that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.020
 we remove the pelle as far as possible 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.540
 and cut the little agile last one 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.950
 Of course, pretending to go fresh 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.670
 big project could be the butcher 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.720
 to order 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.820
 perhaps another tick 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.660
 elegant in fulfillment but I do 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.330
 that's great 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.150
 the next one is totally important 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.470
 delegation of at least three people the 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.190
 help you to stir communes 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.170
 one of stirs the two tell me the 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.410
 be careful that about that neat 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.410
 do 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.220
 Now we take the girls before us 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.220
 cut a small pocket pure 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.970
 leaving about a tablespoon of fulfillment 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.970
 fits in this little packet 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.040
 After that fix it all with one 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.050
 toothpick or and a skewer the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.710
 one needs only briefly at the beginning of 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.050
 grill 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.180
 thus do not directly deal 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.760
 if you are once laid out short 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.440
 usually keep their shape afterwards 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.610
 you can in between the skewers end 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.100
 The result is a monolithic preheat 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.660
 the big deal is over now 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.130
 we grill the pigs 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.850
 one and a half to two minutes from 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.850
 every page 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.530
 as soon as the girls are registered 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.070
 Let's take it from the east under the one 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.740
 cast-iron pan with the person cheering 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:47.190
 and feel half an onion and something 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.190
 Add garlic to the net to equip 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.500
 and then we give the pigs again 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.500
 in addition 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.939
 then are fast run 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.640
 simply fresh thyme two above 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.590
 over it and then the whole with one 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.280
 good neat shot black 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.280
 fresh 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:30.310

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:33.520
 Great beer with some salt and pepper above 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:38.849
 then over it with a closed lid 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.849
 Let it stew for another 25 minutes 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.030
 that's what it looks like when they are 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:56.950
 Almost done when you smell that 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.070
 could and then we take those from the 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.070
 pan 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.940

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.550
