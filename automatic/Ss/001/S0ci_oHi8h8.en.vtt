important<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:34.940> kind<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.330> feel<00:04:35.510> like<00:04:35.539> Trust<00:04:36.169> for

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
important I kind of feel like Trust for

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.740 
important I kind of feel like Trust for
me<00:04:37.190> I<00:04:37.220> think<00:04:37.370> Trust<00:04:37.760> would<00:04:38.000> trump<00:04:38.300> values

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
me I think Trust would trump values

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.390 
me I think Trust would trump values
because<00:04:39.140> I<00:04:39.260> think<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.560> if<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.860> trusted<00:04:40.310> each

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
because I think that if you trusted each

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.219 
because I think that if you trusted each
other<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:41.150> would<00:04:41.240> be<00:04:41.360> able<00:04:41.419> to<00:04:41.539> understand

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
other you would be able to understand
