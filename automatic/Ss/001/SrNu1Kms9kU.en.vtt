00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.799
 and greet everyone so there I know who 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.030
 are heavy damage 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.700
 I will show you little trick kama 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.070
 for the for multis counting this 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.100
 times so 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.340
 you will see there it will concern 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.630
 ruins so 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.650
 you had consciously understood 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.820
 what it is going to be 4th range has more 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:32.600
 it will ally with the ccr kwakwa dungeon 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.070
 that you will close 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 with your team I will show you 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.230
 what they do not see here is the pack yeah 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.690
 that's it so toulon jean is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.210
 interesting and it's doing the du 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.180
 chalenge everywhere even to the boss that you 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.510
 capture of course to redo it in 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.620
 arena and so what is it 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.100
 that you are going to crack which you have the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.700
 do about ten times with 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.180
 a team with a clinic in 55 to 3 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.440
 at least level 150 you low in 15 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.830
 minutes by doing all the challengers 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.660
 it's very fast and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.530
 and then say you're going to crack 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.920
 you go kraft and quads and what 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.900
 what do I believe for the fame of the coup 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.280
 I break everything I have nothing but that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.930
 you are going to crafter 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:32.360
 I'm going back to the bank for you 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.360
 show the kraft so no pop pop pop 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.030
 but never found that too cucul 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.200
 here you go kraft and headdresses 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.360
 so there is a lack of feathers 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.960
 match this led by kraft a 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.070
 so that gives you 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.830
 that's it gives you four to 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.290
 saint-domingue items void in itself in 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.950
 bring seen as the multi elements at 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.780
 level 50 that couple to the rings is 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.960
 but you're going to break it and you're going 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.270
 get runes I will show 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.080
 levante how much is it worth and you go 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.050
 as kraft and rings of wood 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.330
 fire finally or another element according to 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.850
 the price of 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:29.840
 runal deval seems so 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.840
 proves resistance in percentage 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.910
 so here I have not looked at the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.610
 amulets to but they are for 8 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.600
 yeah 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.710
 not interesting so what's the time 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.110
 So they give you runes and 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.840
 and then not street Linnaeus palin 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.410
 finally then and papers for all then 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.750
 some runes are there 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.790
 and the banks you took the helm 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.350
 according to the elements of the noc you have 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.420
 cracked and then of course 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.830
 resistors so pair the resistors 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.530
 percentage and stays in that percentage 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.790
 things are the most are the most 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.040
 dear so we'll go see that in 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.290
 selling hotels how much is it worth and you 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.980
 see that we can quickly get 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.960
 a lot of tote a month I almost 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.770
 crocos and I made myself four 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.770
 five thousand fires in the time it gets 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.740
 so sees his share very quickly even a too 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.580
 quickly that you will have to put 2 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.460
 gives normal prices 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.620
 so here I have a lot of stuff before 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.820
 so that's it's the streets one 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:52.450
 percentage that will fall to them it's 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:57.010
 that they will go back surely seen 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.810
 that it's worth then they know the 4000 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.480
 units but you make it into 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.150
 do in March so it's going so a race 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.709
 to this thing moans in pants before so 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.440
 the offoff runes so the one that was worth 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.630
 more expensive a it's going 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.630
 14000 8 is so here I will hand over to 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.590
 less clever who put himself to a case 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.590
 Fewer people than me 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:30.000
 these are the two ter but like fucking 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.750
 the notaries his three dogs 67000 kg 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.750
 115 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:48.340
 ab no dumb tianhe no I do not say 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:49.810
 that yes I gave a little that to my 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:05:01.000
 asks how even if it does not serve 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:05:03.310
 absolutely nothing here yes yes actually 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.880
 did 74th morning really not 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:11.390
 woke up 24 well here it is suggested m and 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.760
 else the runes 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:18.620
 two ovals that slab the runes not then 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.660
 its vocation especially that we do 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.870
 a lot in the streets since soaps 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.630
 nothing runes ray Perfia it 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.720
 it's huge it's full of range with 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.570
 Lemieux but that will grab a dolphin 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.750
 and re father fire game little holes do not 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.430
 not read some cases here and there at 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.470
 read a land also a talent not 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.880
 badly but are selling a little less well 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.270
 that the area but overall it starts 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.450
 very quickly 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.710
 So that's all for this trick 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.810
 that before I look if manage and 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:52.940
 do not forget to tell you yeah that's so 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:57.680
 made the multi- year challenge to the 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:00.500
 boss room and room to the room 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.780
 clear words I think it's the front 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.700
 before last room crinkle the 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.700
 third room where the second game more 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.940
 that's because we need a fire 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.410
 of kraft wood for kraft and caps 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.870
 and when we do not have a lot of 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.890
 Prospecting is therefore to banks when 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.570
 we have a lot of prospecting are going 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:24.170
 miss a boss item here for me 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:26.990
 I'm doing with a group of 2400's 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:30.110
 prospecting I'm getting a million by 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.620
 dungeon and a million 20 minutes and this 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:37.780
 which makes me counting the price 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.780
 keys the ways 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.750
 1858 and it's really negligible 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:45.060
 compared to fortune when so 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.099
 that's all for this video I hope 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.689
 that you liked it and I do not tell you 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:50.689
 more for the bis the chao
