00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
station they're called Haitian port I

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.830 
station they're called Haitian port I
think<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.070> called<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.300> has<00:00:39.449> a<00:00:39.480> service

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
think it's called and it has a service

serves the ferry service to Douglas
Elliman<00:00:58.309> to<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.969> old<00:01:00.090> welcome

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
Elliman to do this the old welcome

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.310 
Elliman to do this the old welcome
station<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.590> further<00:01:02.719> along<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:04.050> hopefully

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
station is further along which hopefully

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.160 
station is further along which hopefully
will<00:01:04.619> go<00:01:04.770> past<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.460> think<00:01:06.390> there's<00:01:06.570> another

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
will go past I think there's another

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.210 
will go past I think there's another
train<00:01:07.500> doing<00:01:08.070> that's<00:01:08.369> coming<00:01:08.820> from<00:01:09.240> Leeds

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
train doing that's coming from Leeds

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.029 
train doing that's coming from Leeds
which<00:01:11.220> forms<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.320> 10:30<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.560> departure

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
which forms the 10:30 for departure

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.889 
which forms the 10:30 for departure
because<00:01:14.130> there's<00:01:14.369> quite<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.550> few<00:01:14.610> people<00:01:14.899> in

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
because there's quite a few people in

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.590 
because there's quite a few people in
the<00:01:16.050> station

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
the station

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.270 
the station
apparently<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.660> station<00:01:19.110> service<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:20.039> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
apparently in station service like a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:45.280 
apparently in station service like a
million<00:01:21.140> passengers<00:01:22.140> per<00:01:22.350> year

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.950 

yeah<00:01:45.830> so<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:46.160> is<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.370> going<00:01:46.910> to<00:01:46.970> be<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.210> 1034

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
yeah so this is the going to be the 1034

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.520 
yeah so this is the going to be the 1034
to<00:01:48.110> Leeds

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
to Leeds

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:57.000 
to Leeds
so<00:01:49.460> they've<00:01:49.580> now<00:01:49.730> got

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.710 

twofold

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
twofold

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.200 
twofold
let's<00:01:59.290> open<00:01:59.940> station

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.180 

like<00:02:08.210> truth<00:02:08.720> actually<00:02:09.229> stay<00:02:09.710> here<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.040> case

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
like truth actually stay here in case

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.240 
like truth actually stay here in case
you're<00:02:10.399> trying<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:11.350> place<00:02:12.350> them<00:02:12.650> but<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:13.190> want

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
you're trying to place them but you want

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.980 
you're trying to place them but you want
to<00:02:13.370> do<00:02:13.490> that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.130 

whereas<00:02:17.740> like<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.130> such<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:19.360> violation

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
whereas like you such it's a violation

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.870 
whereas like you such it's a violation
and<00:02:20.560> then<00:02:20.680> departs<00:02:21.100> them<00:02:21.220> from<00:02:21.370> Auckland<00:02:21.700> if<00:02:21.790> I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
and then departs them from Auckland if I

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.420 
and then departs them from Auckland if I
catch<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.210> on<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.420> way<00:02:22.510> back<00:02:22.690> from<00:02:22.750> open<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:24.370> I

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
catch it on the way back from open and I

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.190 
catch it on the way back from open and I
believe<00:02:24.700> what<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:24.970> does<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.360> goes<00:02:25.510> with<00:02:25.780> goes

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
believe what it does it goes with goes

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.350 
believe what it does it goes with goes
along<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.500> line<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.190> has<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.520> stop<00:02:28.000> and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
along this line and it has to stop and

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.050 
along this line and it has to stop and
the<00:02:29.080> crew<00:02:29.500> get<00:02:29.770> off<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.310> manually<00:02:30.670> change<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the crew get off and manually change the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.980 
the crew get off and manually change the
points<00:02:31.510> which<00:02:32.200> take<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.650> on<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.990> Haitian

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
points which take it on to the Haitian

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.100 
points which take it on to the Haitian
but<00:02:35.830> which<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.760> branch<00:02:37.240> off<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.810> MILCON

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
but which is a branch off the MILCON

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.870 
but which is a branch off the MILCON
branch

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
branch

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.980 
branch
the<00:02:39.880> other<00:02:40.000> interesting<00:02:40.150> thing<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.720> then<00:02:40.870> at

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
the other interesting thing is then at

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.470 
the other interesting thing is then at
Haitian<00:02:41.410> there's<00:02:41.620> an<00:02:41.800> power<00:02:42.760> station<00:02:43.240> nuclear

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
Haitian there's an power station nuclear

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.990 
Haitian there's an power station nuclear
power<00:02:43.600> station<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:44.980> imagine<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.730> trains

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
power station and I imagine the trains

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.410 
power station and I imagine the trains
have<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.270> come<00:02:46.450> up<00:02:46.540> here<00:02:46.830> with<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.420> nuclear

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
have to come up here with the nuclear

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.150 
have to come up here with the nuclear
waste<00:02:49.540> or<00:02:49.750> whatever<00:02:49.960> they<00:02:50.110> do<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.740> possibly

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
waste or whatever they do and possibly

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.820 
waste or whatever they do and possibly
the<00:02:51.430> sliding<00:02:51.910> be<00:02:52.330> like<00:02:52.510> behind<00:02:52.840> me<00:02:55.830> talking

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
the sliding be like behind me talking

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.250 
the sliding be like behind me talking
what<00:02:57.100> it's<00:02:57.220> called<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.780> head<00:02:58.780> shunt<00:02:59.080> there

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
what it's called the head shunt there

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.040 
what it's called the head shunt there
maybe<00:02:59.500> that's<00:02:59.830> for<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.600> engine<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.720> run<00:03:01.840> round

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
maybe that's for the engine to run round

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.790 
maybe that's for the engine to run round
I<00:03:02.320> don't<00:03:02.500> know

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
I don't know

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.860 
I don't know
expect<00:03:03.160> something<00:03:03.490> anyway<00:03:03.940> time<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.450> go<00:03:04.720> off

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
expect something anyway time to go off

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.550 
expect something anyway time to go off
down<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.290> Haitian<00:03:05.710> mail<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.140> station

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
down to Haitian mail so to the station

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.220 
down to Haitian mail so to the station
which<00:03:08.710> used<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:08.950> be<00:03:09.070> white<00:03:09.310> on<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:11.610> beach

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230
