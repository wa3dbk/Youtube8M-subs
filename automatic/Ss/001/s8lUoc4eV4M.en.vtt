00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
hey YouTube kayak DIY here and in this

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.550 
hey YouTube kayak DIY here and in this
very<00:00:16.920> very<00:00:17.340> short<00:00:17.910> video<00:00:18.300> I'm<00:00:19.050> gonna<00:00:19.289> quickly

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
very very short video I'm gonna quickly

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.429 
very very short video I'm gonna quickly
go<00:00:19.740> over<00:00:19.890> two<00:00:20.490> ideas<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.779> guys<00:00:21.990> could

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
go over two ideas that you guys could

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.490 
go over two ideas that you guys could
use<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:23.460> secure<00:00:24.300> your<00:00:24.480> rod<00:00:24.660> leashes<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.350> your

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
use to secure your rod leashes to your

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.920 
use to secure your rod leashes to your
rods<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:26.789> people<00:00:27.060> will<00:00:27.300> attach<00:00:27.599> rod

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
rods so some people will attach rod

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.140 
rods so some people will attach rod
leashes<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.590> these<00:00:28.769> areas<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.490> their<00:00:29.640> rods<00:00:29.820> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
leashes to these areas on their rods I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.450 
leashes to these areas on their rods I
have<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> different<00:00:31.410> method<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.189> it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
have a different method that I like it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.830 
have a different method that I like it
might<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.210> all<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:33.780> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
might not be for all of you but I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.080 
might not be for all of you but I
thought<00:00:34.079> I'd<00:00:34.290> share<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.710> anyway<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.340> because

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
thought I'd share it anyway just because

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.500 
thought I'd share it anyway just because
well<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.500> know<00:00:37.760> one<00:00:38.760> man's<00:00:38.969> junk<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.450> another

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
well you know one man's junk is another

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.610 
well you know one man's junk is another
man's<00:00:39.780> treasure

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
man's treasure

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.100 
man's treasure
you<00:00:41.100> know<00:00:41.190> same<00:00:41.520> kind<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> principle<00:00:42.110> this

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
you know same kind of principle this

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.389 
you know same kind of principle this
might<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.320> work<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
might not work for all of you but it

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.540 
might not work for all of you but it
works<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.760> me<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:46.469> these<00:00:46.980> type<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.250> rods

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
works for me so on these type of rods

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.950 
works for me so on these type of rods
here<00:00:47.879> where<00:00:48.059> they<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.420> cut<00:00:48.629> out<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
here where they have the cut out you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.150 
here where they have the cut out you
could<00:00:49.140> actually<00:00:49.320> wrap<00:00:49.789> paracord<00:00:51.320> around<00:00:52.320> this

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
could actually wrap paracord around this

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.700 
could actually wrap paracord around this
area<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.940> create<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> loop<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:55.320> an<00:00:55.410> attachment

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
area and create a loop for an attachment

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.150 
area and create a loop for an attachment
point<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:57.680> carabiner<00:00:58.680> style<00:00:59.370> rod<00:00:59.850> leash<00:01:00.149> so

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
point of a carabiner style rod leash so

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.340 
point of a carabiner style rod leash so
if<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> robbed<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> issue<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.260> would

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
if this was I robbed the issue you would

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.200 
if this was I robbed the issue you would
be<00:01:04.500> able<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.710> quickly<00:01:05.010> attach<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.939> your

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
be able to quickly attach to your

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.070 
be able to quickly attach to your
paracord

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
paracord

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.109 
paracord
now<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.770> isn't<00:01:08.159> wrapped<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.760> good<00:01:08.909> this

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
now this isn't wrapped on here good this

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.060 
now this isn't wrapped on here good this
was<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.750> demonstration<00:01:10.439> purposes<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
was just for demonstration purposes I

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.580 
was just for demonstration purposes I
didn't<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> full<00:01:11.850> wrap<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.320> could<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.560> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
didn't do a full wrap but you could do a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.010 
didn't do a full wrap but you could do a
full<00:01:13.920> wrap<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.549> using<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> method<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
full wrap here using the method that I

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.289 
full wrap here using the method that I
actually<00:01:16.259> show<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.159> my<00:01:17.250> videos<00:01:17.580> which

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
actually show in one of my videos which

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.359 
actually show in one of my videos which
is<00:01:18.450> about<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> spear<00:01:19.080> gaff<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.320> DIY<00:01:19.979> spear

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
is about a spear gaff the DIY spear

graft if you look in the videos you'll
see<00:01:22.020> how<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.380> wrapped<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.070> PVC<00:01:23.430> pipe<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.200> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
see how I wrapped a PVC pipe and you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.679 
see how I wrapped a PVC pipe and you
could<00:01:25.380> follow<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.770> same<00:01:26.159> method<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.060> wrap

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
could follow that same method to wrap

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.260 
could follow that same method to wrap
this<00:01:27.930> area<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.950> create<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> loop<00:01:29.909> for<00:01:30.150> an

these i screws like this I prefer to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.510 
these i screws like this I prefer to
have<00:01:41.430> stainless<00:01:42.360> not<00:01:42.840> zinc<00:01:43.200> plated<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.280> I

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
have stainless not zinc plated but I

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.480 
have stainless not zinc plated but I
worked<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> had<00:01:45.479> at<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> moment<00:01:46.490> so

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
worked with what I had at the moment so

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.240 
worked with what I had at the moment so
what<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.540> would<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.409> simply<00:01:49.649> drill<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
what you would do is you simply drill a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.330 
what you would do is you simply drill a
hole<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:51.000> small<00:01:51.390> hole<00:01:52.320> smaller<00:01:52.920> than<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
hole a small hole smaller than the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.700 
hole a small hole smaller than the
threads<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:54.060> set<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.840> threads<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.470> grip

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
threads here set the threads can grip

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.010 
threads here set the threads can grip
you<00:01:56.369> drill<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> small<00:01:56.850> hole<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.479> butt<00:01:57.780> end

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you drill a small hole on the butt end

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.520 
you drill a small hole on the butt end
of<00:01:58.350> your<00:01:58.680> rod<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.340> then<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.810> would<00:02:01.110> take<00:02:01.290> like

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
of your rod and then you would take like

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.090 
of your rod and then you would take like
a<00:02:01.560> marine<00:02:02.549> based<00:02:02.820> adhesive<00:02:03.540> or<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.560> could<00:02:04.829> use

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
a marine based adhesive or you could use

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.350 
a marine based adhesive or you could use
superglue<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.469> super<00:02:07.469> glue<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:08.729> inside<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
superglue and super glue the inside of

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.210 
superglue and super glue the inside of
that<00:02:09.390> hole<00:02:09.660> before<00:02:10.020> threading<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:11.009> and

your screw eyes and these have held up
very<00:02:17.880> well<00:02:17.970> I've<00:02:18.960> used<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.500> method<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:20.100> my

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
very well I've used this method on my

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.720 
very well I've used this method on my
rods<00:02:20.550> for<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.940> while<00:02:21.150> now<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.890> does<00:02:23.370> really

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
rods for a while now and it does really

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.050 
rods for a while now and it does really
work<00:02:24.720> quite<00:02:25.020> well<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:26.070> holds<00:02:26.370> up<00:02:26.490> so<00:02:26.760> if

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
work quite well and it holds up so if

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.480 
work quite well and it holds up so if
you<00:02:27.090> pretend<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.960> is<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> rod<00:02:28.440> leash<00:02:28.710> you
