 Hello. I'm Martin Shervington, and in this video we'll look at a process 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.689
 in three steps to use Google Hangouts and Google Drive for collaboration. 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:37.300
 The first step is to go to your heguta and start a new heguta. If you click in the box, 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.370
 you can, for example, invite people from the circle of your team members. 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.890
 This will open a window. And if you write a message 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.170
 to the people in this heguta, they will all get this message. 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.640
 And as you can see in this example, there are 15 people in this particular hegut. 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.820
 If you go to the cogwheel, and click, you'll see that the notifications are on. 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.340
 Removing the checkmark means that when people are chatting you will not receive a notification. 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.920
 You can also name the project and thus know which heguta for which project it refers to. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.369
 It is important not to leave the heguta if you want to continue to cooperate with this team, 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.350
 as you will have to be invited back to the heggeath to join again. 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.350
 When you're done, click Save. Now let's take a look at Google Drive. If we take for example 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.469
 presentation on which I want to work with this group and clicked 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:48.469
 of the Share button (a person with a + sign), this shows who has access. 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.689
 If you change this to "Anyone with the link" "Can Edit", and then click "Save", 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.630
 then you can copy the link, return to the heguta and drop it inside. 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.190
 Press Return, and everyone in this heguta will be able to cooperate 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.620
 on this document. Also, if you click on the icon that appears 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.410
 as a camera, it will start video chat with everyone in this heguta, 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.849
 provided their notifications are included. And from there, you will be able to 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.730
 to open the document in the Google Drive app, which you can see here, in the video call part of this hegut. 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.709
 If at some point you need to invite more people in the room, 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.319
 to collaborate, you can do this by clicking 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.659
 Invite people, and then enter names, circles, or email addresses. 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.909
 This is Martin Shervington, and now you know how to create a Google Hangout and keep it, 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.819
 so you can work together on projects using Google Drive. 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.790
