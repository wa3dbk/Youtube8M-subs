and sustainable is not an exception
becomes<00:00:33.749> the<00:00:33.960> rule<00:00:35.300> most<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> students

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
becomes the rule most of the students

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.700 
becomes the rule most of the students
that<00:00:37.649> come<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> don't<00:00:38.399> know<00:00:38.609> how<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.789> cook<00:00:39.149> and

I<00:03:58.700> think<00:03:59.660> that<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.870> major<00:04:00.080> issue<00:04:00.440> is<00:04:00.710> that

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
I think that the major issue is that

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.130 
I think that the major issue is that
people<00:04:00.920> think<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:01.940> food<00:04:02.360> is<00:04:02.660> a

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
people think that food is a

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.680 
people think that food is a
time-consuming<00:04:04.100> proposition<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.330> come<00:04:05.540> home

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
time-consuming proposition you come home

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.230 
time-consuming proposition you come home
after<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:06.170> long<00:04:06.260> day<00:04:06.470> you<00:04:07.130> don't<00:04:07.760> really<00:04:08.030> want

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
after a long day you don't really want

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.060 
after a long day you don't really want
to<00:04:08.300> think<00:04:08.600> about<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.320> now<00:04:09.410> I'm<00:04:09.560> gonna<00:04:09.680> cook<00:04:09.920> a

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
to think about and now I'm gonna cook a

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.490 
to think about and now I'm gonna cook a
three-course<00:04:10.190> meal<00:04:10.790> but<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.660> could<00:04:12.290> put

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
three-course meal but you could put
