put it on because all of it all go the
outside<00:03:13.780> of<00:03:13.900> his<00:03:13.959> foot<00:03:14.019> there<00:03:14.860> which<00:03:15.100> was

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
outside of his foot there which was

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.650 
outside of his foot there which was
quite<00:03:15.459> nice<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.060> think<00:03:16.299> he<00:03:16.390> managed<00:03:16.600> to

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
quite nice and I think he managed to

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.330 
quite nice and I think he managed to
grab<00:03:16.989> as<00:03:17.140> eight<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.680> next<00:03:17.950> shot<00:03:18.070> on<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.250> edge

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
grab as eight the next shot on the edge

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.009 
grab as eight the next shot on the edge

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
from there which gives you an example

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.340 
from there which gives you an example
how<00:03:45.850> far<00:03:46.090> out<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.239> can<00:03:46.450> shoot<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.930> score<00:03:47.170> and

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
how far out you can shoot and score and

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.229

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.030 
think but then also you see a couple
finesses<00:03:49.900> which<00:03:50.080> these<00:03:50.470> weren't<00:03:50.680> even<00:03:50.950> the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
finesses which these weren't even the

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.979 
finesses which these weren't even the
ones<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.370> scored<00:03:51.640> from<00:03:51.820> first<00:03:51.880> out<00:03:52.360> there's

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
ones that scored from first out there's

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.780 
ones that scored from first out there's
just<00:03:53.110> more<00:03:53.350> realistic<00:03:54.160> ones<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:54.580> can

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
just more realistic ones that you can

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.090 
just more realistic ones that you can
score<00:03:55.030> easily<00:03:55.239> this<00:03:55.989> is<00:03:56.140> again<00:03:56.440> all<00:03:56.680> before

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
score easily this is again all before

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.039 
score easily this is again all before
pre<00:03:57.340> patch<00:03:57.580> em<00:03:57.970> so<00:03:58.330> I'm<00:03:58.420> not<00:03:58.540> sure<00:03:58.600> what<00:03:58.780> it's

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
pre patch em so I'm not sure what it's

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.220 
pre patch em so I'm not sure what it's
like<00:03:59.140> now<00:03:59.410> but<00:03:59.980> look<00:04:00.160> at<00:04:00.310> that<00:04:00.459> is<00:04:00.640> just

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
like now but look at that is just

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.900 
like now but look at that is just
ridiculous<00:04:02.230> how<00:04:02.799> far<00:04:03.220> out<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.430> can<00:04:03.670> finesse

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
ridiculous how far out you can finesse

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.060 
ridiculous how far out you can finesse
it<00:04:04.090> in<00:04:04.209> from<00:04:04.390> that<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:04.780> he<00:04:05.560> was<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.709> good<00:04:05.920> player

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
it in from that and he was a good player

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.860 
it in from that and he was a good player
to<00:04:06.400> burn<00:04:06.489> study<00:04:06.820> you<00:04:06.970> can<00:04:07.000> get<00:04:07.420> I'll<00:04:07.660> show<00:04:07.810> you

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
to burn study you can get I'll show you

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.780 
to burn study you can get I'll show you
after<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.320> other<00:04:08.650> version<00:04:08.829> then<00:04:09.610> there<00:04:09.760> is

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
after the other version then there is

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.750 
after the other version then there is
the<00:04:10.030> ROI<00:04:10.360> so<00:04:10.600> you<00:04:10.690> can<00:04:10.810> get<00:04:10.959> i<00:04:11.170> paid<00:04:11.400> 460k<00:04:12.400> for

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
the ROI so you can get i paid 460k for

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.920 
the ROI so you can get i paid 460k for
him<00:04:12.850> he's<00:04:13.000> probably<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.299> little<00:04:13.390> bit<00:04:13.540> lower<00:04:13.780> by

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
him he's probably a little bit lower by

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.409 
him he's probably a little bit lower by
