in<00:06:06.500> this<00:06:06.560> video<00:06:06.830> and<00:06:07.070> it's<00:06:08.000> um<00:06:08.450> I<00:06:10.870> don't<00:06:11.870> know<00:06:12.050> I

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
in this video and it's um I don't know I

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.440 
in this video and it's um I don't know I
just<00:06:12.590> kind<00:06:12.889> of<00:06:12.950> line<00:06:13.400> my<00:06:13.639> lips<00:06:13.820> with<00:06:14.030> this<00:06:14.180> and

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
just kind of line my lips with this and

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.589 
just kind of line my lips with this and
then<00:06:14.630> I<00:06:14.780> smudge<00:06:15.380> it<00:06:15.560> in<00:06:15.740> so<00:06:16.729> it's<00:06:17.090> a<00:06:17.300> matte

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
then I smudge it in so it's a matte

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.200 
then I smudge it in so it's a matte
color<00:06:17.990> now<00:06:18.830> I'm<00:06:19.099> putting<00:06:19.310> on<00:06:19.550> the<00:06:19.789> blushing

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
color now I'm putting on the blushing

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.360 
color now I'm putting on the blushing
gauge<00:06:20.419> stuff<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:21.139> I'm<00:06:21.440> just<00:06:21.470> dabbing<00:06:22.160> it<00:06:22.220> on

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
gauge stuff and I'm just dabbing it on

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.310 
gauge stuff and I'm just dabbing it on
because<00:06:22.669> if<00:06:23.030> you<00:06:23.180> rub<00:06:23.389> it<00:06:23.419> on<00:06:23.599> it<00:06:23.930> looks<00:06:23.960> very

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
because if you rub it on it looks very

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.709 
because if you rub it on it looks very
shiny<00:06:24.889> in<00:06:25.220> cakey<00:06:25.580> and<00:06:25.760> I<00:06:25.940> like<00:06:26.150> more<00:06:26.450> of<00:06:26.479> a

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:26.719 
shiny in cakey and I like more of a

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.050 
shiny in cakey and I like more of a
matte<00:06:26.960> look<00:06:27.229> so<00:06:27.650> that's<00:06:27.890> why<00:06:28.099> I'm<00:06:28.250> dabbing<00:06:28.520> one
