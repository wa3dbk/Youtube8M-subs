the front here and the whole thing holds

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.430 
the front here and the whole thing holds
together<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.549> hang<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.880> right<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:25.049> then

thing out and add to it so it gives it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.020 
thing out and add to it so it gives it
some<00:01:38.820> modularity<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:41.520> other<00:01:41.670> thing

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
some modularity and the other thing

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.660 
some modularity and the other thing
about<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.860> other<00:01:43.950> thing<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.310> designed

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
about it we the other thing we designed

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.530 
about it we the other thing we designed
it<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.080> hook<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:47.640> front<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.180> our

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
it for was to hook to the front of our

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.899 
it for was to hook to the front of our
Engel<00:01:49.049> fridge<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.979> basically<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.520> set<00:01:50.790> up

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
Engel fridge so it basically is set up

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.480 
Engel fridge so it basically is set up
so<00:01:51.060> it'll<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.380> back<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:52.950> it's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
so it'll so that on the back here it's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.499 
so it'll so that on the back here it's
