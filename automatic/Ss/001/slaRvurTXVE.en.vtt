00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
body so this is what I decide to do with

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.139 
body so this is what I decide to do with
it<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.910> tried<00:00:41.910> before<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.520> gray<00:00:44.520> body<00:00:44.789> but

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.729 
it I tried before with the gray body but
that<00:00:45.510> didn't<00:00:45.780> turn<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:45.960> too<00:00:46.289> good<00:00:46.320> with
