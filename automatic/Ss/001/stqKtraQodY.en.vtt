00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.120 

make<00:02:05.479> sure<00:02:05.509> that<00:02:05.899> there<00:02:06.079> are<00:02:06.170> no<00:02:06.380> lumps<00:02:06.710> in<00:02:07.009> the

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
make sure that there are no lumps in the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.609 
make sure that there are no lumps in the
batter<00:02:07.159> of<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:08.360> gram<00:02:08.599> flour<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.410> batter

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
batter of the gram flour and the batter

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.979 
batter of the gram flour and the batter
is<00:02:09.920> absolutely<00:02:10.550> smooth<00:02:10.940> before<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.630> steam<00:02:11.959> it

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
is absolutely smooth before you steam it

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.530 
is absolutely smooth before you steam it
no<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.739> think<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.250> batter<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.700> now<00:02:13.819> ready<00:02:13.849> you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
no I think the batter is now ready you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.110 
no I think the batter is now ready you
can<00:02:14.690> see<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.140> consistency<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.220> it's<00:02:16.489> not

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
can see the consistency of it it's not

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.290 
can see the consistency of it it's not
very<00:02:17.420> thick<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.019> not<00:02:18.769> very<00:02:19.010> thin<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:19.970> batter

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
very thick and not very thin so batter

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.089 
very thick and not very thin so batter
is<00:02:20.540> now<00:02:20.690> ready<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.200> water<00:02:21.440> has<00:02:21.680> come<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.040> a

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
is now ready the water has come to a

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.009 
is now ready the water has come to a
boil<00:02:22.280> now<00:02:22.910> we'll<00:02:23.060> have<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.390> pour<00:02:23.599> this<00:02:23.780> batter

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
boil now we'll have to pour this batter

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.290 
boil now we'll have to pour this batter
in<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.349> thali<00:02:24.650> but<00:02:25.250> before<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.790> we'll<00:02:25.970> have<00:02:26.180> to

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
in a thali but before that we'll have to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.059 
in a thali but before that we'll have to
grease<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.720> thali<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.680> batter<00:02:27.890> does

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
grease the thali so that the batter does

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.640 
grease the thali so that the batter does
not<00:02:28.430> stick<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:28.940> tally<00:02:29.269> so<00:02:30.019> I<00:02:30.050> have<00:02:30.230> some

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
not stick to the tally so I have some

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.190 
not stick to the tally so I have some
steel<00:02:31.040> Thalys<00:02:31.459> over<00:02:31.670> here<00:02:31.900> we'll<00:02:32.900> pour<00:02:33.170> a

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
steel Thalys over here we'll pour a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.080 
steel Thalys over here we'll pour a
little<00:02:33.350> bit<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.680> oil<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.220> we'll<00:02:34.610> grease<00:02:34.850> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
little bit of oil and we'll grease the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.720 
little bit of oil and we'll grease the
honey<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.540> few<00:02:35.900> drops<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.319> oil<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.860> we'll<00:02:37.489> just

now will allow this to cool a little bit
after<00:03:31.639> which<00:03:31.819> we'll<00:03:32.030> cut<00:03:32.329> it<00:03:32.359> and<00:03:32.720> we'll

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
after which we'll cut it and we'll

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.900 
after which we'll cut it and we'll
temper<00:03:33.319> it<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.620> coating<00:03:34.100> already<00:03:34.400> mixture<00:03:34.760> is

now<00:03:35.060> cooled<00:03:35.359> down<00:03:35.569> let's<00:03:36.170> cut<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.620> into

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
now cooled down let's cut it into

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:45.860 
now cooled down let's cut it into
squares

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.330
