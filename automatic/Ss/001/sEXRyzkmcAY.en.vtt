00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
Four young Latin-American people.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.260
A challenge, chosen through internet.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.140
72 hrs. to accomplish it.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.090
Chosen case.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.160
My name is Homero. 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.230
I am Mexican and I live in Argentina. 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.120
I live with my girlfriend, Erica, who I am deeply in love with. 
Erica works as a model. 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.230
She was offered a job abroad. 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.270
The problem is that I am not self confident and I am afraid of losing Erica when she goes abroad. So, I want to marry her as soon as possible. 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.050
Challenge: Organize the first online wedding in the world, in 72 hs. “Express Wedding.”

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.140
We have to organize a wedding in 72 hours.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.030
I think it is going to be a good experience for all of us. 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.120
We have to achieve it no matter what.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.170
We will get them married through UStream. 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.190
I will ask in US Stream if anybody knows Homero and Erica…
Right

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.080
And if they can help us.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.280
We can use the tablets, build a UStream channel for the wedding and upload it in a webpage.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.270
We divided the tasks and the first one was to contact the groom.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.170
I would like to talk to him, listen to him, to know what he likes and what he does not like.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.280
I think we should talk to him right now.    

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.290
Homero, can you hear me? Have you already proposed to her? 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.090
No, not yet.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.250
So, that is the first challenge.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.020
You look a bit nervous. How are you?

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.000
Well, I am a bit nervous. I am about to propose to the love of my life.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.070
Yes, but do it from your heart.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.180
Meeting her was definitely essential.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.290
Hi, my love, how are you?

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.150
And this? 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.070
Thank you!

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.290
We had to think if he had already proposed to her or not, and for me that is a delicate issue.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.110
Will you marry me?

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.210
It is not possible…no.
Please…

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.080
No, darling, this is not the way we have dreamed it, at least this is how you dreamed it, not me.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.210
She was very negative. She did not want to.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.080
I do not think this can come out as I have dreamed, in only 3 days.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.260
Do not worry about that. We will make sure you feel comfortable and have the wedding of your dreams.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.090
I promise you it will unforgettable.

00:02:00,09 --&gt; 00:02:00,08
I love you.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.120
Nico, Mox
She said yes!

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.200
We achieved the first challenge: Erica, the bride, accepted the proposal.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:19.120
And why not ask the social networks? I sent the question and a guy said that the chroma key is very much used in photography and cinema. 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.270
And I started to investigate how we can use a chroma key, use a green screen to pretend, to create an atmosphere. 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.000
We can be everywhere at the same time, if we want to. In México’s Cathedral, we can be in San Isidro. 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.220
I think we will save time and money.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.160
I met Homero, a great guy. We went to buy his suit and the rings. 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.010
I have not seen Ann-Marie that much because she was with the bride all day long, looking for the shoes. In fact, she came back quite stressed.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.130
The bride. Dani, our designer. 
You are the bride. How are you?

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.110
It was quite a hard day. I thought she was a very sweet girl and suddenly…she became crazy. 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.050
Very vain, very fussy.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.050
Daniel Ifer – Designer

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.040
No, no, no. I do not like it. I want another one.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.240
I will see how it fits. Anyway, the flowers are like… It has another fabric underneath and I look fat.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.270
Ok, let’s see another.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.160
And if I do not like any of them. What will happen?
Uf!

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.080
Very fussy.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.100
She felt bad, he felt bad. There was a tense moment. 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.270
I think a bride should feel the most beautiful in the world. I feel ridiculous.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.010
With the time left, I am not sure we will make it.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.130
Is the open invitation ready?
Yes

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.170
Great. How can you have all this open?

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.120
Because I use Intel Core i5.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.270
That is great.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.200
The four of us will be wearing bows to see to the people, because there will be no waiters. 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.050
How come there are no waiters?

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.030
I mean there is only one. And you will go like this with your pad. 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.280
No, no, no. How come there are no waiters? 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.230
Oh, I wanted to kill him! 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.000
Do you think I have to carry a tray?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.050
If we have the money to hire waiters, we will hire them.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.190
Remember we have less than 24 hours left and we need to solve it, guys, solve it.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.090
The wedding

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.080
How do you feel? Nervous.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.030
Homero, are you there? The camera. What do you think? How do you feel?

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.040
Fine. I only need a hairdo.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.110
Hi, how are you? 
Fine? 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.140
Surnames, please.

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.090
Please do come in.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.130
After the ceremony, we will change the setting and we will have dinner here, 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.230
and then we will take the tables and chairs out of here and we will have the party.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.000
Homero, do you take Erica to be your wife?

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.220
Yes,I do.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.080
Erica, do you take Homero to be your husband?

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.110
Yes, I do.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.100
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.040
Wow, how nice!

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:34.020
I felt like a real hostess so I wanted to make sure everything was OK: the music, the cake, and the people.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.250
I will call Stephanie, Homero’s sister. She is in Mexico.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.110
Stephanie, how are you?

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.260
A surprise for the groom.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.100
Congratulations to both of you. We love you so much. Erica, welcome to our family. 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.250
As I have already told you, this is our wedding and here we are, just married. 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:18.020
I would like to introduce you to Erica’s family. Nancy, well, my brother, Carlos, 
Hortensia and Melisa.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.070
Hello, how are you?

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.240
Now we have the opportunity to see you and know you.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.030
My father in law is waiting right her to talk to you.
Hello, how are you?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.280
We have used a cinema technique and it was seen worldwide on the internet.
