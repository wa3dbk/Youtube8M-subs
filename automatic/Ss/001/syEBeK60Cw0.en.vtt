 the tutorial on how to make street gifs and 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.280
 That's good, I'm glad that I'm a yard. 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.529
 I'm teaching you here how it 's like 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.820
 Are you going to create gifs with 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.010
 program 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.800
 photo escape that has no devil right? 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.480
 you will have your moves here with 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.280
 the green background that's all there, you 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.469
 Are you going to get some movement here? 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.480
 stopped even though you can not move 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.239
 then you pick one select a control c 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.899
 opened a new one here 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.760
 the school is picking up the bucket of paint the button 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.100
 right on it and it will turn white 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:04.159
 Just adjust what things to stay. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:07.950
 a line 12 you leave it is normal 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.260
 You will modify it in the next 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.150
 I'll leave it transparent that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.150
 provided leaving the same height 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.750
 There is what you will change is what you 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.750
 would you like 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:40.390
 I had to do can do so 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:45.880
 can do so and here you will click 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.700
 with this thing here pick up pick up color is 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.490
 took the perspective is that it took him 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.500
 and then click Next. 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.170
 I will not do it, it 'll only have to 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.359
 do enough and until you get to the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.359
 end here is some more 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:10.269
 It will get bigger like this here. 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:15.970
 for example close to show my self 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:23.819
 I caught and beans there too caught here 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.819
 This is what you did there, you save it. 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:32.530
 there you will create the movements in the 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.030
 moves here you will create are you 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.849
 moves these movements to the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:42.310
 stay right and you can do it when you 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:46.630
 grow up forgetful that you're gone 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:52.370
 Here you get white there that size 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:55.730
 it's good here 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.299
 there you create an otta folder made here 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.690
 who put more or less in the middle and not 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.849
 left of it bypassed Pocinho 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.060
 bypassed in it so leaves it normal 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:14.420
 the way it is in the middle and big 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:24.049
 There you save as png image and it goes 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:28.220
 create a folder that the video if and 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:33.560
 image on your doll there is a picture is 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.930
 pixel art and the other one is cesava vai 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.879
 back in pixel art 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.180
 Take care to be so zoomed here for the 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:48.709
 line has found control and 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.420
 mouse ball forward will have 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.040
 so you will not be able to see if you 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.250
 Doing so will go wrong. 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.660
 then click on select in the 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.130
 select and click selection 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.799
 transparent 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.040
 there you will line up with the top 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:07.340
 He's here to see what's wrong. 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.669
 this black line is now right 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:16.450
 Then you 'll take the transparent and go 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:18.650
 disappeared last the last one was like 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:23.000
 22 same thing 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.360
 aligning with the tip until your 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.360
 movements 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.229
 I'll get here, it can not be any more 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.900
 of a contour line because otherwise 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.930
 he's wrong transparent shots after 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.919
 to align 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.919
 know how next year 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.300
 After you do that you will have 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.110
 that come back in these images to be able to 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.350
 leave them green for the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.510
 issue could leave the fund with 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.910
 any fund can take that fund 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.730
 green and put it in the room by 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.610
 example I'm doing here I think 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.490
 I'm going to cut this fourth because it's too 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.320
 boring is watching people making their 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.370
 I think you guys are not going to like it. 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.230
 but I'll cut it 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.470

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:28.090

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:49.689
 his display time decreases there 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:52.960
 stayed so you may have dictated the 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:55.150
