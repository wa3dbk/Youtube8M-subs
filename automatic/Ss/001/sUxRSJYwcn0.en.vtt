00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.639
 you 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.300
 objectives the objectives of this video 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.270
 are show the stages of the 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.829
 embryonic segmentation in an amphibian and 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.239
 explain the technique to obtain 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.239
 embryos of batrachians 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.510
 ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.540
 this is the main axiom of the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.520
 embryology what does this mean first 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.560
 define in each term separately 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.530
 ontogeny also called 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.540
 morphogenesis how much genesis describes the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.290
 development of an organism from the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.510
 zygote until its in essence turn the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.030
 phylogeny is defined as history 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.010
 evolutionary of the species its mission is 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.150
 know the evolutionary relationships between 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.720
 the species 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.850
 therefore this axiom implies that the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.620
 Embryos of higher species are usually 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.500
 pass during its embryonic development 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.760
 by stages that are similar to 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.950
 of the species evolutionarily 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.780
 inferior to them 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.180
 taking into account this principle 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.829
 we can extrapolate what happens to the 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.210
 humans based on development 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.210
 embryonic of other species 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.700
 the fertilization of amphibians in 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.070
 general is external this implies that the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.990
 oocytes and sperm are fertilized 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.790
 outside the body of the female and it 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.790
 It usually occurs in the aquatic environment 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.390
 in this video I will explain the technique for 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.280
 fecundate toad oocytes and it will be observed 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.509
 the embryonic development of it in 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.509
 his first studies 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.280
 fertilization technique 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.500
 one day before the induction of the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.200
 ovulation the females are entered 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.180
 adults to the laboratory and are kept in 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.300
 a container containing running water 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.069
 with a height of one centimeter 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.940
 approximately to 25 degrees centigrade 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.520
 and with lighting 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.430
 males differ from females 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.650
 for its smaller size and because this one 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.070
 when being grabbed by the spine it tends to 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.070
 to sing 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.650
 ovulation of the female is induced in 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.930
 afternoon or evening schedule through the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.390
 Intraperitoneal injection of 2500 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.849
 units of chorionic gonadotrophin or 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.739
 well with intraperitoneal injection of 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.290
 homogeneous female pituitary and 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.540
 male of the same species 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.450
 for the realization of the homogenous cough of 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.940
 the hypophysis sedes marrow the animal and it 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.730
 discover the floor of the mouth 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.330
 to expose the palate 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.520
 the hypophysis is removed from the soft palate 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.920
 it is located between the two eyes 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.630
 once the pituitary gland is removed 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.630
 homogenizes in ringer for amphibians 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.579
 the injected females are kept in 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.920
 a container with water and in an environment 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.110
 warm with light on for 12 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.920
 hours until they begin to expel the 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.360
 first oocytes through the cloaca 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.580
 later it proceeds to des medular 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.460
 the same ones using a des medula dor 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.860
 and the oocytes are extracted from the 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.350
 bishops taking care not to cut the network 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.140
 vascular 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.760
 simultaneously the bone marrow to the male and 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.000
 the testicles are removed and the 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.000
 hypophysis 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.370
 the testicles are homogenized in a 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.050
 richter solution and the oocytes 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.450
 obtained are fertilized 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.040
 immediately in petri dishes with the 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.890
 concentrated solution of reinier and 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.019
 sperm and after 15 minutes it 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.209
 complete the ringer solution until 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.340
 cover the oocytes in order to avoid 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.190
 permia polis and they remain in the 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.870
 containers for 15 more minutes 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.300
 then they are transferred to capsules of 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.670
 petri with ringer for amphibians 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.830
 the amphibian eggs are found 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.980
 included in a gelatinous strip called 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.170
 bargain which must be removed 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.050
 For this, a solution of 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.150
 1% glycolic acid neutralized with 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.520
 potassium hydroxide in solution 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.490
 richter for amphibians first 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.580
 the embryos are washed four times in 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.440
 cold ringer solution for amphibians 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.180
 of cattle consists in placing the 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.150
 embryos inside a small glass of 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.060
 precipitation and add 20,000 liters of 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.220
 acid has a 1% colic is agitated 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.070
 gently until the 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.840
 embryos and the acid is removed with 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.970
 plastic pasteur pipette for 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.370
 Then rinse in solution 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.979
 re-plant amphibians 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.389
 one last rinse is carried out with 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.389
 potassium phosphate base 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.200
 the embryos are allowed to develop in 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.150
 Petri dishes to different 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.750
 temperatures so that their evolution will 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.660
 perform at different speeds 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.940
 the embryos thus achieved are fixed and 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.450
 included in gel paraffin in capsules 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.450
 from petra 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.130
 it is called segmentation or cleavage 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.930
 early embryological process that 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.300
 consists of a series of divisions 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.230
 zygote cells that are produced 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.420
 before gastronomy 'morphology of 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.490
 egg and in particular with the amount of 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.979
 edit what it contains 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.590
 the cells resulting from the division 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.870
 of the zygote are called walking sticks and 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.810
 they form a compact mass called morula 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.050
 from this the seedling is formed and 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.270
 subsequently the spent 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.150
 the screening results from two processes 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.940
 cardio sinesis or division of the core of the 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.819
 mechanical agent is the mitotic spindle and the 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:03.330
 hundred without exis or cell division whose 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:05.340
 mechanical agent is the contact ring to 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.319
 then they will be observed using 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.270
 a magnifying glass the toad embryos in their 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:10.880
 different stages during the process of 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.460
 segmentation 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.850
 in this image an oocyte is observed 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.850
 fertilized 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.850
 here the first plane of 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.230
 screening that determines the emergence of 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.230
 the first two blast or less 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.300
 this is an eight-cell embryo 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.100
 note that in the amphibians the four 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.470
 superior tomeros polo are more 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.330
 small than the others in this 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.240
 embryo there are already three planes of 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.920
 cleavage two at right angles that 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.960
 originated the first four vast 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.390
 groupers and the third cut to the 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.590
 previous transversely generating 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:51.110
 the big stickmen 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.150
 at this stage the embryo acquires the 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.150
 appearance of a default and is called 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.310
 modulates the cell divisions go 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.850
 thus generating an exponential number of 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.850
 cells 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.889
 later the embryo will 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.229
 develops in blas tula that has a 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:10.840
 internal cavity that is called blast or cl 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:14.370
 in this image the clearest area of 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.370
 embryo is plasters l 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.080
 in the human embryo said stadium 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.729
 it is called blastocyst and it is 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.800
 able to part with the 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:24.800
 zona pellucida and implanted in the uterus 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.300
 for the realization of this video it 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.300
 They consulted the following websites 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.960
 and making this material have 

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:41.790
 fulfilled its objectives I thank you 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.790
 the visit to the video bank
