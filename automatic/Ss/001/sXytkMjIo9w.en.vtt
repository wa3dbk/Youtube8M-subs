00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
in the front kind of on the side and I'm

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.440 
in the front kind of on the side and I'm
going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> make<00:00:33.750> four<00:00:34.050> regular<00:00:34.320> braids<00:00:35.450> all

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
right I went ahead and made these braids

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.770 
right I went ahead and made these braids
off-camera<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.540> would<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.719> been

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
off-camera because that would have been

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.110 
off-camera because that would have been
some<00:00:40.110> pretty<00:00:40.260> boring<00:00:40.680> footage<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.820> made<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
some pretty boring footage but I made a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
some pretty boring footage but I made a
part<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.110> side<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:43.950> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
part here on the side and then I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 
part here on the side and then I
basically<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.579> sectioned<00:00:45.239> off<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.690> bangs

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
basically just sectioned off this bangs

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.040 
basically just sectioned off this bangs
area<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.829> then<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.160> made<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.510> regular

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
area and then I made for just regular

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.260 
area and then I made for just regular
three<00:00:49.379> strand<00:00:49.410> braids<00:00:49.950> we're<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.180> be

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
three strand braids we're going to be

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.150 
three strand braids we're going to be
making<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.870> scissor<00:00:52.170> braid<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:52.710> these<00:00:52.890> four

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
making a scissor braid with these four

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790 
making a scissor braid with these four
braids<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.480> already<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> original

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
braids and we already have the original

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619 
braids and we already have the original
scissor<00:00:56.039> braids<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.640> our<00:00:56.850> channel<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.480> will

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
scissor braids on our channel I will

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.450 
scissor braids on our channel I will
have<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.930> linked<00:00:58.230> below<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:59.190> only

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
have that linked below the only

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.160 
have that linked below the only
difference<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.059> instead<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.480> using<00:01:00.719> four

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
difference is instead of using four

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.959 
difference is instead of using four
strands<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.739> hair<00:01:01.920> I'm<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.640> using
