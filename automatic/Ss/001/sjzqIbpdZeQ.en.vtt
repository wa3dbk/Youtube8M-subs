top<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.890> all<00:02:14.100> your<00:02:14.280> layers<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.750> set<00:02:15.900> to

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
top of all your layers I have it set to

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.140 
top of all your layers I have it set to
linear<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.800> then<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.700> 90<00:02:18.890> degree<00:02:19.890> angle<00:02:20.250> one

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
linear and then a 90 degree angle one

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.180 
linear and then a 90 degree angle one
hundred<00:02:21.390> percent<00:02:21.420> scale<00:02:21.930> align<00:02:22.800> with<00:02:22.950> layer

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
hundred percent scale align with layer

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.960 
hundred percent scale align with layer
click<00:02:23.550> OK<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.330> then<00:02:25.310> over<00:02:26.310> here<00:02:26.340> you're<00:02:26.730> going

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
click OK and then over here you're going

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.460 
click OK and then over here you're going
to<00:02:27.090> tone<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.050> down<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.860> well<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:30.200> probably<00:02:31.200> set

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
to tone it down as well I probably set

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.930 
to tone it down as well I probably set
it<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.800> about<00:02:31.830> fifty<00:02:32.760> percent<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:35.700> is

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
it to about fifty percent and that is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.730 
it to about fifty percent and that is
what<00:02:36.150> gives<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.930> love<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.380> because<00:02:37.410> add

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
what gives you I love it because add

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.920 
what gives you I love it because add
some<00:02:38.070> color<00:02:38.310> here<00:02:38.880> toward<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.540> white<00:02:39.750> space

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
some color here toward the white space

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.680 
some color here toward the white space
list<00:02:40.320> yeah<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.190> fades<00:02:41.490> away<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:41.880> your<00:02:42.210> subjects

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
list yeah it fades away so your subjects

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.280 
list yeah it fades away so your subjects
still<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.380> really<00:02:43.740> sharp<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.460> focus

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
still is really sharp and in focus

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.450 
still is really sharp and in focus
another<00:02:46.290> cool<00:02:46.500> thing<00:02:46.560> about<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.010> gradient

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
another cool thing about the gradient

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.600 
another cool thing about the gradient
fill<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.910> if<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.270> run<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.320> again<00:02:49.710> so<00:02:50.250> click<00:02:50.490> on

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
fill is if you run it again so click on

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.650 
fill is if you run it again so click on
gradient<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:52.800> can<00:02:53.010> change<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.610> angle<00:02:54.120> to

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
gradient and you can change the angle to

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.990 
gradient and you can change the angle to
anywhere<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.800> photo<00:02:56.100> where<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.640> want<00:02:56.880> it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
anywhere in the photo where you want it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.830 
anywhere in the photo where you want it
to<00:02:57.060> fill<00:02:58.130> um<00:02:59.130> what's<00:03:00.000> cool<00:03:00.240> about<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.600> you

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
to fill um what's cool about that you

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.990 
to fill um what's cool about that you
can<00:03:01.050> add<00:03:01.320> like<00:03:01.890> almost<00:03:02.190> like<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.400> son<00:03:02.730> washed

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
can add like almost like a son washed

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.400 
can add like almost like a son washed
Phil<00:03:03.360> if<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.720> do<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.930> where<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.200> Sun<00:03:04.380> is

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
Phil if you do it where the Sun is

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.060 
Phil if you do it where the Sun is
coming<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:04.950> I'm<00:03:05.010> going<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.220> kind<00:03:05.460> of<00:03:05.520> like<00:03:05.660> 151

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
coming so I'm going to kind of like 151

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.250 
coming so I'm going to kind of like 151
degree<00:03:08.070> angle<00:03:08.520> click<00:03:08.790> OK<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.660> then<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.050> can

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
degree angle click OK and then you can

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.630 
degree angle click OK and then you can
tone<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.590> down<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:13.170> then<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.100> coming<00:03:14.460> from

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
tone it down and then it's coming from

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.170 
tone it down and then it's coming from
where<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.150> sky<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:15.930> might<00:03:16.170> even<00:03:16.910> give<00:03:17.910> the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
where the sky is so might even give the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.730 
where the sky is so might even give the
effect<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:19.310> there's<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.430> lot<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.670> sunshine<00:03:21.740> ok

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
effect that there's a lot of sunshine ok

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.000 
effect that there's a lot of sunshine ok
so<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:23.400> mean<00:03:23.670> that's<00:03:23.850> just<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.240> five<00:03:24.420> percent

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
so I mean that's just that five percent

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.120 
so I mean that's just that five percent
but<00:03:26.010> if<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.310> click<00:03:26.550> on<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:27.410> um<00:03:28.410> still<00:03:28.980> is

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
but if you click on it um still is

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.350 
but if you click on it um still is
adding<00:03:29.520> just<00:03:30.210> a<00:03:30.360> touch<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.960> a<00:03:32.000> little<00:03:33.000> touch<00:03:33.180> of

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
adding just a touch of a little touch of

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.960 
adding just a touch of a little touch of
Phil<00:03:33.540> there<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.580> another<00:03:35.580> one<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.910> my

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
Phil there and another one of my

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.780
