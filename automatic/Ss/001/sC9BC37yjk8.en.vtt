00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.979 
maybe they were either gone or they
hadn't<00:02:51.160> arrived<00:02:51.430> yet<00:02:51.610> we<00:02:51.879> were<00:02:52.030> early<00:02:52.599> for<00:02:52.870> the

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
hadn't arrived yet we were early for the

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.869 
hadn't arrived yet we were early for the
goose<00:02:53.170> migration<00:02:53.410> season<00:02:54.040> but<00:02:54.370> we<00:02:54.489> figured

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
goose migration season but we figured

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.640 
goose migration season but we figured
we'd<00:02:55.030> take<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.360> chance<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.290> looked<00:02:56.470> like

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
we'd take the chance and it looked like

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.440 
we'd take the chance and it looked like
it<00:02:56.769> wasn't<00:02:56.889> gonna<00:02:57.069> pay<00:02:57.310> off<00:02:57.519> then<00:02:57.970> we<00:02:58.269> got

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
it wasn't gonna pay off then we got

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.390 
it wasn't gonna pay off then we got
kinda<00:02:58.900> lost<00:02:59.049> driving<00:02:59.440> around<00:02:59.650> on<00:02:59.859> backroads

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
kinda lost driving around on backroads

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.520 
kinda lost driving around on backroads
through<00:03:00.730> well<00:03:00.940> horse<00:03:01.299> pasture<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:02.200> I'd

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
through well horse pasture and I'd

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.229 
through well horse pasture and I'd
pretty<00:03:02.920> much<00:03:03.010> given<00:03:03.160> up<00:03:03.519> on<00:03:03.670> seeing<00:03:03.940> whose

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
pretty much given up on seeing whose

it<00:03:07.510> was<00:03:07.720> beautiful<00:03:08.230> but<00:03:08.799> then<00:03:09.040> they're<00:03:09.849> right

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
it was beautiful but then they're right

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:42.830 
it was beautiful but then they're right
ahead<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.650> us
