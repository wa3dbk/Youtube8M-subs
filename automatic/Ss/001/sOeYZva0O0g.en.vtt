like a mr pacman just cut a little tiny

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:56.960 
like a mr pacman just cut a little tiny
slice<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:30.079> both<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.110> them

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.300 

once<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.870> this<00:01:58.020> done<00:01:58.260> I'm<00:01:58.500> going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.100> cut

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
once I have this done I'm going to cut

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.440 
once I have this done I'm going to cut
down<00:01:59.520> my<00:02:00.000> eye<00:02:00.390> pin<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.380> size<00:02:01.620> and<00:02:02.240> add<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> little

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
down my eye pin to size and add a little

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.890 
down my eye pin to size and add a little
East<00:02:03.750> 6000<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.650> put<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.580> into<00:02:05.820> some<00:02:06.600> point

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
East 6000 and put that into some point

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.280 
East 6000 and put that into some point
on<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.729> larger<00:02:09.119> circle<00:02:09.570> because<00:02:10.140> that's

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
on this the larger circle because that's

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:33.440 
on this the larger circle because that's
going<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.800> be<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> crabs<00:02:11.280> body

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.250 

next<00:02:34.230> take<00:02:34.410> your<00:02:34.650> TLS<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.780> what<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.810> do<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.050> I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
next take your TLS and what I do is I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.890 
next take your TLS and what I do is I
put<00:02:37.290> two<00:02:37.890> dots<00:02:38.069> near<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.640> top<00:02:38.849> because<00:02:39.780> this

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
put two dots near the top because this

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.600 
put two dots near the top because this
is<00:02:40.080> where<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.500> pac-man<00:02:40.739> pieces<00:02:41.280> are<00:02:41.400> going<00:02:41.550> to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
is where the pac-man pieces are going to

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.140 
is where the pac-man pieces are going to
go<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.000> then<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.750> make<00:02:42.959> two<00:02:43.410> lines<00:02:43.769> on<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.910> side

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
go and then I make two lines on the side

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.940 
go and then I make two lines on the side
and<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.450> use<00:02:45.629> a<00:02:45.660> dotting<00:02:45.930> tool<00:02:46.110> because<00:02:46.769> it's

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
and I use a dotting tool because it's

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.940 
and I use a dotting tool because it's
kind<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.340> easier<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.849> get<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.120> perfect<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.200> not

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
kind of easier to get it perfect and not

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.120 
kind of easier to get it perfect and not
get<00:02:50.130> too<00:02:50.280> much<00:02:50.459> on<00:02:50.700> there<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.950> reason

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
get too much on there and the reason

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.920 
get too much on there and the reason
that<00:02:53.310> I'm<00:02:53.519> doing<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:53.970> because<00:02:54.239> the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
that I'm doing this is because the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.660 
that I'm doing this is because the
little<00:02:55.170> legs<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.340> claws<00:02:56.580> are<00:02:56.970> hard<00:02:57.750> to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
little legs and the claws are hard to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.509 
little legs and the claws are hard to
try<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.700> stick<00:03:00.120> on<00:03:00.360> without<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.349> TLS<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.130> TLS

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
try to stick on without the TLS the TLS

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.670 
try to stick on without the TLS the TLS
just<00:03:02.730> adds<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.060> little<00:03:03.239> bit<00:03:03.390> more<00:03:04.049> support<00:03:04.530> so

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
just adds a little bit more support so

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.440 
just adds a little bit more support so
that<00:03:04.769> they<00:03:04.950> don't<00:03:05.069> fall<00:03:05.340> off<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:09.180> once<00:03:09.330> you

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
that they don't fall off so once you

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.670 
that they don't fall off so once you
have<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.599> done<00:03:09.750> go<00:03:10.049> ahead<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.380> add<00:03:10.500> your

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
have that done go ahead and add your

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.000 
have that done go ahead and add your
little<00:03:10.890> close<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.090> top<00:03:12.269> make<00:03:12.510> sure<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
little close to the top make sure the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.280 
little close to the top make sure the
the<00:03:14.010> part<00:03:14.280> where<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.700> slice<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.360> sticking<00:03:16.110> out

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
the part where the slice is sticking out

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.140 
the part where the slice is sticking out
because<00:03:16.769> that's<00:03:17.010> going<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.370> be<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.610> clause<00:03:17.880> if

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
because that's going to be the clause if

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.330 
because that's going to be the clause if
you<00:03:18.269> didn't<00:03:18.630> realize<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:25.130> then<00:03:26.130> take

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
you didn't realize that and then take

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.539 
you didn't realize that and then take
three<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.660> long<00:03:28.530> pieces<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.250> made

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
three of the long pieces that you made

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.880 
three of the long pieces that you made
and<00:03:29.790> put<00:03:30.660> them<00:03:30.780> together<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.769> then

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
and put them together like that and then

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.130 
and put them together like that and then
stick<00:03:32.220> them<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:33.329> side<00:03:33.569> for<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.900> crabs

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
stick them on the side for the crabs

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.640 
stick them on the side for the crabs
legs<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:35.299> do<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.420> same<00:03:36.630> with<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.930> ones<00:03:37.110> for

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
legs and do the same with the ones for

00:03:37.650 --> 00:04:03.630 
legs and do the same with the ones for
the<00:03:37.739> other<00:03:37.859> side

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.580 

now<00:04:04.180> go<00:04:04.330> ahead<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.600> get<00:04:04.660> your<00:04:04.810> black<00:04:05.020> clay<00:04:05.290> and

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
now go ahead and get your black clay and

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.940 
now go ahead and get your black clay and
roll<00:04:05.920> two<00:04:06.220> very<00:04:06.730> small<00:04:06.910> balls<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.780> clay<00:04:08.620> and

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
roll two very small balls of clay and

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.380 
roll two very small balls of clay and
these<00:04:09.400> are<00:04:09.490> going<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.670> be<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.850> eyes<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:10.360> you

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
these are going to be the eyes so you

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.350 
these are going to be the eyes so you
can<00:04:10.569> just<00:04:10.600> place<00:04:11.050> them<00:04:12.000> like<00:04:13.000> where<00:04:13.240> I'm

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
can just place them like where I'm

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.140 
can just place them like where I'm
placing<00:04:13.690> them<00:04:14.050> on<00:04:14.080> line<00:04:14.580> right<00:04:15.580> there<00:04:15.880> and

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
placing them on line right there and

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.660 
placing them on line right there and
once<00:04:17.109> this<00:04:17.200> is<00:04:17.380> finished<00:04:17.590> bake<00:04:18.400> in<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.640> oven

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
at 275 for 15 minutes once that's

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.800 
at 275 for 15 minutes once that's
finished<00:04:22.960> you're<00:04:23.560> going<00:04:23.890> to<00:04:24.070> want<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.810> wait

finished you're going to want to wait

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.930 
finished you're going to want to wait
for<00:04:25.990> it<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.110> dry<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.680> mean<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.280> cool<00:04:27.490> down<00:04:27.520> and

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
for it to dry I mean to cool down and

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.940 
for it to dry I mean to cool down and
then<00:04:28.000> add<00:04:28.390> two<00:04:28.780> layers<00:04:28.990> of<00:04:29.350> sculpey<00:04:29.740> glass

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
then add two layers of sculpey glass

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.130 
then add two layers of sculpey glass
glaze<00:04:30.250> for<00:04:30.460> maximum<00:04:30.850> glossiness<00:04:31.240> this<00:04:31.900> will

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
glaze for maximum glossiness this will

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.290 
glaze for maximum glossiness this will
also<00:04:32.290> help<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.680> keep<00:04:32.919> it<00:04:33.070> together<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.669> you
