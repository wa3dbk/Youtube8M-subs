00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.669
 hello to all know that the video of 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.990
 Friday will be online on Saturday at 10 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.630
 hours so there will be no video 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.240
 Friday here is what we will do 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.369
 today a personalized cup and 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.789
 here is the list of the material that you 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:31.880
 So first I printed 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.830
 a little typo on photoshop and I'm going 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.510
 so cut off my home using a 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.559
 scalpel 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.149
 so there we absorb in cuts and 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.489
 only one knowing that the two words 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.629
 are the same and for the word sweet that 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.280
 not at all is the same but good 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.750
 it was to give a little overview of 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.750
 what is it going to give roughly 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.840
 so or cuts well with a scalpel 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.850
 all around we are careful not to 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.680
 cut off your fingers if you do not know 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.750
 do not hesitate to ask for help from a 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.680
 of your parents 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.680
 it's always better than cutting yourself a 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.299
 finger I assure you I'm sorry this 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.860
 martin little bit rude but I am 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.740
 still a little sick so I have not 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:15.140
 totally recovered my voice finally 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.420
 I hope that it will go so here is once 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.670
 that you have cut out your word you 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.290
 keep that aside and we'll take our 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.149
 polymer clay so I decided to move on 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.750
 to serbia for this story tutorial 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.179
 try it and so here I took the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.229
 purple color in glamor so interest 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.450
 of this dough is that it is a little 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.670
 pearled so then I'm going to put all 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.869
 my letters on my paw that I flattened 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.369
 and I'm going to give a little bit of 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.560
 roll to make sure to stick the 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.630
 letters is actually given a footprint 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.479
 on my paw that will then allow me 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:53.390
 to cut exactly the same form of 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.280
 letter so I take my scalpel and I 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.899
 come cut all around the pool in 2 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.390
 times I first cut slightly and 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.490
 then I cut deeply for 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.420
 to really have all my letters well 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.729
 cut properly I then remove 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.750
 the excess of dough is also the surplus 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.750
 which binds to whose little high 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.050
 and I'm going to take a cup or a bug 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.000
 of your choice this one I found them 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.820
 to cultura for three times nothing 2 euros 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.450
 something and then I placed my 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.430
 letters so here it's just going in fact 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.130
 medea then well place my word on 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.410
 sweet momo that I'm going to write to 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.480
 marker so then I did 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.770
 exactly the same with the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.940
 paternity yellow and there I do that all of 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.830
 next do not you do not have to june 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.210
 just actually soften the edges for 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.860
 really do not have too much it's ferran 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.230
 bullous and that it is a little bit more 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.620
 sweet and a little bit nicer to 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.300
 watch 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.650
 so I did not press at all on my 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.020
 letters not some alcohols 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.900
 completely i will then take my 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.500
 posca pencil and i'm going to start 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.700
 write my sweet word so freehand 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.940
 so if you do not know how to do it by hand 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.230
 lift train yourself but the interest 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.760
 it is possible to erase with 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.620
 dissolving so really you are you 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.670
 deceived so you can go there 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.030
 repeat several times there is no 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.190
 worry more we are not at all 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.750
 obliged to write like me so really 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.490
 let your imagination speak or 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.950
 do you inhale typo that you have 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.010
 found on the internet is also very 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.870
 well then the interest of writing oscars 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.040
 is that they write everywhere in fact 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.170
 you can really here on the fabrics 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.540
 are really all the materials so 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.400
 there actually to really seal the 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.940
 posca pencil it will be put in the oven 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.680
 afterwards and after me I would have 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.330
 varnish anyway over to be 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.330
 sure it's ok 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.930
 am really you do not have a pencil 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.290
 skin sky which you are not sure that it 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.330
 yours 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.480
 take paint directly at 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:02.230
 porcelain or porcelain marker 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.550
 I think it will be as good 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.550
 even better why not 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.450
 so here I did everything to the sweatshirt 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.940
 and now I'm going to kidnap the kid and 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.580
 I'm going to come and put my mug at 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.640
 oven at 160 degrees for 30 minutes 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.080
 to be sure that the post case is yours 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.670
 then I put my kid back and I do 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.670
 same thing with my fatherhood 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.270
 and as I found that the letters is 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.890
 a little bit smooth and a little bit bland 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.780
 I wondered what I could 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.370
 do and so eventually I found that 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.130
 put a little bit of textures are 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.860
 every letter that could lead to bring 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.140
 a nice little side and I tested and I 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.190
 am quite happy with the result 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.530
 after you do not have to do it 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.790
 of course but it can be an idea that 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.050
 makes the letters a little bit less 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.210
 smooth and a little less bland to 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.270
 to look more, it brings 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.680
 texture to the touch so I'm going to do that 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.780
 on everything but being with different 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.280
 tools 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.830
 so me my letters have very very good 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.070
 stuck on the porcelain I did not have 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.890
 any problem where it took off after 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.560
 chords tonight with hand washing 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.310
 of course not fake to pass it to 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.050
 dishwasher otherwise you risk 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.630
 completely to damage a 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.700
 but if it really comes off put 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.320
 the strong glue and as a letter to 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.930
 radios like the letter will have already taken its 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.490
 shape it will be perfect then I take 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.470
 thermal paste so that's it 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.110
 paste porcelain effect at the end actually 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.780
 so that's the number one and I'm going 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.090
 come make little hearts that I co 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.570
 the press on the cup to give a 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.919
 little more colors so it's 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.180
 same but little heart have very very 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.380
 alright so and so do not you know 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.790
 well pressed on do not forget to 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.650
 rub a little bit with your hand 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.120
 to remove all fingerprints 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.280
 because it's not very pretty to look at 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.050
 then 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.910
 and that's all we have left 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.990
 put your mail again this 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.630
 time to cook the thermal paste 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.650
 which 30 minutes to 110 degrees and you 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.020
 will have finished 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.200
 I hope you liked this tutorial I 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.310
