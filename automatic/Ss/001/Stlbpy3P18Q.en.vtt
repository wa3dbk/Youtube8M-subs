while<00:00:30.150> we're<00:00:30.300> waiting<00:00:30.570> here

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900

it loads very slowly against this some

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.569 
it loads very slowly against this some
low<00:00:36.780> your<00:00:37.350> focus<00:00:38.100> loves<00:00:38.910> very<00:00:39.390> very<00:00:39.719> slowly<00:00:40.579> of

low your focus loves very very slowly of

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340

course<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.300> ported<00:00:42.780> pretty<00:00:42.989> much<00:00:43.170> from

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
course this is ported pretty much from

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.709 
course this is ported pretty much from
the<00:00:43.410> Xperia<00:00:44.070> Play<00:00:44.280> which<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:45.090> probably<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the Xperia Play which was probably the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.029 
the Xperia Play which was probably the
worst<00:00:45.899> phone<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> think<00:00:46.710> they<00:00:46.860> could<00:00:47.010> have

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
worst phone I think they could have

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.520 
worst phone I think they could have
launched<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:48.719> we're<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> back<00:00:49.320> up

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
launched on so we're going to back up

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.220 
launched on so we're going to back up
here<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.920> little<00:00:49.980> bit<00:00:50.129> man<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
here just a little bit man and get the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.600 
here just a little bit man and get the
greatest<00:00:52.440> idea<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.860> wanted<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.340> real

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
greatest idea but I wanted this in real

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.850 
greatest idea but I wanted this in real
time<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.030> show<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.570> like

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
time to show you what it's like

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.790 
time to show you what it's like
screaming<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> sleep<00:00:56.660> there<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.750> goes<00:00:57.899> so

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
screaming to sleep there it goes so

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.490 
screaming to sleep there it goes so
screen<00:00:59.340> yeah<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.879> does<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.300> equate

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
screen yeah and it does that equate

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.770 
screen yeah and it does that equate
which<00:01:01.500> definitely<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.670> timeout<00:01:03.420> isn't

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
which definitely the the timeout isn't

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.420 
which definitely the the timeout isn't
set<00:01:03.989> very<00:01:04.199> long<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.619> device<00:01:04.920> that's<00:01:05.250> why

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
set very long on this device that's why

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.090 
set very long on this device that's why

a little idea this is on the lower
graphics<00:02:28.230> quality<00:02:28.500> because<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.040> tried<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.340> on

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
graphics quality because I tried it on

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.070 
graphics quality because I tried it on
the<00:02:29.490> higher<00:02:29.700> one<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.270> didn't<00:02:30.540> do<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.660> much<00:02:30.930> of

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
the higher one it didn't do it much of

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.530 
the higher one it didn't do it much of
anything<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:34.250> brick<00:02:35.250> hut<00:02:35.610> that's<00:02:36.300> what<00:02:36.450> we're

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
anything a brick hut that's what we're

anything a brick hut that's what we're
going<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.690> try<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.930> do<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.460> be<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.580> very

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
going to try to do so this can be a very

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.670 
going to try to do so this can be a very
small<00:02:39.210> brick<00:02:39.540> hut<00:02:39.780> but<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.350> going<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.530> be<00:02:40.650> a

small brick hut but it's going to be a
brick<00:02:40.830> hood<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.250> also<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:41.970> not<00:02:42.090> think<00:02:42.150> there's

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
brick hood I also do not think there's

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
that concept where you tap and hold and

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.440 
that concept where you tap and hold and
of<00:03:22.770> course<00:03:22.980> if<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.310> build<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.670> stronger<00:03:24.090> block

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
of course if you build a stronger block

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.720 
of course if you build a stronger block
it's<00:03:24.660> going<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.870> last<00:03:25.080> longer<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.590> if<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:26.070> if<00:03:26.550> I

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
it's going to last longer so if I if I

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.370 
it's going to last longer so if I if I
had<00:03:26.760> obsidian<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:27.540> here<00:03:27.690> but<00:03:27.959> it's<00:03:28.080> in<00:03:28.170> there

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
had obsidian in here but it's in there

had obsidian in here but it's in there
it's<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.190> game<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.550> takes<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.910> long<00:03:30.120> much

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
it's in the game it takes a long much

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.900 
it's in the game it takes a long much
longer<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.410> destroy<00:03:31.800> so<00:03:32.670> we're<00:03:32.760> going<00:03:32.850> to

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
longer to destroy so we're going to

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.400 
longer to destroy so we're going to
continue<00:03:33.330> on<00:03:33.480> with<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:33.750> little<00:03:33.959> Hut<00:03:34.200> there

in<00:04:12.200> progress<00:04:12.260> I'm<00:04:12.920> ready<00:04:13.100> for<00:04:13.190> them<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.400> port

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
in progress I'm ready for them to port

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.180 
in progress I'm ready for them to port
this<00:04:13.820> to<00:04:13.940> iOS<00:04:14.410> but<00:04:15.410> obviously<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.160> reason

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
this to iOS but obviously the reason

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.310 
this to iOS but obviously the reason
they<00:04:16.609> did<00:04:16.790> Android<00:04:17.269> first<00:04:17.510> was<00:04:17.870> because

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
they did Android first was because

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.180 
they did Android first was because

all of androids coding is in Java makes
sense<00:04:24.770> but<00:04:24.980> obviously<00:04:25.250> I<00:04:25.340> missed<00:04:25.760> there<00:04:26.090> I

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
sense but obviously I missed there I

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.750 
sense but obviously I missed there I
didn't<00:04:27.080> go<00:04:27.170> far<00:04:27.350> enough<00:04:27.410> over<00:04:27.710> so<00:04:28.460> we'll<00:04:28.520> break

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
didn't go far enough over so we'll break

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.050 
didn't go far enough over so we'll break
these<00:04:28.970> blocks<00:04:29.360> just<00:04:30.250> like<00:04:31.250> this<00:04:34.060> then

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
these blocks just like this then

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.970 
these blocks just like this then
continue<00:04:35.480> on<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:36.080> I<00:04:36.380> could<00:04:36.590> see<00:04:36.740> how<00:04:36.830> this

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
continue on and I could see how this

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.280 
continue on and I could see how this
could<00:04:37.040> be<00:04:37.370> really<00:04:37.580> cool<00:04:37.700> I<00:04:38.210> really<00:04:38.540> could<00:04:39.260> see

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
could be really cool I really could see

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.040 
could be really cool I really could see
this<00:04:39.710> but<00:04:40.280> for<00:04:40.550> right<00:04:40.669> now<00:04:40.730> it's<00:04:41.300> really<00:04:41.870> a

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
this but for right now it's really a

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.950 
this but for right now it's really a
terrible<00:04:42.650> user<00:04:42.950> experience<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:43.730> think<00:04:44.000> if<00:04:44.780> I

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
terrible user experience I think if I

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.540 
terrible user experience I think if I
was<00:04:45.110> not<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:45.650> would<00:04:45.830> honestly<00:04:45.980> be<00:04:46.250> quite

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
was not I would honestly be quite

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.010 
was not I would honestly be quite
embarrassed<00:04:47.030> to<00:04:47.150> show<00:04:47.330> this<00:04:47.480> off

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
embarrassed to show this off

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.890 
embarrassed to show this off
I'd<00:04:48.950> say<00:04:49.220> it's<00:04:49.460> wonderful<00:04:49.760> on<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.360> Xperia

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
to show this but this is pretty much how

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.719 
to show this but this is pretty much how
you<00:05:06.080> build<00:05:06.380> oops<00:05:06.560> fill<00:05:09.040> and<00:05:10.040> this<00:05:10.130> is<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.520> demo

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
you build oops fill and this is the demo

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.430 
you build oops fill and this is the demo
like<00:05:11.000> I<00:05:11.090> said<00:05:11.300> so<00:05:11.450> in<00:05:11.600> this<00:05:11.690> demo<00:05:11.900> you<00:05:12.050> can't

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
like I said so in this demo you can't

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.350 
like I said so in this demo you can't
save<00:05:12.860> which<00:05:13.250> does<00:05:13.490> kind<00:05:13.700> of<00:05:13.760> stink<00:05:14.060> so<00:05:14.300> I'm

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
save which does kind of stink so I'm

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.960
