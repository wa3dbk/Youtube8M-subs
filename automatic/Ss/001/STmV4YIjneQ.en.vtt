00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.340
 quality culture 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.490
 by his teammates javier ue diana karen 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.920
 flowers had extra handle 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.190
 today we are going to talk about what is 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.350
 continuous improvement 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.780
 to be able to talk about continuous improvement 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.660
 you must understand the fact that no 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.650
 there are unique solutions to the problems 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.779
 but several 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.670
 all of them likely to be 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.920
 improved 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.510
 customer satisfaction as being 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.510
 human has no limits 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.250
 after a certain time all level 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.240
 qualitative achieved is given by 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.180
 discounted 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.700
 which loses its value before the eyes 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:55.280
 of the client given that their expectations 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.949
 they grow and change continuously 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.890
 the companies that contemplate the quality 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.390
 in a static way they run a serious 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.180
 risk 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.510
 because by not complying with the changes 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.869
 in future expectations that can 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.530
 have the clients and be satisfied with a 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.760
 certain level of satisfaction 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.550
 leaving a gap for the purchase 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.770
 hence the importance of working 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.330
 continuously to improve the quality of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.330
 all business processes 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.830
 improve quality does not mean the 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.320
 fruit of innovations that makes a 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.840
 unlimited in number of people in the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.180
 inside a company promoting the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.670
 costs 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.320
 that could lack limits and 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.250
 compromise the existence of the company 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.720
 on the contrary with the total quality 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.660
 improve the quality that is based on 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.180
 small but numerous improvements and 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.290
 continued that all the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.290
 members of the company 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.700
 the characteristics of this improvement to 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.700
 small steps are 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.560
 can and should involve all the staff 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.900
 of the company 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.870
 the maintenance of what is 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.150
 has and is improved with the potential that 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.730
 account each operator in terms of 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.730
 intellectual and knowledge capacity 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.650
 orientation totally focused on the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.650
 personal 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.069
 requires knowledge of 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.510
 efforts even before the 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.970
 results 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.670
 is obtained with the use of 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.770
 seven instruments and the cycle 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.280
 of c 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.280
 ah 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.510
 and the seven instruments would be the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.610
 following 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.800
 the data collection sheet 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.260
 the histogram 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.610
 the cause-effect diagram 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.610
 the wall diagram 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.930
 stratification the diagram 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.100
 correlation 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.680
 and the control sheet 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.180
 we also have the basic rules for 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.329
 a continuous improvement which are 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.010
 you can not improve anything that has not 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.189
 been controlled 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.200
 you can not control anything that has not 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.410
 been measured 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.270
 you can not measure anything that has not been 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.540
 definite 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.620
 and you can not define anything that has not 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.599
 been identified 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.640
 applying it in an organization the 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.599
 continuous improvement implies in the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.599
 following points 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.830
 analysis and evaluation of the situation 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.770
 existing 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:05.720
 objectives for the best implementation 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.720
 of possible measurement solution 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.720
 check 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.410
 analysis and evaluation of the results 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.410
 of the implementation 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.960
 formalization of the changes 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.940
 the results are reviewed to detect 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.940
 improvement opportunities 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.389
 improvement is a continuous activity and 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:35.699
 part of the information received from 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.699
 own system and customers
