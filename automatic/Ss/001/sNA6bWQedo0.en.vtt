this<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:10.040> homemade<00:00:11.269> doll<00:00:12.269> bit<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:13.139> I

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
this is a homemade doll bit that I

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.270 
this is a homemade doll bit that I
bought<00:00:13.679> at<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> yard<00:00:14.339> sale<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> dollar<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.280> I

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
bought at a yard sale for a dollar and I

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.279 
bought at a yard sale for a dollar and I
thought<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.789> would<00:00:17.940> be<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.600> right<00:00:18.750> size

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
thought it would be just the right size

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.519 
thought it would be just the right size
