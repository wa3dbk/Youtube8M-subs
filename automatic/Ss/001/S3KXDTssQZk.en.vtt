Hi and welcome to another video!

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.500
I just bought this little plastic bag at a news-stand, around here, and I'd like to open it with you!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.500
As you can see, it's a Marvel "Iron Man 3" movie related item.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Very nice bag, featuring the Iron Man helmet. You can see the hall of armor reflected on the Iron Man mask.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here at the bottom, the Avengers Initiative logo.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.000
Hall of armor: it includes a 3D diorama, 1 fanbook and 1 card.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.500
The price is 3.50 EURO (about 4.50 USD). Let's wait to see the content to judge if it's too expensive or not. I feel it's a bit expensive already, but let's wait to see the content...

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:04.000
On the back, we can see all the armors you can find: Mark 42, War Machine, Iron Patriot, Deep Sea Armor, Igor (very interesting!), this is called Striker...

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I apologize for the lighting, but I'm using a lamp, because the weather is bad so there's not much light outside.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.000
...then we have the Hyper Velocity armor, a.k.a Shotgun, very nice, and the Stealth Armor, a.k.a Sneaky.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Nice armors. I really like the Mark 42, War Machine, Igor, Deep Sea is very nice as well...and the Shotgun, one of my favourites along with the Silver Centurion which is not included unfortunately.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Let's open it up! I've chosen it carefully. My target is to find the Igor, in fact I picked up the most massive, the largest one.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's see if I made it!

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Suspence, suspence...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.500
Wonderful!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.000
IGOR! Which is not in the paint scheme seen in the movie, blue and gray, but it's in the classic red and gold color scheme.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I hope you can see it well despite the bad lighting.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Very nice! Very well made! Paintjob is pretty good, not perfect, but it could have been a lot worse.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
A base is also included. It's not removable, it's attached under Igor's feet.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Pretty nice!

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Let's see what we have in the bag in addition to the Igor figurine.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We have this cardboard base to make your hall of armor.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Then we have the fanbook, I guess it's about the armor: Igor...

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:19.000
...no, it's about a lot of stuff: hall of armor, War Machine and Iron Patriot, Iron Man and War Machine, curiosities about the movie...a bit of everything.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Probably it will be the same in every single bag, not a great thing.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Let's take a look at the card. It is dedicated to the armor we found: Igor.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.500
Not bad, really not bad.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Oh, then we have this vertical piece for the hall of armor. Let's assemble it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Let's push it in...voila!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Here's our hall of armor! Very nice! Yeah, really nice!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I must say that for 3.50 EURO (about 4.50 USD), considering how massive the armor is (it's about 3 inches tall!), is really not bad! Really neat!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I think I'll get more! Like I said, I'd like to find, at least, the Mark 42 and War Machine. I would like the Shotgun too!

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I will definitely get more! I'm impressed!

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
That being said, I hope you enjoyed this unboxing, and I'll see you on the next video! BYE!
