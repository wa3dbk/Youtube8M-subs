00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.950
 hi everyone with you with this 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.340
 This is a review of the textures of the pack. border craft 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:13.290
 this texture pack 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.980
 graphics are taken and taken from the game another 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.980
 I do not remember the name 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.800
 I forgot honestly though I play this game myself 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.800
 and then go do 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.020
 I'll show you what it looks like. 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.080
 bed cakes 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.310
 water 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.600
 probably the only negative in this 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:38.600
 texture is water 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 she looks like lifeless 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.160
 book shelves 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.160
 looks cool 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.330
 all for now and what is 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.720
 now I will show you the temple 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.720
 looks like 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.590
 and specifically I will show 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.949
 probably the port that gave you all well 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.949
 have you seen 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.600
 what does it look like on this texture pack 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:15.580
 with water well as water looks like 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:21.700
 looks ugly not really got here 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:25.570
 so here's a drink here are the golden diamonds 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.030
 the bars in this texture pack are the coolest 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.020
 that night 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.500
 Now itâ€™s like a pumpkin 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.500
 cool 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.830
 similar to real and this one cobblestone 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.500
 most 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.380
 cool from afar 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.050
 no it seems like these 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.750
 pebbles are small they are real 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:53.310
 bulging that is choose and here it is 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.310
 the coolest in this texture pack 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.830
 by the way here in the game 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.640
 by which this texture is made pak moon 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.640
 same cool 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.170
 I'll show you the port now and I will 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:13.750
 finish kissing under cool 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.720
 the original is still cooler here with me 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.480
 there are top pack textures i.e. in places 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.310
 They are in the first place the original in the second 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.180
 miso and on the third here is this cool 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.180
 river carp 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.730
 actually here is the port itself 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.220
 this is wool 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.690
 sound well you see everything 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.690
 I will not be a captain obvious 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.850
 woman 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.950
 but by the way, too , somehow 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.810
 life to looks doesnâ€™t move 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.810
 could be on the network come prettier 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.240
 probably on this and all 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.670
