00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 fiery greetings to you all again 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.549
 alexander better known coded 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.049
 Today we will have a review on the null version 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.590
 minecraft this time with us 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.599
 and 1.8.7 and of course we will start 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.490
 today's story bug fix all as 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.210
 love our subscribers so everyone 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.369
 claims to them they are stones if that 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.260
 so first we have such a thing 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.699
 called on custom resource packs 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.390
 for example you go play on 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.369
 highpixel will play the same race you 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.199
 come on a server a server automatically 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.070
 installs the necessary resource pack on your 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.690
 minecraft silently and magically that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.100
 same deputy sheila was an extra mushroom mycelium 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.219
 and other building materials 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.739
 magically turns into 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.870
 wonderful cars on examples and 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.730
 with these red jesus while we were 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.640
 connected 2 bugs the first one he was 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.460
 associated with who what when you happen to be 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.989
 disconnect body from server 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.940
 resourcepack continued to download it 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.859
 first second sometimes when you went out 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.320
 server and when this resource pack should 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.989
 automatically deleted it sometimes not 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.090
 now removed all these 2 bugs removed 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.100
 so with custom resource packs you have it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.830
 there will be fewer bugs and glitches than I 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.330
 all and congratulations there also was a bug 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.650
 about our turkish users when they 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.250
 used some characters from 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.409
 Unicode in my opinion in their nicknames could 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.180
 painted minecraft now this bug 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.700
 so fixed our vocational 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.490
 wonderful Turkish friends now 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.119
 it will be less likely to crumble minkravt okay and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.310
 finally another bug it was he connected with 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.759
 sorry sorry error here 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.320
 Here, too, which could cause the theft 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.299
 there is somehow there is something you can 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.310
 It was prescribed such in the plate to 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.710
 this label after installation caused 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.159
 theft of the server or minecraft 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.140
 client as all as usual developers 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.479
 minecraft do not specify details as 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.549
 do not call the edge of the client or server 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.259
 eat they hide it from the people and not 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.390
 only informs us periodically that we 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.939
 fixed a new regular very dangerous 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.590
 tank rubles for views per subscription and 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.390

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.470
 all these pseudo updates are you waiting for 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.500
 something normal standing for example 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.700

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.740

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.210
 put all that in one clip 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.220
 known so far at the moment about 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.410
 new version of minecraft 1.9 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.030
 but knowing from the developers of michroft I 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.950
 I think that it will take another two weeks 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.510
 They will release version of Maycroft 1.8. 9 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.040

 industrial technical fashion 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.790
