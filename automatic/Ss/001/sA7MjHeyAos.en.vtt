00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.469
 viewing a recipe that 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:11.019
 Well I know it's nothing new not 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.700
 it has no relevance but 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.169
 simply many times we do not know what 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.099
 to cook 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:21.359
 this time I'm going to make eggs 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:25.000

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.860
 below the link to my recipes 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.570
 enchiladas usually I always have 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.780
 Enchiladas I have left 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.020

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.390

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.719

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.749
 eggs guys 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.909
 is depending on the amount of chili that 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:55.429
 about us then I'll stir the already 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.039
 I have my pan with hot oil what 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.449
 revuelvo and right now it was a girlfriends to 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.409
 give a little taste if you 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.309
 like you can add a little onion 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.309
 before adding 2 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.820
 i 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.130
 the temperature or the average flame 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.770
 and I 'm going to finish waking up 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.990
 we add salt to taste and well let's 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.270
 stir 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.270
 and wait for it to be good 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.740
 good since it's not your kitchen 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.740
 let's add 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.020
 yes our dried chilies for both and the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.450
 Chulito of the waves will use the signal 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.399
 m 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.140
 I do not love me anymore and because that's how 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.140
 late but many times if left over 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.920
 as it dries up it 's like it dries out 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.920
 the chile 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.690
 then this can add a 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.660
 little bit of chicken broth if it was left over and 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.660
 if not a little water always 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.250
 and now here we'll going to stir it 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.470
 that the fat chili is well integrated 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.340
 Y 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.800
 in this way we leave nothing else 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.870
 another little bit more in the man who carries 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.750
 a little chilito 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:59.269
 and good is everything is ready is a 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.860
 very easy fast and good food 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.599
 we take advantage of what we did 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.160
 enchiladas and we will not do more then 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.170
 we take advantage of that chile is very economical 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.210
 and can make it special not be 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.590
 prepare the special chili to make 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.440
 egg 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.040
 what they can do all for this 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.010
