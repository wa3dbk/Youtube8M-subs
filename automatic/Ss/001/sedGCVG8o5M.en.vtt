00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 i 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.460
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.099
 video a boxing for pc box channel 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.300
 youtube today we bring you the unboxing of 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.410
 racer mouse or achievements that as we see is 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.429
 a very characteristic mouse that also 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.259
 russell lets us know thanks to 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.239
 packaging let's get it out of the house 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.140
 so you can see the features 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.490
 the content and also 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.950
 you can 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.950
 and hallucinate with the mouse of russell 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.600
 a very elegant presentation and also 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.610
 very characteristic let's start 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.170
 take it out of the box 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.079
 we have already seen the packaging 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.450
 and we will see 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.850
 the characteristics 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.160
 it's a wireless mouse because there 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.410
 many gamers can be a 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.750
 inconvenient but it has the advantage of 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.130
 that this mouse offers us the possibility 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.100
 of connecting the cable and using it from 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:08.220
 Wired way in a wire way 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.680
 we see the content the presentation is 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.690
 Excellent 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.910
 comes to us here as I was telling you 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.040
 cable that not only serves to load the 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.730
 battery but also to use it 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.650
 and reduce response times these 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.120
 are the eyelashes that come in the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.310
 laterals that we will now change for 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.060
 that you see it and the rechargeable battery that 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.060
 comes included 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.380
 the usb port if you want to see it is 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.740
 Gold plating to improve the 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.740
 connectivity 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.740
 let's go here 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.409
 and the russell logo in tiny 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.270
 right here as you can see 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.860
 we will also show you the content 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.120
 from here 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.120
 we will see that a manual comes 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.190
 we have right here 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.150
 some stickers as is typical in the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.740
 reuters points 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.420
 over here and we see the manuals a guide 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.070
 Quick start in which we 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.170
 will explain how to open the mouse by 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.349
 example change the pieces 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.690
 connect it and other things that we're going to go 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.000
 doing now 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.350
 a product guide in which we 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.330
 will explain all the features 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.030
 techniques and good a letter 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.090
 simulated by the president of russell 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.200
 giving us thanks and telling us that 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.470
 we have bought one of the best 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.080
 market mice 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.060
 all right 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.490
 we already have the product here ready to 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:45.470
 take it out we unhooked it 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.880
 and we see that the form is ambidextrous 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.620
 we can use it with both hand 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.050
 right as with the left since 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.970
 we have the buttons on both sides 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:00.300
 uses both one hand and another we have 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.030
 the selector of the page the wheel is of 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.720
 rubber and also 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.720
 carries 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.870
 he brings us some little gobs for 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.910
 improve grip 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.880
 right here 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.860
 we see that we have two buttons for 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.180
 block and it serves to block the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.670
 buttons here 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.489
 well the pieces as we have commented 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.739
 before they can be disassembled carries three 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.060
 magnets and so we saved ourselves from having to 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.880
 screw or unscrew 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.670
 we are going to place them and see how they 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.160
 hooks perfectly on this side 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.480
 let's change it also and when 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.489
 we put this piece 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.670
 what we do is reduce the surface 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.930
 but we improved thanks to lagarde as 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.220
 rubber surface is the ruber and 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.860
 it will depend on the user that we choose one 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.470
 or another one once we connect it here 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.680
 we can see the illumination of those of 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.700
 felix let's take it apart 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.700
 and you can see 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.260
 how it is extracted 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.890
 and we have here the hollow of the pile 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.959
 where the battery is connected that we can 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.760
 use a normal or a rechargeable 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.340
 We always recommend the regable since 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.160
 we will save a lot of money in stacks 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.020
 single-use this is not only for 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.230
 dismantle them but we can also 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.580
 regulate the size of the hand in which 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.580
 a bigger hand 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.030
 we can 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.260
 adapt them 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.210
 we have the design that is very beautiful is 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.650
 a pretty flat mouse is not very tall and 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.190
 that we can use it in both hands 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.460
 small as in big hands thank you 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.460
 to the format 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.280
 on the other hand we have also that just 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.380
 below comes the connector base to this we 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.060
 It will greatly ease the burden and mouse 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.530
 that we can leave it fixed for example in 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.030
 the desk and when we need 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.920
 load it we will simply have to 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.420
 place on top of the mouse 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.470
 it will stay like that on the table 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.470
 always wearing 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.819
 will charge us the battery 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.069
 we see that on the bottom it is a 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:27.729
 rubber finish so it does not move 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:30.289
 of the table 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.470
 the sync button 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.250
 and the port 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.250
 load 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.170
 good thing else to also highlight the 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.540
 mouse that we have seen later is that 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:47.050
 have a wheel here too that we 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.850
 will improve the height of the mouse and we can 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.230
 adapt it much more so I do not know if 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:56.640
 you can see it but we can tilt 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.640
 all this part of here 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:05.290
 this is very useful to finish off 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.590
 to adapt the mouse so we take it in 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.300
 claw or flat shape a lot 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.390
 people take it if there are people who take it 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.940
 more more in claw well up here the 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.860
 unboxing mouse or achievements russell 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.480
