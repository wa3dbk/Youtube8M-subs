underneath<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.920> driver's<00:02:21.250> seat<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:21.580> beefed

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
underneath the driver's seat we beefed

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.120 
underneath the driver's seat we beefed
up<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.150> power<00:02:22.360> supply<00:02:22.600> we<00:02:23.500> added<00:02:23.710> a<00:02:23.770> second

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
up the power supply we added a second

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.220 
up the power supply we added a second
battery<00:02:24.310> it's<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.880> kinetic<00:02:25.300> 700<00:02:25.870> watt<00:02:25.990> power

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
battery it's the kinetic 700 watt power

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.040 
battery it's the kinetic 700 watt power
so<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.580> triggered<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.210> charge<00:02:28.480> only<00:02:28.780> when

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
so this is triggered to charge only when

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.010 
so this is triggered to charge only when
the<00:02:29.140> ignitions<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.640> separates<00:02:31.510> itself

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
the ignitions on it separates itself

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.290 
the ignitions on it separates itself
from<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.620> system<00:02:33.040> when<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.670> ignition<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:34.060> off

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
from the system when the ignition is off

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.450 
from the system when the ignition is off
so<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.840> could<00:02:35.050> listen<00:02:35.310> theoretically<00:02:36.310> and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
so you could listen theoretically and

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.980 
so you could listen theoretically and
run<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:36.670> battery<00:02:37.060> all<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.360> way<00:02:37.450> down<00:02:37.690> and

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
run this battery all the way down and
