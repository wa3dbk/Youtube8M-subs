00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
between the two i found myself having a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.780 
between the two i found myself having a
little<00:02:49.680> more<00:02:49.770> fun<00:02:49.920> with<00:02:50.040> terraria<00:02:50.430> i<00:02:50.490> really

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
little more fun with terraria i really

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.860 
little more fun with terraria i really
like<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.000> control<00:02:51.270> scheme<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.690> one<00:02:51.840> a

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
like the control scheme of that one a

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.300 
like the control scheme of that one a
little<00:02:52.020> better<00:02:52.170> although<00:02:52.890> i<00:02:52.920> will<00:02:53.100> say<00:02:53.130> that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
little better although i will say that

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.770 
little better although i will say that
one<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.670> upsides<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.030> junk<00:02:54.330> jack<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.750> that

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
one of the upsides to junk jack is that

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.660 
one of the upsides to junk jack is that
a<00:02:54.930> lot<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.230> pixel<00:02:55.560> art<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.860> larger<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.370> it's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
a lot of the pixel art is larger so it's

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.280 
a lot of the pixel art is larger so it's
a<00:02:56.700> lot<00:02:56.790> easier<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.150> specifically<00:02:57.630> target<00:02:57.870> what

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
a lot easier to specifically target what

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.780 
a lot easier to specifically target what
you<00:02:58.410> want<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> break<00:02:58.830> down<00:02:59.040> whereas<00:02:59.670> in

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
you want to break down whereas in

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.130 
you want to break down whereas in
terraria<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.360> can<00:03:00.480> have<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.600> bad<00:03:00.780> habit<00:03:00.990> of

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
terraria you can have a bad habit of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.510 
terraria you can have a bad habit of
accidentally<00:03:01.530> cutting<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.980> wrong<00:03:02.160> area

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
accidentally cutting the wrong area

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.890 
accidentally cutting the wrong area
especially<00:03:03.090> when<00:03:03.390> you're<00:03:03.480> trying<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.690> dig

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
deep underground now both these games

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.580 
deep underground now both these games
are<00:03:05.820> incredibly<00:03:06.480> complex<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.050> have<00:03:07.140> lots<00:03:07.410> of

are incredibly complex and have lots of
different<00:03:07.800> things<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.070> do<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.250> terms<00:03:08.400> of

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
different things you can do in terms of

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.970 
different things you can do in terms of
late<00:03:08.700> gameplay<00:03:09.150> it's<00:03:09.420> way<00:03:10.320> too<00:03:10.380> much<00:03:10.590> data<00:03:10.800> for

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
late gameplay it's way too much data for

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.140 
late gameplay it's way too much data for
me<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.190> talk<00:03:11.310> about<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.640> floor<00:03:11.790> review<00:03:12.030> the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
me to talk about in a floor review the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.670 
me to talk about in a floor review the
point<00:03:12.360> being<00:03:12.570> if<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.900> like<00:03:13.050> world<00:03:13.320> builders

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
point being if you like world builders

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.020 
point being if you like world builders
both<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.340> them<00:03:14.400> are<00:03:14.550> definitely<00:03:14.910> worth

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
both of them are definitely worth

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.699 
both of them are definitely worth
investing<00:03:15.570> in<00:03:15.630> each<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.170> them<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.290> only<00:03:16.470> five

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
investing in each of them is only five

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.259 
investing in each of them is only five
bucks<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.190> you'll<00:03:17.280> easily<00:03:17.489> spend<00:03:17.880> way<00:03:18.239> more

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
bucks and you'll easily spend way more

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.180 
bucks and you'll easily spend way more
