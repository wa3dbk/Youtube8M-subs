00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
a little bit more and then begin working

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.969 
a little bit more and then begin working
forward<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.460> with<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.970> thought<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.330> mind<00:01:27.979> I'm

distinct<00:03:31.250> with<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.520> yet<00:03:31.790> this<00:03:32.270> is<00:03:32.450> that

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
distinct with that yet this is that

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.530 
distinct with that yet this is that
would<00:03:32.960> be<00:03:33.110> finishing<00:03:33.950> touches<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:35.270> want<00:03:35.450> to

would be finishing touches and I want to
save<00:03:35.750> those<00:03:36.050> but<00:03:36.530> at<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:36.920> same<00:03:37.130> time<00:03:37.460> it's<00:03:38.360> at

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
save those but at the same time it's at

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.910 
save those but at the same time it's at
a<00:03:38.600> point<00:03:38.840> where<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.140> need<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.500> know<00:03:39.620> where<00:03:39.830> I'm

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
a point where I need to know where I'm

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.160 
a point where I need to know where I'm
going<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:41.150> other<00:03:41.210> thing<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.600> think<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:41.960> need<00:03:42.140> to

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
going the other thing I think I need to

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.750 
going the other thing I think I need to
know<00:03:42.440> is<00:03:42.710> just<00:03:43.130> exactly<00:03:44.680> where<00:03:45.680> does<00:03:46.310> the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
know is just exactly where does the

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.320 
know is just exactly where does the
water<00:03:47.230> meet<00:03:48.230> those<00:03:48.440> grasses<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:49.790> just<00:03:50.180> give

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
water meet those grasses so it just give

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.940 
water meet those grasses so it just give
myself<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.780> little<00:03:50.989> hint<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.470> now<00:03:51.680> and

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
myself a little hint of that now and

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.220 
myself a little hint of that now and
that's<00:03:52.640> probably<00:03:53.030> enough<00:03:53.360> for<00:03:53.390> now<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.020> can

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
that's probably enough for now and I can

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.490 
that's probably enough for now and I can
just<00:03:54.410> move<00:03:54.650> on<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.459> another<00:03:55.880> area<00:03:56.570> that<00:03:56.810> needs

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
just move on to another area that needs

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.760 
just move on to another area that needs
to<00:03:57.739> be<00:03:57.770> cleaned<00:03:58.160> up<00:03:59.680> here<00:04:00.820> moving<00:04:01.820> into<00:04:02.209> a

of the things that caught my eye is the

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.210 
of the things that caught my eye is the
way<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.020> light<00:04:24.169> moved<00:04:24.440> down<00:04:24.650> across<00:04:24.890> these

way the light moved down across these

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.500 
way the light moved down across these
grasses<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:25.940> down<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.169> water<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:28.510> I'm

using the side of my pastel but I might

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.620 
using the side of my pastel but I might
catch<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:32.870> few<00:04:33.110> little<00:04:33.290> vertical<00:04:34.270> strokes<00:04:35.270> here

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630

detail yet I'm still just exploring the
color<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:42.770> beginning<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.580> bring<00:04:43.760> this

less of the bright green because the

less of the bright green because the

start to imply leaves when I'm painting
foliage<00:05:06.970> I<00:05:07.210> try<00:05:07.870> not<00:05:08.080> to<00:05:08.140> think<00:05:08.470> about<00:05:08.590> leaves

foliage I try not to think about leaves

foliage I try not to think about leaves
the<00:05:09.550> minute<00:05:09.820> you<00:05:09.910> start<00:05:10.210> thinking<00:05:10.540> about

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
the minute you start thinking about

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.420 
the minute you start thinking about
leaves<00:05:11.050> you're<00:05:11.680> going<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.920> start<00:05:12.130> making

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
leaves you're going to start making

little tiny picky little spots and

little tiny picky little spots and
shapes<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.940> trying<00:05:16.540> to<00:05:16.690> connect<00:05:17.020> things<00:05:17.170> to

shapes and trying to connect things to
branches<00:05:17.950> instead<00:05:18.610> I<00:05:18.880> think<00:05:19.240> about<00:05:19.590> masses<00:05:20.590> of

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
branches instead I think about masses of

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.840 
branches instead I think about masses of
