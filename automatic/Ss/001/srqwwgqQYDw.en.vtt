00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
so hi this is a tutorial for two for BBC

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.330 
so hi this is a tutorial for two for BBC
basic<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.880> beginners<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.770> how<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.830> use<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.040> fork

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
basic for beginners on how to use a fork

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.820 
basic for beginners on how to use a fork
mount<00:00:20.640> today's<00:00:21.390> for<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> same<00:00:21.990> context<00:00:22.529> you

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
mount today's for the same context you

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.450 
mount today's for the same context you
want<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.310> do<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:24.110> times<00:00:25.110> tables<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.189> number

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
want to do a times tables of a number

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.650 
want to do a times tables of a number
almost<00:00:26.700> pools<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.360> a<00:00:27.480> number<00:00:28.039> so<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:30.390> user

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
almost pools of a number so the user

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.840 
almost pools of a number so the user
would<00:00:30.900> aim<00:00:31.110> for<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.380> valueless<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.160> 1/10<00:00:32.669> times

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
would aim for a valueless a 1/10 times

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.950 
would aim for a valueless a 1/10 times
table<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.540> 10<00:00:34.140> times<00:00:34.379> 1<00:00:34.620> if<00:00:34.949> 10<00:00:35.480> mm<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.629> 10<00:00:36.809> times

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
table so 10 times 1 if 10 mm to 10 times

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.670 
table so 10 times 1 if 10 mm to 10 times
3<00:00:37.199> is<00:00:37.290> 30<00:00:37.530> look<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.460> 10<00:00:38.640> 20<00:00:39.120> 30<00:00:39.330> 40<00:00:39.480> 50<00:00:40.020> 60<00:00:40.050> 70<00:00:40.650> 80

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
3 is 30 look at 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.630 
3 is 30 look at 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
90<00:00:40.890> 100<00:00:41.340> let's<00:00:41.760> say<00:00:42.320> so<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.949> full<00:00:44.280> command

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
90 100 let's say so the full command

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.210 
90 100 let's say so the full command
would<00:00:44.970> increment<00:00:45.300> between<00:00:46.170> different<00:00:46.890> bodies

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
would increment between different bodies

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.270 
would increment between different bodies
until<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:48.769> until<00:00:49.769> you<00:00:49.860> reach<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.129> certain

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
until you until you reach a certain

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.490 
until you until you reach a certain
value<00:00:50.580> so<00:00:50.909> it<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.900> described<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.350> in

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
value so it is just described this in

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.140 
value so it is just described this in
more<00:00:52.620> detail<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:55.190> want<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> program

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
more detail I want to make a program

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.079 
more detail I want to make a program
that<00:00:57.479> lets<00:00:58.379> say<00:00:58.650> does<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.640> multiples<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
that lets say does the multiples of

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.899 
that lets say does the multiples of
phenomena<00:01:00.860> now<00:01:01.860> I<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.220> have<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.400> comment<00:01:02.640> at

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
phenomena now I can have a comment at

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.180 
phenomena now I can have a comment at
the<00:01:02.970> beginning<00:01:03.059> saying<00:01:03.540> rap<00:01:03.870> which<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.920> you

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
the beginning saying rap which of you

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.100 
the beginning saying rap which of you
will<00:01:05.370> ignore<00:01:05.700> when<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> my<00:01:06.120> gram<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.600> configure

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
will ignore when you my gram a configure

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.039 
will ignore when you my gram a configure
to<00:01:07.260> ignore<00:01:07.560> sacrified<00:01:08.159> any<00:01:08.430> notes<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.120> want<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
to ignore sacrified any notes I want to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.700 
to ignore sacrified any notes I want to
include<00:01:10.440> about<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.770> program<00:01:12.350> safe<00:01:13.350> all

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
include about this program safe all

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.950 
include about this program safe all
right

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
right

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:27.920 
right
now<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:18.620> time<00:01:26.180> that's<00:01:27.180> because<00:01:27.450> green<00:01:27.750> which

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
now very time that's because green which

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.750 
now very time that's because green which
shows<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.230> computer<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.770> ignoring<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
shows the computer is ignoring this and

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.180 
shows the computer is ignoring this and
you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.970> write<00:01:30.120> notes<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.770> useful

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
you can write notes and it's for useful

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.490 
you can write notes and it's for useful
in<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> future<00:01:32.820> when<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.120> look<00:01:33.270> back<00:01:34.230> at<00:01:34.410> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
in the future when you look back at the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.350 
in the future when you look back at the
program<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.220> he<00:01:35.250> knows<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.910> what<00:01:36.120> you've

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
program because he knows on what you've

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.420 
program because he knows on what you've
done<00:01:37.280> right<00:01:38.280> ok<00:01:38.550> so<00:01:39.020> if<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.230> wanted<00:01:40.530> what<00:01:40.830> this

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
done right ok so if I wanted what this

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.690 
done right ok so if I wanted what this
is<00:01:41.610> also<00:01:41.910> useful<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.660> want<00:01:42.870> more<00:01:43.140> things<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
is also useful if I want more things I

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700 
is also useful if I want more things I
don't<00:01:44.820> want<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.150> computer<00:01:45.300> to<00:01:45.780> meet<00:01:46.410> at<00:01:46.590> all

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
don't want the computer to meet at all

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.730 
don't want the computer to meet at all
like<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.640> select<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.120> right-click<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.290> dream

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
like I select this right-click a dream

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.140 
like I select this right-click a dream
so<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.010> computer<00:01:50.370> will<00:01:50.460> completely<00:01:50.940> ignore

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
so the computer will completely ignore

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.330 
so the computer will completely ignore
this<00:01:53.090> ok<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:55.320> let's<00:01:55.500> say<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.590> want<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.920> user<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
this ok so let's say I want the user to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.860 
this ok so let's say I want the user to
input<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.300> number<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:59.240> from<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.390> number<00:02:00.690> I

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
input a number and from that number I

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.750 
input a number and from that number I
can<00:02:01.140> generate<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.830> times<00:02:02.130> tables

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
can generate a times tables

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.790 
can generate a times tables
so<00:02:02.940> I've<00:02:03.120> already<00:02:03.360> input<00:02:06.140> this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.380> what<00:02:07.680> is

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
so I've already input this is what is

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.230 
so I've already input this is what is
printed<00:02:08.009> out<00:02:08.280> please

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:21.420 

and<00:02:18.900> colder<00:02:19.900> place<00:02:20.440> with<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.740> lotta<00:02:20.920> kids<00:02:21.160> try

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
and colder place with a lotta kids try

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.230 
and colder place with a lotta kids try
something<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.460> enter<00:02:24.460> a<00:02:24.490> variable<00:02:25.090> where

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
something and it enter a variable where

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.910 
something and it enter a variable where
this<00:02:25.330> number<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.720> two<00:02:25.990> so<00:02:26.380> let's<00:02:26.560> put<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:26.890> not

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
this number is two so let's put it not

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.030 
this number is two so let's put it not
sent<00:02:29.920> such<00:02:30.100> as<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:30.730> very<00:02:31.170> he<00:02:32.170> stood<00:02:32.470> as<00:02:32.770> a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
sent such as so it's very he stood as a

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.550 
sent such as so it's very he stood as a
I<00:02:33.070> mean<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.400> true<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.810> let's<00:02:38.380> introduce

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
I mean as it's true and let's introduce

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.970 
I mean as it's true and let's introduce
the<00:02:38.860> for<00:02:39.040> comment<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.650> written

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
the for comment for it is written

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.550 
the for comment for it is written
letters<00:02:43.020> now<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:45.220> starts<00:02:45.640> off<00:02:45.850> with<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:47.230> video

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
letters now it starts off with the video

number and carries on incrementing by
one<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.890> certain<00:02:51.700> industry<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.420> they<00:02:52.540> say<00:02:52.720> I

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
one to a certain industry so they say I

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.020 
one to a certain industry so they say I
which<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.860> most<00:02:54.010> common<00:02:54.340> version<00:02:54.520> for

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
which is the most common version for

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.660 
which is the most common version for
like<00:02:55.840> percentage<00:02:56.470> as<00:02:56.980> it's<00:02:57.280> an<00:02:57.370> integer

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
like percentage as it's an integer

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.540 
like percentage as it's an integer
equals<00:02:58.000> one<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.350> starting<00:02:59.860> value<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.310> Phi

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
equals one this is starting value of Phi

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.070 
equals one this is starting value of Phi
and<00:03:01.739> you'll<00:03:02.739> increment<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.810> assess<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:04.959> was

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
and you'll increment it to assess I was

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.670 
and you'll increment it to assess I was
writing<00:03:05.320> till<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.989> says<00:03:07.989> number<00:03:08.410> so<00:03:08.620> if

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
writing till I to and says number so if

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.340 
writing till I to and says number so if
I<00:03:08.860> write<00:03:09.300> five<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:12.730> will<00:03:12.880> give<00:03:13.120> me<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:14.140> write

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
I write five it will give me and I write

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
I write five it will give me and I write
print<00:03:18.060> high<00:03:19.060> percentage<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.739> print<00:03:21.130> me

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
print high percentage so print me

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.190 
print high percentage so print me

now<00:03:50.310> from<00:03:50.460> this<00:03:50.580> for<00:03:50.850> comment<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.480> could<00:03:52.230> make

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
now from this for comment I could make

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.350 
now from this for comment I could make
the<00:03:53.220> program<00:03:55.190> increment<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.280> numbers<00:03:56.640> from<00:03:56.910> 1

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
the program increment the numbers from 1

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.930 
the program increment the numbers from 1
to<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:58.380> number<00:03:58.500> inputted<00:03:59.400> by<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.670> user

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
to the number inputted by the user

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.810 
to the number inputted by the user
through<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.110> set<00:04:01.770> of<00:04:01.920> five<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.340> replace<00:04:02.640> it

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
through this set of five you replace it

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.380 
through this set of five you replace it
with<00:04:02.940> number<00:04:03.300> which<00:04:03.840> is<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.080> variable<00:04:04.440> music

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
with number which is the variable music

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.720 
with number which is the variable music
so<00:04:06.390> for<00:04:06.570> here<00:04:06.720> they<00:04:06.810> wrote<00:04:07.020> ten<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.950> increment

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
so for here they wrote ten it increment

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.010 
so for here they wrote ten it increment
from<00:04:08.880> one<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.240> ten<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:09.780> if<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.990> write<00:04:10.170> know

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
from one to ten so if I write know

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:21.229 
from one to ten so if I write know
centage<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:18.299> input<00:04:18.540> number<00:04:19.220> five<00:04:20.220> good<00:04:21.030> one

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
centage this input number five good one

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.130 
centage this input number five good one
to<00:04:21.390> five<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.989> was<00:04:22.230> running<00:04:23.090> and<00:04:24.090> when<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:24.990> might

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
to five I was running and when you might

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.570 
to five I was running and when you might
run<00:04:25.170> here<00:04:25.830> let's<00:04:26.370> rerun<00:04:26.790> the<00:04:26.940> program<00:04:28.580> let's

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
run here let's rerun the program let's

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.620 
run here let's rerun the program let's
say<00:04:29.700> alright<00:04:30.530> well<00:04:31.760> look<00:04:32.760> you'll<00:04:32.970> move<00:04:33.150> one<00:04:33.420> to

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
say alright well look you'll move one to

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.780 
say alright well look you'll move one to
twelve<00:04:33.870> this<00:04:34.740> is<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:34.980> basic<00:04:35.310> system<00:04:35.610> for

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
twelve this is the basic system for

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:43.550 
twelve this is the basic system for
command<00:04:36.530> okay<00:04:39.500> now<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:41.010> want<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.400> write<00:04:42.560> the

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
command okay now I want to write the

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.450 
command okay now I want to write the
code<00:04:44.040> for<00:04:44.340> writing

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
code for writing

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.290 
code for writing
times<00:04:47.460> tables<00:04:47.910> of<00:04:48.000> a<00:04:48.090> number<00:04:49.160> so<00:04:50.180> usually<00:04:51.180> in

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
times tables of a number so usually in

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.480 
times tables of a number so usually in
times<00:04:51.510> tables<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:52.110> take<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.500> first<00:04:52.830> first

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
times tables you take the first first

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.630 
times tables you take the first first
that<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.270> take<00:04:54.480> I<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:55.320> times<00:04:56.100> it<00:04:56.280> by<00:04:56.310> number

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
that you take I and times it by number

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.570 
that you take I and times it by number
so<00:04:57.450> let's<00:04:57.600> say<00:04:57.690> one<00:04:57.960> times<00:04:58.500> number<00:04:58.890> in<00:04:59.160> two

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
so let's say one times number in two

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.140 
so let's say one times number in two
times<00:05:00.150> number<00:05:00.570> three<00:05:00.900> times<00:05:01.200> number<00:05:01.590> 2<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:03.120> the

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
times number three times number 2 to the

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.280 
times number three times number 2 to the
number<00:05:03.300> times<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:03.960> number

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
number times a number

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.460 
number times a number
so<00:05:04.920> say<00:05:05.070> if<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.280> start<00:05:05.610> with<00:05:05.670> 10<00:05:06.600> they<00:05:07.110> say<00:05:07.260> our

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
so say if I start with 10 they say our

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.580 
so say if I start with 10 they say our
10<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.340> 1<00:05:08.520> times<00:05:08.670> 10<00:05:08.910> 2<00:05:09.390> times<00:05:09.630> 10<00:05:09.840> 3<00:05:10.230> times<00:05:10.440> 2

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
10 so 1 times 10 2 times 10 3 times 2

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.540 
10 so 1 times 10 2 times 10 3 times 2
etc<00:05:11.090> number<00:05:12.090> times<00:05:12.420> 10<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:13.050> 10<00:05:13.290> times<00:05:13.770> 10<00:05:14.040> just

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
etc number times 10 so 10 times 10 just

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.780 
etc number times 10 so 10 times 10 just
give<00:05:14.730> 100<00:05:15.410> so<00:05:16.410> it's<00:05:16.530> right<00:05:16.650> this<00:05:16.920> I<00:05:17.160> can<00:05:17.640> write

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
give 100 so it's right this I can write

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.390 
give 100 so it's right this I can write
print

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:30.629 

I<00:05:24.210> then<00:05:25.210> I<00:05:25.570> could<00:05:25.810> write<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:28.139> str2<00:05:29.639> centage

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
I then I could write and str2 centage

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.310 
I then I could write and str2 centage
tracking<00:05:31.570> I<00:05:31.840> can<00:05:32.560> write<00:05:32.710> print<00:05:33.010> I<00:05:33.190> so<00:05:34.320> will

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
tracking I can write print I so will

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.300 
tracking I can write print I so will
print<00:05:35.620> whatever<00:05:35.740> value<00:05:36.280> of<00:05:36.400> is<00:05:36.820> so<00:05:37.510> I

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
print whatever value of is so I

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.850 
print whatever value of is so I
percentage<00:05:39.360> okay<00:05:40.389> we're<00:05:40.930> writing<00:05:41.110> string<00:05:41.590> to

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
percentage okay we're writing string to

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.980 
percentage okay we're writing string to
convert<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.340> into<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.580> string<00:05:42.699> as<00:05:43.270> a<00:05:43.330> Econoline

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
convert it into a string as a Econoline

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.860 
convert it into a string as a Econoline
as<00:05:44.320> you<00:05:44.830> can't<00:05:45.040> like<00:05:45.220> variables<00:05:45.910> like<00:05:46.449> on<00:05:46.750> my

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
as you can't like variables like on my

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.080 
as you can't like variables like on my
strings<00:05:47.199> and<00:05:47.500> integers<00:05:47.830> in<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.370> same<00:05:48.610> line<00:05:48.880> at

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
strings and integers in the same line at

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.860 
strings and integers in the same line at
the<00:05:49.180> same<00:05:49.360> time

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
the same time

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:57.600 
the same time
so<00:05:50.470> string<00:05:50.889> close<00:05:52.949> and<00:05:53.949> I<00:05:54.070> can<00:05:54.100> write<00:05:56.610> space

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
so string close and I can write space

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.969 
so string close and I can write space
times<00:05:59.729> please

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
times please

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.310 
times please

tutorial about manipulating numbers too
many<00:06:59.889> times<00:07:00.729> I<00:07:01.349> by<00:07:02.349> number<00:07:02.710> it<00:07:02.770> has<00:07:02.800> time<00:07:03.160> I<00:07:03.370> by

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 
many times I by number it has time I by

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:08.760 
many times I by number it has time I by
number<00:07:03.970> sir<00:07:04.380> I<00:07:06.060> percentage<00:07:07.320> star<00:07:08.320> which<00:07:08.530> means

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
number sir I percentage star which means

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.760 
number sir I percentage star which means
x<00:07:09.180> no<00:07:10.260> centage

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
x no centage

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.909 
x no centage
so<00:07:12.550> what's<00:07:12.759> doing<00:07:13.060> here<00:07:13.300> is<00:07:13.720> doing<00:07:14.139> I<00:07:14.289> times

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 
so what's doing here is doing I times

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.089 
so what's doing here is doing I times
number<00:07:15.370> so<00:07:15.669> with<00:07:16.270> every<00:07:16.780> time<00:07:16.990> I<00:07:17.169> increment<00:07:17.680> so

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:18.099 
number so with every time I increment so

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:19.800 
number so with every time I increment so
it<00:07:18.220> stops<00:07:18.430> for<00:07:18.520> the<00:07:18.759> one<00:07:18.910> and<00:07:19.210> two<00:07:19.389> or<00:07:19.509> three

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.810 
it stops for the one and two or three

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.790 
it stops for the one and two or three
and<00:07:20.229> that<00:07:20.590> ties<00:07:20.770> a<00:07:20.800> number<00:07:21.220> today<00:07:21.729> goes<00:07:22.060> NEX<00:07:22.389> I

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 
and that ties a number today goes NEX I

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.550 
and that ties a number today goes NEX I
just<00:07:23.800> say<00:07:23.889> PI<00:07:24.069> sauce<00:07:24.310> for<00:07:24.550> one

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 
just say PI sauce for one

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.830 
just say PI sauce for one

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 
next time - Tyler's number X like three

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.110 
next time - Tyler's number X like three
times<00:07:29.050> or<00:07:29.199> not<00:07:29.340> till<00:07:30.340> the<00:07:30.520> number<00:07:30.759> reaches<00:07:31.090> a
