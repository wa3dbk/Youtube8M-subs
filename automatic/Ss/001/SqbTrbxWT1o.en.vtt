wind socks they are also used to show

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.560 
wind socks they are also used to show
wind<00:01:22.470> direction<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:23.850> show<00:01:24.119> where<00:01:24.390> the

-<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:28.000> is<00:01:28.210> also<00:01:28.450> useful<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.200> know<00:01:29.470> wind<00:01:29.830> speed

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
- it is also useful to know wind speed

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.370 
- it is also useful to know wind speed
to<00:01:30.940> measure<00:01:31.150> this<00:01:31.420> we<00:01:31.750> use<00:01:31.870> an<00:01:32.020> instrument

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
to measure this we use an instrument

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.920 
to measure this we use an instrument
called<00:01:32.980> an<00:01:33.130> anemometer<00:01:33.760> which<00:01:34.540> looks<00:01:34.840> like

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
called an anemometer which looks like

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.640 
called an anemometer which looks like
this

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
this

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.430

the faster the wind the more quickly the
cups<00:01:38.680> on<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.130> anemometer<00:01:39.670> spin<00:01:40.420> around<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:41.530> is

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.980 
cups on the anemometer spin around it is
important<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.670> know<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.090> speed<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.660> a<00:01:43.780> wind

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
important to know the speed of a wind

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.280 
important to know the speed of a wind
the<00:01:44.680> faster<00:01:45.160> it<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:46.060> more<00:01:46.270> damage<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.990> can

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
the faster it is the more damage it can

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.980 
the faster it is the more damage it can
do<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:48.729> have<00:01:48.760> different<00:01:49.360> words<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.870> describe

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
how fast a wind is blowing a gust is a

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.880 
how fast a wind is blowing a gust is a
