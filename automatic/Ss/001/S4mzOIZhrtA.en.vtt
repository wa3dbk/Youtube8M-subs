00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 the carol oliveira missionary 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.879
 question is the following if god already knows of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 all things because we should pray 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.210
 I then volleyed for Miss Mateus 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.330
 chapter 7 verse number 7 that says 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.910
 ask and it will be given to you to seek 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.840
 they will find knock and the door will be 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.990
 open 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.130
 because everyone who asks receives what they are looking for 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.289
 and whoever knocks the door will be 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.710
 open because we have to pray 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.550
 if god already knows everything one thing is god 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.250
 to know something else is you asking for something 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.200
 It's my wife knowing that I want one. 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.489
 Kiss another thing I got to lose 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.180
 say give me a kiss 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.550
 god is not our waiter god not god 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.829
 is a genius of the lamp that is thus 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.230
 people what my son're wanting 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.710
 I left running the same way to answer 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.649
 It's not a relationship that God wants a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.350
 relationship if god only attended 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.039
 to my desires without I have to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.379
 improve 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.140
 it was not god it was samu it was 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.900
 a lamp genius he was a nanny 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.930
 he was a foot of kuru manicure he was 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.270
 God is not that God is not our slave 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.979
 who now has q just because he knows what 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.310
 I want him to have to come running and me 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.430
 to give God's own attention to the rule of 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.210
 Nothing will happen in your prayer. 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.450
 life 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.549
 nothing is in your life or in your life. 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.259
 church in that country nowhere to 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.090
 people before not praying 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.290
 he said ask and it shall be given 'it 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.650
 said 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.009
 because all you ask for is not all the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.970
 who wants to receive the method they want 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.799
 is all that asks then God left a lot 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.399
 Of course his word of Jesus signed 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.579
 below 250 thousand times we have to pray 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.829
 express why, in expressing the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.829
 desire through prayer we are 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.530
 exercising our faith in God I want 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.180
 so much and I created so much that all able 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.640
 to give me what I want I'm 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.470
 verbalizing this in prayer and I am 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.170
 presenting before the Lord in the form 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.599
 of a request for a clan 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.360
 My love, I 'm here saying to you 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.550
 I want so do not stop crying 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.860
 We can not stop crying if we 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.739
 do not look at the look we will not see the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.620
 results that God expects then fact 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.980
 I know everything we want not to 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.959
 nullifies our need for prayer if we 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.180
 do not look when things 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.819
 happened in our lives will not give 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.300
 Nor to believe anything for God, let's go. 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.510
 have to give the pro random profit the agent 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.970
 by any chance, I got a job just for 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.350
 Did God give me a wife, you or me? 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.930
 He prayed for you are thanking 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.120
 God happened without wanting everything you did 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.790
 no schedule happen gave no credit 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.750
 God damn it, no one can tell. 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.120
 anything 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.330
 Look, I want to thank or not at all because 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.030
 I was walking on the street and that's how you have it. 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.069
 that looking at you really has what 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.959
 thank and really have a 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.030
 relationship with you 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.620
 praying and walking with God is walking 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.660
 God is talking to God. 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.200
 Adam walked with God by the vibration of the 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.660
 day and they talked to interact 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.269
 with the other when sin entered the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.910
 walks between Adam and God stopped there 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.209
 today these walks between us and God 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.829
 back through the fast prayer of the 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.230
 reading does not stop searching for the 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.230
 God is the best in our day is the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.239
 high point of my day is when I pray and 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.709
 I search for God, send me your 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.470
 question and I'll always try 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.920
 answer here in the light of the word 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.920
 lord jesus
