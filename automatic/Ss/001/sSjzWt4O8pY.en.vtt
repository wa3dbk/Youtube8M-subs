00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
this motherboard has some really nice

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.460 
this motherboard has some really nice

z87 motherboard which means that

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.540 
z87 motherboard which means that
basically<00:01:31.840> this<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.560> primarily<00:01:32.860> made<00:01:33.310> for

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.210 
basically this is primarily made for
overclocking<00:01:34.140> especially<00:01:35.140> with<00:01:35.230> that<00:01:35.290> g<00:01:35.560> 2258

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
overclocking especially with that g 2258

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.520 
overclocking especially with that g 2258
this<00:01:37.000> could<00:01:37.210> support<00:01:37.570> ram<00:01:37.810> overclocking<00:01:38.380> up

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
this could support ram overclocking up

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.290 
this could support ram overclocking up
to<00:01:38.770> 20<00:01:39.100> hundred<00:01:39.400> megahertz<00:01:39.610> if<00:01:39.910> you're<00:01:40.090> into

this<00:02:49.610> also<00:02:49.910> can<00:02:50.300> support<00:02:50.540> Crossfire's<00:02:51.020> we

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
this also can support Crossfire's we

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.080 
this also can support Crossfire's we
want<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.350> add<00:02:51.440> another<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.950> ATX<00:02:52.280> in<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.730> future
