00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the next level to a soft catch is

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.429 
the next level to a soft catch is
actually<00:01:27.360> using<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.040> in<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.189> shot<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.200> use<00:01:31.409> it

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
actually using it in a shot so we use it

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.980 
actually using it in a shot so we use it
to<00:01:31.979> improve<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.490> player's<00:01:32.759> quick<00:01:33.090> release<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
then release it creates a one motion

see<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.960> shop<00:02:07.259> -<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.530> soft<00:02:07.860> catch<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
see to this shop - the soft catch is the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.980 
see to this shop - the soft catch is the
work<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.450> we<00:02:09.569> did<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.780> packing<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
work that we did with packing and

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.360 
work that we did with packing and
using<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.890> soft<00:02:12.190> catch<00:02:12.580> as<00:02:12.910> another<00:02:13.750> move<00:02:14.370> or

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
using the soft catch as another move or

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.360 
using the soft catch as another move or
the<00:02:15.730> first<00:02:15.970> move<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.930> sequence<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:17.740> we're

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the first move in a sequence so we're

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.060 
the first move in a sequence so we're
teaching<00:02:18.850> when<00:02:19.090> he<00:02:19.360> catches<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.960> pass<00:02:20.170> to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
teaching when he catches the pass to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.430 
teaching when he catches the pass to
catch<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.580> in<00:02:21.730> such<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.030> way<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.630> allows<00:02:23.020> him

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
catch it in such a way that allows him

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.280 
catch it in such a way that allows him
to<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:24.190> dynamic<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.090> you'll<00:02:25.600> see<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.020> some<00:02:26.260> of

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
to be dynamic and you'll see it some of

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.470 
to be dynamic and you'll see it some of
the<00:02:26.500> clips<00:02:27.130> as<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.520> how<00:02:27.700> important<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.420> for

more effective and pull the defenseman
out<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.270> position<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:04.960> the<00:03:05.530> soft<00:03:05.800> catch<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.310> a

dozen players in the world who currently
use<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:23.110> as<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.380> tactic<00:03:23.950> in<00:03:24.130> in<00:03:24.790> their<00:03:25.000> games

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
use this as a tactic in in their games

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.650 
use this as a tactic in in their games
but<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:26.140> not<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.910> difficult<00:03:27.910> skill<00:03:28.210> to<00:03:28.270> have

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
but it's not a difficult skill to have

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.200 
but it's not a difficult skill to have
it's<00:03:29.380> just<00:03:29.500> one<00:03:30.340> that's<00:03:30.580> like<00:03:30.730> like<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:30.940> said

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
it's just one that's like like I said

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.150 
it's just one that's like like I said
underappreciated<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.380> underdeveloped<00:03:32.650> and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
underappreciated and underdeveloped and

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.010 
underappreciated and underdeveloped and
for<00:03:33.430> those<00:03:33.520> of<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:33.940> who<00:03:34.420> are<00:03:34.570> trying<00:03:34.780> to

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
for those of you who are trying to

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.260 
for those of you who are trying to
develop<00:03:35.290> your<00:03:35.650> game<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.520> next<00:03:36.640> level

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
develop your game to the next level

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.230 
develop your game to the next level
developing<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.320> soft<00:03:38.620> catch<00:03:38.980> would<00:03:39.400> separate

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
developing a soft catch would separate

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.840 
developing a soft catch would separate
you<00:03:40.480> from<00:03:40.750> everyone<00:03:41.710> else<00:03:41.950> because<00:03:42.220> there's

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
you from everyone else because there's

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.940 
you from everyone else because there's
not<00:03:43.210> nobody<00:03:43.780> in<00:03:43.930> your<00:03:44.110> league<00:03:44.350> that<00:03:44.590> would<00:03:44.800> be

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
not nobody in your league that would be

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.310 
not nobody in your league that would be
doing<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:45.610> this<00:03:46.390> would<00:03:46.570> be<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.690> great<00:03:46.960> skill

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
doing it so this would be a great skill

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.370 
doing it so this would be a great skill
to<00:03:47.470> have<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.710> provide<00:03:48.400> much<00:03:48.820> more<00:03:48.850> dynamic
