00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
basically what it is it's a really rigid

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.260 
basically what it is it's a really rigid
program<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.730> really<00:00:41.940> unique<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
program it's really unique to

program it's really unique to
Northeastern<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.649> pretty<00:00:43.890> well<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
Northeastern it's pretty well see the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
Northeastern it's pretty well see the
thing<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.180> northeastern<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.930> known

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
thing is is that northeastern is known

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.860 
thing is is that northeastern is known
for<00:00:46.440> its<00:00:46.590> co-op<00:00:46.800> program<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.629> that's

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
for its co-op program so like that's

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.810 
for its co-op program so like that's
partially<00:00:49.230> why<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> wanted<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> come<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.219> but
