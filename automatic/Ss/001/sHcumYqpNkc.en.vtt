00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello hello this diack rise so 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.790
 in this tutorial I will show you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.349
 how could we install 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.799
 paid apps from the app store 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.779
 totally for free then for that 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:23.100
 so you need an iphone ios 7 or 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:29.550
 senior john merrick is then for 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.820
 install it you have to go to cydia there 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:39.950
 must be installed 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:42.980
 a tweak called link store so 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:47.870
 when you see him here he has to 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.870
 load so link store so here you are 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.140
 have 2 yellow the official one 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.989
 blue is the crash and because the link 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.030
 official store has a lot of bugs in 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.580
 done for the moment so it is 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.600
 better to take there version 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.590
 cracked for that you have to go in 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.890
 the sources 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.270
 you have to add one that carries the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:21.200
 hack your iphone name so the source 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:24.680
 it's http 2 point slash bars 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.610
 oblique resting points acquired your iphone 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.880
 dot org slashes 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.220
 camps-the-source she is installed you 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.740
 go into the search worry 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.509
 I will not put sources in the 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.360
 description 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:48.829
 so you go in search you 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:53.210
 put the link store and you take the 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.549
 blue diamond that's here if you do not 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.950
 not put there the source it will not appear 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.530
 of course so you install it 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.899
 so same method as for others 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.340
 since you get settled in 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.709
 top right installed confirmed the screen 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.019
 black with white source lines 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.560
 you restart your device or the 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.400
 springboard 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.940
 when they ask for it and then 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.680
 so you get to the dock and that's it 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:28.370
 you go back to the normal page you 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.670
 add wifi to go in 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.990
 your app store what is normal 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.970
 I'm going to the 3g because here I have 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:40.069
 no I do not have wifi now 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.690
 unfortunately and you have under a 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.870
 paid application 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.370
 I put airplane mode 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:53.720
 sorry and here you have hanotaux link 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:57.130
 store that is displayed here you click 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.970
 above and there they are looking will be so 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.730
 the same involvement for free 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.500
 he will download it will install when 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.989
 you have updates you are going 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.250
 in the updates he will show you 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.680
 so a usual update but the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.220
 abuse so always wants to try to do 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.510
 to update normally because 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.250
 you could forget the names of 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.239
 applications that you have installed by 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:30.530
 a parent was silent at the moment when 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.840
 where you have an update you are going 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.150
 Update 1 of milk will be here 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.850
 click on update and he'll say 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.790
 with this apple id there 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.390
 is not available so full up 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.100
 to the left 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:51.079
 good here you're going to have to round neck 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.890
 with the number of updates you 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:57.950
 have you go on there I have no 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.850
 update to do so he does not put me 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.250
 not the names of the applications the 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.019
 moment you know of updates to 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.049
 do you click on the name you 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.630
 want to update and it will do the same 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.700
 installation the same procedure as 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.989
 Installation 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.390
 I hope I have informed you 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.329
 for that it can be useful especially 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.229
 when we do not want to pay for 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.520
 applications 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.850
 what I can totally understand 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.970
 especially if you change from apple to samsung 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.550
 or others quite recently 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.590
 I am a little weak because apple 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.639
 still remains above the others 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.499
 brands 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.060
 here I hope I have you anyway 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:40.060
 learned something 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.840
 do not hesitate to leave a comment 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.669
