myself to get cut and lean because my

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
myself to get cut and lean because my
diet<00:01:58.439> does<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.189> only<00:01:59.399> thing<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.579> happens

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
diet does it the only thing that happens

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.600 
diet does it the only thing that happens
in<00:02:00.000> my<00:02:00.090> body<00:02:00.360> when<00:02:01.049> my<00:02:01.079> training<00:02:01.979> drops<00:02:02.280> off<00:02:02.460> is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
in my body when my training drops off is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.530 
in my body when my training drops off is
my<00:02:02.759> tan<00:02:03.000> goes<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.070> my<00:02:05.070> heart<00:02:05.310> muscle<00:02:05.850> gets<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
my tan goes and my heart muscle gets a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.529 
my tan goes and my heart muscle gets a
little<00:02:06.719> bit<00:02:06.840> weaker<00:02:07.200> because<00:02:07.619> when<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.979> have

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
little bit weaker because when you have

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.229 
little bit weaker because when you have
strength<00:02:09.539> mass<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.459> heart<00:02:11.670> muscle<00:02:12.120> that

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
strength mass in your heart muscle that

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.760 
strength mass in your heart muscle that
comes<00:02:12.450> from

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
comes from

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.010 
comes from
training<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.490> can't<00:02:13.760> have<00:02:13.940> mass<00:02:14.270> in<00:02:14.750> your

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
training you can't have mass in your

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.470 
training you can't have mass in your
heart<00:02:15.350> muscle<00:02:15.710> if<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:15.890> don't<00:02:16.040> use<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:17.450> I

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
heart muscle if you don't use it so I

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.590 
heart muscle if you don't use it so I
look<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.960> same<00:02:17.990> but<00:02:18.860> my<00:02:19.250> cardiac<00:02:20.030> output

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
look the same but my cardiac output

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.480 
look the same but my cardiac output
drops<00:02:21.080> off<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.290> bit<00:02:21.560> which<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:21.770> normal<00:02:22.250> because

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
drops off a bit which is normal because

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.910 
drops off a bit which is normal because
you<00:02:22.760> use<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.300> or<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.690> lose<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.560> goes<00:02:24.680> on

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
you use it or you lose it it goes on

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.640 
you use it or you lose it it goes on
standby<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.300> my<00:02:26.450> fitness<00:02:26.720> goes<00:02:27.020> on<00:02:27.200> standby

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
standby so my fitness goes on standby

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.490 
standby so my fitness goes on standby
over<00:02:28.010> winter<00:02:28.340> coz<00:02:29.080> general<00:02:30.080> has<00:02:30.260> been<00:02:30.350> too

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
and wear it so I just drop the training

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.300

that's<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.940> thing<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.300> don't<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.780> train

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
that's the thing I don't have to train

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.200 
that's the thing I don't have to train
for<00:02:36.410> weight<00:02:36.770> loss<00:02:36.980> because<00:02:37.250> what<00:02:37.610> diet<00:02:37.880> does

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210

are well I've got fucking packets of
sugar<00:02:44.650> packets<00:02:45.650> of<00:02:45.800> organic<00:02:46.280> sugar<00:02:46.580> on<00:02:46.850> the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
sugar packets of organic sugar on the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.810 
sugar packets of organic sugar on the
ground<00:02:47.630> there<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.470> know<00:02:48.620> I'm<00:02:49.400> still<00:02:49.670> eating

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
ground there you know I'm still eating

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.310 
ground there you know I'm still eating
this<00:02:49.970> stuff<00:02:50.240> even<00:02:50.390> though<00:02:50.540> hardly<00:02:50.840> training

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
this stuff even though hardly training

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.590 
this stuff even though hardly training
because<00:02:51.950> it's<00:02:52.130> sugar<00:02:52.430> for<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.670> cells<00:02:52.970> the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
because it's sugar for the cells the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.660 
because it's sugar for the cells the
fruit<00:02:53.810> quality<00:02:53.960> type<00:02:54.350> lavabit<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.770> winter<00:02:55.070> so

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
fruit quality type lavabit in winter so

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.370 
fruit quality type lavabit in winter so
the<00:02:55.760> sugar<00:02:56.000> sugar<00:02:56.390> they're<00:02:56.780> adding<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.290> in

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
the sugar sugar they're adding that in

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.020 
the sugar sugar they're adding that in
the<00:02:57.500> refined<00:02:57.890> organic<00:02:58.280> sugar<00:02:58.520> can<00:02:58.640> help<00:02:58.790> bulk

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
the refined organic sugar can help bulk

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.530 
the refined organic sugar can help bulk
up<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.210> sugar<00:02:59.780> calories<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.730> that's<00:03:01.910> what

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
up the sugar calories so that's what

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.090 
up the sugar calories so that's what
else<00:03:02.660> is<00:03:02.720> gonna<00:03:02.810> show<00:03:03.080> peanuts<00:03:03.500> about<00:03:03.770> it<00:03:03.920> so

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
else is gonna show peanuts about it so

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.910
