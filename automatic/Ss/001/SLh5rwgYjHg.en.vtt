I think the way they do this they sell
the<00:00:35.070> PlayStation<00:00:35.970> then<00:00:36.120> they<00:00:36.240> just<00:00:36.450> send<00:00:37.410> it

plug to plug into PlayStation and I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.650 
plug to plug into PlayStation and I
guess<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.400> a<00:01:02.430> plug<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.120> plug<00:01:03.270> into<00:01:03.540> your

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.959 
guess this is a plug to plug into your
TV<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.460> you're<00:01:05.549> supposed<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.820> do

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:05.969 
TV and I think you're supposed to do

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.539 
TV and I think you're supposed to do
with<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> HDMI<00:01:06.780> cable<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:08.159> they<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.340> not

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.880 
with like a HDMI cable but they do not
provide<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.259> believe<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.649> is<00:01:10.859> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
provide one and I believe this is a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.459 
provide one and I believe this is a
charging<00:01:11.399> cable<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.969> the<00:01:12.119> wireless<00:01:12.780> remote
