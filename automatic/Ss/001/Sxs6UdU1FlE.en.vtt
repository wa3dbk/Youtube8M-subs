00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.900 
to Pat these down so I'm going to take
this<00:02:11.790> shoelace<00:02:12.750> dip<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:13.890> into<00:02:14.040> our<00:02:14.280> solution

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
this shoelace dip it into our solution

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.700 
this shoelace dip it into our solution
and<00:02:15.120> then<00:02:15.480> I'm<00:02:15.630> going<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.870> just<00:02:16.020> basically

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
and then I'm going to just basically

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.700 
and then I'm going to just basically
take<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.540> into<00:02:18.540> my<00:02:18.750> hands<00:02:19.320> causing<00:02:20.280> friction

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
take it into my hands causing friction

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.200 
take it into my hands causing friction
okay<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.210> next<00:02:24.390> step<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.900> process<00:02:24.990> is

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
okay so the next step in this process is

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.730 
okay so the next step in this process is
to<00:02:27.210> put<00:02:27.450> them<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.870> sneaker<00:02:28.200> laundry<00:02:28.530> bag

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
to put them in the sneaker laundry bag

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.440 
to put them in the sneaker laundry bag
all<00:02:29.460> we're<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.850> do<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.030> put<00:02:30.210> them<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
all we're going to do is put them in the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.780 
all we're going to do is put them in the
washing<00:02:30.750> machine
