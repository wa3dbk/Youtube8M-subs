fusing<00:01:54.390> them<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> say<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.409> then

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
fusing them that is to say and then

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.789 
fusing them that is to say and then
beginning<00:01:56.700> your<00:01:56.880> weave<00:01:57.259> but<00:01:58.259> that's<00:01:58.469> enough

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
beginning your weave but that's enough

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.740 
beginning your weave but that's enough
about<00:01:58.950> some<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.520> those<00:01:59.640> variations<00:01:59.969> except

about some of those variations except

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.050 
about some of those variations except

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
for of course the keychain which is just

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.459 
for of course the keychain which is just
like<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:04.200> one

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
like that one

like that one
okay<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.460> connect<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> keychain<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
okay just connect it to a keychain and

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.520 
okay just connect it to a keychain and
this<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.890> which<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.099> more<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> zipper<00:02:08.789> pull

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530

bracelet is to make let's go ahead and
get<00:02:28.770> into<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.520> first<00:02:29.790> thing<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.060> want<00:02:30.240> to

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
get into it the first thing we want to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.060 
get into it the first thing we want to
do<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:31.020> we<00:02:31.230> do<00:02:31.410> with<00:02:31.440> any<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
do just like we do with any of the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.950 
do just like we do with any of the
ripcord<00:02:32.430> sentence<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.000> find<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.750> halfway

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
ripcord sentence is find the halfway

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.620 
ripcord sentence is find the halfway
point<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.560> bring<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.860> two<00:02:35.010> ends<00:02:35.190> together

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
point so bring the two ends together

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.470 
point so bring the two ends together
find<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.780> middle<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:38.490> we<00:02:38.610> begin<00:02:38.880> just<00:02:39.270> like

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
find that middle and we begin just like

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.550 
find that middle and we begin just like
this<00:02:40.070> we<00:02:41.070> rotate<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:42.780> create<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.110> little<00:02:43.380> loop

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
this we rotate to create a little loop

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.880 
this we rotate to create a little loop
like<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.210> then<00:02:45.210> we<00:02:45.330> pass<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.840> end<00:02:46.110> through

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
like that then we pass this end through

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.380 
like that then we pass this end through
the<00:02:46.980> back<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:48.540> like<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:50.240> now<00:02:51.240> at

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
the back of that just like so now at

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.020 
the back of that just like so now at
this<00:02:51.600> point<00:02:51.959> if<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.920> want<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.250> turn<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.700> into

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
this point if you want to turn this into

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.960 
this point if you want to turn this into
a<00:02:54.450> zipper<00:02:54.930> pull<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:56.100> is<00:02:56.400> where<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.850> would

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
a zipper pull this is where you would

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.250 
a zipper pull this is where you would
open<00:02:57.240> up<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:58.260> hole<00:02:58.530> right<00:02:58.560> here<00:03:00.200> okay<00:03:01.200> you

that hold just about right but we're
going<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.130> assume<00:03:38.220> we've<00:03:38.489> got<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.850> right<00:03:39.000> here

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
going to assume we've got it right here

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.630 
going to assume we've got it right here
and<00:03:39.510> we're<00:03:40.200> going<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.380> stop<00:03:40.680> with<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.430> hole

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
and we're going to stop with that hole

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.390 
and we're going to stop with that hole
just<00:03:42.000> about<00:03:42.239> right<00:03:42.570> where<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.810> is<00:03:42.930> now<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:44.160> is

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
just about right where it is now this is

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.060 
just about right where it is now this is
where<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.090> begins<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.989> it's<00:03:46.230> really<00:03:46.590> simple

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
where it begins and it's really simple

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.440 
where it begins and it's really simple
as<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.250> said<00:03:47.580> once<00:03:47.970> you've<00:03:48.120> got<00:03:48.269> this

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
as I said once you've got this

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.170 
as I said once you've got this
configuration<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.380> come<00:03:50.370> over<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.760> this<00:03:50.880> end

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
configuration you come over to this end

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.090 
configuration you come over to this end
you<00:03:51.930> make<00:03:52.170> what's<00:03:52.380> called<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.650> bite<00:03:52.830> where

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
you make what's called the bite where

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.520 
you make what's called the bite where
you<00:03:53.190> just<00:03:53.310> kind<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.550> Bend<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.850> rope<00:03:54.060> like<00:03:54.269> so

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
you just kind of Bend the rope like so

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.500 
you just kind of Bend the rope like so
you<00:03:55.530> pass<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:56.040> through<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.310> back<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.880> this

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
you pass it through the back of this

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.449 
you pass it through the back of this
well<00:03:58.350> let's<00:03:58.530> give<00:03:58.830> that<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:58.980> little<00:03:59.100> more<00:03:59.250> space

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
well let's give that a little more space

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.840 
well let's give that a little more space
you<00:03:59.730> pass<00:04:00.300> it<00:04:00.480> through<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.720> back<00:04:00.900> of<00:04:01.080> this<00:04:01.170> one

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
you pass it through the back of this one

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.630 
you pass it through the back of this one
just<00:04:02.850> like<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:04.100> then<00:04:05.100> you<00:04:05.220> cinch<00:04:05.459> this

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
just like that and then you cinch this

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.380 
just like that and then you cinch this
down<00:04:07.310> take<00:04:08.310> care<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.730> make<00:04:08.760> sure<00:04:09.030> everything

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
down take care to make sure everything

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.880 
down take care to make sure everything
is<00:04:09.480> even<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:12.260> getting<00:04:13.260> nice<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.620> tight<00:04:13.769> on

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
is even and getting nice and tight on

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.909 
is even and getting nice and tight on
all<00:04:14.070> ends<00:04:15.350> and<00:04:17.120> that's<00:04:18.120> that<00:04:18.560> that<00:04:19.560> one's<00:04:19.739> done

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
all ends and that's that that one's done

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.550 
all ends and that's that that one's done
then<00:04:20.760> move<00:04:20.910> on<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.120> this<00:04:21.239> side<00:04:21.479> we<00:04:21.840> also<00:04:22.020> make<00:04:22.530> a

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
then move on to this side we also make a

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.409 
then move on to this side we also make a
bite<00:04:22.860> just<00:04:23.100> like<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.760> pass<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.300> through

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
bite just like that and pass it through

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.920 
bite just like that and pass it through
this<00:04:24.600> hoop

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.900 

we<00:04:26.990> begin<00:04:27.229> to<00:04:27.320> sense<00:04:27.500> this<00:04:27.620> one<00:04:27.800> down<00:04:27.949> and

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
we begin to sense this one down and

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.159 
we begin to sense this one down and
again<00:04:29.240> we<00:04:29.419> make<00:04:29.600> sure<00:04:29.750> everything<00:04:30.080> is<00:04:30.139> tight

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
again we make sure everything is tight

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.980 
again we make sure everything is tight
pull<00:04:30.979> it<00:04:31.070> here<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.310> little<00:04:31.490> bit<00:04:31.750> pull<00:04:32.750> here<00:04:32.960> a

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
pull it here a little bit pull here a

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.860 
pull it here a little bit pull here a
little<00:04:33.139> bit<00:04:33.789> get<00:04:34.789> that<00:04:34.820> cinch<00:04:35.240> down<00:04:35.300> nice<00:04:35.630> and

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
little bit get that cinch down nice and

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.480 
little bit get that cinch down nice and
tight<00:04:36.020> you<00:04:36.050> can<00:04:36.350> almost<00:04:36.530> already<00:04:36.979> see<00:04:37.460> that

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
tight you can almost already see that

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.930 
tight you can almost already see that
Synod<00:04:38.289> taking<00:04:39.289> shape<00:04:39.530> then<00:04:40.460> back<00:04:40.669> to<00:04:40.820> this

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
Synod taking shape then back to this

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
Synod taking shape then back to this
side<00:04:41.180> we<00:04:41.360> make<00:04:41.539> a<00:04:41.570> bite<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:43.310> pass<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:43.789> through

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
side we make a bite you pass it through

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.680 
side we make a bite you pass it through
and<00:04:44.960> we<00:04:45.050> cinch<00:04:45.289> it<00:04:45.410> down<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:46.150> this<00:04:47.150> is<00:04:47.210> really

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
and we cinch it down and this is really

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.310 
and we cinch it down and this is really
all<00:04:48.050> there<00:04:48.530> is<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:49.009> it<00:04:49.160> guys<00:04:49.780> you<00:04:50.780> make<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.050> bite

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
all there is to it guys you make a bite

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.710 
all there is to it guys you make a bite
you<00:04:52.009> pass<00:04:52.280> it<00:04:52.490> through<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.759> the<00:04:53.090> back<00:04:53.360> make

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
through the front and you cinch it down

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.710 
through the front and you cinch it down
now<00:04:58.430> if<00:04:58.669> you<00:04:58.789> end<00:04:58.970> up<00:04:59.120> bringing<00:04:59.479> it<00:04:59.690> through

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
make sure you always pass it through the

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.270 
make sure you always pass it through the
back<00:05:07.280> make<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.180> Bight<00:05:08.479> pass<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.139> through<00:05:09.289> cinch

back make a Bight pass it through cinch

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.400 
back make a Bight pass it through cinch
it<00:05:10.430> down<00:05:10.460> and<00:05:11.150> kind<00:05:11.509> of<00:05:11.599> try<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.020> keep<00:05:12.289> that

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
it down and kind of try to keep that

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.499 
it down and kind of try to keep that
straightened<00:05:13.009> as<00:05:13.099> well<00:05:13.280> don't<00:05:13.970> let<00:05:14.120> this<00:05:14.300> get

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
straightened as well don't let this get

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.810 
straightened as well don't let this get
twisted<00:05:14.960> in<00:05:15.080> front<00:05:15.380> or<00:05:15.560> twisted<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:16.400> back<00:05:16.580> or

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
twisted in front or twisted and back or

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.529 
twisted in front or twisted and back or
anything<00:05:16.970> like<00:05:17.120> that

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
anything like that

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.749 
anything like that
keep<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.110> kind<00:05:18.289> of<00:05:18.320> stacked<00:05:18.710> on<00:05:18.919> top<00:05:18.979> of<00:05:19.460> itself

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
keep it kind of stacked on top of itself

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.469 
keep it kind of stacked on top of itself
like<00:05:20.060> that<00:05:21.310> so<00:05:22.310> it's<00:05:22.490> tighten<00:05:22.849> that<00:05:22.940> down<00:05:23.000> and

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
like that so it's tighten that down and

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.659 
like that so it's tighten that down and
that's<00:05:23.750> always<00:05:24.410> how<00:05:25.039> it<00:05:25.160> should<00:05:25.340> look<00:05:25.520> with

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
that's always how it should look with

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.189 
that's always how it should look with
that<00:05:25.820> loop<00:05:26.090> kind<00:05:26.419> of<00:05:26.539> coming<00:05:26.780> up<00:05:26.900> and<00:05:27.050> around

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
that loop kind of coming up and around
