head I don't know if I have enough space

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.219 
head I don't know if I have enough space
on<00:01:05.939> my<00:01:06.060> desk<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.110> you're<00:01:07.200> just

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
on my desk to do it but you're just

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.800 
on my desk to do it but you're just
going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.510> hair<00:01:09.720> is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
going to do it like this if your hair is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.170 
going to do it like this if your hair is
straight<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.280> tease<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> little<00:01:12.030> bit

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
straight you can tease it a little bit

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.750 
straight you can tease it a little bit
to<00:01:12.360> add<00:01:12.510> some<00:01:13.110> texture<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:14.400> you're<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
to add some texture but you're going to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.429 
to add some texture but you're going to
do<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.030> all<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> way<00:01:15.390> around<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.900> head<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
do that all the way around your head and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.710 
do that all the way around your head and
just<00:01:16.830> pin<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.060> super<00:01:21.509> super

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
just pin it down and this is super super

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.330 
just pin it down and this is super super
easy<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.350> usually<00:01:22.650> takes<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.009> five

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
easy this usually takes like five

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.859 
easy this usually takes like five
minutes<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.820> when<00:01:23.909> my<00:01:24.030> hair<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.270> scrunched

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
minutes and when my hair is scrunched

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.450 
minutes and when my hair is scrunched
it's<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.320> much<00:01:25.530> easier<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.070> looks<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.400> much

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
it's so much easier and it looks so much
