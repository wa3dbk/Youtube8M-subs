00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
the results okay so basically I didn't

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.720

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
when I'm running late in the morning and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.440 
when I'm running late in the morning and
just<00:02:18.650> want<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.980> do<00:02:19.130> something<00:02:19.610> with<00:02:19.700> my<00:02:19.910> hair<00:02:20.150> I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
just want to do something with my hair I

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.690 
just want to do something with my hair I
just<00:02:20.990> grabbed<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.320> big<00:02:21.800> big<00:02:22.100> chunk<00:02:22.460> of<00:02:22.550> my<00:02:22.670> hair

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
just grabbed a big big chunk of my hair

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.050 
just grabbed a big big chunk of my hair
since<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.690> waiver<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.410> pretty<00:02:24.920> huge<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.820> can

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
since this waiver is pretty huge you can

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.480 
since this waiver is pretty huge you can
get<00:02:26.240> away<00:02:26.360> with<00:02:26.810> using<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.320> huge<00:02:27.650> chunk<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.100> hair

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
get away with using a huge chunk of hair

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.260 
get away with using a huge chunk of hair
so<00:02:29.120> basically<00:02:29.930> what<00:02:30.260> i<00:02:30.290> do<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.670> careful<00:02:31.880> not

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
so basically what i do is be careful not

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.300 
so basically what i do is be careful not
to<00:02:32.450> bring<00:02:32.600> your<00:02:32.810> ear<00:02:33.020> because<00:02:33.230> i<00:02:33.470> always<00:02:33.830> burn

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
to bring your ear because i always burn

go all the way to the roof if you don't

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.720 
go all the way to the roof if you don't
get<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.590> root<00:03:09.739> that's<00:03:09.980> five<00:03:10.280> we'll<00:03:10.580> just

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
get to the root that's five we'll just

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:19.120 
get to the root that's five we'll just
go<00:03:10.910> right<00:03:11.180> over<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.840> afterwards<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.680> now<00:03:18.860> when

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
go right over it afterwards and now when

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.009 
go right over it afterwards and now when
i<00:03:19.250> move<00:03:19.550> it<00:03:19.700> down<00:03:19.940> my<00:03:20.120> hair<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.630> let<00:03:20.750> me<00:03:20.870> get<00:03:20.989> a

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
i move it down my hair and let me get a

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.530 
i move it down my hair and let me get a
little<00:03:21.200> bit<00:03:21.410> closer<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.130> can<00:03:22.280> see<00:03:22.459> i<00:03:22.850> tried

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
little bit closer so you can see i tried

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.500 
little bit closer so you can see i tried
to<00:03:23.989> make<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.410> indent<00:03:25.040> right<00:03:25.519> underneath<00:03:26.030> of

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
to make the indent right underneath of

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.650 
to make the indent right underneath of
the<00:03:26.570> last<00:03:27.080> in<00:03:27.500> 10<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.519> looks<00:03:28.730> more<00:03:28.910> natural

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
the last in 10 so it looks more natural

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.090 
the last in 10 so it looks more natural
that<00:03:30.320> way<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.660> as<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.959> see<00:03:33.230> when<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.530> lift<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.920> up

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
that way so as you see when I lift it up

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.490 
that way so as you see when I lift it up
there's<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.820> part<00:03:35.180> that's<00:03:35.239> indented<00:03:36.230> right

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
there's a part that's indented right

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.830 
there's a part that's indented right
there<00:03:36.800> so<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.250> just<00:03:37.340> clamp<00:03:37.940> down<00:03:38.330> in<00:03:38.690> that

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
there so I just clamp down in that

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.680 
there so I just clamp down in that
section<00:03:39.230> again<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.610> just<00:03:40.820> makes<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.360> even

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
section again so it just makes it even

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.240 
section again so it just makes it even
the<00:03:42.019> wave<00:03:43.959> alright<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.320> when<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.680> get<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.220> my

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
the wave alright so when I get to my

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.310 
the wave alright so when I get to my
front<00:03:46.820> part<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.180> my<00:03:47.330> bangs<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.930> like<00:03:48.170> to

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.400 
my bangs looks crazy so I just leave it
on<00:04:13.920> for<00:04:13.980> seriously<00:04:14.670> like<00:04:14.909> two<00:04:15.239> seconds<00:04:15.840> you

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
on for seriously like two seconds you

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.069 
on for seriously like two seconds you
can<00:04:16.560> see<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.579> waves<00:04:17.940> are<00:04:18.209> already<00:04:18.720> in<00:04:18.870> my

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
can see that the waves are already in my

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.409 
can see that the waves are already in my
hair<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.620> basically<00:04:20.100> just<00:04:20.430> keep<00:04:20.850> going<00:04:21.180> and

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
hair I basically just keep going and

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.350 
hair I basically just keep going and
where<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.720> top<00:04:21.989> sections<00:04:22.590> of<00:04:22.770> my<00:04:23.100> hair<00:04:23.360> try

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
where the top sections of my hair try

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.629 
where the top sections of my hair try
and<00:04:24.419> get<00:04:24.660> as<00:04:24.780> close<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.800> root<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.250> my<00:04:26.430> head

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
and get as close to the root of my head

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.570 
and get as close to the root of my head
as<00:04:26.910> possible<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:28.169> it<00:04:28.350> basically<00:04:28.530> looks<00:04:29.250> like

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
as possible so it basically looks like

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:38.150 
as possible so it basically looks like
your<00:04:29.789> waves<00:04:30.060> are<00:04:30.360> more<00:04:30.720> natural<00:04:31.440> that<00:04:31.650> way<00:04:37.160> if

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
your waves are more natural that way if

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.080 
your waves are more natural that way if
you<00:04:38.729> have<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.240> bump<00:04:39.870> in<00:04:40.289> your<00:04:40.320> hair<00:04:40.889> you<00:04:41.789> can

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
you have a bump in your hair you can

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.620 
you have a bump in your hair you can
just<00:04:42.479> lock<00:04:42.930> your<00:04:43.440> waiver<00:04:43.830> so<00:04:44.759> it<00:04:45.150> has<00:04:45.330> two

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
settings lock and unlock and basically

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.960 
settings lock and unlock and basically
this<00:04:47.940> part<00:04:48.389> top<00:04:48.780> we're<00:04:49.349> kind<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.830> waves<00:04:50.130> out<00:04:50.520> a
