00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
you what I mean by matted down look at

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.870 
you what I mean by matted down look at
the<00:00:23.880> st.<00:00:24.180> Augustine<00:00:24.779> grass<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.830> flat<00:00:26.220> it's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
the st. Augustine grass it's flat it's

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.150 
the st. Augustine grass it's flat it's
not<00:00:27.150> growing<00:00:27.510> up<00:00:27.720> very<00:00:28.019> tall<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:28.920> real

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
not growing up very tall it's not real

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.460 
not growing up very tall it's not real
real<00:00:29.429> thick<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.510> reason<00:00:30.929> why<00:00:31.080> is

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
real thick and the reason why is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.950 
real thick and the reason why is
underneath<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.489> st.<00:00:32.759> Augustine<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.420> soil

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
underneath this st. Augustine the soil

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.979 
underneath this st. Augustine the soil
is<00:00:34.590> very<00:00:34.950> hard<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.489> compacted<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> roots

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
is very hard and compacted the roots

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.740 
is very hard and compacted the roots
cannot<00:00:37.469> move<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.250> hard<00:00:38.550> ground<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
cannot move in that hard ground so of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.299 
cannot move in that hard ground so of
course<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.410> going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.739> get<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> lot<00:00:41.190> of

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
course you're not going to get a lot of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
course you're not going to get a lot of
growth<00:00:41.520> out<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.000> st.<00:00:42.270> Augustine<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:43.050> the

growth out of the st. Augustine if the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380 
growth out of the st. Augustine if the
roots<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:43.649> able<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.129> release<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.879> go

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
roots are not able to release and go

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.869 
roots are not able to release and go
deeper<00:00:45.780> down<00:00:45.930> into<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.289> soil<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.610> take<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
deeper down into the soil if you take a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.330 
deeper down into the soil if you take a
look<00:00:48.180> at<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.510> spot<00:00:48.840> right<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
look at this spot right here and it's a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.330 
look at this spot right here and it's a
good<00:00:50.640> example<00:00:50.809> side<00:00:51.809> by<00:00:52.110> side<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.469> got<00:00:52.949> flat

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
good example side by side you got flat

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.819 
good example side by side you got flat
matted<00:00:53.879> down<00:00:54.059> log<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.440> got<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
matted down log here then you got the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.520 
matted down log here then you got the
tall<00:00:56.100> thick<00:00:56.430> st.<00:00:56.789> Augustine<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.289> is

Augustine<00:01:28.650> grow<00:01:29.369> sometimes<00:01:29.759> you'll<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
Augustine grow sometimes you'll have to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.600 
Augustine grow sometimes you'll have to
wait<00:01:30.600> two<00:01:31.170> or<00:01:31.320> three<00:01:31.590> weeks<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.040> let<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> catch

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
wait two or three weeks to let it catch

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
wait two or three weeks to let it catch
up<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.509> you're<00:01:33.659> gonna<00:01:33.810> automatically<00:01:34.560> see

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
up what you're gonna automatically see

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.950 
up what you're gonna automatically see
by<00:01:35.100> letting<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.490> st.<00:01:35.790> Augustine<00:01:36.329> grow<00:01:36.570> is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
by letting that st. Augustine grow is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.810 
by letting that st. Augustine grow is
you're<00:01:37.439> gonna<00:01:37.530> obviously<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> taller

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
you're gonna obviously see a taller
