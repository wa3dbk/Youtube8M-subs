00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.880 
can see obviously it looks quite a bit
different<00:02:42.060> than<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:43.110> ones<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.739> been

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
different than the ones that have been

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.890 
different than the ones that have been
top<00:02:44.129> coated<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.640> done<00:02:44.910> because<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.420> top<00:02:45.630> coat

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
top coated and done because the top coat

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.930 
top coated and done because the top coat
does<00:02:46.170> change<00:02:46.560> slightly<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> depth<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.849> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
does change slightly the depth of the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.080 
does change slightly the depth of the
color<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:49.739> when<00:02:50.069> you're<00:02:50.190> happy<00:02:50.370> you've<00:02:50.849> got

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
color so when you're happy you've got

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:58.759 
color so when you're happy you've got
all<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.450> surplus<00:02:51.840> bits<00:02:52.230> off<00:02:55.880> will<00:02:56.880> then<00:02:57.769> pop

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
all the surplus bits off will then pop

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.569 
all the surplus bits off will then pop
the<00:02:58.950> top<00:02:59.129> coat<00:02:59.370> on<00:03:00.680> okay<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.890> have<00:03:02.129> actually

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
the top coat on okay I have actually

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.270 
the top coat on okay I have actually
just<00:03:02.610> done<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.420> top<00:03:03.750> coats<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.260> save<00:03:04.470> time<00:03:05.040> and

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
just done the top coats to save time and

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.610 
just done the top coats to save time and
you<00:03:05.310> watching<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.989> I'm<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.260> going<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.440> show

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
layer and these are the so that you see

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.050 
layer and these are the so that you see
a<00:03:13.980> close-up<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.730> actual<00:03:15.120> colors<00:03:16.579> how<00:03:17.579> it's

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060
