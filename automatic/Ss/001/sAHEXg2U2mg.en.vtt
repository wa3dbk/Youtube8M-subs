say I was walking down the street the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.100 
say I was walking down the street the
other<00:00:36.480> day<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.230> saw<00:00:37.500> scratch<00:00:38.300> on<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> car<00:00:39.750> and

other day and I saw scratch on a car and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.220 
other day and I saw scratch on a car and
I<00:00:40.170> thought<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> might<00:00:40.680> be<00:00:40.860> your<00:00:41.390> car<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
I thought it might be your car and I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.700 
I thought it might be your car and I
thought<00:00:43.469> who<00:00:43.829> knows<00:00:45.320> now<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> don't<00:00:46.530> know

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
thought who knows now I don't know

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.590 
thought who knows now I don't know
whether<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.190> works<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.180> technique

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
whether that works or not that technique

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
whether that works or not that technique
so<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.050> thought<00:00:49.469> I'd<00:00:49.590> try<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:50.129> some<00:00:50.399> hypnotic

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
