for<00:00:22.600> the<00:00:22.660> new<00:00:22.720> Grand<00:00:22.990> Cherokee<00:00:23.410> really<00:00:23.740> want

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
for the new Grand Cherokee really want

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.260 
for the new Grand Cherokee really want
to<00:00:24.040> raise<00:00:24.190> the<00:00:24.430> amount<00:00:24.520> to<00:00:24.760> be<00:00:24.880> a<00:00:24.910> level<00:00:25.240> that's

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
to raise the amount to be a level that's

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.930 
to raise the amount to be a level that's
on-road<00:00:25.810> performance<00:00:26.310> make<00:00:27.310> it<00:00:27.430> perform<00:00:27.730> more

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
on-road performance make it perform more

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.120 
on-road performance make it perform more
like<00:00:28.120> a<00:00:28.150> sports<00:00:28.510> SUV<00:00:29.050> and<00:00:29.320> in<00:00:29.800> doing<00:00:29.950> that

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
like a sports SUV and in doing that

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.970 
like a sports SUV and in doing that
require<00:00:30.970> two<00:00:31.210> basic<00:00:31.600> things<00:00:31.870> one<00:00:32.590> is<00:00:32.740> to

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
require two basic things one is to

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.440 
require two basic things one is to
significantly<00:00:33.520> stiffen<00:00:34.120> up<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.270> body

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
significantly stiffen up the body

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.720 
significantly stiffen up the body
