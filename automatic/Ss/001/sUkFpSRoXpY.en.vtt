the<00:00:00.630> University<00:00:01.050> provided<00:00:01.350> me<00:00:01.620> with<00:00:01.650> quite<00:00:01.979> a

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
the University provided me with quite a

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.889 
the University provided me with quite a
few<00:00:02.100> opportunities<00:00:02.490> that<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:03.300> was<00:00:03.540> able<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.750> do

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
few opportunities that I was able to do

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.840 
few opportunities that I was able to do
outside<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.290> class<00:00:04.440> so<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.100> was<00:00:05.460> part<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:05.730> the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
outside of class so I was part of the

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.789 
outside of class so I was part of the
co-op<00:00:06.060> program<00:00:06.150> which<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.319> gave<00:00:07.470> me<00:00:07.560> lots<00:00:07.740> of

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
co-op program which I gave me lots of

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.400 
co-op program which I gave me lots of
work<00:00:07.980> experience<00:00:08.550> as<00:00:08.849> well<00:00:09.150> as<00:00:09.210> I'm<00:00:10.170> involved

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
work experience as well as I'm involved

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.749 
work experience as well as I'm involved
in<00:00:10.559> let's<00:00:10.740> talk<00:00:10.889> science<00:00:11.130> which<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.550> another

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
in let's talk science which is another

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.600 
in let's talk science which is another
initiative<00:00:12.380> nationally<00:00:13.380> where<00:00:13.620> we<00:00:14.519> basically

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
initiative nationally where we basically

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.150 
initiative nationally where we basically
teach<00:00:15.089> kids<00:00:15.330> about<00:00:15.480> science<00:00:16.020> really<00:00:16.230> try<00:00:17.130> to

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
teach kids about science really try to

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.220 
teach kids about science really try to
promote<00:00:17.460> science<00:00:17.760> literacy<00:00:18.180> we<00:00:19.020> go<00:00:19.109> into

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
promote science literacy we go into

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.200 
promote science literacy we go into
classrooms<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.980> we<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.189> hands-on<00:00:20.699> activities

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
classrooms and we do hands-on activities

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.700 
classrooms and we do hands-on activities
that<00:00:21.449> really<00:00:21.660> get<00:00:21.869> them<00:00:22.020> excited<00:00:22.529> about

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
that really get them excited about

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.840 
that really get them excited about
science<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.340> they<00:00:23.430> get<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> see<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
science and they get to see the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.820 
science and they get to see the
different<00:00:23.970> opportunities<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:25.109> science<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
different opportunities in science and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.080 
different opportunities in science and
what<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.070> means<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> scientist

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
what it means to be a scientist

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.169 
what it means to be a scientist
I<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:28.050> math<00:00:28.320> because<00:00:29.220> well<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.849> liked<00:00:30.090> it

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
I like math because well I liked it

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.089 
I like math because well I liked it
originally<00:00:30.599> because<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> was<00:00:31.050> hard<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
originally because it was hard and it

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
originally because it was hard and it
was<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.550> challenge<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.239> very<00:00:33.510> satisfying<00:00:34.079> you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
was a challenge and very satisfying you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.080 
was a challenge and very satisfying you
get<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> nice<00:00:34.559> answer<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.399> then<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.730> answer

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
get a nice answer and then the answer

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.720 
get a nice answer and then the answer
stopped<00:00:36.329> being<00:00:36.540> nice<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:38.129> too<00:00:38.399> far<00:00:38.550> in

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
stopped being nice but I was too far in

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.990 
stopped being nice but I was too far in
so<00:00:38.969> now<00:00:39.320> now<00:00:40.320> I'm<00:00:40.559> committed<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
so now now I'm committed and I like it a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.250 
so now now I'm committed and I like it a
lot<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.840> rewarding<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.809> aerial

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
lot it's rewarding so I do aerial

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.410 
lot it's rewarding so I do aerial
acrobatics<00:00:52.680> which<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.370> japaese<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.210> guess

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
acrobatics which is like japaese I guess

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.209 
acrobatics which is like japaese I guess
if<00:00:54.539> anybody<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.989> seeing<00:00:55.230> circle<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> they<00:00:56.160> can

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
if anybody is seeing circle a they can

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040 
if anybody is seeing circle a they can
kind<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.610> picture<00:00:56.850> us<00:00:57.300> hanging<00:00:57.750> from<00:00:57.870> this

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
kind of picture us hanging from this

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.590 
kind of picture us hanging from this
from<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.829> ceilings<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.340> that's<00:01:00.149> definitely

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
from the ceilings so that's definitely

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.660 
from the ceilings so that's definitely
what<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.260> spare<00:01:01.379> time<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:02.010> guess<00:01:02.550> since

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
what I do in my spare time I guess since

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.039 
what I do in my spare time I guess since
we're<00:01:02.820> doing<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.090> other<00:01:03.180> side<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.600> brain

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
we're doing the other side of my brain

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.719 
we're doing the other side of my brain
so<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.260> artistic<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> saw<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.369> can

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
so it's artistic and I saw that I can

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.219 
so it's artistic and I saw that I can
die<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.689> great<00:01:06.750> way<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.960> express

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
die just it's a great way to express

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:15.350 
die just it's a great way to express
yourself<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.950> fun<00:01:08.810> I<00:01:14.119> chose<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> U

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
yourself and to have fun I chose the U

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.850 
yourself and to have fun I chose the U
of<00:01:15.390> M<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.780> my<00:01:15.869> undergrad<00:01:16.259> degree<00:01:16.290> because

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
of M for my undergrad degree because

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.460 
of M for my undergrad degree because
it's<00:01:16.979> close<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> home<00:01:17.520> my<00:01:17.880> name<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.090> Naimah<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
it's close to home my name is Naimah and

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
it's close to home my name is Naimah and
I<00:01:19.470> had<00:01:20.250> too<00:01:20.460> many<00:01:20.549> good<00:01:20.759> friends<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.270> boy

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
I had too many good friends can you boy

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.270 
I had too many good friends can you boy
so<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> decided<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.500> move<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:22.830> my<00:01:22.920> masters

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so I decided to move for my masters

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.399 
so I decided to move for my masters
which<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.640> now<00:01:23.790> looks<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.090> I'll<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.450> doing<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
which it now looks like I'll be doing I

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
which it now looks like I'll be doing I
think<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.100> time<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.700> liked<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
think at the time I really liked the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.429 
think at the time I really liked the
fact<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.420> there's<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> microbiology

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
fact that there's a microbiology

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.280 
fact that there's a microbiology
specific<00:01:28.890> program<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:30.689> f/w<00:01:30.869> didn't<00:01:31.200> have

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
specific program and the f/w didn't have

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:41.499 
specific program and the f/w didn't have
that<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.590> time<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.460> was<00:01:33.390> more

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.109 

and<00:01:42.509> Oxford<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> plan<00:01:43.289> is<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.610> lot<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and Oxford the plan is to do a lot of

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.359 
and Oxford the plan is to do a lot of
work<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.420> mathematical<00:01:45.960> modeling<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.590> biology

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
work on mathematical modeling of biology

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.639 
work on mathematical modeling of biology
and<00:01:47.640> maybe<00:01:48.360> there<00:01:48.570> perhaps<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.960> ecology<00:01:49.469> I

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and maybe there perhaps in ecology I

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.469 
and maybe there perhaps in ecology I
have<00:01:50.219> to<00:01:50.310> pick<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.460> supervisor<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.179> that's<00:01:51.329> yet

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
have to pick a supervisor so that's yet

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.510 
have to pick a supervisor so that's yet
to<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.630> decided<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.829> something<00:01:53.250> involving

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to be decided but something involving

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.830 
to be decided but something involving
mathematical<00:01:54.060> modeling<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.539> biological
