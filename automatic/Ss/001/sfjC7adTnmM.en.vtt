00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.250 
that that then that demo came out
because<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.580> think<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.300> saw<00:02:19.480> like<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> video<00:02:20.110> or

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
because I think I saw like on a video or

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260 
because I think I saw like on a video or
something<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:20.980> was<00:02:21.160> talking<00:02:21.459> about<00:02:21.520> like

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
something that I was talking about like

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.420 
something that I was talking about like
the<00:02:22.680> release<00:02:23.680> date<00:02:23.860> for<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.069> Arkham<00:02:24.310> City

actual<00:02:27.040> game<00:02:27.280> came<00:02:27.730> out<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:27.970> do<00:02:28.060> think<00:02:28.330> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
actual game came out and I do think the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.270 
actual game came out and I do think the
actual<00:02:28.810> game<00:02:28.840> came<00:02:29.200> out<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.560> around<00:02:29.770> like

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280
