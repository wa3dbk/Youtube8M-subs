00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
the only thing that makes it different

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.310 
the only thing that makes it different
from<00:03:26.460> its<00:03:26.760> higher<00:03:26.940> capacity<00:03:27.510> brothers<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:27.990> the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
that it does exactly the same thing so
