she's a little rusty underneath but it's

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.330 
she's a little rusty underneath but it's
not<00:05:17.870> like<00:05:18.050> go<00:05:18.200> and<00:05:18.410> tear<00:05:18.620> your<00:05:18.770> arrest<00:05:19.070> it's

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
not like go and tear your arrest it's

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.480 
not like go and tear your arrest it's

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
but I guess it's cuz they don't use salt

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.670 
but I guess it's cuz they don't use salt
on<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.250> roads<00:05:25.490> up<00:05:25.670> here<00:05:26.380> anyway<00:05:27.380> they<00:05:27.530> don't
