00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Education There is room for the news today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.400
 only in other modine leads because there was 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.010
 it now by the latest patch, so to speak 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.870
 a graphics downgrade then it's about 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.019
 the load on filming soon again 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.030
 environmentalists 3 and also to cheeky 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.250
 four could be a new part 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.690
 or what about driver and four 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.220
 there are new rumors in the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.340
 internet that right now within the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.340
 news 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.320
 yes, life is not a pony farm and we 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.320
 currently not only waiting for half-life 3 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.239
 but also on a fallout 4 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.579
 maybe because as I said no big 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.780
 Information on this and currently there 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.160
 actually only rumors and me 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.469
 actually do not comment on that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.149
 but ok because many asked 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.800
 make something overwhelmed 4 and 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.500
 Now I'm doing something about fallout 4 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.149
 and there are rumors on the internet 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.370
 to that there is probably a dispute between 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.379
 bethesda and interplay are both 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.680
 probably own the trademark rights of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.290
 cheek or from the fallout row and 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.790
 but have different 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.140
 Ideas like the game then 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.460
 will ultimately look like 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.689
 bethesda would like a mmo rpg 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.810
 from fort four , for example, do 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.009
 how much that short online and interplay 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 I agree with that 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.759
 blocks all development and 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.340
 would like to break off cheeky four 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.659
 Of course that is a bit stupid and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.040
 of course you can now decide what 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.689
 is there really in my opinion 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.610
 is there not really much to it 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.549
 I also believe that the right of the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.810
 fallout series already included 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.759
 bethesda lie 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.079
 but if i go about it uhr skin 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.220
 like to be below the videos in the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.259
 comments and I'm curious if 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.880
 in the next time there really tangible 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.439
 information to come so i would 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.340
 definitely the fans and me 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.560
 course can 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.210
 I can not quite help but 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.460
 somehow i feel like that 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.049
 developer techland and publisher warner 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.299
 bros momentary life so a bit 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.210
 make yourself difficult 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.409
 ubisoft because there is a new one now 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.890
 patch he already came across yesterday 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.420
 spoken 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.490
 He takes, among other things, the annoying 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.899
 performance problems as well 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.329
 But now he also stops that 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.360
 Change front of files and databases 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.580
 Of course for protection because China is 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.110
 to have a heavier shuffle in the game 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.670
 Of course, they have it now 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.569
 accordingly , something also became 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.400
 severe 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.019
 and that's a bit hard now 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.880
 to understand for me why the one 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.849
 modern as in the butt occurs 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.160
 and that they cross over 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.989
 In addition, there is now the mcl 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.879
 complaints in the internet against 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.200
 various mods to your regret 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.829
 due to trademark infringement 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.310
 based on the us law digital 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.230
 millennium copyright act that means many 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.049
 mods from limelight were now from 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.000
 various download portals removed one 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.590
 official statement by techland 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.450
 or warner bros are currently still available 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.060
 not but i do not understand why you 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.859
 the players and just being modern 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.799
 play the run even longer keep the 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.470
 so no need to kick in the butt 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.639
 idea 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.170
 and where we are at techland warner 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.150
 Bros and a dress are still here 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.920
 to the patch from yesterday back to the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.430
 should be some performance problem 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.989
 accept 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.880
 that's exactly what the patch did 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.650
 However, not necessarily now 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.900
 the program code or so optimized 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.040
 but you just thought okay okay 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.359
 believe the graphics a little bit down 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.900
 then the game will definitely work 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.790
 better 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.829
 That should definitely be refined 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.880
 I remember, however, complain 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.380
 Of course, many players now 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.380
 Example that the sight only 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.209
 the shadow is still at 50 percent 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.810
 middle distance have been removed 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.440
 and that objects only have less 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.269
 polygons resp 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.239
 in total less polygons have 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.530
 the details of objects just want 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.590
 screwed down so the whole 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.359
 game works better and that is possible 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.410
 you make it if that makes so much sense now 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.960
 I did not know 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.210
 techland 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.070
 so we can for the new zombies of 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.670
 limelight finally cooked again 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.340
 by riva from the witcher or too far 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.930
 hand the third part of the potter-saga 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.480
 and there is new information now 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.280
 not to the recommended or minimal 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.260
 System requirements from the pc are yes 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.760
 already out but how many 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.250
 hard disk storage on the 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.020
 Playstation 4 needs and that is 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.900
 really a lot and indeed 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.450
 at least 50 gigabytes it is completely in 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.540
 order and thus the title competes 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.630
 then, for example, with wolfenstein señora 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.060
 and also with gta 5 would also have about 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.280
 in this direction and below are 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.650
 then, for example, titles like call of duty 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.510
 modern warfare or urges me inclusive 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.180
 they're just over 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.370
 is even more than 40 gb so that he is 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.800
 definitely in things memory needs 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.140
 already quite good with it as it is with the 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.610
 xbox looks like there are of course still 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.380
 no information on how much 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.080
 memory space you will need then 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.180
 it will be about 40 on the pc as well 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.140
 So gb actually be on the ps4 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.740
 again about ten gigabyte more 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:59.470
 Well, at the end of this news format is 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.480
 today so again lars tovar is so 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.610
 the disposal of course to the survival 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.860
 shooter of naughty dog ​​and that is it 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.600
 because now some new information or 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.130
 not much information but if it is 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.630
 new information gives then snap 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.560
 Let's get the course and then report 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.270
 I also like about it 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.710
 and now macy williams 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.660
 this is the aria from game of thrones 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.580
 again commented on this whole topic 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.380
 and emphasizes that they still like the 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.050
 Elly would play and I have 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.000
 now an interesting quote from the 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.790
 senator film is still in the 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.320
 first days so williams i have with 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.080
 influential people talked that 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.430
 helping me lascivious on the legs and me 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.870
 I am hopeful that I will be in the future 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.610
 elli can play 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.310
 but we still have to wait and see 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.100
 So what happens in my opinion 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.260
 So that's really true for me 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.080
 the best occupation for the elly many 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.430
 say yes 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.080
 I would not be that bad either 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.569
 I really think it's meanwhile 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.550
 a little too old for the role 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.740
 well your opinion as always below 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.560
 of the video in the comments and yes that 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.629
 was the last news 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.039
 that was the news today for monday to 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:01.580
 Of course you have a good start to the week 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.229
 week 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.849
 and you see each other at the next one 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.229
 juso finally taken to the 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:13.360
 salad but what are there there are 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.360
 especially player formations
