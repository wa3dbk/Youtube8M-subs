00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
the browser the only difference in the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.640 
the browser the only difference in the
browser<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.420> I've<00:03:52.569> noticed<00:03:52.930> really<00:03:53.410> is<00:03:53.500> the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
browser that I've noticed really is the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.710 
browser that I've noticed really is the
pinch<00:03:53.859> to<00:03:54.010> zoom<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.700> might<00:03:55.000> be<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.180> little<00:03:55.480> bit

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
pinch to zoom it might be a little bit

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.750 
pinch to zoom it might be a little bit
faster<00:03:56.170> pinch-to-zoom<00:03:56.920> doesn't<00:03:57.430> work<00:03:57.549> well

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
faster pinch-to-zoom doesn't work well

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.390 
faster pinch-to-zoom doesn't work well
really<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:58.900> well<00:03:59.140> when<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.889> website<00:04:00.280> is

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
really that well when the website is

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.390 
really that well when the website is
still<00:04:00.639> loading<00:04:00.880> it<00:04:01.810> works<00:04:01.989> okay<00:04:02.380> but<00:04:03.100> it's

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
still loading it works okay but it's

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.550 
still loading it works okay but it's
really<00:04:03.880> not<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.090> great<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.810> works<00:04:05.019> well<00:04:05.290> when

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
really not that great it works well when

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.410 
really not that great it works well when
the<00:04:05.920> website<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.400> loaded<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:06.850> also<00:04:07.180> you'll

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
the website is loaded and also you'll

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.849 
the website is loaded and also you'll
notice<00:04:07.600> two<00:04:07.900> down<00:04:08.079> at<00:04:08.139> the<00:04:08.200> bottom<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.620> still

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
notice two down at the bottom you still

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.979 
notice two down at the bottom you still
have<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.190> zoom<00:04:09.519> in<00:04:09.670> and<00:04:09.819> out<00:04:09.910> buttons<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:10.510> you

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
have the zoom in and out buttons and you

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.750 
have the zoom in and out buttons and you
can<00:04:11.170> also<00:04:11.410> double<00:04:11.890> tap<00:04:12.069> to<00:04:12.099> zoom

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
can also double tap to zoom

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.100 
can also double tap to zoom
so<00:04:13.060> there's<00:04:13.239> three<00:04:13.360> different<00:04:13.480> options<00:04:13.780> not

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
so there's three different options not

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.720 
so there's three different options not
for<00:04:14.290> zooming<00:04:14.590> in<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:14.799> out<00:04:14.920> now<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.610> we're

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
for zooming in and out now that we're

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.729 
for zooming in and out now that we're
loaded<00:04:16.030> here<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.239> can<00:04:16.449> show<00:04:16.479> you<00:04:16.690> but<00:04:17.350> yeah<00:04:17.440> it

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
motorola have learned from this that you

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.320 
motorola have learned from this that you
know<00:05:08.440> announcing<00:05:09.250> that<00:05:09.280> an<00:05:09.520> update<00:05:09.880> is<00:05:10.000> coming

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
out and then pulling it i think they did

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.360 
out and then pulling it i think they did
it<00:05:12.250> twice<00:05:12.690> is<00:05:13.690> not<00:05:14.440> really<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:14.860> best<00:05:15.100> way<00:05:15.220> to

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
it twice is not really the best way to

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.890 
it twice is not really the best way to
go<00:05:15.550> especially<00:05:15.699> when<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.300> comes<00:05:16.389> to<00:05:16.570> android

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
go especially when it comes to android

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.450 
go especially when it comes to android
because<00:05:17.289> we've<00:05:17.470> got<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.620> lot<00:05:17.800> of<00:05:17.830> geeky<00:05:18.280> people

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
because we've got a lot of geeky people

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.969 
because we've got a lot of geeky people
