00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
way these numbers are on an individual

the xbox 360 of course you'd then have

it's nowhere near that 3 million mark
that<00:03:03.329> I<00:03:03.359> just<00:03:03.690> said<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.440> let's<00:03:04.739> go<00:03:04.920> with<00:03:05.099> that

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
that I just said so let's go with that

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.339 
that I just said so let's go with that
as<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.549> high-water<00:03:06.000> mark<00:03:06.389> now<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.900> know<00:03:07.200> I'm

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
as the high-water mark now I know I'm

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.349 
as the high-water mark now I know I'm
gonna<00:03:07.560> lose<00:03:07.889> all<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.549> plebeians<00:03:09.150> that

gonna lose all of you plebeians that

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.240 
gonna lose all of you plebeians that
suck<00:03:09.659> at<00:03:09.810> math<00:03:10.019> but<00:03:10.290> trust<00:03:10.590> me<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.829> did<00:03:11.099> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
suck at math but trust me I did the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.360 
suck at math but trust me I did the
fucking<00:03:11.639> calculations<00:03:12.389> here<00:03:12.720> if<00:03:13.109> 12<00:03:13.889> players

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
fucking calculations here if 12 players

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.839 
fucking calculations here if 12 players
fit<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.359> server<00:03:15.780> which<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.680> 636<00:03:17.280> server

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
fit in one server which is a 636 server

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.970 
fit in one server which is a 636 server
now<00:03:18.389> I<00:03:18.419> know<00:03:18.720> there<00:03:18.930> are<00:03:18.989> ground<00:03:19.319> more<00:03:19.500> servers

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
now I know there are ground more servers

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.680 
now I know there are ground more servers
that<00:03:20.129> have<00:03:20.220> 18<00:03:20.699> players<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:21.299> there's<00:03:21.510> also

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
that have 18 players but there's also

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.629 
that have 18 players but there's also
free<00:03:22.379> for<00:03:22.590> all<00:03:22.709> servers<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.280> have<00:03:23.400> eight

free for all servers that have eight

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.550 
free for all servers that have eight
players<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.359> multi<00:03:24.660> team<00:03:24.900> servers<00:03:25.319> that<00:03:25.440> have

players and multi team servers that have
nine<00:03:25.799> players<00:03:25.829> so<00:03:26.760> let's<00:03:27.090> average<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:28.470> out

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
nine players so let's average this out

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.490 
nine players so let's average this out
to<00:03:29.040> 12<00:03:29.489> players<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.660> would<00:03:30.870> mean<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.079> call

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
to 12 players that would mean that call

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.629 
to 12 players that would mean that call
of<00:03:31.650> duty<00:03:31.949> would<00:03:32.340> need<00:03:33.889> 250,000<00:03:34.889> servers<00:03:35.370> in

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
of duty would need 250,000 servers in

of duty would need 250,000 servers in
order<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.209> support<00:03:36.629> that<00:03:36.720> three<00:03:37.290> million

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
order to support that three million

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.390 
order to support that three million
player<00:03:38.069> base<00:03:38.370> if<00:03:38.609> you<00:03:39.150> multiply<00:03:40.220> 250,000<00:03:41.220> by

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
player base if you multiply 250,000 by

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.670 
player base if you multiply 250,000 by
the<00:03:41.459> twenty<00:03:42.030> dollars<00:03:42.359> per<00:03:42.599> server<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.470> get

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
the twenty dollars per server you get

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.670 
the twenty dollars per server you get
five<00:03:44.099> million<00:03:44.790> dollars<00:03:45.480> per<00:03:45.840> month<00:03:46.049> in<00:03:46.290> server

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
five million dollars per month in server

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.849 
five million dollars per month in server
costs<00:03:47.310> multiply<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.150> by<00:03:48.540> twelve<00:03:48.900> months<00:03:49.709> and

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
costs multiply that by twelve months and

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.580 
costs multiply that by twelve months and
you<00:03:50.010> get<00:03:50.160> 60<00:03:50.760> million<00:03:50.970> dollars<00:03:51.480> for<00:03:51.959> one<00:03:51.989> year

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590
