in forever version 1.1 the first i will

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.050 
in forever version 1.1 the first i will
show<00:00:13.600> you<00:00:13.860> ambient<00:00:14.860> occlusion<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:16.299> we<00:00:16.869> have

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
show you ambient occlusion so we have

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.739 
show you ambient occlusion so we have
seen<00:00:19.060> here<00:00:19.900> with<00:00:20.169> just<00:00:20.560> one<00:00:20.919> light<00:00:21.160> and<00:00:21.749> we

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:22.749 
seen here with just one light and we

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:32.100 
seen here with just one light and we
will<00:00:22.960> at<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:24.179> ambient<00:00:25.179> light<00:00:25.330> now<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.900> we<00:00:32.079> can

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
will at the ambient light now so we can

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.470 
will at the ambient light now so we can
adjust<00:00:32.829> the<00:00:33.520> intensity<00:00:34.030> like<00:00:34.450> in<00:00:34.630> Maya<00:00:36.240> so<00:00:37.240> and

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
adjust the intensity like in Maya so and

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.740 
adjust the intensity like in Maya so and
now<00:00:37.540> we<00:00:37.720> will<00:00:38.110> put<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:39.040> light<00:00:39.910> attribute<00:00:40.150> from

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
now we will put the light attribute from

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.270 
now we will put the light attribute from
furry<00:00:41.020> wall<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.360> turn<00:00:43.690> on<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.770> ambient

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
furry wall and turn on the ambient

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.160 
furry wall and turn on the ambient
occlusion<00:00:47.310> now<00:00:48.310> we<00:00:48.370> have<00:00:48.700> to<00:00:48.880> select<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:49.840> turn

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
occlusion now we have to select and turn

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.780 
occlusion now we have to select and turn
on<00:00:50.470> ambient<00:00:50.980> occlusion<00:00:51.160> also<00:00:51.850> in<00:00:52.150> in<00:00:52.840> the

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
on ambient occlusion also in in the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.490 
on ambient occlusion also in in the
furball<00:00:54.790> just<00:00:55.080> things<00:00:56.080> and<00:00:56.760> now<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:58.660> see<00:00:59.230> the

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
furball just things and now you see the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.310 
furball just things and now you see the
shadows<00:01:00.330> ambient<00:01:01.330> occlusion<00:01:01.510> under<00:01:02.140> the

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
shadows ambient occlusion under the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:11.039 
shadows ambient occlusion under the
objects<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.229> for<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.100> better<00:01:09.479> better<00:01:10.479> tuning

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.359 

you<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.720> adduce<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:59.060> intensity<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
you can adduce the intensity of the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:18.559 
you can adduce the intensity of the
whole<00:02:03.080> ambient<00:02:04.080> occlusion

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.229 

now<00:02:19.569> we<00:02:19.629> can<00:02:19.900> turn<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:20.560> cob<00:02:20.769> reading<00:02:21.239> there

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
now we can turn on the cob reading there

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.920 
now we can turn on the cob reading there
is<00:02:22.360> no<00:02:22.659> necessary<00:02:22.840> some<00:02:23.680> other<00:02:24.629> settings<00:02:25.629> and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
is no necessary some other settings and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.059 
is no necessary some other settings and
now<00:02:26.650> we<00:02:26.709> will<00:02:26.980> see<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.879> colors<00:02:28.690> are<00:02:28.930> breeds<00:02:29.409> so

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
now we will see the colors are breeds so

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.050 
now we will see the colors are breeds so
you<00:02:30.159> can<00:02:30.340> also<00:02:30.610> turn<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:32.069> special<00:02:33.069> color

you can also turn on the special color

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.740 
you can also turn on the special color
pass<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.829> GI<00:02:36.010> settings<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.120> also

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
pass and in the GI settings you can also

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:52.100 
pass and in the GI settings you can also
change<00:02:38.379> many<00:02:38.769> parameters

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.470 

a<00:02:52.550> very<00:02:53.550> nice<00:02:53.790> feature<00:02:55.610> we<00:02:56.610> go<00:02:56.790> back<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
a very nice feature we go back to the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.330 
a very nice feature we go back to the
normal<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.590> when<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.430> when<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.210> select<00:03:00.600> some

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
normal and when you when you select some

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.120 
normal and when you when you select some
hope<00:03:02.340> does<00:03:03.030> also<00:03:03.270> some<00:03:03.690> some<00:03:04.470> global

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
hope does also some some global

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.470 
hope does also some some global
adjustment<00:03:06.030> for<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.270> whole<00:03:06.770> color<00:03:07.770> bleeding

the last feature in the football 1.1 is

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.860 
the last feature in the football 1.1 is
the<00:04:13.390> depth<00:04:14.349> of<00:04:14.470> field<00:04:14.939> so<00:04:15.939> just<00:04:16.180> turn<00:04:16.449> it<00:04:16.660> on

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
the depth of field so just turn it on

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.760 
the depth of field so just turn it on
and<00:04:20.010> now<00:04:21.010> you<00:04:21.070> can<00:04:21.459> you<00:04:21.639> can<00:04:21.820> use<00:04:22.030> our<00:04:22.780> utility

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
and now you can you can use our utility

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.350 
and now you can you can use our utility
focus<00:04:24.760> on<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.060> selected<00:04:25.449> object<00:04:25.600> and<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:28.090> will

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
focus on the selected object and it will

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.129 
focus on the selected object and it will
create<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.440> locator<00:04:30.130> in<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.729> scene<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:32.080> you

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
create a locator in the scene and you

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.990 
create a locator in the scene and you
can<00:04:32.500> also<00:04:32.770> move<00:04:33.760> this<00:04:34.060> locator<00:04:35.820> through<00:04:36.820> the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
can also move this locator through the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.060 
can also move this locator through the
scene<00:04:37.270> in<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.660> real<00:04:37.810> time<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.440> you<00:04:38.650> will<00:04:38.800> see

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
scene in the real time and you will see

00:04:39.070 --> 00:05:07.180 
scene in the real time and you will see
the<00:04:39.510> behavior<00:04:40.510> of<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:41.199> lenses

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.590 

so<00:05:08.030> we<00:05:08.150> can<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.420> course<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:09.080> change<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:10.600> focal

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
so we can of course to change the focal

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.950 
so we can of course to change the focal
length<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.320> stop<00:05:13.100> and<00:05:13.430> many<00:05:13.850> other<00:05:14.030> parameter

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
length and stop and many other parameter

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.510 
length and stop and many other parameter
likes<00:05:15.380> in<00:05:15.910> all<00:05:16.910> all<00:05:17.860> renders<00:05:20.890> but<00:05:21.890> the<00:05:22.040> results

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
likes in all all renders but the results

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.020 
likes in all all renders but the results
are<00:05:22.670> in<00:05:23.000> real<00:05:23.270> time<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:26.170> the<00:05:27.370> behavior<00:05:28.370> of<00:05:28.670> the

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
are in real time and the behavior of the

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:36.130 
are in real time and the behavior of the
lungs<00:05:29.240> are<00:05:29.570> very<00:05:29.930> very<00:05:30.260> real<00:05:34.990> it's<00:05:35.990> been

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
lungs are very very real it's been

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.490 
lungs are very very real it's been
adduced<00:05:36.440> also<00:05:37.010> the<00:05:37.280> quality<00:05:37.640> of<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.710> dryer

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
adduced also the quality of the dryer

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.650 
adduced also the quality of the dryer
and<00:05:42.670> put<00:05:43.670> the<00:05:43.940> higher<00:05:44.120> quality<00:05:44.750> and<00:05:46.090> it's<00:05:47.090> much

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
and put the higher quality and it's much

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.920 
and put the higher quality and it's much
more<00:05:47.930> slower<00:05:48.200> of<00:05:48.470> course<00:05:49.000> so<00:05:50.000> thank<00:05:50.300> you<00:05:50.450> for
