00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.380
 Hi, I'm Claudia from 5 on youtube.com 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.510
 this is the first tutorial in which you 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.170
 I will explain the ideal signs for 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.310
 start with your networks 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.260
 first I will present you in business and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.090
 Spanish signs and then on 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.470
 American sign language for the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.080
 who are interested in introducing 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.440
 English in their homes for families that already 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.420
 they use English because there are thousands of 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.480
 signs that I 'm going to show you are mom 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.420
 dad drinks milk 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.340
 eat and drink we start with the signs 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.879
 mom mom is more by putting her hand to a 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.879
 side to side 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.390
 the next one is baby baby 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.740
 We already know that it's like cradling a baby 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.170
 we've seen it in the first video 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.900
 we repeat now baby 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.689
 Milk milk is as if we were 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:23.689
 ordering a milk bench eat eat 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.570
 we all know the gesture of eating is the same 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:32.729
 for language without eating eat 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.450
 and drink as if we had a glass and we 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.450
 we put it in your mouth 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.880
 more the Spanish sign language is with 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.720
 the thumb up 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.170
 and its good more 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.120
 and I have finished that it seems to me a sign 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.510
 very useful for when we start to give 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.510
 pap 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.719
 Sometimes we do not know if they want more 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.180
 they have less 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.030
 finished is finished 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.500
 I have finished eating then it has 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.920
 finished has ended lives 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.380
 or you want more you want more and so we can 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.350
 know if what you want more porridge less 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.290
 papilla wants something else we will be able to 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:27.000
 distinguish better we repeat it more 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.940
 country country country baby country 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.330
