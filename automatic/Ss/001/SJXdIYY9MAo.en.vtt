 I agree with my opinion 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.680
 from the board 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.970

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.030

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.460
 outside contacts for the beam cover 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.650
 open and my reunion in order we are in 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.480
 the summer 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.310
 fortunately the wife of onno also loves 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.230
 cars 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.950
 we once bought a house because there 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.810
 four cars in the basement can 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.130
 well there you buy a house so 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.800
 quite for me 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.030
 disturbed people would say yes but me 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.360
 what do you see above the ground? 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.690
 very ordinary house ordinary ordinary 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.730
 50 modest yes very modest but 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.580
 in possession of an extremely 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.140
 rare and precious amfi card of which 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.720
 there are only a few left in the Netherlands 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.030
 I think a maximum of ten in it 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.640
 are currently in the Netherlands and they are coming 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.810
 slowly back most are to america 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.240
 sold 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.069
 it is actually a german car is one 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.250
 German engineer who designed this 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.080
 he wanted a car that could also sail 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.720
 which of course I suddenly like the water 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.250
 but before everything is ready, everything has to be done 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.530
 are waterproof 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.550
 an extra and you can put the door on you 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.870
 just close because otherwise comes 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.040
 of course because of the rubber that is there 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.020
 behind 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.360
 yes here you need that for a while 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.010
 also pull down or up and must 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.010
 up and it is now watertight 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.209
 I'm ready for it 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.800
 and now the cameraman for a moment 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.750
 that in between is also half the duration 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.080
 ran out 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:54.940
 gas and you know very well 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:04:02.200
 discs very well of the handbrake a no 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.200
 now you can add the water so much fun 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.489
 paper on 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:18.759
 I hope your photos still starts 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:22.030
 we can clinge 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:25.650
 links yes yes like that 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.650
 I can now accelerate the connections 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:36.430
 dream car i'm gonna use you this well me 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.110
 think times or five and six a year you have 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.530
 when you feel about from the canals of 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.750
 Amsterdam 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.449
 yes that is one of the nicest things that 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.580
 you can do that 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.710
 be the only slopes with this car 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.180
 I know are in Amsterdam North 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.979
 So you should Amsterdam-north as the 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.710
 water in but once you get in the 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.809
 forces that is a unique experience 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.289
 people love that too 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:58.520
 to see 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.520
 you get a lot of enthusiastic club 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.379
 where are the the family and your three 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:06.449
 daughter yes well she actually got this 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.229
 super practical cars no longer 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.879
 to make 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.889
 it could be the solution 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.479
 are for the file problem because there is 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.629
 with us all the we somewhere a channel or 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.400
 how keen in the neighborhood but special 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.810
 practical 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.389
 The nice thing he sends is with his 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.879
 front wheels have no rudder and they have gas 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.819
 Well on is yes then we must drag you 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:29.009
 ask someone certain 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.569
 we sink very slowly will come 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.789
 the water inside but has a pump 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.120
 it is coming from 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:38.129
 that costs something from car yes that depends 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.589
 from what you understand him will buy 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.789
 still suffer from rust and there are not 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:44.930
 so much more about it 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.279
 so for a really good you need 50,000 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.289
 euro you have to pay you know it 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:51.540
 actually have a very high position 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.780
 both venus within management have one 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.670
 just a family and we quite modest 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.920
 see in the way you tell where 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.260
 but you have a lot of attention with such 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.770
 car and with basically all cars that 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.800
 you have 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.870
 but why do you like that 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.220
 well I think it's very nice cars myself 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.080
 I like the technology 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.990
 that is really my really my passion one 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.580
 bit my hobby i also like van 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.590
 Originally I worked as an architect 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.360
 engineer and it is nice to have this kind 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.520
 share things with people who 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.520
 spectators 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.520

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.340
 wheels and now you can just steer it 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:40.890
 yes apparently we want to give gas away 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:43.250
 is going to continue to have gas ships 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.250
 well done 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:53.670
 to be totally crazy 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.170
 great anyway really very special about this 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.480
 to be able to do 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.980
 I would really like him this car yes 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.020
 but then you have to be a bit handy 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:09.290
 its to be after such nevertheless you close it anyway 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:09.290
 some waterings double bottom boys 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.680

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.360
 yes that oil has everything damn good 

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:26.189
