 How do you do that for sure? 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.190
 with the heating of the moment is with the device that counts the beats every 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.740
 second 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000

 professional drummers are consistent and impressive 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.820
 in slow motion the precious movements of May that are measured 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.410
 all the action takes place in the center pockets for the time being the drumsticks are 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.430
 moving to the rest of the body is practically stopped another 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.180
 but what happens when mike shinoda 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.050
 all this speed in its customer base 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.280
 rock drummers and acted on the physical limit of humans 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.120
 why not up to 600 calories per hour and ran the risk of suffering from extensions 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.570
 repetitive strain injuries and heart stress have already 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.530
 including pulmonary collapse 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.870
 how do you feel that you can move so fast without understanding the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.999
 control you always hit that hit all the time there 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.900

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.899
 also the belly and the back 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.519

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.889
 Thinking about it, I have to think 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:36.419
 otherwise I can not make the management movements have to know which 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.899
 the parts of my body need to be pressed by the lost control 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:43.680
 I understand it seems like a lot of people end up getting hurt because they support each other. 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:47.359
 smaller muscles to take care of tasks that should be one of the Mayan muscles 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.469

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:03.389
 by talking in your budget for the works as certain aboard the house knew 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.519

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:09.820
 if parked 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.140

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.950
 stay relaxed to get this kind of new to the left if there is year 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.880

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.559
 just out of curiosity your head and your eyes are thinking about how many 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:31.639
 movements in front of the hands when I hit the two highest plates 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.269
 I'm already thinking about getting the details right. 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.619

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.189
 more money 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.449
 enough of the drummer what will happen to a battery 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.439
 I do not have to smile 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.039
