ultimate<00:01:11.790> attack<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.689> how<00:01:12.810> they

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
ultimate attack so that's how they

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.750 
ultimate attack so that's how they
limited<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.470> basically<00:01:14.100> when<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.460> number

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
limited it basically when that number

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.510 
limited it basically when that number
hit<00:01:15.000> three<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.360> four<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:17.100> better<00:01:17.310> make<00:01:17.460> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
hit three or four you better make that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.920 
hit three or four you better make that
tack<00:01:17.790> count<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> lot<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.479> people<00:01:18.570> actually

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
tack count and a lot of people actually

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.179 
tack count and a lot of people actually
did<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.380> was<00:01:19.470> never<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.860> match<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
did like there was never a match to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.560 
did like there was never a match to
start<00:01:20.250> off<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.700> Ultimates<00:01:21.119> left<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.479> right

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
start off with Ultimates left and right

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.030 
start off with Ultimates left and right
and<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.080> never<00:01:22.229> matched<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.619> consisted

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and it was never matched and consisted

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.219 
and it was never matched and consisted
of<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.460> span<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> entire<00:01:24.390> time<00:01:24.659> every

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
of the span like the entire time every

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.840 
of the span like the entire time every
time<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.409> number<00:01:25.770> had<00:01:25.890> three<00:01:26.100> or<00:01:26.189> four<00:01:26.400> then

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
time that number had three or four then

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.130 
time that number had three or four then
you<00:01:26.939> better<00:01:27.060> make<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.330> tack<00:01:27.630> count<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you better make that tack count and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.960 
you better make that tack count and
basically<00:01:28.680> use<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.369> advantage<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
basically use that to your advantage and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.190 
basically use that to your advantage and
I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.420> should<00:01:30.479> bring<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.750> back<00:01:31.020> because

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
I think I should bring that back because

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.510 
I think I should bring that back because
they'll<00:01:31.320> make<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.680> lot<00:01:31.860> more<00:01:31.979> balanced<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
they'll make you a lot more balanced and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.130 
they'll make you a lot more balanced and
feel<00:01:32.729> more<00:01:32.880> epic<00:01:33.240> when<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.689> comes<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> ultimate

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
feel more epic when it comes to ultimate

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.330 
feel more epic when it comes to ultimate
attacks<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.009> guys<00:01:35.100> think<00:01:35.159> about

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
attacks what do you guys think about

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.760 
attacks what do you guys think about
that<00:01:35.549> feel<00:01:36.540> free<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.720> drop<00:01:36.840> me<00:01:36.960> any<00:01:37.409> feedback

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that feel free to drop me any feedback

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
that feel free to drop me any feedback
in<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> comment<00:01:38.729> section<00:01:38.970> below<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.659> far

in the comment section below now as far

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.359 
in the comment section below now as far
as<00:01:39.960> king<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> stamina<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.950> one's<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> bit

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
as king of stamina this one's a bit

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.649 
as king of stamina this one's a bit
different<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:42.000> they<00:01:42.270> should<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.450> very

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
different I think they should be very

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.880 
different I think they should be very
depend<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:42.990> each<00:01:43.079> other's<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> mean<00:01:43.799> by

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
depend on each other's what I mean by

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.530 
depend on each other's what I mean by
that<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.880> now<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> universe<00:01:45.450> you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
that is right now in the universe you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.639 
that is right now in the universe you
can<00:01:45.659> easily<00:01:45.930> make<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.079> character<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.470> has

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
can easily make a character that has

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.679 
can easily make a character that has
eight<00:01:46.920> bars<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.310> key<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:48.030> bottle<00:01:48.329> stamina

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
eight bars of key in a bottle stamina

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.749 
eight bars of key in a bottle stamina
and<00:01:48.869> that's<00:01:49.229> pretty<00:01:49.829> powerful<00:01:50.310> especially

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
and that's pretty powerful especially

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.520 
and that's pretty powerful especially
when<00:01:51.000> compared<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.960> regular<00:01:52.110> characters

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
when compared to the regular characters

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.190 
when compared to the regular characters
especially<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.070> most<00:01:53.250> people<00:01:53.369> online<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
especially and most people online and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.260 
especially and most people online and
based<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.500> how<00:01:55.880> unbalanced<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.909> games<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
based on like how unbalanced the games a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.520 
based on like how unbalanced the games a
lot<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.509> people<00:01:57.659> are<00:01:57.750> forced<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.170> make<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
lot of people are forced to make the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.719 
lot of people are forced to make the
characters<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:58.950> balance<00:01:59.189> as<00:01:59.280> well<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.700> can

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
characters on balance as well so you can

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.999 
characters on balance as well so you can
stand<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.180> stand<00:02:01.049> up<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> fight<00:02:01.439> online<00:02:01.619> and

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
stand up stand up to fight online and

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.639 
stand up stand up to fight online and
they<00:02:02.549> shouldn't<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:02.969> next<00:02:03.119> time<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:04.259> for

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
they shouldn't do that next time so for

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.899 
they shouldn't do that next time so for
example<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:04.979> can't<00:02:05.219> stand<00:02:05.460> what<00:02:05.520> they<00:02:05.729> should

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
example we can't stand what they should

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.010 
example we can't stand what they should
do<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.149> edition<00:02:06.450> Mako<00:02:06.600> depend<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:06.990> each

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
do is this edition Mako depend on each

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.690 
do is this edition Mako depend on each
other<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.920> put<00:02:08.069> points<00:02:08.310> into<00:02:08.459> one

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
other so if you put points into one

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.130 
other so if you put points into one
thing<00:02:08.729> then<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.539> takes<00:02:09.660> all<00:02:09.810> your<00:02:09.840> massive

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
thing then it takes all your massive

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.360 
thing then it takes all your massive
potential<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.770> other<00:02:10.890> things<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.250> for

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
potential for the other things so for

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.830 
potential for the other things so for
example<00:02:11.459> if<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.910> want<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> stammer

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
example if you want to be a stammer

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.820 
example if you want to be a stammer
based<00:02:13.110> character

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
based character

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.560 
based character
max<00:02:14.040> could<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.640> bar<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.030> stamina<00:02:15.450> and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
max could be like a bar the stamina and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.270 
max could be like a bar the stamina and
four<00:02:15.990> bars<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.260> key<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.860> wanna<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.130> key

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
four bars of key if you wanna be a key

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.070 
four bars of key if you wanna be a key
base<00:02:17.400> character<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:18.150> your<00:02:18.210> max<00:02:18.480> will<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:18.840> eight

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
base character in your max will be eight

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.840 
base character in your max will be eight
bars<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.500> key<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:20.250> BOTS<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.520> standards

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
bars of key and for BOTS of standards

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.220 
bars of key and for BOTS of standards
essentially<00:02:21.300> everything<00:02:21.480> put<00:02:21.750> points<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.080> one

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
essentially everything put points in one

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.810 
essentially everything put points in one
thing<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.680> takes<00:02:23.010> for<00:02:23.160> your<00:02:23.220> max<00:02:23.430> potential

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
thing it takes for your max potential

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.130 
thing it takes for your max potential
for<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:23.970> other<00:02:24.090> thing<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.900> actually

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
for the other thing and now you actually

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.230 
for the other thing and now you actually

not both doing both is very old powered
I<00:02:31.740> mean<00:02:31.890> it's<00:02:31.980> great<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.730> powerful

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060

nine but let's be real here it's just

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.470 
nine but let's be real here it's just
it's<00:02:35.370> unfair<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.850> balance<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.360> then

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
it's unfair and balance and then

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.970 
it's unfair and balance and then
everybody<00:02:36.870> kind<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.110> play<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.410> way<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> keep

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
everybody kind of play that way to keep

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.260 
everybody kind of play that way to keep
up<00:02:38.100> online<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.400> they<00:02:38.610> shouldn't<00:02:38.880> definitely

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
up online and they shouldn't definitely

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.090 
up online and they shouldn't definitely
not<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.630> next<00:02:39.750> time<00:02:39.930> around<00:02:40.080> balance<00:02:40.950> it

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
not do that next time around balance it

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.740

either your stamina base or your key
base<00:02:42.930> came<00:02:43.410> both<00:02:43.620> if<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.980> do<00:02:44.070> both<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.430> know<00:02:44.550> a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
base came both if you do both you know a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.760 
base came both if you do both you know a
six<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.210> six<00:02:45.420> which<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.600> still<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:46.050> pretty<00:02:46.530> good

more feedback videos over the next
couple<00:02:55.080> months<00:02:55.230> because<00:02:55.470> again<00:02:55.680> Xena<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.070> too

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
ultimate should be limited so uh you

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.250 
ultimate should be limited so uh you
can't<00:03:15.060> do<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.240> thousand<00:03:15.810> ultimate<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:16.200> the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
can't do a thousand ultimate in the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.140 
can't do a thousand ultimate in the
match<00:03:16.380> when<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:16.920> bar<00:03:17.220> fills<00:03:17.459> up<00:03:17.700> then<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.060> can

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
match when that bar fills up then it can

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.040 
match when that bar fills up then it can
do<00:03:18.239> your<00:03:18.360> ultimate<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.780> make<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.989> really

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
count as far as key and stamina should

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.370 
count as far as key and stamina should
be<00:03:20.970> depend<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.330> each<00:03:21.360> other<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.140> can

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
be depend on each other so you can

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.930
