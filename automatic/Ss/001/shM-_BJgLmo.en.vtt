00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:11.670
 The balloon was with another video for 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.530
 you and I'm here to show you my 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.639
 scenery as I record and these things that 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.630
 the galera has requested there in the comments 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.480
 videos to make a channel of 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.730
 drawing she can try to solve 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.680
 several photos and a video of what not 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.539
 it hits a detour to hell 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.599
 rock video he showed that he can 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.030
 Unleashing the scenery myself 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.430
 I used what I'm using now in using 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.890
 a tripod unlike you in editing 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.870
 you reverse the new camera purchase has 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.090
 other ways you can do too 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.789
 but who developed the last time the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.210
 people already stayed here was to take this tripod 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.100
 that should illuminate areas I undo 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.149
 a lamp in this one had the top part 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.590
 of a tripod is exactly the same as the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.390
 dollar 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.149
 I put here put DESENBAHIA chu 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.150
 there is another problem asking for the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.450
 role that happens because this 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.110
 camera for you to see the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.460
 whole house basically because of it 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.650
 we use a lambda probe it 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.020
 It burned and we do not feel like it. 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.520
 of the cameras and assembling nonsense 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.290
 Ride how do I do it here? 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.000
 focus the lamp down with my 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.000
 role here shot in the foot in front of the store 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.549
 so I do that and start recording 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 Anytime camera software there and there 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:47.670
 makes the recording 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:54.899
 this is not paper do everything in place 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:57.060
 correct is normal now you can see that 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.430
 arrived my ox sba the microphone does not want 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.840
 to know who bought will improve 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.280
 Damn quality where I think you 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.040
 already 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.830
 love very different from that the show 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.340
 keep going, I'll use my eyes on 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.350
 zone keyboard and zone phone 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.150
 so that's it she's here 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.910
 scenery the way we record the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.850
 videos and will change a lot still 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.790
 Then you know the guys who got curious 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.760
 that as we record the videos as 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.900
 that we did to her all this is 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.610
 so we record 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.680
 if you are really curious about your 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.750
 who will bring great reviews for 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.040
 You're right, so do not forget to 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.959
 part of this content has a lot of people 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.630
 Wondering how you can record 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.800
 videos about the role of our you 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.800
 Until the next video I went
