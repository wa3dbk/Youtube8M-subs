00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
meeting but actually say after a few
minutes<00:01:22.259> I've<00:01:22.530> been<00:01:22.579> pleasantly<00:01:23.579> surprised

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
minutes I've been pleasantly surprised

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.029 
minutes I've been pleasantly surprised
this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.869> something<00:01:25.170> quite<00:01:25.409> different<00:01:25.530> from

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
this is something quite different from

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.100 
this is something quite different from
veteran<00:01:26.520> now<00:01:27.299> okay<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.659> doesn't<00:01:27.899> have<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
veteran now okay it doesn't have the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.380 
veteran now okay it doesn't have the
performance<00:01:28.649> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.070> Subaru<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> does

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
performance of the Subaru but it does

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.060 
performance of the Subaru but it does
have<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> very<00:01:30.840> sporty<00:01:31.350> feel<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.950> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
have a very sporty feel to it and that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
have a very sporty feel to it and that
much<00:01:32.399> stiffer<00:01:32.789> chassis<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.420> something<00:01:33.810> that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
much stiffer chassis it's something that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.779 
much stiffer chassis it's something that
voxel<00:01:34.350> has<00:01:34.439> really<00:01:34.710> been<00:01:34.829> working<00:01:35.039> on<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
voxel has really been working on and

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.700 
voxel has really been working on and
stiffen<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.930> made<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.439> lot<00:01:37.649> more

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
stiffen it up and made it a lot more

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.120 
stiffen it up and made it a lot more
responsive<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.579> sporty<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.570> works

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
responsive and sporty and it works

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.080 
responsive and sporty and it works
certainly<00:01:41.130> we've<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> much<00:01:41.850> better

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
certainly we've got a much better

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.109 
certainly we've got a much better
handling<00:01:42.630> car<00:01:43.070> now<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.130> keep<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> road

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.430 

I'm<00:02:50.240> actually<00:02:50.450> more<00:02:50.750> impressed<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.290> the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
I'm actually more impressed with the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.110 
I'm actually more impressed with the
Vectra<00:02:51.800> than<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.100> thought<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> might<00:02:52.700> be<00:02:52.880> and

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
Vectra than I thought I might be and

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.850 
Vectra than I thought I might be and
though<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.660> can't<00:02:53.930> compete<00:02:54.320> with<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.680> Subaru

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
though it can't compete with the Subaru

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.920 
though it can't compete with the Subaru
for<00:02:55.280> performance<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:56.150> certainly<00:02:56.690> has<00:02:56.900> a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
for performance it certainly has a

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.260 
for performance it certainly has a
sporty<00:02:57.470> feel<00:02:57.710> to<00:02:57.740> it<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.160> it's<00:02:58.520> looks<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:59.030> think

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
sporty feel to it and it's looks I think

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.880 
sporty feel to it and it's looks I think
will<00:02:59.360> appeal<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.810> more<00:02:59.990> people<00:03:00.050> than<00:03:00.740> the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
will appeal to more people than the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.320 
will appeal to more people than the
Subarus<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.670> more<00:03:01.820> I<00:03:01.850> look<00:03:02.120> at<00:03:02.210> the

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
Subarus and the more I look at the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.140 
Subarus and the more I look at the
Subaru<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:03.140> pretty<00:03:03.530> ugly<00:03:03.760> but<00:03:04.760> what<00:03:04.940> isn't

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
Subaru it's pretty ugly but what isn't

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.330 
Subaru it's pretty ugly but what isn't
ugly<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.840> price<00:03:06.080> of<00:03:06.110> both<00:03:06.410> cars<00:03:06.770> both

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
ugly is the price of both cars both

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.750
