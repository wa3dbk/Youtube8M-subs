her all the time and she won't forget
her<00:02:11.290> medications<00:02:11.830> anymore<00:02:12.070> I<00:02:12.460> looked<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.780> tried

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
her medications anymore I looked I tried

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.800 
her medications anymore I looked I tried
all<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.220> major<00:02:15.400> manufacturers<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.510> could

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
all of the major manufacturers and could

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.150 
all of the major manufacturers and could
never<00:02:16.960> find<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.290> watch<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.650> had<00:02:17.770> more<00:02:17.950> than<00:02:18.010> a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
never find a watch that had more than a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
never find a watch that had more than a
couple<00:02:18.430> alarms<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:20.790> started<00:02:21.790> thinking<00:02:21.910> this

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
couple alarms so I started thinking this

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.090 
couple alarms so I started thinking this
is<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.840> problem<00:02:23.260> for<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.470> lot<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.650> people

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
is this is a problem for a lot of people

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.660 
is this is a problem for a lot of people
I'm<00:02:24.220> sure<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:25.240> did<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.110> survey<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:27.040> found

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
I'm sure and I did a survey and found

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.850 
I'm sure and I did a survey and found
out<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.450> was<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.320> most<00:02:29.470> common

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
out that it was and that the most common

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.530 
out that it was and that the most common
reason<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.340> people<00:02:30.760> didn't<00:02:31.180> take<00:02:31.330> their

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
reason that people didn't take their

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.180 
reason that people didn't take their
medications<00:02:32.080> as<00:02:32.230> prescribed<00:02:32.710> was<00:02:32.890> because

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
medications as prescribed was because

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.510 
medications as prescribed was because
they<00:02:33.370> simply<00:02:33.910> forgot<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.710> began<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.190> develop

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
they simply forgot so I began to develop

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.500 
they simply forgot so I began to develop
this<00:02:36.880> idea<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:38.320> watch<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:39.400> would<00:02:39.580> have<00:02:39.790> ten

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
this idea of a watch that would have ten

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.130 
this idea of a watch that would have ten
or<00:02:40.660> twelve<00:02:40.900> alarms<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.840> eventually<00:02:43.840> develop

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
or twelve alarms and eventually develop

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.630 
or twelve alarms and eventually develop
the<00:02:44.200> idea<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.620> would<00:02:44.740> also<00:02:44.860> tell<00:02:45.250> them<00:02:45.400> what

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
the idea that would also tell them what

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.580 
the idea that would also tell them what
to<00:02:45.820> take<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:48.010> about<00:02:48.520> 1999<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:49.930> went<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.440> Hong

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
to take and in about 1999 I went to Hong

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.310 
to take and in about 1999 I went to Hong
Kong<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.220> found<00:02:51.460> a<00:02:51.610> manufacturer<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.630> gave

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.840 
think is very important when the watch
