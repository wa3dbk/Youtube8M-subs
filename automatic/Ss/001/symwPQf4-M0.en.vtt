00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
so I did have to invent some characters

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.340 
so I did have to invent some characters
just<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:42.170> kill<00:01:42.409> them<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:43.509> in<00:01:44.509> a<00:01:44.689> way<00:01:44.869> that<00:01:45.109> has

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
just to kill them and in a way that has

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.649 
just to kill them and in a way that has
this<00:01:45.530> sort<00:01:45.770> of<00:01:45.920> horror<00:01:46.399> movie<00:01:46.880> it's<00:01:47.090> very<00:01:47.359> much

this sort of horror movie it's very much

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.109 
this sort of horror movie it's very much
like<00:01:47.929> a<00:01:48.439> slasher<00:01:49.280> film<00:01:49.520> where<00:01:49.819> you<00:01:49.850> meet

that<00:05:14.289> women<00:05:15.010> can<00:05:15.370> be<00:05:15.520> funny<00:05:15.699> you<00:05:16.479> know<00:05:17.010> Wow<00:05:18.180> and

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
that women can be funny you know Wow and

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.920 
that women can be funny you know Wow and
so<00:05:20.139> I<00:05:20.500> it's<00:05:21.250> something<00:05:21.460> I<00:05:21.850> think<00:05:21.880> Gossip<00:05:22.720> Girl

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
so I it's something I think Gossip Girl

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.879 
so I it's something I think Gossip Girl
is<00:05:23.050> part<00:05:23.380> of<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:24.570> but<00:05:25.570> it's<00:05:25.870> it's<00:05:26.200> not<00:05:26.500> really

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
is part of that but it's it's not really

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.620 
is part of that but it's it's not really
a<00:05:26.919> trend<00:05:27.430> I<00:05:27.639> think<00:05:27.820> it's<00:05:27.910> been<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.120> core<00:05:28.389> sort<00:05:28.570> of

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
a trend I think it's been a core sort of

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.219 
a trend I think it's been a core sort of
gradual<00:05:29.229> process<00:05:29.919> and<00:05:30.539> you<00:05:31.539> know<00:05:31.690> like<00:05:31.960> any

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
gradual process and you know like any

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.060 
gradual process and you know like any
kind<00:05:32.680> of<00:05:33.330> trends<00:05:34.330> or<00:05:34.510> gonna<00:05:34.750> waves<00:05:35.139> in<00:05:35.590> culture

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
kind of trends or gonna waves in culture

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.430 
kind of trends or gonna waves in culture
like<00:05:36.340> it<00:05:36.520> will<00:05:36.669> probably<00:05:36.880> it'll<00:05:37.750> go<00:05:37.900> back<00:05:38.110> then

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440
