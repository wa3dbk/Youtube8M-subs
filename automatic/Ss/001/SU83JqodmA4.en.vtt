00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
and then he won't have time to react

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.469 
and then he won't have time to react
against<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.409> move<00:01:25.619> because<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.880> flick<00:01:27.299> the

standing taco he won't be able to take
the<00:01:33.030> ball<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.020> ball<00:01:34.049> will<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.130> air

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the ball and the ball will be in the air

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.149 
the ball and the ball will be in the air
this<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> great<00:01:36.810> way<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.049> fool<00:01:37.560> defender

this is a great way to fool defender

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.789 
this is a great way to fool defender
while<00:01:38.430> he's<00:01:38.700> making<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:39.270> taco<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.900> then<00:01:40.439> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
while he's making a taco and then you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.429 
while he's making a taco and then you
have<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> opportunity<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.659> score<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.229> you're

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
have the opportunity to score if you're

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.710 
have the opportunity to score if you're
in<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.799> good<00:01:44.009> position<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> current

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
in a good position like the current

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.990 
in a good position like the current
example<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.380> Benzema<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.369> skill<00:01:47.640> move<00:01:47.820> is

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
example of Benzema the skill move is

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.240 
example of Benzema the skill move is
also<00:01:48.479> great<00:01:48.780> way<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.229> cause<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> penalty<00:01:50.100> kick

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
