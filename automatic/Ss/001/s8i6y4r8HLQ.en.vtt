00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
first time that was my fault because I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.289 
first time that was my fault because I
had<00:01:10.080> failed<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> charged<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.040> properly<00:01:11.460> they

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
had failed to charged it properly they

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.320 
had failed to charged it properly they
this<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.020> our<00:01:13.350> first<00:01:13.830> experience<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.700> there

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
this is our first experience up there

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.550 
this is our first experience up there
I<00:01:15.360> only<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.740> course<00:01:17.750> was<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.930> very<00:01:19.200> steady<00:01:19.409> I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
I only of course was not very steady I

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.320 
I only of course was not very steady I
was<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> guy<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.580> video<00:01:20.850> camera<00:01:21.210> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
was the guy with the video camera so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.230 
was the guy with the video camera so
it's<00:01:21.420> very<00:01:21.570> shaky<00:01:22.670> but<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> important<00:01:24.210> thing

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
it's very shaky but the important thing

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.320 
it's very shaky but the important thing
to<00:01:24.450> understand<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.729> 90%<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.000> saw

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
to understand is that 90% of what we saw

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
to understand is that 90% of what we saw
we<00:01:27.869> were<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.170> able<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.439> videotape<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.490> just

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
we were not able to videotape it just

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.179 
we were not able to videotape it just
wouldn't<00:01:30.000> show<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> video<00:01:31.070> when<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
wouldn't show up on the video when you

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.550 
wouldn't show up on the video when you
hear<00:01:32.400> us<00:01:32.520> talking<00:01:32.909> about<00:01:33.119> asking<00:01:33.420> them<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.140> do

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
hear us talking about asking them to do

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.429 
hear us talking about asking them to do
certain<00:01:34.860> things<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.900> is<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.259> we

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
certain things that is because we

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.670 
certain things that is because we
discovered<00:01:38.070> during<00:01:38.579> our<00:01:38.700> long<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.540> long<00:01:39.720> time

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
discovered during our long the long time

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.640 
discovered during our long the long time
that<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:40.979> process<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.549> viewing<00:01:41.700> them

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
that the process of viewing them

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.500 
that the process of viewing them
when<00:01:42.890> we<00:01:43.040> would<00:01:43.220> collectively<00:01:43.700> would<00:01:44.150> wish

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
when we would collectively would wish

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.280 
when we would collectively would wish
for<00:01:44.720> them<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:44.990> form<00:01:45.260> a<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:47.090> know<00:01:47.210> an<00:01:47.420> octagon

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
for them to form a you know an octagon

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.750

or something they would actually form
shapes<00:01:50.150> and<00:01:50.650> sometimes<00:01:51.650> they<00:01:51.800> would<00:01:51.950> all<00:01:52.130> come

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
shapes and sometimes they would all come

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.460 
shapes and sometimes they would all come
together<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.850> get<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:53.210> bright<00:01:53.480> they<00:01:53.690> were<00:01:53.810> you

thing<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.340> learning<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.850> figuring<00:02:14.570> out<00:02:14.630> how<00:02:14.810> to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
thing of learning it figuring out how to

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.270 
thing of learning it figuring out how to
dub<00:02:15.080> music<00:02:15.440> in<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.770> everything's<00:02:16.040> kind<00:02:16.190> of

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
dub music in and everything's kind of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.790 
dub music in and everything's kind of
fun<00:02:16.490> but<00:02:17.240> eventually<00:02:17.840> I'll<00:02:18.110> be<00:02:18.140> able<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.560> pull

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
fun but eventually I'll be able to pull

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.790 
fun but eventually I'll be able to pull
that<00:02:18.980> video<00:02:19.370> off<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:20.090> want<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.930> copy<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.650> it's

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
that video off I want to copy it it's

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.380 
that video off I want to copy it it's
got<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.130> many<00:02:22.220> views<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.610> really<00:02:22.880> don't<00:02:23.060> wanted

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
got so many views I really don't wanted

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.590 
got so many views I really don't wanted
to<00:02:23.680> pull<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.800> off<00:02:24.920> but<00:02:25.030> it's<00:02:26.030> essentially<00:02:26.420> the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
to pull it off but it's essentially the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.940 
to pull it off but it's essentially the
same<00:02:26.780> type<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.080> thing<00:02:27.320> as<00:02:27.500> you've<00:02:27.709> seen<00:02:27.890> here

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
same type of thing as you've seen here

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.360 
same type of thing as you've seen here
it's<00:02:28.520> just<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:30.080> think<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.530> was<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.800> afford<00:02:31.250> this

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
it's just I think it was to afford this

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.180 
it's just I think it was to afford this
one<00:02:31.610> but<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.420> same<00:02:32.600> event<00:02:33.020> so<00:02:33.500> I'll<00:02:33.890> get<00:02:34.100> it

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
one but the same event so I'll get it

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.949 
one but the same event so I'll get it
out<00:02:34.310> but<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:34.850> want<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.180> put<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.420> one<00:02:35.600> up<00:02:35.780> and

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
out but I want to put this one up and

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.920 
out but I want to put this one up and

I<00:02:47.120> have<00:02:47.840> nothing<00:02:48.050> interesting<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.650> close<00:02:48.920> out

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
I have nothing interesting to close out

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:59.260 
I have nothing interesting to close out
this<00:02:49.280> segment<00:02:49.959> stay<00:02:50.959> safe

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.510 

now<00:02:59.840> let's<00:03:00.080> just<00:03:00.260> see<00:03:00.440> if<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.650> turns<00:03:00.920> into<00:03:01.130> the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
now let's just see if it turns into the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.680 
now let's just see if it turns into the
basket<00:03:02.420> there's<00:03:02.630> I'll<00:03:02.720> ask<00:03:03.050> it<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.440> divide

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
basket there's I'll ask it to divide

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.560 
basket there's I'll ask it to divide
don't<00:03:05.690> shake<00:03:05.870> my<00:03:06.020> chair

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
don't shake my chair

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.250 
don't shake my chair
let's<00:03:08.570> see<00:03:08.720> if<00:03:08.780> it'll<00:03:08.930> divide<00:03:10.540> guys<00:03:11.540> just<00:03:12.020> ask

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
let's see if it'll divide guys just ask

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.150 
let's see if it'll divide guys just ask
in<00:03:12.500> your<00:03:12.530> mind<00:03:12.830> son<00:03:15.910> there<00:03:16.910> we<00:03:17.000> go

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
in your mind son there we go

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.830 
in your mind son there we go
basket<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.280> divide<00:03:19.520> again<00:03:19.790> more<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.330> want<00:03:20.690> light

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
basket to divide again more I want light

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.890 
basket to divide again more I want light
like<00:03:21.020> 5<00:03:21.320> or<00:03:21.350> 12<00:03:21.830> like<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.070> did<00:03:22.340> see<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:22.820> dividing

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.730 

there<00:03:26.900> we<00:03:26.990> go<00:03:29.290> how<00:03:30.290> do<00:03:30.350> you<00:03:30.410> see<00:03:30.560> what<00:03:30.680> I'm

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
there we go how do you see what I'm

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.620 
there we go how do you see what I'm
seeing

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.570 

keep<00:03:35.630> define<00:03:35.990> keep<00:03:36.410> dividing<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.920> lot<00:03:37.160> more<00:03:37.400> and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
keep define keep dividing a lot more and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.140 
keep define keep dividing a lot more and
get<00:03:37.700> it<00:03:37.790> brighter

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
get it brighter

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.350 
get it brighter
will<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.690> get<00:03:38.900> brighter<00:03:39.140> you<00:03:39.320> guys<00:03:40.360> it's

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
will it get brighter you guys it's

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.410 
will it get brighter you guys it's
important<00:03:41.870> because<00:03:42.020> it's<00:03:42.290> recording<00:03:42.740> them<00:03:42.890> I

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.710 

don't<00:03:47.420> want<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:47.630> zoom<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:47.960> too<00:03:48.110> much<00:03:49.720> it's

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
don't want to zoom in too much it's

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.590 
don't want to zoom in too much it's
weird<00:03:51.020> that's<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:52.120> it's<00:03:53.120> hard<00:03:53.300> to<00:03:53.360> hold<00:03:53.480> it

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
weird that's it it's hard to hold it

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.150 
weird that's it it's hard to hold it
steady<00:03:55.750> guys<00:03:56.750> now<00:03:57.020> have<00:03:57.200> them<00:03:57.380> like<00:03:57.920> come

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
steady guys now have them like come

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.620 
steady guys now have them like come
together<00:03:58.280> or<00:03:58.670> something<00:03:58.910> maker<00:03:59.240> that<00:03:59.450> make

together or something maker that make
that<00:03:59.750> weird<00:04:00.020> octagon<00:04:00.710> thing<00:04:02.680> or<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:04.160> triangle

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
that weird octagon thing or the triangle

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.810 
that weird octagon thing or the triangle
look<00:04:06.740> at<00:04:06.830> them<00:04:06.920> all<00:04:07.040> look<00:04:07.280> at<00:04:07.340> them<00:04:07.430> all<00:04:07.520> now<00:04:07.670> do

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
look at them all look at them all now do

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.060 
look at them all look at them all now do
you<00:04:07.910> see<00:04:08.060> it

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
you see it

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.650 
you see it
it<00:04:10.070> is<00:04:10.250> dividing<00:04:10.700> again<00:04:10.820> but<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.180> needs<00:04:11.510> to

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
it is dividing again but it needs to

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:23.260 
it is dividing again but it needs to
form<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:11.960> shape

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.670 

it's<00:04:24.270> kind<00:04:24.510> of<00:04:24.570> clustering<00:04:25.050> man<00:04:25.290> we<00:04:25.500> need<00:04:25.650> a

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
it's kind of clustering man we need a

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.020 
it's kind of clustering man we need a
shape<00:04:25.950> like<00:04:26.190> like<00:04:26.490> something<00:04:26.880> like<00:04:27.000> a

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
shape like like something like a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.680 
shape like like something like a
geometry<00:04:27.420> thing<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:27.960> geometric<00:04:28.530> shape<00:04:29.690> okay

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
geometry thing a geometric shape okay

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:41.450 
geometry thing a geometric shape okay
it's<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.840> fading<00:04:31.170> out<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.710> if<00:04:40.800> I<00:04:40.920> try<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.160> put<00:04:41.370> on

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
it's a fading out and if I try to put on

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.670 
it's a fading out and if I try to put on
night<00:04:41.610> vision<00:04:41.640> a<00:04:41.940> little<00:04:42.180> is<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:43.730> there's<00:04:45.680> just
