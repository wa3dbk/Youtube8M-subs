00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.360
 community 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.360
 ah 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.809
 very good everything goes up here as always 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.910
 with more going to fix the in playing a bit 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.830
 with m16 3 and mimicry 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.750
 transport helicopter but for today 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.430
 I bring you a list of pros and their 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.080
 things that I liked and others that I did not 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.090
 both with regard to the vote beta 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.340
 fix line I have around 12 points 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.900
 if I'm not wrong and obviously have in 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.220
 please note that all this is 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.140
 subject a lot of changes 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.550
 being that this is the first version of 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.550
 the beta that we have and that is missing a lot 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.290
 so that the complete game comes out 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.290
 let's start with the negative points 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.059
 which I have here says too much 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.920
 to battlefield 4 this is something that has 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.660
 complained a lot of people that for the 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.910
 price they ask to bother me a little 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.550
 also that the game is so similar 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.620
 visually to battle 4 let's say but 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.539
 well let's hope they change this let's say 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.890
 make some kind of update and 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.420
 modify it a little so that it does not 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.539
 feel that it is beats end 4 with other 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.129
 point textures in number 2 little time or 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.469
 teamwork it is felt that the 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.539
 game no longer rewards you so much for 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.369
 work with your patrol team 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:10.100
 general with respect to other titles 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.930
 previous of the saga point number 3 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.340
 too juicy 3d icons on the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.259
 screen there is not too much to explain 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.369
 every time I gave less to what I am 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.649
 pointing and I actually see more 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.200
 triangles with colored landmarks that 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.600
 are they are enemy targets or what 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.579
 be on the screen point number four 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.319
 there is no destruction I do not know if they will 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.299
 noticed but can not be destroyed 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.899
 walls to build new roads is not 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.490
 can throw down buildings columns 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.950
 that are supporting something the only thing 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.600
 on this map if I'm not mistaken in addition to 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.009
 obviously the windows is to shoot down 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.770
 the crane that is the effect of evolution 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.030
 after that there is nothing we hope a 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.860
 more time they change this because if not 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.369
 it would be a big step back for the saga 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.619
 with all the number 5 too much chaos and 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.689
 little strategy has noticed that the game 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.360
 it has become more chaotic and less tactical 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.340
 or strategist is simply all 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.439
 they throw head to the target and it comes out 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.689
 whatever comes out, I have not noticed 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.079
 too much like tactical gameplay a 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.030
 team working as a team let's say to 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.310
 reaching a certain goal is something that 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.260
 I noticed in general let's say it may not be 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.470
 the case obviously with arrived in all 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.150
 these points this is my personal opinion 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.190
 point number 6 all weapons for 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.370
 both sides that start from him 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.350
 let's say it's something I did not like for tv3 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.990
 it did not bother me so much because even though 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.450
 each faction let's say in the game each 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.220
 was born in the game started with a gun 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.020
 characteristic of them after more 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.970
 of 4 this was removed and I did not like it 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.580
 for nothing that everyone starts with the aka 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.020
 12 for example, I do not like it 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.690
 I the good guys are the cops 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.390
 start with an ak 12 or an academy 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.360
 sorry or that thieves start with 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.550
 an m16 and 3 for example is something of what 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.140
 which I am completely against but 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.910
 leaving a little aside all they are 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.080
 the negative points of the game let's go to 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.970
 talk about the things that have 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.830
 liked and they have called me quite the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.840
 attention as far as the beta goes for 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.150
 start obviously is the change of 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.730
 thematic of the saga even for this 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.590
 title that is not always us against the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.700
 first army that crosses something that 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.960
 I had already mentioned that I was 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.700
 happening a little bit I was 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.140
 making the truth a bit tedious the truth is 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.700
 that the subject of police against 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.440
 thieves although it does not fit so much in 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.150
 battle in general what the name 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.950
 respect the truth that I liked 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.690
 far more than I thought I will 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.270
 like point number 2 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.160
 are the few explosives that in the game 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.030
 although for now another problem that 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.520
 has bad flip 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.440
 that becomes a festival of explosives 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.510
 more times you end up killing yourself with some 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.250
 kind of rare pomegranate that there is here or 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.110
 over there that instead of someone killing 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.840
 you with your primary or secondary weapon with 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.120
 a little more skill let's say point 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.100
 number 3 the new system of blockages not 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.080
 there's a lot to say there are points earned 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.580
 in this case money and you can buy 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.980
 what you want without having to walk 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.860
 unlocking 20 accessories before not 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.930
 you will never use in your life point 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.850
 number 4 are the new details and 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.440
 new little mechanics let's say that I 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.060
 It has attracted much attention how 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.500
 grab ammo from your mates 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.450
 shoot through the window in vehicles 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.519
 to be able to appear even by 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.709
 windows etcetera etcetera the truth is 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.420
 which are small details that change from 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.790
 great way what is the game in 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.830
 general or the gameplay in general point 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.690
 number 5 the new mechanics for the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.220
 vehicles for those who do not know to 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.019
 visceral games did not like how 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.970
 the vehicles worked in the saga of 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.310
 what feel decided to remove completely 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.200
 the mechanics of the game and create a new 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.340
 the truth that vehicles are handled 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.770
 let's say all that are collisions 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.300
 etcetera in a much better way and 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.979
 the only thing that would be missing would be a button 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.210
 Handbrake is the only thing that a lot 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.240
 people have asked for but 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.460
 that very, very good with that new 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.620
 mechanics for vehicles and the last 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.789
 point that I thought was right 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.620
 add it is that this is a beta of 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.389
 We really have about five months 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.099
 to test the game try it and so 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.960
 try to fix as much of 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.280
 problems you may have before 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.139
 that goes on the market within the 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.030
 about five months and that does not happen 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.410
 same as happened with battlefield 4 but 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.330
 as always I hope you liked it 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.740
 do not forget to leave me your comments 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.229
 down the comments section 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.229
 obviously and see you next time
