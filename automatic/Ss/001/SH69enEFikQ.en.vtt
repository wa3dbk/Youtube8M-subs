00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.289 

it's<00:03:43.440> really<00:03:43.739> not<00:03:44.340> realistic<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:45.000> take

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
it's really not realistic to take

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.559 
it's really not realistic to take
anything<00:03:45.659> bigger<00:03:46.110> like<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.879> D<00:03:48.090> can<00:03:48.390> take

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
anything bigger like the D can take

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.740 
anything bigger like the D can take
while<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.989> got<00:03:49.110> almost<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.620> 400<00:03:50.390> we<00:03:51.390> can't<00:03:51.599> put

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
while I got almost a 400 we can't put

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.270 
while I got almost a 400 we can't put
anything<00:03:51.930> on<00:03:52.080> it<00:03:52.290> though<00:03:52.530> like<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:52.830> mean<00:03:53.250> they

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
anything on it though like I mean they

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.089 
anything on it though like I mean they
would<00:03:53.519> be<00:03:53.640> I've<00:03:54.269> had<00:03:54.980> electronics<00:03:55.980> or

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
would be I've had electronics or

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.190 
would be I've had electronics or
scouting<00:03:56.400> or<00:03:56.670> unique<00:03:57.090> sensors<00:03:57.720> or<00:03:57.930> something

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
scouting or unique sensors or something

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.670 
scouting or unique sensors or something
like<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.459> but<00:03:59.459> like<00:03:59.959> there's<00:04:00.959> no<00:04:01.200> point<00:04:01.500> what

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
like that but like there's no point what

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.509 
like that but like there's no point what
is<00:04:01.799> this<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:02.040> think<00:04:02.099> it's<00:04:02.370> like<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.549> three<00:04:04.430> it's<00:04:05.430> a

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
is this I think it's like a three it's a

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.860 
is this I think it's like a three it's a
390<00:04:06.000> like<00:04:06.239> there's<00:04:06.870> no<00:04:07.519> practicality<00:04:08.519> to<00:04:08.700> that

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
390 like there's no practicality to that

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.319 
390 like there's no practicality to that
30<00:04:09.870> ton<00:04:10.170> engine<00:04:13.430> compared<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.609> 15<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.299> half

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
30 ton engine compared to 15 and a half

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.650 
30 ton engine compared to 15 and a half
like<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.870> did<00:04:16.560> yeah<00:04:16.889> just<00:04:17.269> like<00:04:18.269> it's<00:04:18.449> one<00:04:18.570> of

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
like it did yeah just like it's one of

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.060 
like it did yeah just like it's one of
those<00:04:18.720> like<00:04:18.900> weird<00:04:19.139> rules<00:04:19.410> where<00:04:19.680> if<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.859> mech

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
those like weird rules where if a mech

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.770 
those like weird rules where if a mech
starts<00:04:20.400> out<00:04:20.519> with<00:04:20.669> like<00:04:20.850> set<00:04:21.180> engine<00:04:21.539> then<00:04:21.690> it

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
starts out with like set engine then it

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.080 
starts out with like set engine then it
can<00:04:21.959> go<00:04:22.229> up<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.470> max<00:04:22.710> like<00:04:22.979> it's<00:04:23.190> just<00:04:23.880> not

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
can go up to max like it's just not

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:32.230 
can go up to max like it's just not
realistic<00:04:24.449> in<00:04:24.770> functionality<00:04:25.770> right<00:04:26.310> but

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.719 

then<00:04:33.229> I<00:04:33.319> touched<00:04:33.590> everybody<00:04:33.949> that<00:04:34.310> match<00:04:34.520> I

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
then I touched everybody that match I

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.120 
then I touched everybody that match I
pulled<00:04:35.000> up
