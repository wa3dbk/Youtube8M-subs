00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.170
 I hope we are well in this novelty 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.389
 or titled how to install the crisis of 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.480
 gain soul rebel for our device 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:15.230
 android and good we will need three things 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.900
 which will be the playstation 1 emulator and 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.760
 what will the game files be that 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.939
 it would be this one here that says lewis that 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.340
 insulted and good is completely in 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 Spanish so you can enjoy it better 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.470
 good to do that and the bios that also 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.570
 he left them a description along with a 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.550
 game and everything else good once 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.310
 downloaded all that we want to close 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.950
 the synths 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.800
 we will go to the playstation emulator 1 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.040
 and we will open it and we will give you here where 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.650
 he says execute bios once done that 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.100
 will not start looking for what will be 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.290
 bios and not the checkbook and return us 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.090
 this screen once boot returning to 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.310
 this screen will give you run 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.520
 game that will be to look for the game 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.820
 obviously true and as you see here is 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.760
 that cs lewis the king's the king see and 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.860
 as you see says and says what is the 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.860
 description of what is and what is in 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.900
 Spanish well I is not done that so 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.550
 we want to be open it 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.550
 and because it's all completed 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.340
 we talked a little 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.710
 as you can see there the game is running very 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.729
 well in fact you do not need much of 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.009
 memory and this as it is said neither 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.009
 both ram and good 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.570
 and once that's done and here it is 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.570
 running 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.280
 as you see here is the body once 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:00.300
 is already having that we will have here 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.770
 you are ready to play 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.770
 to have the buttons 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.680
 good as you can notice the game what 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.050
 It runs very well and they are also very good 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.970
 graphics and well that would be all in my 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.899
 part of the law to write you this taste and 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.909
 tell me what did you think of this place 

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:09.339
 a small fact when you 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:10.930
 download some game or something from gendt and 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:13.090
 all this for 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.389
 when you download a game or 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.919
 some rumba or something like that 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.930
 this as if a file is going to come if 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.580
 you will have to extract the file 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.190
 bigger than say there and finish 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.570
 well usually that's the format of 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.190
 reading the emulator but good in 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.000
 given that they tell me none of them 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.009
 call so not nothing this we will extract 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.350
 what will be the heaviest I say in 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:42.610
 that folder the others will ignore 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.520
 for all we ignore and good 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.789
 It would be everything and see you until next time 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.789
 goodbye
