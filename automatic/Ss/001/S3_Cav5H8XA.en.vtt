started doing all the things that you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.280 
started doing all the things that you
needed<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.580> win<00:01:10.820> he<00:01:11.060> wasn't<00:01:11.330> really<00:01:11.450> wow<00:01:11.840> look

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290

at<00:01:12.409> Tom<00:01:12.650> Brady<00:01:12.950> he<00:01:13.520> was<00:01:13.640> just<00:01:13.760> managing<00:01:14.330> the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
at Tom Brady he was just managing the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.600 
at Tom Brady he was just managing the
game<00:01:14.630> not<00:01:15.229> making<00:01:15.620> mistakes<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.340> I<00:01:16.430> think

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
game not making mistakes and I think

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.490 
game not making mistakes and I think
that's<00:01:16.760> what<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.299> Patriots<00:01:17.750> wanted<00:01:18.110> the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
that's what the the Patriots wanted the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.840 
that's what the the Patriots wanted the
expectations<00:01:19.220> in<00:01:19.310> that<00:01:19.430> first<00:01:19.640> season

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.340 
expectations in that first season
weren't<00:01:20.270> very<00:01:20.390> high<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.869> mean<00:01:21.020> here's<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.260> guy

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350
