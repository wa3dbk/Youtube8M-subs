us to start and place the fine line you
can<00:00:16.670> see<00:00:16.820> we've<00:00:17.000> had<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:17.240> excavator<00:00:17.749> in<00:00:17.929> there

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
can see we've had the excavator in there

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.230 
can see we've had the excavator in there
and<00:00:18.349> there's<00:00:19.279> that<00:00:19.429> the<00:00:19.550> liner<00:00:19.759> we've<00:00:19.999> placed

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
and there's that the liner we've placed

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.550 
and there's that the liner we've placed
him<00:00:20.859> around<00:00:21.859> the<00:00:22.099> entire<00:00:22.669> pond<00:00:23.169> and<00:00:24.169> now<00:00:24.380> we're

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
him around the entire pond and now we're

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.069 
him around the entire pond and now we're
going<00:00:24.679> to<00:00:24.769> start<00:00:25.039> in<00:00:25.189> to<00:00:25.489> locate<00:00:26.210> some<00:00:26.900> of<00:00:27.019> the

going to start in to locate some of the

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.040 
going to start in to locate some of the
rocks<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:27.560> we've<00:00:27.710> both<00:00:28.009> got<00:00:28.849> a<00:00:28.880> top<00:00:29.480> loader<00:00:29.810> and

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
rocks so we've both got a top loader and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.370 
rocks so we've both got a top loader and
a<00:00:30.470> posi-track<00:00:30.949> to<00:00:31.339> locate<00:00:32.029> them<00:00:32.300> all<00:00:33.260> the

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
can see we've got the plants in place

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.290 
can see we've got the plants in place
we've<00:00:47.900> laid<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.290> turf<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:48.830> hey<00:00:49.610> presto<00:00:49.640> we've

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
got water in there and isn't that a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.150 
got water in there and isn't that a
stunning<00:00:53.930> effect<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.380> you<00:00:54.710> can<00:00:54.890> see<00:00:55.070> the

actually<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.100> complete<00:01:28.670> filtration<00:01:29.390> system

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
actually a complete filtration system

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.429 
actually a complete filtration system
which<00:01:30.049> runs<00:01:30.320> 24<00:01:30.920> 7<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:32.600> separate<00:01:33.140> country

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
which runs 24 7 and a separate country

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.800 
which runs 24 7 and a separate country
no<00:01:33.680> just<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.070> run<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.369> waterfall<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.539> so

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
no just to run the waterfall and so

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.359 
no just to run the waterfall and so
there's<00:01:35.960> quite<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.259> little<00:01:36.530> water<00:01:36.740> it's

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
there's quite a little water it's

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.770 
there's quite a little water it's
getting<00:01:37.729> through<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.060> system<00:01:38.240> now<00:01:38.570> about

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
getting through the system now about

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.770 
getting through the system now about
forty<00:01:39.140> thousand<00:01:39.590> liters<00:01:39.890> an<00:01:40.009> hour<00:01:40.780> you'll

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
forty thousand liters an hour you'll

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.539 
forty thousand liters an hour you'll
also<00:01:41.929> be<00:01:42.229> able<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.470> see<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.830> in<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.280> pond

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
also be able to see the in the pond

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.950 
also be able to see the in the pond
we've<00:01:43.850> lined<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.869> entire<00:01:45.700> four<00:01:46.700> areas<00:01:47.270> with<00:01:47.929> a

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
we've lined the entire four areas with a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.370 
we've lined the entire four areas with a
movie<00:01:48.619> star<00:01:49.030> with<00:01:50.030> some<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.689> 20<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.080> 40

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.800 
movie star with some the 20 to 40
millimeter<00:01:52.000> rated<00:01:53.000> riverstone<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:53.659> then

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
millimeter rated riverstone and then

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.050 
millimeter rated riverstone and then
some<00:01:54.020> ungraded<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:55.490> give<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:55.789> really

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
some ungraded to give that really

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.680 
some ungraded to give that really
natural<00:01:56.479> effect<00:01:56.920> I'm<00:01:57.920> sure<00:01:58.159> you'll<00:01:58.340> agree

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
natural effect I'm sure you'll agree

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:21.990 
natural effect I'm sure you'll agree
does<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.840> fantastic

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.760 

you<00:02:23.000> had<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.240> include<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.690> special<00:02:24.140> filtration

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
you had to include a special filtration

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.860 
you had to include a special filtration
system<00:02:25.220> which<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.610> come<00:02:25.940> from<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.390> clear<00:02:26.630> pond

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
system which is come from the clear pond

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.380 
system which is come from the clear pond
Brett<00:02:27.680> helped<00:02:27.980> us<00:02:28.070> with<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.460> considerably

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
Brett helped us with that considerably

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.360 
Brett helped us with that considerably
through<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.780> project<00:02:29.990> you'll<00:02:30.950> see<00:02:31.190> here

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
through the project you'll see here

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.430 
through the project you'll see here
there's<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.700> UV<00:02:32.240> light<00:02:32.450> in<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.840> first<00:02:33.140> square

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
there's a UV light in that first square

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.370 
there's a UV light in that first square
box<00:02:33.740> then<00:02:34.490> it<00:02:34.610> overflows<00:02:35.120> into<00:02:35.420> four<00:02:35.930> separate

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
box then it overflows into four separate

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.700 
box then it overflows into four separate
filters<00:02:37.570> returning<00:02:38.570> back<00:02:38.780> into<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.230> far<00:02:39.500> end

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
filters returning back into the far end

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.210 
filters returning back into the far end
of<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.890> pool<00:02:40.630> it's<00:02:41.630> quite<00:02:41.810> complex<00:02:42.230> although

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
of the pool it's quite complex although

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.330 
of the pool it's quite complex although
very<00:02:43.430> simple<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.390> maintain<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.980> over<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
very simple to maintain and over in the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.610 
very simple to maintain and over in the
back<00:02:49.490> here<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.180> remote<00:02:50.750> control<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:51.590> that

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
back here is the remote control so that

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.560 
back here is the remote control so that
we<00:02:51.860> can<00:02:52.070> remotely<00:02:52.820> control<00:02:52.970> both<00:02:53.540> the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
we can remotely control both the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.750 
we can remotely control both the
