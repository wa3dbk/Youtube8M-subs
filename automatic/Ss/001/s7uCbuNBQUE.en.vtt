the<00:01:09.210> wire<00:01:09.390> seems<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> fly<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.380> now<00:01:11.310> let's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the wire seems to fly there now let's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.980 
the wire seems to fly there now let's
create<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.090> simple<00:01:12.270> loop<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.630> top<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
create a simple loop on the top of the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.590 
create a simple loop on the top of the
beach<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.439> take<00:01:13.770> your<00:01:13.920> nose<00:01:14.159> pliers<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.939> cross

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
beach so take your nose pliers and cross

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.570 
beach so take your nose pliers and cross
the<00:01:15.720> top<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> wire<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> tip<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.250> your

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the top of the wire with the tip of your

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.830 
the top of the wire with the tip of your
pliers<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.360> roll<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.350> away<00:01:19.439> from<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.750> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
pliers and roll it away from you so you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.749 
pliers and roll it away from you so you
just<00:01:21.869> create<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> simple<00:01:22.560> loop<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.189> now<00:01:23.400> let's

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
just create a simple loop so now let's

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.730 
just create a simple loop so now let's
repeat<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> steps<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:25.259> our<00:01:25.500> beats<00:01:27.740> so

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
repeat the steps with all our beats so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.170 
repeat the steps with all our beats so
bend<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> wire<00:01:33.229> cut<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.439> wire<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.939> about<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
bend the wire cut the wire to about a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.390 
bend the wire cut the wire to about a
tenth<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.720> an<00:01:36.840> inch<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:40.070> create<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> simple

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
tenth of an inch and create a simple

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.679 
tenth of an inch and create a simple
loop<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> top<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.329> second

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
loop on the top of it so here the second

00:01:48.689 --> 00:02:06.390 
loop on the top of it so here the second
one<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.049> third<00:01:49.110> one

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:21.720 

alright<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:12.130> is<00:02:12.190> done<00:02:12.580> as<00:02:12.760> well<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:21.490> now<00:02:21.670> take

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
alright this is done as well so now take

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.390 
alright this is done as well so now take
the<00:02:22.270> eye<00:02:22.300> pin<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.080> slide<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.650> bead<00:02:23.830> on<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.100> and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
the eye pin and slide the bead on it and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.090 
the eye pin and slide the bead on it and
the<00:02:24.640> same<00:02:24.820> way<00:02:25.030> holding<00:02:25.690> your<00:02:25.870> left<00:02:26.110> hand<00:02:26.380> the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
the same way holding your left hand the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.130 
the same way holding your left hand the
beat<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:27.520> it's<00:02:27.550> human<00:02:27.940> steady<00:02:28.270> with<00:02:28.990> your

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
beat so it's human steady with your

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.380 
beat so it's human steady with your
right<00:02:29.350> hand<00:02:29.380> bend<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> wire<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.610> 90<00:02:31.000> degree

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
right hand bend the wire to 90 degree

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.100 
right hand bend the wire to 90 degree
angle<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:33.100> quite<00:02:33.340> hard<00:02:33.580> here<00:02:33.790> because<00:02:34.120> the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
angle it's quite hard here because the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.250 
angle it's quite hard here because the
wire<00:02:35.320> is<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.650> really<00:02:35.950> short<00:02:36.420> cut<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.600> wire<00:02:37.840> to

on<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.270> top<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.720> P<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.650> grasp<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.130> top

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
on the top of the P so you grasp the top

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.040 
on the top of the P so you grasp the top
of<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.730> wire<00:02:48.970> move<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.450> tip<00:02:49.600> of<00:02:49.630> your<00:02:49.780> pliers

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
of the wire move the tip of your pliers

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.180 
of the wire move the tip of your pliers
and<00:02:50.470> roll<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.830> away<00:02:50.950> from<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:52.740> you<00:02:53.740> should

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
and roll it away from you so you should

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.980 
and roll it away from you so you should
end<00:02:54.580> up<00:02:54.790> with<00:02:54.850> something<00:02:55.330> that<00:02:55.510> looks<00:02:55.690> like

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
end up with something that looks like

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:04.860 
end up with something that looks like
this<00:03:02.400> do<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.430> simple<00:03:03.700> loops<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.209> both<00:03:04.450> sides<00:03:04.720> of

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
this do a simple loops on both sides of

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.030 
this do a simple loops on both sides of
the<00:03:05.050> beat<00:03:05.230> now<00:03:07.200> repeat<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.380> steps<00:03:08.680> with<00:03:08.860> all

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
the beat now repeat the steps with all

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.380 
the beat now repeat the steps with all
your<00:03:09.310> base<00:03:10.680> let<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.830> eye<00:03:11.860> pin<00:03:12.280> slide<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.209> bead

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
your base let the eye pin slide the bead

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.699 
your base let the eye pin slide the bead
on<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.830> bend<00:03:14.830> it<00:03:15.660> cut<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.080> create<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> simple

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
on it bend it cut it and create a simple

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:39.869 
on it bend it cut it and create a simple
loop<00:03:17.860> on<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.130> top

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:04:16.259 

unmarked

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:45.239 

and<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.930> last<00:04:17.169> one

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:45.249 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:47.579 

so<00:04:46.089> all<00:04:46.329> our<00:04:46.359> bids<00:04:46.719> have<00:04:46.899> a<00:04:46.929> simple<00:04:47.319> loop<00:04:47.409> on

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:47.589 
so all our bids have a simple loop on

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:48.959 
so all our bids have a simple loop on
the<00:04:47.679> top<00:04:47.889> of<00:04:48.039> it<00:04:48.189> so<00:04:48.219> let's<00:04:48.609> connect

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
the top of it so let's connect

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.649
