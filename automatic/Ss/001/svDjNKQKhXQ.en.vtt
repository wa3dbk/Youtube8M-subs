the next thing in our series of two
tough<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.890> get<00:00:20.100> off<00:00:21.289> is<00:00:22.289> going<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.830> be<00:00:23.010> our

tough to get off is going to be our
bottom<00:00:23.490> bracket<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.689> itself<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.380> think<00:00:25.740> that

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
bottom bracket so itself I think that

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.070 
bottom bracket so itself I think that
this<00:00:26.010> was<00:00:26.189> arm<00:00:26.430> off<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:27.029> know<00:00:27.180> how<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.420> pull<00:00:27.660> if

this was arm off you know how to pull if

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.419 
this was arm off you know how to pull if
you<00:00:28.199> don't<00:00:28.410> know<00:00:28.470> how<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> use<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> puller<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
you don't know how to use the puller to

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.009 
you don't know how to use the puller to
get<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.789> off<00:00:30.000> or<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.359> happens<00:00:30.660> if<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.960> is

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
all right I get this one a lot all the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.080 
all right I get this one a lot all the
time<00:00:46.620> there's<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.950> fixed<00:00:47.309> cup<00:00:47.550> side<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
time there's a fixed cup side and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.000 
time there's a fixed cup side and
there's<00:00:48.270> an<00:00:48.420> adjustable<00:00:48.840> cup<00:00:49.200> side<00:00:49.469> either

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
there's an adjustable cup side either

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.340 
there's an adjustable cup side either
one<00:00:50.340> side<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.940> other<00:00:51.059> side<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:51.989> coming

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
one side or the other side is not coming

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.819 
one side or the other side is not coming
off<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.710> them<00:00:52.829> usually<00:00:53.870> it's<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> fixed<00:00:55.559> cup

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
off for them usually it's the fixed cup

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.700 
off for them usually it's the fixed cup
side<00:00:56.190> okay<00:00:56.969> because<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
side okay because I think one of the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
side okay because I think one of the
reasons<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.399> fixed<00:00:59.670> cup<00:00:59.879> side<00:01:00.149> doesn't

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
reasons that the fixed cup side doesn't

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.080 
reasons that the fixed cup side doesn't
come<00:01:00.750> off<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.170> them<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.949> a

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
come off for them is that it is a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.939 
come off for them is that it is a
backwards<00:01:03.090> threat<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.049> reverse<00:01:04.500> threat

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
backwards threat it's a reverse threat

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.039 
backwards threat it's a reverse threat
the<00:01:05.700> next<00:01:06.030> thing<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> reason<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.689> comes<00:01:06.930> off

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
the next thing the reason that comes off

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.450 
the next thing the reason that comes off
is<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.439> damn<00:01:07.590> tool<00:01:07.860> constantly

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
is because the damn tool constantly

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.200 
is because the damn tool constantly
slides<00:01:08.760> off<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.150> there<00:01:09.770> alright<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.060> let's<00:01:12.060> get

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
slides off of there alright so let's get

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
slides off of there alright so let's get
to<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.420> position<00:01:13.049> right<00:01:13.170> now<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.310> can

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
to that position right now and this can

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.830 
to that position right now and this can
work<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.670> either<00:01:15.060> either<00:01:15.479> or<00:01:15.990> side<00:01:17.780> let<00:01:18.780> me

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
work for either either or side let me

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.600 
work for either either or side let me
get<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.140> side<00:01:19.409> off<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> standard

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
