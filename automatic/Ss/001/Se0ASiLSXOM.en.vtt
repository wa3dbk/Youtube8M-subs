fail on me and and the hard drive

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.359 
fail on me and and the hard drive
crashed<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.349> lost<00:00:28.380> all<00:00:28.710> my<00:00:28.890> data<00:00:29.039> and

everything<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.000> had<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.300> remember<00:00:30.900> how<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
everything so I had to remember how to

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.930 
everything so I had to remember how to
make<00:00:31.619> all<00:00:31.830> these<00:00:32.009> things<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.489> I'm<00:00:32.579> about<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
make all these things that I'm about to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180 
make all these things that I'm about to
show<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.290> made<00:00:34.500> them<00:00:34.680> again

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
show you but I made them again

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.380 
show you but I made them again
and<00:00:36.380> first<00:00:37.380> thing<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:40.800> basically

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
and first thing is this it basically

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
and first thing is this it basically
takes<00:00:42.390> an<00:00:43.320> item<00:00:43.680> payment<00:00:44.100> by<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> way<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.610> is

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
takes an item payment by the way this is

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.850 
takes an item payment by the way this is
all<00:00:44.910> about<00:00:45.000> vending<00:00:45.600> machine<00:00:46.140> payments<00:00:46.739> as

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
all about vending machine payments as

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.610 
all about vending machine payments as
posed<00:00:47.149> it<00:00:48.149> takes<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.050> pushes<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.530> along

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
posed it takes it and it pushes it along

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.410 
posed it takes it and it pushes it along
but<00:00:51.110> unfortunately<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.410> one<00:00:52.800> point<00:00:53.100> two

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
but unfortunately in one point two

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.799 
but unfortunately in one point two
sponges<00:00:54.829> don't<00:00:55.829> make<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.610> five<00:00:57.329> by<00:00:57.539> five

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
sponges don't make the five by five

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.750 
sponges don't make the five by five
update<00:00:59.180> which<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.449> very<00:01:00.780> annoying<00:01:01.730> but<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
update which is very annoying but I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.509 
update which is very annoying but I
don't<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.300> someone<00:01:04.199> else<00:01:04.409> should<00:01:04.769> think<00:01:05.369> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
don't know someone else should think of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.460 
don't know someone else should think of
a<00:01:05.670> use<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.390> machine<00:01:08.869> it<00:01:09.869> might<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.380> be

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
a use for this machine it might just be

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.000 
a use for this machine it might just be
a<00:01:10.560> nice<00:01:10.860> way<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:12.710> transporting<00:01:13.710> blocks

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
a nice way of like transporting blocks

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.570 
a nice way of like transporting blocks
if<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.659> main<00:01:16.250> good<00:01:17.250> thing<00:01:17.460> about

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
if you want to the main good thing about

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.580 
if you want to the main good thing about
this<00:01:17.909> design<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.840> sorry<00:01:19.049> I'm<00:01:19.200> skipping

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
this design is it sorry I'm skipping

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.609 
this design is it sorry I'm skipping
around<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.070> lot<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.200> flat

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
around a lot but is that it's flat

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.410 
around a lot but is that it's flat
against<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> wall<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.150> doesn't

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
against the wall and it doesn't

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.710 
against the wall and it doesn't
propagate<00:01:24.900> beyond<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.380> wall<00:01:28.850> but<00:01:29.850> yeah<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
propagate beyond this wall but yeah and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.679 
propagate beyond this wall but yeah and
it's<00:01:30.960> very<00:01:31.170> fast<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:32.220> works<00:01:32.689> however

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
it's very fast and it all works however

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.980 
it's very fast and it all works however
that<00:01:34.530> doesn't<00:01:34.710> work<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.810> going

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that doesn't work and if that was going

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.780 
that doesn't work and if that was going
to<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.110> great<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.619> sponges<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.430> know<00:01:38.579> our

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
to be great for sponges you know our

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.830 
to be great for sponges you know our
unique<00:01:39.210> block<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.689> contact<00:01:40.140> them<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:41.840> normal

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
unique block to contact them in normal

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.429 
unique block to contact them in normal
survival<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.990> there<00:01:45.990> would<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.200> great

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
survival so there would be a great

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.429 
survival so there would be a great
currency<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.659> we<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> make<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.290> with

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
currency but we have to make do with

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.130 
currency but we have to make do with
what<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.060> go<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
what we have and now we go on to the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.069 
what we have and now we go on to the
next<00:01:52.320> thing<00:01:52.799> which<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.360> much<00:01:54.869> larger<00:01:55.500> device

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
next thing which is a much larger device

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.100 
next thing which is a much larger device
and<00:01:58.189> basically<00:01:59.189> all<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.329> its<00:02:00.659> massive

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
and basically all this is is its massive

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.950 
and basically all this is is its massive
monostable<00:02:01.829> circuit<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:03.180> wiring<00:02:03.540> just

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
monostable circuit with wiring just

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.320 
monostable circuit with wiring just
going<00:02:04.229> everywhere<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.329> pay<00:02:06.540> with<00:02:06.780> web

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.850 

here<00:02:12.330> oh<00:02:12.510> great

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
here oh great

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.120 
here oh great
when<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.340> try<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.940> check<00:02:15.630> imagine<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.830> it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
when I try it check imagine that it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.900 
when I try it check imagine that it
doesn't<00:02:17.820> work<00:02:17.970> but<00:02:18.330> do<00:02:19.080> not<00:02:19.260> fear<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:20.040> should

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
doesn't work but do not fear it should

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.720 
doesn't work but do not fear it should
work<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.420> time<00:02:24.680> or<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.920> might<00:02:26.220> just<00:02:26.250> drop

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
work this time or it might just drop

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.090 
work this time or it might just drop
down<00:02:27.000> see<00:02:27.840> that's<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:28.440> problem<00:02:28.680> with

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
down see that's the one problem with

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.770 
down see that's the one problem with
this<00:02:29.540> device<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:32.250> sometimes<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:33.510> can

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
this device is that sometimes it can

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.820 
this device is that sometimes it can
just<00:02:33.810> destroy<00:02:34.500> your<00:02:34.710> money<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:36.740> don't<00:02:37.740> know

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
just destroy your money I don't know

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.910 
just destroy your money I don't know
that's<00:02:38.010> very<00:02:38.160> good<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:39.660> normally<00:02:40.320> works<00:02:40.500> quite

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
that's very good it normally works quite

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.110 
that's very good it normally works quite
well<00:02:41.870> I'm<00:02:42.870> still<00:02:43.500> not<00:02:43.620> sure<00:02:43.680> how<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.160> prevent

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
well I'm still not sure how to prevent

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.970 
well I'm still not sure how to prevent
that<00:02:45.300> thing<00:02:45.810> happening<00:02:46.290> where<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.740> pops

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
that thing happening where it just pops

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.240 
that thing happening where it just pops
on<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.460> here<00:02:48.500> maybe<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:49.740> can<00:02:49.920> make<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:50.190> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
on to here maybe we can make this a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.910 
on to here maybe we can make this a
glass<00:02:50.730> pane<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.630> thought<00:02:51.990> about<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.500> but<00:02:52.560> then

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
glass pane I thought about that but then

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.860 
glass pane I thought about that but then
you<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.430> see<00:02:53.640> some<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.060> wiring<00:02:54.300> behind

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
you can see some of the wiring behind

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.830 
you can see some of the wiring behind
these<00:02:55.050> two<00:02:55.260> blocks<00:02:58.940> but<00:02:59.940> yeah<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.570> then<00:03:00.720> you

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
these two blocks but yeah and then you

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.630 
these two blocks but yeah and then you
could<00:03:00.990> like<00:03:01.230> pick<00:03:01.470> up<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.740> item<00:03:02.070> afterwards

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
could like pick up the item afterwards

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.100 
could like pick up the item afterwards
and<00:03:03.000> then<00:03:07.370> but<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.490> way<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:08.850> works<00:03:09.210> a<00:03:09.750> lot

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
and then but the way this works a lot

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.530 
and then but the way this works a lot
means<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.800> even<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.550> throw<00:03:11.760> items<00:03:12.300> in

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
means that even if you throw items in

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.080 
means that even if you throw items in
here<00:03:12.720> even<00:03:13.050> if<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.260> get<00:03:13.440> like<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.090> perfect

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
here even if you get like the perfect

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.720 
here even if you get like the perfect
angle<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:16.230> throw<00:03:16.410> these<00:03:16.680> items<00:03:17.190> down<00:03:17.700> here

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
angle to throw these items down here

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.560 
angle to throw these items down here
like<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:22.280> they<00:03:23.280> won't<00:03:23.490> get<00:03:23.640> very<00:03:23.700> far<00:03:23.940> and

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
like that they won't get very far and

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.020 
like that they won't get very far and
when<00:03:25.530> they're<00:03:25.710> through<00:03:25.950> cells<00:03:26.760> for<00:03:27.090> throw<00:03:27.510> and

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
when they're through cells for throw and

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.750 
when they're through cells for throw and
then<00:03:30.030> they'll<00:03:30.390> go<00:03:30.630> into<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.960> water<00:03:31.230> stream<00:03:31.760> that

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
then they'll go into a water stream that

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.180 
then they'll go into a water stream that
will<00:03:32.910> go<00:03:33.770> flying<00:03:34.770> to<00:03:35.490> lava<00:03:36.560> as<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.740> can<00:03:37.950> hear

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
will go flying to lava as you can hear

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.520 
will go flying to lava as you can hear
there's<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.459> bit<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:39.000> hissing<00:03:39.930> noise<00:03:40.110> every

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
there's a bit of a hissing noise every

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.050 
there's a bit of a hissing noise every
time<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.980> press<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.280> body<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:47.520> that's<00:03:47.790> just

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
time I press the body and that's just

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.570 
time I press the body and that's just
due<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.600> thing<00:03:48.930> being<00:03:49.350> updated<00:03:49.620> this

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
due to this thing being updated this

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.949 
due to this thing being updated this
block<00:03:51.180> here<00:03:51.560> as<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.770> can<00:03:52.920> use<00:03:53.070> it<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.400> make<00:03:53.580> a

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
block here as you can use it to make a

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.160 
block here as you can use it to make a
smoke<00:03:54.959> machine<00:03:55.410> but<00:03:56.160> anyway<00:03:56.730> it's<00:03:57.510> just<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.990> bit

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
smoke machine but anyway it's just a bit

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.380 
smoke machine but anyway it's just a bit
nor<00:03:58.410> bit<00:03:58.980> annoying<00:03:59.250> but<00:03:59.610> you<00:03:59.910> know<00:04:00.240> it's

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
nor bit annoying but you know it's

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.920 
nor bit annoying but you know it's
working<00:04:00.630> them<00:04:01.050> I<00:04:01.290> suppose

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
working them I suppose

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.640 
working them I suppose
anyway<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:05.600> bit<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:06.720> string<00:04:07.050> propagates

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
anyway the the bit of string propagates

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.170 
anyway the the bit of string propagates
down<00:04:07.860> here<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.400> then<00:04:08.520> falls<00:04:08.820> through<00:04:09.060> this

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
down here and then falls through this

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.480 
down here and then falls through this
pressure<00:04:09.510> plate<00:04:10.040> activating<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.130> signal

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
pressure plate activating a signal

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.100 
pressure plate activating a signal
through<00:04:11.640> here<00:04:11.940> which<00:04:12.180> goes<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:12.630> your<00:04:12.690> vending

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
through here which goes to your vending

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.860 
through here which goes to your vending
machine<00:04:13.470> payment<00:04:13.890> system<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:15.150> yeah<00:04:15.390> sorry

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
machine payment system so yeah sorry

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.390 
machine payment system so yeah sorry
that<00:04:16.169> I<00:04:16.200> haven't<00:04:16.440> been<00:04:16.680> here<00:04:16.950> for<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.190> while

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
that I haven't been here for a while
