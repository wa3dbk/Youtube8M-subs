they<00:01:14.189> used<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> use<00:01:14.520> never<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.390> gave<00:01:15.540> them

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
they used to use never really gave them

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.570 
they used to use never really gave them
the<00:01:15.900> results<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:16.290> wanted<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:17.009> everyone

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the results they wanted because everyone

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.550 
the results they wanted because everyone
who<00:01:17.759> played<00:01:18.240> there<00:01:18.509> didn't<00:01:18.990> play<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.380> they

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
who played there didn't play like they

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649 
who played there didn't play like they
usually<00:01:19.799> would<00:01:20.189> nothing<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.119> happened<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
usually would nothing really happened to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.820 
usually would nothing really happened to
that<00:01:21.750> main<00:01:21.930> character<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:22.590> was<00:01:22.619> no

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that main character there was no

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.230 
that main character there was no
consequence<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:23.700> they<00:01:23.820> did<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
consequence for what they did as a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.789 
consequence for what they did as a
result<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.750> test<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.080> didn't<00:01:25.409> really<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
result of test so didn't really have a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.950 
result of test so didn't really have a
real<00:01:26.130> community<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.000> thus<00:01:27.210> wasn't<00:01:27.720> really<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
real community and thus wasn't really a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.600 
real community and thus wasn't really a
fair<00:01:28.200> test<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.829> features<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.280> they<00:01:29.400> wanted

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
fair test for features that they wanted

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.580 
fair test for features that they wanted
to<00:01:29.759> test<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> broad<00:01:30.450> community<00:01:30.689> scale<00:01:31.229> so

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
to test on a broad community scale so

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.990 
to test on a broad community scale so
they<00:01:31.740> decided<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.280> make<00:01:32.430> these<00:01:32.610> new<00:01:32.790> preview

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
they decided to make these new preview

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
they decided to make these new preview
oils<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.600> an<00:01:33.720> actual<00:01:34.079> community<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.680> players

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
oils with an actual community of players

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
oils with an actual community of players
so<00:01:35.520> everyone<00:01:35.909> will<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.090> playing<00:01:36.329> there<00:01:36.570> for

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
so everyone will be playing there for

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.230 
so everyone will be playing there for
their<00:01:36.990> own<00:01:37.140> reason<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.680> or<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.220> row<00:01:38.430> every
