00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
k in our last example we used a

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.930 
k in our last example we used a
perfectly<00:00:03.629> clean<00:00:03.840> amp<00:00:04.350> and<00:00:04.680> we<00:00:05.100> got<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.790> nice

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
perfectly clean amp and we got a nice

perfectly clean amp and we got a nice
dirty<00:00:06.330> tone<00:00:06.690> using<00:00:07.140> our<00:00:07.649> BB<00:00:08.280> preamp<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:09.330> time

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
give away my age we only had

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.929 
give away my age we only had
single-channel<00:00:28.279> marshall<00:00:29.279> amps<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.730> didn't

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
single-channel marshall amps we didn't

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.179 
single-channel marshall amps we didn't
have<00:00:30.060> two<00:00:30.240> channels<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:31.050> all<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.500> they<00:00:31.890> didn't

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
have two channels at all and they didn't

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.549 
have two channels at all and they didn't
get<00:00:32.309> super<00:00:32.730> dirty<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.899> had<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.290> figure<00:00:34.440> out

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
get super dirty so you had to figure out

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.220 
get super dirty so you had to figure out
a<00:00:34.649> way<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> make<00:00:35.190> them<00:00:35.340> dirtier<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> lot

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
a way to make them dirtier and so a lot

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.330 
a way to make them dirtier and so a lot
of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.860> older<00:00:38.219> marshall<00:00:38.790> users<00:00:39.239> generally

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
of the older marshall users generally

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.950 
of the older marshall users generally
will<00:00:41.340> get<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> nice<00:00:41.730> crunchy<00:00:42.329> sound<00:00:42.510> from<00:00:42.809> their

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
will get a nice crunchy sound from their

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.020 
will get a nice crunchy sound from their
amp<00:00:43.170> now<00:00:43.410> i'm<00:00:43.530> not<00:00:43.680> using<00:00:43.829> any<00:00:44.129> effects<00:00:44.789> now

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
amp now i'm not using any effects now

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.520 
amp now i'm not using any effects now
I'm<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.329> running<00:00:45.450> straight<00:00:45.629> into<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.260> amp

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
I'm just running straight into the amp

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.959 
I'm just running straight into the amp
and<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.309> gains<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.789> about<00:00:48.120> four<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.969> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and the gains on about four and the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.630 
and the gains on about four and the
volumes<00:00:51.809> at<00:00:51.989> about<00:00:52.260> three<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.399> not

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
volumes at about three because it's not

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.959 
volumes at about three because it's not
a<00:00:53.699> big<00:00:53.940> room<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.340> basically<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.579> get<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> sound

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
a big room and basically you get a sound

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.810 
a big room and basically you get a sound
like<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.449> without<00:00:58.440> anything<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.100> it

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.260 

Oh

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.710 

now<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:09.290> is<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.470> great<00:01:09.710> sound<00:01:09.950> for<00:01:10.070> rhythm<00:01:10.720> you

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
now this is a great sound for rhythm you

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:22.360 
now this is a great sound for rhythm you
know<00:01:11.750> if<00:01:11.900> you're<00:01:12.020> playing<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.260> blues<00:01:21.370> but

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
know if you're playing a blues but

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.030 
know if you're playing a blues but
sometimes<00:01:23.060> it's<00:01:23.210> not<00:01:23.300> enough<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.350> long<00:01:24.980> time

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
sometimes it's not enough so a long time

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.580 
sometimes it's not enough so a long time
ago<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.490> we<00:01:25.610> would<00:01:25.840> use<00:01:26.840> something<00:01:27.230> to<00:01:27.350> boost

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
ago is we would use something to boost

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.590 
ago is we would use something to boost
the<00:01:27.890> amp<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.340> there's<00:01:28.910> different<00:01:29.180> ways<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.300> do

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
the amp and there's different ways to do

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.470 
the amp and there's different ways to do
it<00:01:29.920> you<00:01:30.920> know<00:01:31.040> in<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.520> old<00:01:31.730> days<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.000> had<00:01:32.030> fuzz

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
it you know in the old days you had fuzz

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.550 
it you know in the old days you had fuzz
boxes<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:35.030> know<00:01:35.180> in<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.660> 70s<00:01:35.870> you<00:01:36.200> started<00:01:36.500> to

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
boxes you know in the 70s you started to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.430 
boxes you know in the 70s you started to
get<00:01:36.650> more<00:01:36.890> distortion<00:01:37.550> boxes<00:01:38.240> or<00:01:38.780> overdrive

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
get more distortion boxes or overdrive

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.700 
get more distortion boxes or overdrive
and<00:01:39.800> before<00:01:40.700> that<00:01:40.730> they<00:01:41.060> use<00:01:41.320> treble<00:01:42.320> boost<00:01:42.500> or

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
and before that they use treble boost or

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.160 
and before that they use treble boost or
some<00:01:42.890> people<00:01:43.010> didn't<00:01:43.490> like<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.780> range<00:01:44.780> master

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
some people didn't like a range master

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.040 
some people didn't like a range master
and<00:01:45.590> things<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:46.040> that<00:01:46.420> now<00:01:47.420> I'm<00:01:47.810> going<00:01:47.960> to

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
and things like that now I'm going to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.530 
and things like that now I'm going to
try<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.230> do<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.530> same<00:01:48.740> thing<00:01:49.040> with<00:01:49.850> my<00:01:50.120> BB

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
try to do the same thing with my BB

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.620 
try to do the same thing with my BB
preamp<00:01:51.020> here<00:01:51.850> Stevie<00:01:52.850> Ray<00:01:53.000> Vaughan<00:01:53.210> did<00:01:53.480> this

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
preamp here Stevie Ray Vaughan did this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.620 
preamp here Stevie Ray Vaughan did this
with<00:01:54.290> a<00:01:54.590> tube<00:01:55.280> screamer<00:01:55.490> right<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.150> mean<00:01:56.330> sort

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
with a tube screamer right I mean sort

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.300 
with a tube screamer right I mean sort
of<00:01:56.660> famous<00:01:56.990> now<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.860> have<00:01:58.010> to<00:01:58.130> set<00:01:58.280> it

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
of famous now and you have to set it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.950 
of famous now and you have to set it
different<00:01:58.730> than<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:58.940> normally<00:01:59.090> would<00:01:59.360> when

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
different than you normally would when

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.450 
different than you normally would when
you<00:02:00.080> use<00:02:00.200> sourcing<00:02:00.800> through<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:00.980> clean<00:02:01.250> amp

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
you use sourcing through a clean amp

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.900 
you use sourcing through a clean amp
what<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.120> do<00:02:02.440> in<00:02:03.440> our<00:02:03.560> last<00:02:03.740> example<00:02:03.950> we<00:02:04.520> have

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
what you do in our last example we have

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.610 
what you do in our last example we have
the<00:02:05.030> gain<00:02:05.300> up<00:02:05.600> really<00:02:05.870> high<00:02:06.110> in<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.440> volume

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
the gain up really high in the volume

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.830 
the gain up really high in the volume
like<00:02:06.920> in<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.160> middle<00:02:07.340> but<00:02:08.090> in<00:02:08.270> this<00:02:08.630> method

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
like in the middle but in this method

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.720 
like in the middle but in this method
what<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.470> do<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:09.830> turn<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.280> gain<00:02:10.490> down

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
what you do is you turn the gain down

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.280 
what you do is you turn the gain down
really<00:02:11.270> low<00:02:11.420> like<00:02:12.320> on<00:02:12.500> one<00:02:12.860> or<00:02:13.250> two<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:14.330> you

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
really low like on one or two and you

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.290 
really low like on one or two and you
turn<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.650> volume<00:02:15.830> up<00:02:16.190> real<00:02:16.430> loud<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:16.940> when<00:02:17.209> you

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
turn the volume up real loud so when you

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.260 
turn the volume up real loud so when you
step<00:02:17.540> on<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.670> know<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.790> decibel

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
step on it you get a you know a decibel

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.000 
step on it you get a you know a decibel
boost<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:20.900> more<00:02:21.260> sustained<00:02:21.680> you're<00:02:21.890> not

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
boost and more sustained you're not

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.410 
boost and more sustained you're not
looking<00:02:22.250> for<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> lot<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.670> gain<00:02:22.850> out<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.239> box

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
looking for a lot of gain out of the box

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.240 
looking for a lot of gain out of the box
you<00:02:23.540> just<00:02:23.810> as<00:02:24.320> you're<00:02:24.709> just<00:02:24.860> using<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.160> to

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
you just as you're just using it to

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.070 
you just as you're just using it to
boost<00:02:25.400> your<00:02:25.610> signal<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.600> one<00:02:26.750> channel

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
boost your signal the one channel

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.360 
boost your signal the one channel
marshalls<00:02:27.500> we<00:02:27.650> if<00:02:27.830> we<00:02:27.950> wanted<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.220> play

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
marshalls we if we wanted to play

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.790 
marshalls we if we wanted to play
something<00:02:28.700> clean<00:02:29.030> we<00:02:29.930> had<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.200> do<00:02:30.320> it<00:02:30.440> from<00:02:30.620> our

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
something clean we had to do it from our

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.940 
something clean we had to do it from our
guitars<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.880> basically<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:33.590> know<00:02:33.680> we<00:02:33.830> would

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
guitars so basically you know we would

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.100 
guitars so basically you know we would
turn<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.220> volume<00:02:34.550> down<00:02:34.580> low<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:36.489> get<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:38.110> clean

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
turn the volume down low and get a clean

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.460 
turn the volume down low and get a clean
of<00:02:39.230> sound<00:02:39.410> as<00:02:39.530> we<00:02:39.650> could

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
of sound as we could

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.760 
of sound as we could
you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.200 

and<00:02:48.770> bring<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.220> back<00:02:49.370> up<00:02:49.400> for<00:02:49.730> our<00:02:49.880> rhythm

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
and bring it back up for our rhythm

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.040 
and bring it back up for our rhythm
parts

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.980 

now<00:02:54.950> what<00:02:55.190> I'm<00:02:55.280> gonna<00:02:55.400> do<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.850> I'm<00:02:56.180> gonna<00:02:56.330> put
