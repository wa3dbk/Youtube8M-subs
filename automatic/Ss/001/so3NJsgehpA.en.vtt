African ball python this terrarium is a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.300 
African ball python this terrarium is a
captive<00:00:15.809> bred<00:00:16.020> ball<00:00:16.289> python<00:00:16.859> now<00:00:17.010> because

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
captive bred ball python now because

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.140 
captive bred ball python now because
this<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.640> captive<00:00:18.119> bred<00:00:19.490> he's<00:00:20.490> less

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
this is captive bred he's less

let's take him out now so he got himself
wedged<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.949> there<00:01:01.430> okay<00:01:02.660> whoo<00:01:04.970> look<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.119> this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
wedged in there okay whoo look at this

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.090 
wedged in there okay whoo look at this
guy<00:01:06.979> now<00:01:07.979> he<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.580> now<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.750> guy<00:01:09.990> was<00:01:10.830> raised

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
guy now he was now this guy was raised

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.109 
guy now he was now this guy was raised
in<00:01:11.280> captivity<00:01:12.260> that<00:01:13.260> means<00:01:14.630> he<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:16.070> not<00:01:17.119> wild

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
in captivity that means he is not wild

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.300 
in captivity that means he is not wild
and<00:01:18.540> he's<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:18.990> aggressive<00:01:19.290> as<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> wild<00:01:20.130> one

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
and he's not as aggressive as a wild one

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.340 
and he's not as aggressive as a wild one
so<00:01:20.909> he<00:01:21.180> won't<00:01:21.360> strike<00:01:22.430> but<00:01:23.600> he's<00:01:24.600> pretty<00:01:24.960> small

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
so he won't strike but he's pretty small

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.320 
so he won't strike but he's pretty small
because<00:01:25.830> he's<00:01:26.100> only<00:01:26.280> five<00:01:26.580> months<00:01:26.820> old

because he's only five months old
and<00:01:29.420> we've<00:01:30.420> measured<00:01:30.720> him<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.810> figured<00:01:33.810> out

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and we've measured him and figured out

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.640 
and we've measured him and figured out
that<00:01:33.990> he<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.590> about<00:01:35.150> two<00:01:36.150> feet<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.780> one<00:01:37.200> inches

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
he's just a baby he's gonna double in

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.139 
he's just a baby he's gonna double in
size<00:01:42.030> when<00:01:42.299> he's<00:01:42.479> an<00:01:42.630> adult<00:01:43.850> see<00:01:44.850> look<00:01:45.000> at<00:01:45.090> that

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
size when he's an adult see look at that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.850 
size when he's an adult see look at that
tongue<00:01:46.250> see<00:01:47.390> flute<00:01:48.390> looking<00:01:48.960> out<00:01:50.689> whoo

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
tongue see flute looking out whoo

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.740 
tongue see flute looking out whoo
look<00:01:53.860> at<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:55.650> now<00:01:57.030> these<00:01:58.030> are<00:01:58.210> called<00:01:58.479> ball

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
look at that now these are called ball

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.719 
look at that now these are called ball
pythons<00:01:59.380> because<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.509> defense<00:02:01.930> mechanism

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
pythons because as a defense mechanism

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.699 
pythons because as a defense mechanism
they<00:02:04.409> curl<00:02:05.409> themself<00:02:05.830> into<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.100> ball<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:07.709> and

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
they curl themself into a ball and and

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.680 
they curl themself into a ball and and
protect<00:02:09.250> themselves<00:02:09.670> from<00:02:09.789> prep<00:02:10.209> from

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
protect themselves from prep from

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.520 
protect themselves from prep from
predators

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.400 

so<00:02:14.530> look<00:02:14.709> at<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:17.730> okay<00:02:19.080> here's<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.260> ball

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
so look at that okay here's the ball

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.199 
so look at that okay here's the ball
python<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:21.040> I'm<00:02:21.160> going<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.340> show<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.610> his

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
python and I'm going to show you his

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.120 
python and I'm going to show you his
mechanism<00:02:22.540> for<00:02:23.080> hunting<00:02:23.410> prey<00:02:23.709> if<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.950> look

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
mechanism for hunting prey if you look

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.729 
mechanism for hunting prey if you look
here<00:02:24.459> his<00:02:25.239> thumb<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:25.600> constricting<00:02:26.170> my<00:02:26.290> finger

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
here his thumb is constricting my finger

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.520 
here his thumb is constricting my finger
and<00:02:26.980> he<00:02:27.580> constricts<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.900> squeezes<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.500> life

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
and he constricts and squeezes the life

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.920 
and he constricts and squeezes the life
out<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.130> prey<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.700> that's<00:02:31.450> how<00:02:31.600> he<00:02:31.660> kills

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
out of the prey and that's how he kills

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.120 
out of the prey and that's how he kills
his<00:02:32.080> feed<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:35.440> look<00:02:35.650> at<00:02:35.739> that

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
his feed so look at that

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.860 
his feed so look at that
and<00:02:37.200> they<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.319> very<00:02:38.590> sharp<00:02:38.920> teeth<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.870> you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
and they have very sharp teeth and you

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.240 
and they have very sharp teeth and you
don't<00:02:41.050> want<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.260> get<00:02:41.350> bit<00:02:41.560> by<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.739> snake<00:02:41.860> like

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
don't want to get bit by a snake like

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.860 
don't want to get bit by a snake like
this<00:02:42.310> even<00:02:42.819> though<00:02:42.910> they're<00:02:43.120> not<00:02:43.150> venomous

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
this even though they're not venomous

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.820 
this even though they're not venomous
they<00:02:44.319> don't<00:02:44.500> have<00:02:44.769> that<00:02:45.040> venom<00:02:45.400> glands<00:02:46.830> but

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
they don't have that venom glands but

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.190 
they don't have that venom glands but
when<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.819> a<00:02:48.970> graffitied<00:02:49.450> they<00:02:49.600> do<00:02:49.660> give<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.170> a

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
nasty bite they're not aggressive

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.400 
nasty bite they're not aggressive
normally<00:02:52.989> now<00:02:53.920> these<00:02:54.130> snakes<00:02:54.430> have<00:02:55.410> actually

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
normally now these snakes have actually

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.780 
normally now these snakes have actually
a<00:02:56.440> sixth<00:02:56.950> sense<00:02:57.280> on<00:02:57.610> their<00:02:58.510> snout<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.790> in

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.970 
order for me to show you I need to bring
you<00:03:02.799> real<00:03:03.160> close<00:03:03.579> up<00:03:03.959> but<00:03:04.959> basically<00:03:05.320> what<00:03:05.860> it

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
you real close up but basically what it

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.400 
you real close up but basically what it
is<00:03:06.010> he<00:03:06.910> actually<00:03:07.209> can<00:03:07.390> pick<00:03:07.720> up<00:03:07.930> heat<00:03:08.260> of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
is he actually can pick up heat of

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.150 
is he actually can pick up heat of
warm-blooded<00:03:09.280> prey<00:03:09.600> which<00:03:10.769> which<00:03:11.769> makes<00:03:11.799> it

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
warm-blooded prey which which makes it

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:20.430 
warm-blooded prey which which makes it
easier<00:03:12.579> for<00:03:12.640> hunting<00:03:13.150> his<00:03:13.269> food<00:03:16.859> now<00:03:19.440> one

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
easier for hunting his food now one

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.009 
easier for hunting his food now one
spectacular<00:03:20.920> way<00:03:21.670> these<00:03:21.940> pythons<00:03:22.510> hunt<00:03:22.780> their

snout that detect heat from warm-blooded
prey<00:03:34.359> which<00:03:34.840> help<00:03:35.109> them<00:03:35.350> track<00:03:36.190> down<00:03:36.220> their

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
prey which help them track down their

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.240 
prey which help them track down their
food<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.420> they<00:03:37.600> could<00:03:37.810> hunter<00:03:38.440> /<00:03:38.650> hunt<00:03:39.040> their

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
food and they could hunter / hunt their

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.030 
food and they could hunter / hunt their
prey<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.790> strike<00:03:40.720> at<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.230> eat<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.440> even<00:03:41.920> in

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
prey and strike at it and eat it even in

the dark he doesn't even have to see his

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.890 
the dark he doesn't even have to see his
prey<00:03:44.380> because<00:03:44.980> those<00:03:45.190> heat<00:03:45.400> receptors<00:03:45.900> told

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
prey because those heat receptors told

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.860 
prey because those heat receptors told
exactly<00:03:47.410> where<00:03:47.620> they<00:03:47.739> are<00:03:47.769> no<00:03:48.730> we<00:03:49.630> have<00:03:49.720> to

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
exactly where they are no we have to

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.420 
exactly where they are no we have to
give<00:03:50.019> you<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:50.140> closer<00:03:50.410> look<00:03:50.560> but<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.069> don't<00:03:51.310> know

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
he actually has these holes on his snout

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.310 
he actually has these holes on his snout
and<00:04:05.850> below<00:04:06.510> his<00:04:06.690> snout

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
and below his snout

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.500 
and below his snout
those<00:04:08.010> are<00:04:08.190> his<00:04:08.310> heat<00:04:08.550> receptors<00:04:09.090> that's<00:04:09.300> what

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
those are his heat receptors that's what

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.670 
those are his heat receptors that's what
what<00:04:09.690> he<00:04:09.780> does<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.080> pick<00:04:10.260> up<00:04:10.440> heat<00:04:11.180> see<00:04:12.180> that

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
what he does to pick up heat see that

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.050 
what he does to pick up heat see that
okay<00:04:13.940> see<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.090> holes<00:04:15.630> on<00:04:16.380> us<00:04:16.560> now<00:04:16.860> I<00:04:17.130> love<00:04:17.940> you

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
could see but those are his heat

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.590 
could see but those are his heat
receptors<00:04:21.260> all<00:04:22.260> right<00:04:22.530> for<00:04:22.740> picking<00:04:22.980> up<00:04:23.130> heat

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
receptors all right for picking up heat

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
receptors all right for picking up heat
see<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:26.930> those<00:04:27.930> are<00:04:28.080> his<00:04:28.170> heat<00:04:28.320> receptors

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
see that those are his heat receptors
