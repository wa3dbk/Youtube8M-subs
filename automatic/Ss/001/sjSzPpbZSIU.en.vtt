00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 and one as they are I am a cross and we are 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.420
 in a new mode quite simple but 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.820
 that I would like very much that they do not add 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.170
 direct to fire and officially this 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.090
 as you can see here we are in this 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.580
 most homosexual castle I've seen 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.929
 well a cake and everything will not be this 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.119
 case that I was removing the back in 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.460
 this world and I saw this this castle 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.500
 little cake and I said good let's do 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.689
 lived here chingue add and good and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.760
 you know that recently the 1.8 have 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.560
 changed different kinds of good the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.170
 doors with their different types of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.570
 woods not so now with this mod is 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.829
 exactly the same only with the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.860
 Chests already know that they have forgotten 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.540
 totally from the chests so 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.610
 we give you the opportunity equally 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.350
 to the chests if we have different types 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.480
 of chests depending on what way 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.829
 let's use to make the chests do not 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.629
 that I would also like you to find is 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.120
 exactly the same as well as the chests 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.500
 but with those with the crafting tables 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.850
 imagine each color of the castings 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 table obviously working 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.180
 exactly the same as long as they have a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.309
 different texture I think it would not be 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.840
 nothing bad and equally I do not know if many 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.219
 remember an old way of doing 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.199
 enough time that they did not update 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.570
 which for example if I did with 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.940
 sticks of me that is given 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 Wood made this jungle 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.960
 sticks and after the sticks 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.780
 I who was with these sticks made a 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.400
 ax for example this the ax stick 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.619
 That sounded good weird but good 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.630
 stick at the base or whatever you want to tell 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.430
 where you grab this is going to be that 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.900
 color then it 's stupid but to 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.009
 I liked it a lot and I do not know 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.869
 I would like you to start implementing 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.570
 these things and what better to go starting 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.220
 with this that are the chests not this one 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.020
 as you can see here we have all the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.830
 types of chests the wood this 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.890
 white as it is called birch we have plus 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.509
 acacia jungle and dark and I 'm not a 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.550
 main pinter or spend all these 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.860
 colors so good here they have it today 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.479
 I see and obviously we have the normal in what 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.280
 staff that I liked the most here we have 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.350
 a close look see what I saw and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.940
 this time the one I liked the most was this or 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.190
 seriously this one for me was the best one is 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.350
 chocolate bubbles 16 I liked this 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.289
 pretty good west all elegant or not 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.090
 it looks this good here obviously we have 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.100
 the character or thing that can be 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.289
 suppose exactly is exactly the same 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.720
 that as we know it only that it's 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.260
 varying depending on the wood 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.349
 that we use not 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.480
 how to close here and let's go to 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.180
 here is here we have exactly what 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.370
 same only with this doubles not here 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.189
 we have the normal double here we have the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.439
 double bit I think it's ajam be here 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.750
 we have obviously do this and ready 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.959
 this as in all chests the what 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.930
 is this the after the acacia the one 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.760
 jungle and the chocolate today is here 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.530
 well here here I do not stay nice here 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.209
 I wanted my face all aligned but 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.709
 Well here everything has been done for him 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.780
 ready there is even if you did not stay 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.340
 aligned this but what was done to me 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.379
 interesting was that good is our 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.549
 symphony I do not know if it's a mistake but for 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.019
 example that change the texture 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.269
 totally can not be seen 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.069
 example here is this line all 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.810
 like it's broken from here not and if I put 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.639
 this here already disappears the line that 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.079
 I was there, like I do not know if it's a 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.629
 error or if he did it on purpose 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.970
 but this one the texture is changing 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.349
 quite this but good this also 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.600
 It looks pretty good this way 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.060
 lines all scratched I do not know 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.410
 but obviously this is not all this not 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.720
 is everything do not believe that this is all 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.420
 obviously we have more things 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.240
 let's go here we're going to sit here and 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.800
 we have the chests this this one like 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.930
 you can notice it's so good because it's 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.520
 turning around here now is that there is water 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.200
 up here to see since good here 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.790
 we have the chests this is like as 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.140
 that damage the view a little let me remove 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.730
 the saints this is the saints' fault 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.620
 If not, you should not see 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.300
 remove the checks there we are like this is 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.920
 as you can see this has a lot of lighting 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.980
 that I take off for example these 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.300
 torches this I tell you they give you enough 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.070
 lighting this I think they give of 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.140
 lighting as if it were to the water if not 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.670
 I'm wrong because they look so great 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.170
 flashing when I have the shaders 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.120
 because they have the same lighting that 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.800
 wash this pro as you can see what 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.380
 The only thing we have to do is put the 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.480
 chef that we want and above we put this 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.820
 globe this is not going to give us this that's going to 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.770
 be this the wind chest that is going to be 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.070
 exactly the same thing exactly 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.620
 same is the same function but 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.480
 it will give light and occupy would base 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.430
 put light around as you can see here 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.760
 there is no light practically all the source 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.560
 of light comes directly from these chest 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.769
 and I do not know if he did that same seeing 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.810
 a certain variety to all the same already 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.370
 it's the same thing and here also 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.070
 this I finish this is the out 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.449
 obviously again west east and back 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.680
 well aligned but here he went to 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.229
 lose but good that you are going to do 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.889
 I do not know quite well the time I like it 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:35.020
 that there is this kind of thing is not such 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.610
 this time this balloon inches no no 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.530
 I would like it so much that they will add it and 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.760
 officially in the game but if you 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.169
 the colors of chilies also 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.810
 I would like to tell me what you think 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.250
 you who will relegate that kind of thing 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.610
 also here we have exactly what 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.680
 same only with this different kind 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.449
 with doubles not here like to put equally 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.220
 change the texture for example is 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:59.500
 put the texture but good is a 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.449
 simple stupid detail but then there 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.610
 is the detail is not there and I like it 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.670
 quite tell them they must try what I 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.350
 we're going to try what out 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.670
 and so not if you do not want you see everything 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.290
 weird I do not know fiber you see everything 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.910
 strange and so the traders already a pasta 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.310
 accustomed way but has already me 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.550
 again the shaders this good here 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.250
 we are in my castle and it 's fine but 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.080
 this castillito seriously is like a 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.360
 Castle of peace here more 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.920
 you can ask seriously but good this is 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.740
 practically everything just wanted 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.510
 show them good here it looks pretty 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.160
 different than home knabe the difference yes 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.890
 here I met yesterday they look different and they 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.020
 see much more this enlightened at least so 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.370
 in front the comparison of the torch 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.310
 the torch as that give one more light 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.840
 warm and this one gives a light like that more 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.210
 It is as strong say that like it 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.860
 the light of the lava does not wash it of health 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.780
 stronger or the light of the fire that gives 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.000
 this but good this is practically 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.500
 everything is going to end this here and 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.970
 they know everything is in the description for 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.620
 People who want to try it the time 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.540
 I tell you it's pretty good simple way 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.400
 this one I really like the very 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.350
 simple so here is here what 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.930
 they have good well ending this 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.640
 here so I hope you liked it 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.950
 we ended up here in the pastelito castle 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.310
 and well that will show us next 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.310
 two
