the Jolly corner by Henry James and I'm

the Jolly corner by Henry James and I'm
reading<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:23.240> for<00:02:23.390> my<00:02:23.480> American<00:02:23.840> literature

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
reading this for my American literature

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.650 
reading this for my American literature
class<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.740> they<00:02:25.520> were<00:02:25.580> pretty<00:02:25.880> good<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.540> know

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
class and they were pretty good you know

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.250 
class and they were pretty good you know
I<00:02:26.690> i<00:02:27.380> liked<00:02:27.710> it<00:02:27.920> i<00:02:28.100> thought<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:29.690> Daisy<00:02:29.960> Miller

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
I i liked it i thought that Daisy Miller

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.010 
I i liked it i thought that Daisy Miller
was<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.800> lot<00:02:31.100> better<00:02:31.310> than<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.780> Jolly

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
was a lot better than that the Jolly

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.530 
was a lot better than that the Jolly
corner<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.710> my<00:02:34.070> opinion<00:02:34.520> I<00:02:34.700> felt<00:02:35.270> like<00:02:35.360> I

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
corner and my opinion I felt like I

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.600 
corner and my opinion I felt like I
wasn't<00:02:36.070> as<00:02:37.870> intrigued<00:02:38.870> by<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:40.070> Jolly<00:02:40.280> corner

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
wasn't as intrigued by the Jolly corner

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.020 
wasn't as intrigued by the Jolly corner
and<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:42.200> wasn't<00:02:42.620> really<00:02:42.940> catching<00:02:43.940> my

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
and so it wasn't really catching my

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.970 
and so it wasn't really catching my
attention<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:44.959> had<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.170> focus<00:02:45.530> really<00:02:45.860> hard

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
attention so I had a focus really hard

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.610 
attention so I had a focus really hard
on<00:02:46.280> just<00:02:46.490> reading<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.150> which<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.930> know<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.410> not

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
on just reading it which you know is not

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.290 
on just reading it which you know is not
fun<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.370> last<00:02:49.550> three<00:02:49.760> books<00:02:49.910> i<00:02:50.090> read

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
fun and in the last three books i read

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.690 
fun and in the last three books i read
this<00:02:50.720> week<00:02:51.020> were<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.680> first<00:02:51.920> three<00:02:52.220> volumes

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
this week were the first three volumes

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.699 
this week were the first three volumes
of<00:02:53.150> fruits<00:02:53.600> basket<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.230> i've<00:02:54.290> been<00:02:54.440> really

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
of fruits basket and i've been really

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.230 
of fruits basket and i've been really
wanting<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.190> read<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.580> for<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.940> longest

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
wanting to read this for the longest

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.350 
wanting to read this for the longest
time<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.990> i<00:02:57.410> never<00:02:57.580> could<00:02:58.580> find<00:02:58.850> them<00:02:59.150> I

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
time and i never could find them I

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.940 
time and i never could find them I
didn't<00:02:59.690> necessarily<00:02:59.750> want<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.290> buy<00:03:00.590> them

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
didn't necessarily want to buy them

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.830 
didn't necessarily want to buy them
because<00:03:01.130> if<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.430> didn't<00:03:01.640> like<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.240> it's<00:03:02.510> kind<00:03:02.810> of

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
because if I didn't like it it's kind of

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.860 
because if I didn't like it it's kind of
a<00:03:02.900> lot<00:03:03.080> of<00:03:03.200> money<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:04.040> just<00:03:04.070> chance<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.360> book

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
a lot of money to just chance on a book

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.590 
a lot of money to just chance on a book
that<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.440> just<00:03:06.620> fly<00:03:06.830> through<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.600> it's

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
that you just fly through it and it's

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.060 
that you just fly through it and it's
just<00:03:08.870> it'd<00:03:09.170> be<00:03:09.260> kind<00:03:09.440> of<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.560> waste<00:03:09.709> of<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:09.950> and

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
just it'd be kind of a waste of it and

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.370 
just it'd be kind of a waste of it and
like<00:03:10.160> it<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.459> luckily<00:03:10.730> my<00:03:10.880> library<00:03:11.269> has<00:03:11.510> but

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
like it so luckily my library has but

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.229 
like it so luckily my library has but
pretty<00:03:12.620> wide<00:03:12.890> variety<00:03:13.370> among<00:03:13.459> actually<00:03:14.120> I'm

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
pretty wide variety among actually I'm

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.330 
pretty wide variety among actually I'm
pretty<00:03:14.360> lucky<00:03:14.570> with<00:03:14.780> that<00:03:14.900> so<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.739> got<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.100> 1st

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
pretty lucky with that so I got the 1st

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.920 
pretty lucky with that so I got the 1st
