00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.490
 the object of desire of almost all 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.550
 people in the world who fascinate with the salvo 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.160
 help solve instance discourages buying 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.599
 the ilona but few people know how to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.429
 fact is manufactured 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.070
 just like branches with a ballot are 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.469
 here in brazil do not stay 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.469
 check out today in the diary of the curious 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.760
 here in Brazil responsible for 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.800
 preparation of coins and banknotes at the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.030
 currency of Brazil located in the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.520
 Rio de Janeiro 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.010
 she was raised on March 18, 1969 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.820
 by the king of portugal dom pedro 2nd in 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.680
 savior 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.379
 in order to meet the demand for 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 manufacture of coins in Brazil more than 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.440
 300 years later 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.570
 besides meeting the demand for money 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.760
 here in the country our mint also 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.000
 produces safety products a 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.830
 passport with chip and its tax 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.049
 the industrial complex of rio de janeiro 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.270
 is one of the largest of its kind in the world 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.210
 The site operates the three 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.220
 coin and graph paper company 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.229
 where products with 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.549
 high quality standard required in the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.740
 model market 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.030
 everything starts with the paper used to 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.829
 print the money 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.439
 each consignment of paper that comes to the house 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.900
 of the currency carefully examined for 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.030
 avoid having any imperfection by 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.900
 example it is necessary to check the acidity 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.150
 of paper 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.189
 if it is not in the correct standard to give 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.110
 ink drying problem 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.149
 this role that is here as an example 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.329
 roberto is paper used for any 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.250
 production of the bristles there is a 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.320
 order the specific paper to face 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.790
 each type of year is the specific role 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.119
 for each type of ballot 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.930
 in this case here is the 5 reais of the first 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.490
 family 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.130
 These ideas are the result of a 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.740
 secret chemical combination that ensures 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.290
 a color pattern on each of the notes 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.429
 only in this process of checking ideas 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.189
 of paper are made more than 30 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.530
 these chemicals and a machine 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:17.019
 double fold call works folded 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.849
 and unfolding paper samples equal to 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.400
 what do you usually do with it in your 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.409
 need to ensure that the ballot paper 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.540
 resist for longer 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.239
 already the currencies are basically made of 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.849
 two materials stainless steel and steel 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.230
 low carbon of five cents and twenty 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.239
 and five cents that are little more 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.150
 also receives a bath of 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.090
 already 50 cent copper is practiced 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.950
 because of stainless steel as well as 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.930
 those of a real that also has a ring 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.840
 that is made of steel coated with 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.329
 cast bronze safe process of 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.220
 Making a coin is 12 hours 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.959
 despite the heart of the process the coinage 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.349
 12 occurs in a space frazão 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.230
 seconds that is made of a real currency and 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.680
 Look, she leaves the direct mail machine. 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.599
 It leaves right here hot it saw the temperature 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.370
 hot and here it turns out to be a 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.609
 kind of a bathtub a pool 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.439
 full of a real currency you've already seen 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.329
 so much coin along with a coin 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.579
 process in which the currency receives a stamp 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.949
 on both tracks of the disc 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.989
 this transfer is made cold and by 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:23.049
 means of pressure and equipment called 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.159
 presses the capacity of 800 coins with the 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.109
 last minute 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.519
 is a slightly less judicious process 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.379
 than that of banknotes 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.269
 for you to get an idea all over the world 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.220
 there are only four companies that 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.500
 supply the raw material to make the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.439
 Turn money paper here in Brazil. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.329
 only one supplier jumping in 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.310
 jump in the interior of são paulo 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.799
 each sheet produced only by 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.699
 using specific values ​​of the 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.949
 buyer 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:49.689
 then it receives a numbering and is 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:51.669
 accounted for and monitored 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.530
 this proves that even without numbers 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.189
 the leaves are already treated as 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.019
 money 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.879
 despite all the secrecy in the formulation 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.500
 From this role it is possible to know that it is the 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.620
 result of the combination of three blades 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.629
 of the river is a cotton paste as well as 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.370
 the raw material of the 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.159
 of the figures you should be 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.250
 asking the impression of the defendant or 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.470
 The combination of 17 paints are 17 colors 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.750
 overlapping groups divided into three groups 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.720
 each group for one type of print 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.120
 different 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.280
 the first ten inks give color to the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.180
 drawing of the background that was designed 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.730
 computer 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.920
 other extinct ones are used for 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.710
 of the ballots applied by means of 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.690
 fia calculations and know that you made 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.610
 denounces when the note is false and a 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.560
 well kept secret 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.020
 we only know that paints are used 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:45.620
 special for this it gets the note 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:47.960
 a kind of texture the whole process 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.090
 of creation of ballot is based on 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.250
 avoid counterfeits and increase 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.080
 life of each one of them and is 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.030
 precisely on the quality of inks 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.700
 is the secret is one of the main 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.070
 enemies of the notes is the light she can 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.080
 undo the curilas faster 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.120
 that it is forbidden to take 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.890
 flash photos in museums 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.260
 this ends up wearing the colors of the 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.020
 screens through all the processes of 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.960
 creation notes are held 1 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.460
 in a critique and sorting session where 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.230
 only women work 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.330
 according to those responsible for the 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.280
 Men do not have the patience and 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.200
 to catch small 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.370
 printing only looking at the notes 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:31.880
 in this column here 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.450
 a defect in the marked defect is this 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.580
 here o 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.160
 you can see that the ballot, so little honored 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.669
 then brown that this column is 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.010
 lost this ballot will be destroyed 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.860
 the accepted notes are cut stacked 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.840
 and packed ready to circulate more 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.400
 they only saw money even after they were 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.400
 backed by the central bank 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.860
 then look at the notes 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.110
 the other data calls attention to the 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.600
 lifetime of our right 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.210
 according to the central bank the 50 and 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.940
 100 reais have an average useful life of 37 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.550
 months while the 25 10 and 20 reais 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.890
 have a durability of 14 months in 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.050
 average 30% of the scores of two and five 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.580
 are so damaged that they do not 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.590
 may be in circulation 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.960
 the orientation of the central bank and 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.730
 People in possession of these notes deposited 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.890
 in a bank to enable the 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.170
 gathering and destroying them is good 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.940
 remember that destroy or damage 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.470
 money even with a scribble is 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.390
 considered a crime 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.130
 money that we use actually 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.120
 is not ours is considered equity 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.040
 of marriage 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.410
 the penalty for whoever destroys or 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.960
 deteriorate a note and detention of six 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.850
 months to three years and fine beyond penalty 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.770
 corresponding to violence 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.240
 and now that you know more or less 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.160
 how does it work 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.780
 already can give more value to your sweaty 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.780
 work see you soon
