00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.889
 I began to everyone Hello evening hero 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:14.530
 Last time I introduced here the basic voice of tuna great orange dj gun, but today is here 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:19.960
 I would like to try audio with various rock seeds 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.980
 Since then to be linked with the Warriors Saber we would like to introduce with you by all means to the end 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.529
 Please 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:32.050
 First is the voice play in chicks is from generation to generation life in the lock seed that is prepared here of random 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:34.770
 Want to live if again of this is First of all this activity recorded c the sky I think that like 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 I think that 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.670
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.170
 Oh oh oh oh 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.170
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.170
 Ha 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.100
 Ah ah ah 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 Ha 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.300
 Wow 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.300
 Ha 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.450
 r 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.209
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.209
 Ah ah ah 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:53.450
 Next, let's combine Muso Saber with this long-line large orange dj gun 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:59.130
 How to attach to the Muso Saber is quite simple 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:05.100
 Rotate the united joint while pressing this joint unlock button 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.780
 And just as it is just plugging the saver into this hole , but in this case 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:13.850
 It is this grip 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.850
 9 large sword mode grade will be pushed out Let's try actually go 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:27.220
 Completion of reconstruction mode is too long 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:32.230
 It's long, heavy and amazing 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:35.810
 Somehow but I remembered Shinkenger's blaze 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.440
 It is not a weight that this little haves children 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.300
 Click here to trigger the trial mode when it is merged 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.300
 We will hear two types of Zan撃音 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.860
 However, since the sound of Muso Saber also lives here, overtime sounds from here too 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:02.140
 This is a clear part of the orange dj gun, so it's also a great saver from here 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.140
 I can see the LED 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.440
 The trigger also sounds in gun mode so you can hear a total of three sounds 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.729
 In I would like to set the history seed in large sword mode here 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:58.229
 Then I chose randomly in the big sword mode 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.229
 I will listen to this 6-seed voice 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.150
 Ha 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:35.730
 Oh yeah 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.080
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.300
 Ha 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.980
 Go to bed early 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.440
 goo 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.340
 Ha 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:03.090
 Though there was not mention in the manual in particular 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:08.449
 I would like to set this orange circle too 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.449
 In this way, because it can be attached to Any 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:20.800
 It was quite a work of fit on the screen just another Naga in particular, was able to set without any problems 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:23.200
 If I might also appear this combination in the future in the play After lend another too long Homme 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:29.790
 It has become ridiculous too 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.790
 The review on part of the great orange dj gun part 2 ends up with again next time 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.580
 wh 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.300
 me 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.300
 me
