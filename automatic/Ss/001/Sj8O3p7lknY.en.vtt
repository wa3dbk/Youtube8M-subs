and know how it came about and how it
works

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
works

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.499 
works
you<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.680> kind<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.040> an<00:01:26.280> idea<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:27.060> how

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
you got to kind of have an idea of how

you got to kind of have an idea of how
this<00:01:27.810> works<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.500> how<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> scales<00:01:29.159> go<00:01:29.549> now<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
this works of how the scales go now to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.469 
this works of how the scales go now to
do<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.460> we're<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.640> keep<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.970> really

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
do that we're going to keep it really

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.530 
do that we're going to keep it really
really<00:01:33.689> simple<00:01:34.280> now<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> was<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> kid<00:01:36.270> and

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
a series of half and whole steps that's

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.260 
a series of half and whole steps that's
all<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:08.770> I<00:05:09.040> just<00:05:09.310> want<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.670> put<00:05:09.910> your<00:05:10.030> angst

away and just relax in this thing okay
half<00:05:13.480> step<00:05:13.810> is<00:05:14.110> what<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.940> distance<00:05:16.600> from<00:05:17.080> one

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
half step is what the distance from one

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.760 
half step is what the distance from one
dough<00:05:17.710> directly<00:05:18.700> to<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.030> next<00:05:19.420> remember<00:05:19.870> is<00:05:20.230> a

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
dough directly to the next remember is a

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.950 
dough directly to the next remember is a
halftone<00:05:21.520> we<00:05:21.880> talked<00:05:22.150> about<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.540> in<00:05:22.720> how<00:05:22.900> you

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
halftone we talked about that in how you

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.500 
halftone we talked about that in how you
build<00:05:23.290> chords<00:05:24.000> all<00:05:25.000> right

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
build chords all right

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.530 
build chords all right
so<00:05:25.840> for<00:05:26.350> me<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.770> see<00:05:27.130> there<00:05:27.490> is<00:05:27.520> no<00:05:27.970> note<00:05:28.270> in

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
so for me to see there is no note in

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.320 
so for me to see there is no note in
between<00:05:28.930> right<00:05:29.200> so<00:05:30.160> is<00:05:30.310> it<00:05:30.430> a<00:05:30.460> half<00:05:30.730> step<00:05:31.060> or<00:05:31.270> a

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
between right so is it a half step or a

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.750 
between right so is it a half step or a
whole<00:05:31.600> step<00:05:31.990> it's<00:05:32.980> a<00:05:33.130> half

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
whole step it's a half

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.440 
whole step it's a half
there<00:05:34.360> is<00:05:34.740> no<00:05:35.740> note<00:05:36.310> that<00:05:36.580> can<00:05:36.760> sound<00:05:37.090> between

one I'm just going to pick a note
well<00:07:15.310> let's<00:07:15.640> pick<00:07:15.930> C<00:07:17.550> okay<00:07:18.550> so<00:07:18.850> I'm<00:07:19.810> going<00:07:20.020> to

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
well let's pick C okay so I'm going to

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.340 
well let's pick C okay so I'm going to
make<00:07:20.260> a<00:07:20.290> city<00:07:20.650> scale<00:07:21.360> from<00:07:22.360> this<00:07:22.720> note<00:07:23.020> I'm

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.350 
make a city scale from this note I'm

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.530 
make a city scale from this note I'm
going<00:07:23.590> to<00:07:23.680> go<00:07:23.800> up<00:07:24.010> two<00:07:24.520> whole<00:07:24.910> steps

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:25.540 
going to go up two whole steps

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.970 
going to go up two whole steps
so<00:07:26.530> C<00:07:27.070> a<00:07:27.490> whole<00:07:27.820> step<00:07:28.090> from<00:07:28.150> C<00:07:28.570> is<00:07:28.720> what<00:07:28.990> CD

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:29.980 
so C a whole step from C is what CD

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.540 
so C a whole step from C is what CD
what's<00:07:30.940> a<00:07:31.060> whole<00:07:31.240> step<00:07:31.480> from<00:07:31.540> D<00:07:31.960> you<00:07:32.770> from

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.550 
what's a whole step from D you from

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.070 
what's a whole step from D you from
there<00:07:33.880> I<00:07:33.910> need<00:07:34.450> to<00:07:34.570> play<00:07:34.900> a<00:07:34.930> half<00:07:35.350> step<00:07:35.710> F<00:07:37.080> whole

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 
there I need to play a half step F whole

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:44.340 
there I need to play a half step F whole
step<00:07:38.530> to<00:07:38.920> G<00:07:39.360> whole<00:07:40.360> step<00:07:40.420> a<00:07:41.490> whole<00:07:42.490> step<00:07:42.870> B<00:07:43.870> and

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:44.350 
step to G whole step a whole step B and

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.500 
step to G whole step a whole step B and
if<00:07:44.800> we're<00:07:44.980> lucky<00:07:45.160> it's<00:07:45.640> a<00:07:45.730> half<00:07:45.940> step<00:07:45.970> at<00:07:46.390> the

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:46.510 
if we're lucky it's a half step at the

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.130 
if we're lucky it's a half step at the
very<00:07:46.750> end<00:07:47.160> back<00:07:48.160> to<00:07:48.190> see<00:07:48.670> you<00:07:49.270> will<00:07:49.450> start<00:07:49.930> on<00:07:50.080> a

Keys and three and two and three you

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.640 
Keys and three and two and three you
can't<00:08:00.670> that's<00:08:01.480> why<00:08:01.840> they're<00:08:02.050> sharps<00:08:02.470> and

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:02.650 
can't that's why they're sharps and

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.630 
can't that's why they're sharps and
flats<00:08:03.210> now<00:08:04.230> this<00:08:05.230> is<00:08:05.470> the<00:08:05.620> explanation<00:08:06.010> for

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:06.640 
flats now this is the explanation for

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.090 
flats now this is the explanation for
why<00:08:06.790> some<00:08:06.820> scales<00:08:07.510> have<00:08:07.780> sharps<00:08:08.230> and<00:08:08.440> some

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:09.100 
why some scales have sharps and some

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.090 
why some scales have sharps and some
scales<00:08:09.430> have<00:08:09.730> flat
