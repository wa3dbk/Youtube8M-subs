 the sales that 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.349
 we just started 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.649
 the vehicle was officially presented 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.260
 this October 15 obviously there were some previous presentations 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
 to the media pedro 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.940
 the time that has been achieved when it has been achieved now has already 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.880
 achieved that the pre-sale yesterday exceed the 500 units that is anticipated is a good 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.210
 starting point in a 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.320
 what makes us see that it's really going to be 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.469
 of the taste of the public 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.500
 tamén of the studios this new chevrolet product on TV 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.860
 9 7% and engine pnini 1400 day and some other engine that are planned by the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.640
 moment 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.000
 at this moment we have contemplated only this one engine 4 points 4 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.740
 that since 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.500
 the same family d engines in the corsa 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.900
 that the government tries has brought a superior technology Kuna because this is 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.530
 the first engine that is being 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.840
 manufacturing in Argentina with the one that buys with the norms euro 4 30 beating 2 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.060
 therefore it is very respectful of the environment and gives you a power is very 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.149
 interesting that it is 92 horses is given at 6 thousand revolutions 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.779
 It is obviously an 8-valve engine is an engine first of all very reliable 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.770
 Bernard 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.940
 that's what the two chevrolet shifts are working on 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.900
 of the manufacture of products 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.960
 and this auto tarp 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.240
 about to replace any of the chevrolet models with 1m 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.960
 the reality is that this chevrolet agile this is a jet to complement 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.390
 the product portfolio that is currently being marketed in Argentina 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.350
 yes the as well 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.680
 I decided it was occurring in the rosary floor that geek that chevrolet 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.370
 and in rosary in two shifts is a plant that undergoes a transformation 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.810
 total in the investment that was made to Isabella of more than 500 million pesos 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.659
 precisely for 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.309
 be able to start producing high quality cars that can be 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:21.219
 marketed 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.469
 around the world 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.469
 not just the chevrolet agile etts 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:28.060
 the first 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.800
 shows of this technology of this quality with which it is 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.299
 producing in Argentina 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.359
 and it is a vehicle that has to be a center r &amp; d center of chevrolet 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:39.509
 why 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:44.439
 in its lines lanús the new a tn of the brand and zero lecce-cesena will renew 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.989
 it looks like none 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.499
 no doubt it is one is a very modern design very robust there is a very clear 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:51.389
 high 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:52.749
 Herrera in front 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:57.589
 ideal for the paths to be very fresh very fresh ideal for on the roads of 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.359
 understand this region 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.849
 bernardo please tell me values ​​d from here we have just the 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.969
 world against of the range values 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:10.799
 good this vehicle comes in three versions the ls that is the base understand 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.529
 50 thousand 800 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:14.519
 in Argentine pesos and 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.959
 and in what of 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.360
 already in this version tennis technology per hundred very important as is the 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.029
 Automatic cruise control speed or in dido 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:28.309
 Automatic lightning onboard computer in pinto connectivity 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.389
 that this car brought in percent is important 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.129
 and after the other versions that is the lt and the ltz 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.189
 where he the maximum price of that sense thousand pesos 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.310
 percent 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.260
 very many the last week that is to come and thank you for treating us of the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.529
 self-proclaimed that in the study a pleasure of values ​​of the new 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:48.889
 the problem in a thigh 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.959
 behind gando all Latin America from Mexico including of course 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.790
 to all the rest of Latin America and of course we are showing in this 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.189
 moment this new chevrolet product 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.049
 that is made here in another country in rosario 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.039
 about 300 kilometers from the federal capital 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:10.079
 continue counting a bit of the Mexican market that is making mexico 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.729
 how many ford cars 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:15.229
 the Mexican market that when they eat them we have to say that for me 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.839
 At least it is the industry that produces with better quality in all Latin America 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.650
 especially stressed that they are also exported to the United States just 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.079
 this reason when you believe that a car sepor from the United States and Argentina 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.379
 and it comes from mexico I understand why it's great 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:33.469
 but its marking of n a million units usually or 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.990
 practically twice as much as in Argentina 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.629
 However, this year it is previously falling by 30%, it is expected to sell 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.370
 about 700 thousand units is an important peace fall 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.789
 let's say a strange thing before, because it kills the Argentine market 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:55.050
 that leads in the initial team against her mind something more than 10% the marker 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.509
 supporters of forgetic and ocean abortions heavily influenced by what the 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:03.270
 the industry also and the North American brands 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:08.270
 extreme to say that both jortos rotates general motors nissan football in 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.210
 Craymer and Honda manufacture in Mexico 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.210
 and we are going to see them the cars to the year that here is a curiosity 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.059
 the best selling car is the tsuru nissan 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:21.239
 what is really the nissan sentra that many countries are known 

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:25.469
 Latin Americans from Argentina but another third generation is a car that 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.329
 has already been surpassed even in technology for people follow it 

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:30.969
 buying and used a lot as a taxi 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.189
 and second that of the judge baths state of emergency we know him as betoret and 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:38.189
 the chevrolet aveo 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.240
 gago we do not manufacture 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.240
 with regard to steering systems 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.849
 vehicles 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.849
 of all brands 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.289
 we do not only to open and asses 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.879
 We also orientate for the competition part where we are today 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:23.400
 providers would tell you almost of all the cars that are 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.279
 running road tourism 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.300
 filtering 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.300
 rb6 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.680
 before the first time 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.360
 Our company tried to diversify both for the domestic market and for 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.439
 what is export 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.020
 and good and we have a strong presence 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.020
 especially in Brazil 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.199
 We are focused as I mentioned 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.659
 strongly to the replacement market 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.139
 both here and in Brazil 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.139
 Brazil is a very important market address box 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.710
 we are already developing boxes 

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:05.249
 vehicle that have electric power steering 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.330
 we make the product fb 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.719
 which is entirely manufactured here in our company 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:15.719
 we have a second brand 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:17.419
 that if you see 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.790
 where we train to assemble here 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.680
 product that we bring, we import 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.680
 It is a second cheaper brand 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:29.779
 see to experiment to see if 

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:32.249
 we can enter what is original equipment
