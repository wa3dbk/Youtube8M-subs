00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
all the way back to the screw like this

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.650 
all the way back to the screw like this
one<00:03:51.190> here<00:03:51.370> if<00:03:51.460> you<00:03:51.550> notice<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:51.970> went<00:03:52.090> only<00:03:52.240> so

there's gonna be out of sight we're
gonna<00:03:55.840> have<00:03:56.050> this<00:03:56.230> position<00:03:56.710> back<00:03:56.890> here<00:03:57.160> to

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
gonna have this position back here to

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.430 
gonna have this position back here to
where<00:03:57.310> nobody<00:03:57.550> can<00:03:57.820> see<00:03:58.240> it<00:03:58.390> I<00:03:58.570> mean<00:03:58.960> -<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.200> mean

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
just fine now already secured one looks

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.540 
just fine now already secured one looks
pretty<00:04:23.110> good<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.710> again<00:04:23.920> this<00:04:24.100> will<00:04:24.250> be<00:04:24.280> from

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
pretty good and again this will be from
