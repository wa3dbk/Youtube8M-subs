00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
in here I may have mixed it up because

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.909 
in here I may have mixed it up because
of<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.540> compass<00:04:06.540> as<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.870> can<00:04:06.989> see<00:04:07.139> diet<00:04:07.500> we

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
of the compass as you can see diet we

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.689 
of the compass as you can see diet we
won<00:04:08.099> and<00:04:08.629> you<00:04:09.629> gain<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.199> avoid<00:04:10.829> points<00:04:11.250> every

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
won and you gain to avoid points every

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.270 
won and you gain to avoid points every
game<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.720> it's<00:04:13.229> very<00:04:13.530> hard<00:04:13.739> as<00:04:13.859> you<00:04:13.979> can<00:04:14.069> see

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
game so it's very hard as you can see

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.270 
game so it's very hard as you can see
and<00:04:14.489> also<00:04:15.389> you<00:04:15.449> have<00:04:15.569> some<00:04:15.810> coins<00:04:16.280> yeah

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
even your void ray injure armor I

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.800 
even your void ray injure armor I
basically<00:04:42.550> wanted<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.240> raise<00:04:45.240> my<00:04:46.240> range<00:04:46.480> level
