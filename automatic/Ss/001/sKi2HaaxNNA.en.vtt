00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.170

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.290
 places for that I was chosen among them 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.330
 this good and they changed a picture of me and 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.450

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.219
 petter like whatever it is I feel very 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.739
 proud of that because sometimes it's very 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:13.120
 hard to work outside but it's more 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:17.359
 hard to work here in Argentina because 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.120
 always has the most open door the 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.209
 people from Buenos Aires that the people of 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.319

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.930
 I changed the make-up wash 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.879
 before a fight and we happened to be a 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:51.299
 show and I broke a rib 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:54.019
