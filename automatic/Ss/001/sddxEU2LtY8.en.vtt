00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
boat using the flush out attachment on a

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.440 
boat using the flush out attachment on a
hose<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.370> hook<00:00:08.370> up<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.610> hose<00:00:08.639> there<00:00:09.210> I

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
hose you hook up a hose there I

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.709 
hose you hook up a hose there I
recommend<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.050> quick<00:00:10.170> connect<00:00:10.559> on<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.719> you

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
recommend a quick connect on that you

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.049 
recommend a quick connect on that you
order<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.110> which<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.410> flush<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.799> out<00:00:13.950> did<00:00:14.910> you

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
order in which you flush it out did you

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.680 
order in which you flush it out did you
turn<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.139> engine<00:00:16.529> first<00:00:17.390> turn<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
turn on the engine first turn on the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.380 
turn on the engine first turn on the
water<00:00:19.160> let<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.189> run<00:00:20.490> for<00:00:20.760> about<00:00:20.820> couple

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
water let it run for about couple

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.590 
water let it run for about couple
minutes<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.199> rev<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:23.060> real<00:00:24.060> quick<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
minutes you can rev it real quick and

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.650 
minutes you can rev it real quick and
then<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.439> turn<00:00:25.710> off<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.130> water<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.670> then<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
then you turn off the water and then the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.160 
then you turn off the water and then the
engine<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.010> engine<00:00:29.490> water<00:00:29.880> water<00:00:30.480> engine

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
engine so it's engine water water engine

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.370 
engine so it's engine water water engine
and<00:00:31.759> I<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:32.910> hook<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.360> before<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.110> turn

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and I would hook this up before you turn

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.569 
and I would hook this up before you turn
on<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.800> engine<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.600> it<00:00:36.600> goes<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.579> we

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
on the engine and it goes right here we

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.650 
on the engine and it goes right here we
have<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> little<00:00:39.110> knob<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.140> there<00:00:41.239> you<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.480> this

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
have a little knob on there you see this

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
have a little knob on there you see this
knob<00:00:44.059> it's<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.210> male<00:00:45.600> connector<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:47.489> this

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
knob it's a male connector to this

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:59.240 
knob it's a male connector to this
female<00:00:48.300> connector<00:00:49.520> goes<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.829> like<00:00:52.829> this

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.490 

you<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.940> push<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.390> straight<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you just push it straight on and it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.780 
you just push it straight on and it
clicks<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.510> then<00:01:03.510> you're<00:01:03.720> good<00:01:04.129> you<00:01:05.129> screw

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
clicks in and then you're good you screw

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.880 
clicks in and then you're good you screw
I<00:01:06.000> recommend<00:01:06.630> screwing<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.290> quick-connect

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
I recommend screwing and a quick-connect

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.680 
I recommend screwing and a quick-connect
there<00:01:08.160> you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.670> screw<00:01:09.000> your<00:01:09.240> hose<00:01:09.390> into

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
there you can just screw your hose into

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.820 
there you can just screw your hose into
here<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:11.729> once<00:01:11.940> it's<00:01:12.120> all<00:01:12.240> hooked<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.660> like<00:01:13.650> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
here and once it's all hooked up like I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.359 
here and once it's all hooked up like I
said<00:01:14.270> turn<00:01:15.270> battery<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.220> plug<00:01:17.220> your<00:01:17.810> key<00:01:18.810> in

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
said turn battery on plug your key in

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.420 
said turn battery on plug your key in
start<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.580> engine<00:01:20.910> with<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.210> switch<00:01:22.430> you

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
start the engine with this switch you

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.930 
start the engine with this switch you
have<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.610> put<00:01:23.940> it<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.180> neutral<00:01:25.400> to<00:01:26.400> start<00:01:26.760> the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
have to put it in neutral to start the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.840 
have to put it in neutral to start the
engine<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.450> keep<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.020> reverse<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:29.580> lower

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
engine I keep it in reverse to lower

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.260 
engine I keep it in reverse to lower
down<00:01:30.320> gear<00:01:31.320> shifting<00:01:31.800> this<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.850> gears

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
down gear shifting this is the gears

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.950 
down gear shifting this is the gears
this<00:01:34.020> goes<00:01:34.259> down<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:35.070> reverse<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.720> water

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
this goes down for reverse so the water

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.889 
this goes down for reverse so the water
blows<00:01:37.670> forward<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.200> put<00:01:40.410> it<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.590> neutral

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
blows forward so you put it in neutral

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.950 
blows forward so you put it in neutral
to<00:01:42.899> start<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> engine<00:01:44.300> then<00:01:45.300> you<00:01:45.539> would<00:01:45.720> turn

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
to start the engine then you would turn

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.749 
to start the engine then you would turn
on<00:01:46.020> your<00:01:46.380> water<00:01:46.619> flowing<00:01:47.490> through<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.970> engine

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
on your water flowing through the engine

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.730 
on your water flowing through the engine
immediately<00:01:50.759> after<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.360> has<00:01:51.750> been<00:01:52.200> started

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
immediately after it has been started

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.430 
immediately after it has been started
and<00:01:53.180> you<00:01:54.180> could<00:01:54.330> let<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.509> run<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.050> 2<00:01:55.229> or<00:01:55.380> 3

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
and you could let it run for 2 or 3

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.200 
and you could let it run for 2 or 3
minutes

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
minutes

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.749 
minutes
occasionally<00:01:57.210> rev<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.229> bit<00:01:58.410> I

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
occasionally rev it a little bit I

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.160 
occasionally rev it a little bit I
believe<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.970> rev<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.840> put<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.080> in

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
believe to rev it you have to put it in

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.160 
believe to rev it you have to put it in
forward<00:02:01.500> or<00:02:02.190> reverse<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:03.630> put<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:03.930> forward

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
forward or reverse you put it in forward

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.530 
forward or reverse you put it in forward
and<00:02:04.409> rev<00:02:04.650> it<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:05.010> that

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
and rev it like that

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.530 
and rev it like that
and<00:02:06.560> then<00:02:07.560> when<00:02:07.710> you're<00:02:07.830> finished<00:02:08.209> you<00:02:09.209> turn

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
and then when you're finished you turn

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.210 
and then when you're finished you turn
off<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:11.340> water<00:02:12.350> go<00:02:13.350> back<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.650> your<00:02:13.739> hose<00:02:13.890> bib

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
off the water go back to your hose bib

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.310 
off the water go back to your hose bib
or<00:02:14.580> if<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> valve<00:02:15.269> on<00:02:15.540> your<00:02:15.600> hose<00:02:15.900> turn

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
or if you have a valve on your hose turn

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.150 
or if you have a valve on your hose turn
it<00:02:16.500> off<00:02:17.360> then<00:02:18.410> what<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.470> would<00:02:19.680> do

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
it off then what I would do

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.630 
it off then what I would do
rev<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.610> again<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.810> clear<00:02:22.170> out<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.620> water<00:02:22.860> so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
rev it again to clear out the water so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.120 
rev it again to clear out the water so
it<00:02:23.760> stays<00:02:24.030> dry<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.660> then<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.620> turn<00:02:25.799> off<00:02:25.980> your

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
it stays dry and then you turn off your

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.319 
it stays dry and then you turn off your
engine<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:27.570> then<00:02:27.750> when<00:02:27.900> you're<00:02:28.019> done<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.670> put

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
engine and then when you're done you put

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.360 
engine and then when you're done you put
