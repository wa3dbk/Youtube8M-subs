a<00:00:44.829> huge<00:00:45.100> sweater<00:00:45.460> yet<00:00:45.699> so<00:00:46.420> I<00:00:46.449> love<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.110> color

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
a huge sweater yet so I love the color

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.200 
a huge sweater yet so I love the color
combo<00:00:47.770> on<00:00:47.890> this<00:00:48.039> one<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.489> reminds<00:00:48.850> me<00:00:48.910> of<00:00:49.030> the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
combo on this one it reminds me of the

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
combo on this one it reminds me of the
90s<00:00:49.719> early<00:00:50.020> 90s<00:00:50.230> exist<00:00:51.129> to<00:00:51.910> be<00:00:52.059> exact<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:52.870> I

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
90s early 90s exist to be exact and I

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.930 
90s early 90s exist to be exact and I
just<00:00:53.469> think<00:00:53.680> it's<00:00:53.890> really<00:00:54.100> fun<00:00:54.550> and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
just think it's really fun and

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.880 
just think it's really fun and
especially<00:00:55.300> with<00:00:55.780> that<00:00:55.930> blue<00:00:56.199> in<00:00:56.410> it<00:00:56.559> it<00:00:56.680> adds

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
especially with that blue in it it adds

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.400 
especially with that blue in it it adds
a<00:00:57.100> nice<00:00:57.250> pop<00:00:57.609> so<00:00:58.359> I<00:00:58.390> paired<00:00:58.870> it<00:00:59.019> with<00:00:59.079> this

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
a nice pop so I paired it with this

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.229 
a nice pop so I paired it with this
skirt<00:00:59.739> that<00:00:59.890> was<00:00:59.980> already<00:01:00.340> in<00:01:00.519> my<00:01:00.640> closet

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
skirt that was already in my closet

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.740 
skirt that was already in my closet
that's<00:01:01.629> leather<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.649> it<00:01:02.769> has<00:01:03.010> sort<00:01:03.399> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
that's leather and it has sort of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.180 
that's leather and it has sort of
sections<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:04.869> whether<00:01:05.140> it's<00:01:05.410> high-waisted

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
sections of whether it's high-waisted

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.700 
sections of whether it's high-waisted
really<00:01:06.970> comfortable<00:01:07.600> you've<00:01:08.200> seen<00:01:08.440> it<00:01:08.590> before

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
really comfortable you've seen it before

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.270 
really comfortable you've seen it before
and<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:10.450> like<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:11.110> because<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.920> doesn't<00:01:11.950> have<00:01:12.250> a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
and I like it because it doesn't have a

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.279 
and I like it because it doesn't have a
lining<00:01:12.729> so<00:01:12.970> it's<00:01:13.149> pretty<00:01:13.420> thin<00:01:13.869> that<00:01:14.140> you

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
lining so it's pretty thin that you

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:15.359 
lining so it's pretty thin that you
should<00:01:14.500> think<00:01:14.619> about<00:01:14.800> that<00:01:15.099> when<00:01:15.250> you're

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
should think about that when you're

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.669 
should think about that when you're
getting<00:01:15.490> leather<00:01:16.119> skirts<00:01:16.569> as<00:01:16.810> well<00:01:16.990> sometimes

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
getting leather skirts as well sometimes

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.160 
getting leather skirts as well sometimes
they<00:01:18.039> can<00:01:18.250> be<00:01:18.340> booked<00:01:18.580> up<00:01:18.819> by<00:01:19.300> having<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.720> lining

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
they can be booked up by having a lining

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.740 
they can be booked up by having a lining
that's<00:01:20.289> really<00:01:20.679> not<00:01:21.039> necessary<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.390> it's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
that's really not necessary so it's

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.419 
that's really not necessary so it's
really<00:01:22.929> great<00:01:23.229> that<00:01:23.259> when<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.890> skirt<00:01:24.130> doesn't

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
really great that when the skirt doesn't

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.100 
really great that when the skirt doesn't
have<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.729> lining<00:01:25.000> especially<00:01:25.599> a<00:01:25.630> leather<00:01:25.869> one

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
have a lining especially a leather one

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.809 
have a lining especially a leather one
you<00:01:26.259> don't<00:01:26.440> want<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.649> add<00:01:26.709> any<00:01:26.950> extra<00:01:27.069> bulk<00:01:27.640> in

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
you don't want to add any extra bulk in

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.150 
you don't want to add any extra bulk in
the<00:01:27.849> hip<00:01:28.060> area<00:01:28.270> so<00:01:29.259> then<00:01:29.500> I<00:01:29.530> went<00:01:29.800> for<00:01:29.979> some

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
the hip area so then I went for some

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.540 
the hip area so then I went for some
military<00:01:30.670> inspired<00:01:31.300> shoes<00:01:31.869> these<00:01:32.739> are<00:01:33.220> just

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
military inspired shoes these are just

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.699 
military inspired shoes these are just
ankle<00:01:33.910> boots<00:01:34.090> with<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.390> peep<00:01:34.599> toe<00:01:34.709> perfect

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
for this time of year because I can't

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.969
