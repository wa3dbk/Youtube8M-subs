00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.420
 ask Lenin Elena 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.920
 Good day, please tell me 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.309
 they say that our Lord is unpleasant 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.539
 I can't read emotions 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.550
 prayer salad Eric office in monotone 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.180
 I always get an expression 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:29.640
 is it really bad thanks no it 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.000
 not bad and strange what you were told about 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.010
 that God dislikes our emotions or you 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.820
 told a lie or you are wrong 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.579
 have understood 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.530
 the remark that you made when 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.280
 reading of the canon of akathistus or psaltiri 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.090
 the fact is that there is such a rule 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.530
 if you are elena being a reader 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.910
 temple then in this case yes indeed 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:03.719
 it is necessary to read monotonously and evenly 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:08.220
 extra emotion is the rule of the church 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.770
 reading and it is done intentionally in order 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.299
 so that the listeners may pray and 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.210
 attach their prayers to these 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.580
 own feelings your own 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.580
 emotions are your own experience 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:33.720
 This rule is very necessary precisely in 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:38.490
 church reading in this case if the reader 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.650
 reading with emotionally expression he 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.420
 thus impose their 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.380
 own emotions with her own 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.850
 experience 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.020
 to other people this is already wrong 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.979
 if you pray 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.840
 1 and at home you can 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.740
 pray as you please 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.950
 cry 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.930
 you can rejoice you can 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.100
 show your emotions like you 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.280
 I want to 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.270
 because this is your personal prayer this 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.040
 same your personal experience and i don't think 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.040
 that it will be unpleasant to god
