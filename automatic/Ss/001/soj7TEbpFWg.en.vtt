00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
to do that in any other event so it was

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.120 
to do that in any other event so it was
basically<00:01:19.750> like<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.140> Olympics<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.650> surfing

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
and I found that it was paying motional

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.260 
and I found that it was paying motional
when<00:01:24.520> your<00:01:25.240> teammates<00:01:25.690> won<00:01:26.080> or<00:01:26.440> lost<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:27.270> it

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270
