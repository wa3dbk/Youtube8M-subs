sounds cheesy but hey my name is cheesy
bricks<00:00:53.940> tears<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.670> I'll<00:00:56.670> give<00:00:56.880> you<00:00:56.970> a<00:00:57.030> 360<00:00:57.540> view

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
bricks tears so I'll give you a 360 view

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.119 
bricks tears so I'll give you a 360 view
and<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:01.410> bank<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.130> a<00:01:02.970> combination<00:01:03.660> lot<00:01:04.129> only

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and the bank is a combination lot only

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.510 
and the bank is a combination lot only
two<00:01:05.280> digits<00:01:05.519> only<00:01:05.850> two<00:01:06.180> years

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.630 

so<00:01:10.119> when<00:01:10.689> pushing<00:01:11.079> this<00:01:11.200> button<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.520> don't

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
so when pushing this button you don't

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.240 
so when pushing this button you don't
get<00:01:12.850> anything<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.380> I'd<00:01:14.500> like<00:01:14.649> my<00:01:14.710> other

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
get anything and I'd like my other

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.600 
get anything and I'd like my other
machines<00:01:15.640> can't<00:01:16.540> shake<00:01:16.840> anything<00:01:17.350> else<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
machines can't shake anything else so

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.880 
machines can't shake anything else so
what<00:01:22.600> this<00:01:22.810> machine<00:01:23.110> does<00:01:23.619> is<00:01:23.920> that<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.680> takes

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
what this machine does is that it takes

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
what this machine does is that it takes
ten<00:01:27.460> cents<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:28.060> dime<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.950> dime<00:01:30.220> is<00:01:30.399> ten<00:01:30.610> cents

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
ten cents a dime so dime is ten cents

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.789 
ten cents a dime so dime is ten cents
but<00:01:32.049> if<00:01:32.740> you<00:01:32.920> don't<00:01:33.130> have<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.399> dump<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:34.360> takes

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
but if you don't have a dump it takes

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.700 
but if you don't have a dump it takes
two<00:01:35.799> nickels<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.570> then<00:01:37.689> each<00:01:38.170> nickel<00:01:38.590> is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
two nickels and then each nickel is

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.679 
two nickels and then each nickel is
worth<00:01:38.740> five<00:01:39.159> cents<00:01:39.429> two<00:01:40.119> nickels<00:01:40.479> together

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
worth five cents two nickels together

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.490 
worth five cents two nickels together
equals<00:01:41.229> ten<00:01:41.409> cents<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:42.340> same<00:01:42.700> price<00:01:43.440> as<00:01:44.440> a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
equals ten cents the same price as a

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.719 
equals ten cents the same price as a
dime<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.500> don't<00:01:50.679> get<00:01:50.799> anything<00:01:51.069> I<00:01:51.459> can't

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
dime so you don't get anything I can't

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.180 
dime so you don't get anything I can't
shake<00:01:51.940> anything<00:01:52.330> out<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.530> can<00:01:53.799> take<00:01:54.009> a

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
shake anything out so you can take a

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.050 
shake anything out so you can take a
dime<00:01:54.750> put<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:55.840> in<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:55.959> console

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:12.180 

push<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:06.060> Stardust<00:02:07.170> right<00:02:08.170> yeah<00:02:11.190> then

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
push and get Stardust right yeah then

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.170 
push and get Stardust right yeah then
you<00:02:12.280> just<00:02:12.459> pull<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.209> back<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:15.310> what<00:02:15.700> once

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
you just pull it back and is what once

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:26.350 
you just pull it back and is what once
more<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:18.780> eight<00:02:19.780> one<00:02:20.590> nipple

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.590 

and<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.450> doesn't<00:02:27.630> work<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.230> still<00:02:28.380> locked<00:02:29.600> so

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
and it doesn't work it's still locked so

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.150 
and it doesn't work it's still locked so
you<00:02:30.660> put<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:31.050> another<00:02:31.290> nickel<00:02:33.800> needs<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.920> little

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
you put in another nickel needs a little

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.130 
you put in another nickel needs a little
juggling<00:02:35.340> sometimes<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:37.230> then<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.410> push<00:02:39.140> you

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
juggling sometimes and then you push you

00:02:40.140 --> 00:03:51.770 
juggling sometimes and then you push you
gotta

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.970 

so<00:03:52.780> when<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.170> machine<00:03:53.470> has<00:03:53.620> run<00:03:53.830> out<00:03:53.860> of

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
so when the machine has run out of

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.430 
so when the machine has run out of
rounds<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.520> you<00:03:54.580> want<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.910> get<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.150> money

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
rounds and you want to get you money

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:05.600 
rounds and you want to get you money
turn<00:03:56.440> this<00:03:56.620> around<00:03:59.280> down<00:04:00.280> here<00:04:01.230> is<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.470> batter

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.550 

right<00:04:06.610> now<00:04:06.760> is<00:04:07.060> what<00:04:09.660> this<00:04:10.660> red<00:04:10.960> thing<00:04:11.200> can

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
right now is what this red thing can

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:23.640 
right now is what this red thing can
turn<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:12.070> off<00:04:13.860> so<00:04:14.860> combination<00:04:15.820> is<00:04:19.170> red<00:04:22.650> then

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
turn it off so combination is red then

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.540 
turn it off so combination is red then
dark<00:04:24.070> green<00:04:25.200> then<00:04:26.200> you<00:04:26.320> could<00:04:26.470> turn<00:04:26.560> this<00:04:26.770> you

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
dark green then you could turn this you

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.510 
dark green then you could turn this you
pull<00:04:27.820> this<00:04:27.940> out

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.120 

there's<00:04:31.180> oil<00:04:31.360> money

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.580 

lift<00:04:38.130> up<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.670> dial<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:40.020> then<00:04:40.200> it<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.440> locked

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
lift up the dial and then it is locked
