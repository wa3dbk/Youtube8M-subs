from Terry tonight which LEDs I think to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.130

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
their second goal yeah so yeah I mean he

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.649 
their second goal yeah so yeah I mean he
doesn't<00:01:04.500> really<00:01:04.790> make<00:01:05.790> many<00:01:06.030> mistakes<00:01:06.210> so
