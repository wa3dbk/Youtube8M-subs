00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.660
 yes 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.270
 Now you are all the same and today we have a 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.360
 departure of fly in field I have been 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.790
 playing on the map of this last map 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.470
 the end game that called emb walk 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.939
 flatts 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.580
 as answers for hungry kim 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.369
 lift flaps as well call the 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.340
 the planes of the cne send and I think 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.859
 which is a map re super shit for everything 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.840
 unless you're in the air for real 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.699
 I do not like this map, it seems to me that 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.800
 a rock is ridiculous when you play 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.380
 assault on this map is absolutely 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.030
 idiot because that is not just because 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.890
 it is called as well as the planes the plain 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.840
 the mountains are back in the field of 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.760
 game where are you really there's no where 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.710
 It then cover you is like a party 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.170
 sniper if those who defend it have 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.059
 too easy to defend the points 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.350
 attack and those who attack is almost 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.329
 impossible to get over all 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.239
 games of 64 players then I do not know 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.680
 in general the map I do not like but as 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.059
 everyone always make me a cold that has 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.170
 some kind of balance and that 's one of 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.020
 the contractions so much that 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.450
 like the game have you are epic 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.490
 aerial battles and they are just so 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.930
 effective for the same reason as those that do not 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.240
 I like to play on earth 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.550
 because in the air there is no part to cover you 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.410
 then when you hold onto a 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.450
 enemy to fly becomes a 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.920
 full question of which of the two 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.320
 manages to dodge the other because there is no 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.900
 big mountains if you remember 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.240
 in other maps other maps are one can 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.340
 fly between the mountains hide to the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.750
 part of the rivers go down and up between 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.420
 the trees try to make the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.810
 enemy shock here to part of I do not know 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.670
 let's say those fans the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.050
 propellers that are there in the background fly 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.460
 between the propellers to see if the enemy 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.649
 I'm following you on the other plane 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.119
 shock really do not have much where 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.910
 hide some mountains there are others that 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.229
 They are very tiny, and that 's why I 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.720
 love the people who ride the 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.100
 plane and probably they do not know to 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.509
 Sometimes I feel like the enemy of 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.810
 feel like a little humiliated because 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.670
 in pc I have a low level still 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.170
 no no I'm not eaglet anything I think 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.759
 I'm on like level 30 or something like that 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.560
 then surely they should be very 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.630
 chopped when they see a pilot dial 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.780
 rookie grabs mounts and can not 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.780
 pay 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.580
 Of course I will not say that I am the best 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.070
 pilot of the world for nothing the other day 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.900
 rather I was with in a game in the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.070
 that on the contrary in the team 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.560
 contrary in fact it was in this very 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.500
 map on the opposite team the pilot 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.290
 otherwise I was had was eaglet 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.090
 100 and it was indestructible so I do not 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.620
 I think I think I had never flown 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.209
 against someone as good as that guy 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.740
 it was impossible or not only the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.690
 impossible to tear down but it was 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.310
 impossible to follow and the kind of 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.900
 maneuvers that no longer understood how the 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.520
 he did and he always stood behind me and in 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.130
 Two seconds killed me or they split 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.970
 I think that by the time I got fed up and 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.820
 I changed equipment 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.200
 lie the admin the harding of the 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.400
 team exchange game because I like 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.800
 is doing a lot of damage in the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.930
 plane but when they changed my team 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.690
 and I was already in the team of him I think 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.390
 the time was going 28 to 2 I think I do not remember 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.950
 28 30 20 it was very exaggerated what 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.380
 I was carrying the score in the trillions they were 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.880
 as I think the game with the lowest 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.010
 that I have done by plane in fact 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.989
 they were not even on xbox he went on in the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.390
 compu I think it 's in play and it was like 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.000
 17 to 0 before they let me down and playing 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.050
 in assault on the border of on the edge 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.910
 from caspian 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.190
 that the truth is that it is very exaggerated what 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.690
 which is done on airplanes for example 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.400
 if they see me I was carrying the guided missile 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.330
 of ground air was because just 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.750
 a while ago I was playing assault and 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.130
 I was flying in the assault plane of 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.320
 what is it called up to kart and there are 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.180
 land and there I do use the 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.770
 missile remote control say the missile 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.780
 directed from air to ground and especially 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.470
 the reason is because they see as here already 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.150
 he had changed the legs and the reasons 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.630
 that's why it 's because it's much more 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.520
 Cash see the style well 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.050
 always within active and always 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.760
 he saw it he tried to kill by the way here 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.050
 there is one of the things that we had 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.070
 talked about in other videos and sorry and 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.540
 I'm a little scattered but 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.600
 important there is that it is an access my 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.890
 videos in one of my previous videos 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.360
 of the wish list we had talked about the 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.940
 dinosaurs and is that you know that 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.040
 here on the floor you can find the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.190
 skeleton of a tyrannosaurus rex or some 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.290
 predatory dinosaur and can find 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.930
 obviously this flying dinosaur from 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.630
 pterodactyl that makes you wonder if 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.640
 really the people who talk there is 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.769
 invented are rumors of dino survival 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.889
 mode and all that 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.539
 too active for the bar option 4 if 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.840
 they will have done it only because they are 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:32.419
 these 16 sister ex of the dinosaurs 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.590
 that the truth I do not know I do not know 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.060
 well what is the interest that is what 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.500
 you can discover apart from discovering 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.599
 flying 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.659
 or if really already someone really does not 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:44.150
 has in mind that it will be something 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.949
 real that we are going to have in variation 4 not 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.259
 I know the thing is that for me in my head 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.330
 this is like aha as something that 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.340
 has me super hooked in my head 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.620
 and from here I think how the baron goes 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.599
 field 4 will surely do great so 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.180
 of the dinosaurs is that really not 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.740
 I can imagine it if it was not 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.020
 you know how the rumors are sometimes 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.909
 one would expect something that would be too much 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.530
 chiva to see and does not change what is 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.669
 point of passing the epic medium managed 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.770
 destroy the guy just when 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.419
 it exploded the plane jumped because it swears that 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.880
 to the floor and see where my plane will not 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.139
 matter how dad went up or 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.789
 is there a bat to explain to me what 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.370
 points happened there 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:23.210
 I run away the plane goes flying up 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.229
 up and the bastard takes off or goes no 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.190
 I understand if I had been the 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.249
 question if I had stayed 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.749
 mounted on the plane would have survived 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.119
 I'm sure it definitely does not 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:33.889
 has gone straight to the floor and here we go 

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:35.629
 coming to the end of the video my guys 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.669
 it was nothing more about the lukewarm because he had 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.309
 I want to fly a while this time I'm going to 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.809
 do I will continue uploading videos of 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:43.669
 airplanes and helicopters but always like this 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:46.159
 shorties because already on other occasions I 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.839
 they have said that I have a lot of feedback 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.609
 people who have told me that it is boring 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:51.559
 my aerial videos I do not know to me 

00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:52.849
 like and that's why I like to upload them and 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:54.589
 very much like in fact it is the reason 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.029
 the main one by which game conquers and 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:57.229
 especially because lately every time 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.779
 that entered any game conquered 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.729
 they are games of 1200 5000 points 12 and it is 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:04.449
 desperate to see this the best way to 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.449
 abandon an airplane 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:15.559
 the truth this does not mark with missile or 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:19.039
 it was like to finish the game and 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:19.039
 until next time
