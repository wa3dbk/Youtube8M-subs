00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.720
 so welcome the microphones minecraft 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.430
 backes today and there was today 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.189
 not serious but you have the 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.880
 have seen how cool I love this 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:31.000
 texture pack and i love this world 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.829
 who are about to see it coming 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.570
 sky to pulling on me are over 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.489
 not a weird one in any case 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.930
 I have a very special one for you today 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.610
 map prepared that could be such a 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.700
 a little bit as an inspiration that is one 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.960
 big server web and i have so many 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.969
 I can now see shooting stars 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.340
 in any case today wish something 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.200
 and I hope, of course, I wish 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.660
 although this must not betray the 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.160
 you like this map is on everyone 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.020
 case very interesting is a bit 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.030
 middle age part and the server of 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.150
 which is that you are called the app 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.680
 vasteras power if you like this ball 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.689
 look and you now see just 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.250
 in the background how easy the clouds 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.180
 go by it just like that 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.850
 great feeling 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.299
 The map itself is huge with very whole 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.799
 winding streets and because and where I am 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.119
 even if not at all 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.340
 always a little bit around yourself 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.289
 I have to fight it all the way up 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.719
 a small main side street came 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.299
 am and i am now on one or am 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.770
 I to you see yourself is must 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.689
 Orient me there a bit because 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.819
 the map is so huge you can yes 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.409
 I've been through for months with 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.880
 definitely the feeling and you can 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.109
 but from one building or another 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.329
 just a little inspiration 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.219
 take as they are just set up 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.899
 if you yourself and little middle ages 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.859
 and rpg clean has exactly why 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:47.170
 I recommend you this map so extreme 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:50.700
 building over building over building so far 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.700
 the whole eye is enough 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.179
 the palisade or the wall looks like 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.369
 a demarcation from the other world and 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.469
 closes all as a bit of a as 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.950
 there would be nothing outside the wall 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.469
 give 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.200
 small market stalls are available 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.209
 larger buildings are available naturally 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.840
 allowed tor the fisherman's not 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.540
 absence 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.630
 very very detailed everything designed 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.700
 is a great map to really a lot 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.440
 do not copy copy 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.160
 you should not but you can still 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.370
 one or the other idea of this 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.410
 when out there, they are in the green 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.690
 I just can not get enough of it 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.420
 and the sun is getting on it 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.970
 warm the sun pops in here and it 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.780
 just looks so bombastic 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.220
 I still have no sunrise 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.440
 Minecraft world seen that some are not 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.110
 I'm so serious about that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.880
 seen me over the walls like this 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.000
 have a sunrise that's all 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.220
 super super super good looks real 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.540
 fantastic 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.190
 By day everything looks quite complete 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.610
 otherwise we do not walk the street 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.590
 there's that one up there 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.420
 You can visit the castle walls yourself 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.730
 but I also visit at the moment 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.380
 even barely 30 players online around the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.850
 time in which i am here right now 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.640
 the whole record I have grad 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.570
 looked up at the same time 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.010
 if you are a bit concerned with the 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.690
 want to entertain players that 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.580
 want to look at and so on and so on 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.170
 on 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.360
 every attentive observer of you 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.840
 will recognize very strongly that the map 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.640
 derived from game of thrones 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.350
 These churches are better too 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.670
 look at it with another texture pack 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.340
 I would not go here 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.709
 Rheinfelden also has a harbor 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.600
 I also have a few houses in this style 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.910
 seen so far and that a few 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.100
 and if you are yourself that was okay 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.900
 wood with the other wood and he wants 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.010
 and here with the grass and everything 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.660
 continue and so on that's a great 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.360
 combination then it takes over 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.570
 Do not you take one to one but of 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.980
 the idea ago so if you have this map 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.720
 now have a look then look 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.070
 just look at the map where I 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.320
 of course, the way in the description 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.090
 also the link from the server finds that 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.470
 you also find on the site you 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.510
 even a matching texture pack 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.000
 in this case I have the docu strong 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.640
 Speck uses what I of course also the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.900
 top-5 minecraft maps has presented that 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.100
 was perfect for that 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.049
 maybe you would have the one or the other 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.049
 but others can edit that 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.630
 you will definitely find in this better one 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.800
 resource pack the following at the end me 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.210
 Of course, you always want one of these 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.770
 give a little insight that is me 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.300
 you do not want to take it all in advance 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.590
 betrayed everything but I want you 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.450
 always give a little offense 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.440
 if interested, look at it 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.910
 but the map closer 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.569
 post me if he has any 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.429
 understand 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.580
 cool things then I look at it 

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:42.080
 even always happy to and 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.610
 click me a little bit through me 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.589
 have myself here and there in the 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.479
 one or the other church a place 

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:48.889
 the very exciting was cook 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.289
 daughter himself again and again 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.089
 then says thank you very much 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.189
 for watching I hope you the video 

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:57.459
 fallen and I once said to for so 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:57.459
 suffering
