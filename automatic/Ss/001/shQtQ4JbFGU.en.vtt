00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
these things natural and the answer is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.029 
these things natural and the answer is
no<00:00:47.730> they're<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.239> natural<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.379> sometimes

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
no they're not natural and so sometimes

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.310 
no they're not natural and so sometimes
when<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.789> live<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.239> an<00:00:51.390> unnatural<00:00:52.170> situation

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
one that is not designed for human

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.260 
one that is not designed for human
beings<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.110> live<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.309> eat<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.000> live

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
beings to live you have to eat and live

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.290 
beings to live you have to eat and live
in<00:00:57.570> an<00:00:57.719> unnatural<00:00:58.289> way<00:00:58.320> sometimes<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.000> if<00:01:00.149> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
in an unnatural way sometimes so if you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
in an unnatural way sometimes so if you
want<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> hundred<00:01:00.870> percent<00:01:00.989> perfect<00:01:01.379> 100

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
want to be a hundred percent perfect 100

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.219 
want to be a hundred percent perfect 100
percent<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.730> time<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.780> lifestyle

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
percent of the time with this lifestyle

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.469 
percent of the time with this lifestyle
then<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.710> highly<00:01:05.129> recommend<00:01:05.159> moving<00:01:06.150> down<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
then I highly recommend moving down to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.450 
then I highly recommend moving down to
somewhere<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> tropics<00:01:07.320> South<00:01:07.920> America

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
somewhere in the tropics South America

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.969 
somewhere in the tropics South America
Australia<00:01:09.080> places<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.200> northern<00:01:10.500> Africa

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
Australia places in northern Africa

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.500 
Australia places in northern Africa
that's<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> best<00:01:12.240> place<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
that's going to be the best place to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.410 
that's going to be the best place to
live<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.350> get<00:01:13.530> fresh<00:01:14.010> ripe<00:01:14.549> raw<00:01:14.850> fruits<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
live to get fresh ripe raw fruits and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.330 
live to get fresh ripe raw fruits and
vegetables<00:01:15.810> year-round<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.189> going

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
vegetables year-round and that's going

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.310 
vegetables year-round and that's going
to<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.580> an<00:01:17.729> ideal<00:01:17.880> situation<00:01:18.360> where<00:01:19.170> you're

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to be an ideal situation where you're

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.010 
to be an ideal situation where you're
getting<00:01:19.590> vitamin<00:01:20.040> D<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.460> winter<00:01:20.850> time<00:01:21.020> for

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
getting vitamin D in the winter time for

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.840 
getting vitamin D in the winter time for
those<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.470> or<00:01:22.860> that's<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.340> possibility

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
those of you or that's not a possibility

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.810 
those of you or that's not a possibility
there<00:01:24.630> are<00:01:24.810> two<00:01:25.049> options<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.250> purity

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
there are two options and that is purity

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.359 
there are two options and that is purity
on<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.180> diet<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.659> sustainability<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.130> my

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
on this diet or sustainability and in my

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789 
on this diet or sustainability and in my
opinion<00:01:29.960> sustainability<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.079> much<00:01:31.500> more

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
opinion sustainability is much more

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.950 
opinion sustainability is much more
important<00:01:32.250> than<00:01:32.310> being<00:01:32.729> pure<00:01:33.329> all<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
important than being pure all of the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.800 
important than being pure all of the
time<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.950> obviously<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.579> not<00:01:35.670> ideal<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.360> eat

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
time so obviously it's not ideal to eat

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.810 
time so obviously it's not ideal to eat
coconut<00:01:37.290> sugar<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.590> eat<00:01:37.890> freeze-dried<00:01:38.490> corn

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
coconut sugar and eat freeze-dried corn

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.819 
coconut sugar and eat freeze-dried corn
it's<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.750> ideal<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.110> live<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.500> cold<00:01:40.770> climate

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
it's not ideal to live in a cold climate

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.050 
it's not ideal to live in a cold climate
all<00:01:41.310> together

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
all together

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.749 
all together
so<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> recommend<00:01:43.020> coconut<00:01:43.649> sugar<00:01:43.829> because<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
so I recommend coconut sugar because the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.639 
so I recommend coconut sugar because the
one<00:01:45.030> thing<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.360> find<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> winter<00:01:46.259> months<00:01:46.409> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
one thing I find in the winter months is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.160 
one thing I find in the winter months is
that<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.220> need<00:01:47.399> variety<00:01:47.810> sometimes<00:01:48.810> you

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that you need variety sometimes you

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.319 
that you need variety sometimes you
don't<00:01:49.590> want<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> eat<00:01:50.009> another<00:01:50.280> full<00:01:50.729> banana

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
don't want to eat another full banana

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.210 
don't want to eat another full banana
because<00:01:51.780> you're<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.259> sick<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.649> them<00:01:52.829> because

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
because you're so sick of them because

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.830 
because you're so sick of them because
