00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.650
 Welcome to www contributed 60 CNSX point the 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.670
 Today I want to show you how to be at Garmin 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.600
 CBS reported 60 CSX 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.720
 the Migros the menu 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.820
 and the batteries are inserted 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.410
 furthermore, I show you the connections of the 60 CSX 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.449
 For this we have to turn the device over 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.800
 Here we see you now 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.110
 the waterproof cover 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.870
 and to fulfill these 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.140
 you need more leverage for it 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.140
 turn around 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.760
 then you can pull off the cover 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.260
 inside you can see now 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.120
 the rubber sealing as well as think the rubber hand seal 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.770
 because that is Garmin 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.770
 to a depth of full Haimeder 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.340
 waterproof 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.699
 and the MeeGo is to insert the memory card 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.040
 we have to see memory slot 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.670
 push forward 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.790
 then this can be folded up 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.990
 Verbier of a child 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.260
 memory card 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
 in the size of 2g work 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 These must be with the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.040
 be inserted down 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.300
 then the lid opens 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.300
 close down again 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.490
 and pull the covers backwards 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.720
 if the memory card is in it 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.980
 you can use the batteries and these are normal Akos size AA 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.070
 from 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.150
 I have some 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.090
 with 2600 milliamperes 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.330
 In my experience, you can use the device 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.900
 18 hours so I say 16 to 18 hours to operate 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.959
 These become easy 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.359
 glued 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.359
 and the second in the other direction 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:24.189
 then you can close the lid again 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.189
 this one must be hooked to Sion 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.929
 of rumors 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:32.899
 Â«The lever has to be put back 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:34.999
 fold down 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.399
 and done 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.379
 we come to the conclusion 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379
 to the connections on the back 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.950
 For this one finds under the rubber sealing the different connections 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.419
 that for the first 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.479
 the connection for an excellent idea as an antenna 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.419
 However, this is only needed if, for example, in the car a part 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.119
 Needs the windshield has 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:01.119
 otherwise this is completely superfluous 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:03.369
 under em-second 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:06.599
 namely, the port for the computer is the usb port 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.519
 and or the third 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.519
 the connection for the external power supply 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.980
 yes that was already a lot of thoughts to look
