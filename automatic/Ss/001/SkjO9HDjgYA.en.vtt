00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
very good players we were coming off a

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.970 
very good players we were coming off a
bad<00:00:11.370> results<00:00:12.000> or<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.870> bit<00:00:13.080> down<00:00:13.440> because<00:00:13.830> of

that and I think you could see that to
start<00:00:16.440> with<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:17.220> was<00:00:17.369> hard<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.210> did<00:00:18.359> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.870 
no I don't think so as I always say the
important<00:02:06.680> thing<00:02:06.860> is<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.340> team's<00:02:07.610> going

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
important thing is that the team's going

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.359 
important thing is that the team's going
well<00:02:08.210> but<00:02:08.660> we<00:02:08.780> continue<00:02:09.259> this<00:02:09.410> dynamic<00:02:10.130> that

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
well but we continue this dynamic that

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.330 
well but we continue this dynamic that
will<00:02:10.940> return<00:02:11.210> to<00:02:11.450> winning<00:02:11.630> ways<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.740> we

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
will return to winning ways and that we

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.280 
will return to winning ways and that we
see<00:02:13.670> how<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:13.910> very<00:02:14.240> important<00:02:14.810> game<00:02:14.840> coming
