he's just testing it for the live stream
but<00:03:28.959> you'll<00:03:29.049> see<00:03:29.200> him<00:03:29.290> pull<00:03:29.530> up<00:03:29.650> his<00:03:29.769> cursor

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
but you'll see him pull up his cursor

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.259 
but you'll see him pull up his cursor
here<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.430> second<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:30.820> start<00:03:31.030> looking

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
here in a second and start looking

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.390 
here in a second and start looking
around<00:03:31.530> you'll<00:03:32.530> see<00:03:32.590> calls<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.280> write

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
around you'll see calls it and write

about this area here where I have marked

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.020 
about this area here where I have marked
with<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.019> arrow<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.670> we'll<00:03:36.670> keep<00:03:36.820> an<00:03:36.940> eye<00:03:37.000> on

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
with the arrow and we'll keep an eye on

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.210 
with the arrow and we'll keep an eye on
that<00:03:37.209> spot<00:03:37.480> he<00:03:38.350> just<00:03:38.500> drives<00:03:38.680> through<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.160> it

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
that spot he just drives through and it

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.039 
that spot he just drives through and it
starts<00:03:39.459> exploding<00:03:39.790> on<00:03:40.000> anything<00:03:40.840> it's<00:03:41.019> just

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
starts exploding on anything it's just

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.780 
starts exploding on anything it's just
kind<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.620> demonstrating<00:03:42.160> artillery<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.640> see

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
kind of demonstrating artillery to see

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.970 
kind of demonstrating artillery to see
what<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.060> effect<00:03:43.299> is<00:03:43.480> when<00:03:43.660> you're<00:03:43.780> in<00:03:43.989> it

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
what the effect is when you're in it

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.170 
what the effect is when you're in it
it<00:03:45.980> looks<00:03:46.130> like<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:46.580> direct<00:03:46.850> hits<00:03:47.000> just

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
it looks like a in direct hits just

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.059
