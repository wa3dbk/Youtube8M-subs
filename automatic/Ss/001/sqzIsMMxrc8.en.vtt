tube torture test we put Tapatio hot

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.230 
tube torture test we put Tapatio hot
sauce<00:00:13.049> in<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.830> sealed<00:00:14.280> test<00:00:14.700> tube<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.059> we're

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
sauce in a sealed test tube and we're

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.040 
sauce in a sealed test tube and we're
heating<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.719> with<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.320> torch<00:00:16.379> el<00:00:17.130> Tapatio<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.000> a

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
heating it with a torch el Tapatio is a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.590 
heating it with a torch el Tapatio is a
Mexican<00:00:19.050> slang<00:00:19.199> word<00:00:19.560> for<00:00:20.490> somebody<00:00:20.970> who<00:00:21.240> came

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
Mexican slang word for somebody who came

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:55.360 
Mexican slang word for somebody who came
from<00:00:21.869> Guadalajara<00:00:22.939> la-la-la<00:00:23.939> Mexico

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.770 

sure<00:00:56.370> seems<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.700> I<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:56.940> totally<00:00:57.660> different

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
sure seems like I have totally different

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.390 
sure seems like I have totally different
results<00:00:58.260> each<00:00:58.350> time<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.650> do<00:00:58.770> when<00:00:58.980> these<00:00:59.100> test

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
results each time I do when these test

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.340 
results each time I do when these test
tube<00:00:59.550> tests<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.629> no<00:01:00.750> exception

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
tube tests and this is no exception

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.470 
tube tests and this is no exception
now<00:01:02.010> I've<00:01:02.160> had<00:01:02.340> blowouts<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.330> before

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
now I've had blowouts like that before

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.380 
now I've had blowouts like that before
but<00:01:03.870> usually<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:05.060> applied<00:01:06.060> too<00:01:06.240> much

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
but usually because I applied too much

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.719 
but usually because I applied too much
heat<00:01:06.660> or<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.110> material<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.460> poor

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
heat or the material was just a poor

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.469 
heat or the material was just a poor
heat<00:01:09.030> transfer<00:01:09.540> medium<00:01:10.850> now<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.940> sure<00:01:12.119> seemed

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
heat transfer medium now it sure seemed

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.260 
heat transfer medium now it sure seemed
to<00:01:12.570> me<00:01:12.690> like<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:13.080> had<00:01:13.320> good<00:01:14.090> boiling<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
to me like we had good boiling of the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.260 
to me like we had good boiling of the
liquid<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.810> there<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:17.430> was<00:01:17.580> wondering<00:01:17.729> what

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
liquid in there and I was wondering what

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.310 
liquid in there and I was wondering what
the<00:01:18.300> heck<00:01:18.600> created<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.380> pop<00:01:19.800> what<00:01:20.340> blew<00:01:20.580> up

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
the heck created that pop what blew up

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.440 
the heck created that pop what blew up
on<00:01:22.320> closer<00:01:22.830> examination<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
on closer examination you can see a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.320 
on closer examination you can see a
little<00:01:24.690> Bert<00:01:25.080> patch<00:01:25.440> of<00:01:25.800> hot<00:01:26.369> sauce<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
little Bert patch of hot sauce there and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.180 
little Bert patch of hot sauce there and
what<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.690> is<00:01:27.840> doing<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.380> acting<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:28.890> an

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
what that is doing is acting like an

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.570 
what that is doing is acting like an
insulator<00:01:30.020> its<00:01:31.020> insulating<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:32.040> enough<00:01:32.340> to

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
insulator its insulating just enough to

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.480 
insulator its insulating just enough to
prevent<00:01:32.940> proper<00:01:33.600> heat<00:01:33.840> transfer<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:35.190> we<00:01:35.340> call

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
prevent proper heat transfer and we call

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.199 
prevent proper heat transfer and we call
that<00:01:35.520> scale<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.690> boiler<00:01:37.280> world<00:01:38.280> so

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
that scale in the boiler world so

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:40.910 
that scale in the boiler world so
essentially<00:01:39.690> if<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.929> can't<00:01:40.170> pull<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.679> heat

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
essentially if you can't pull the heat

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.370 
essentially if you can't pull the heat
away<00:01:41.130> fast<00:01:41.399> enough<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:42.209> glass<00:01:42.479> becomes<00:01:42.959> soft

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
away fast enough the glass becomes soft

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.249 
away fast enough the glass becomes soft
and<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> rupture<00:01:45.569> and<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and you can get a rupture and it's the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.510 
and you can get a rupture and it's the
same<00:01:46.440> thing<00:01:46.679> that<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.950> happen<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.399> an

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
same thing that can happen in an

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.080 
same thing that can happen in an
industrial<00:01:48.060> boiler<00:01:49.399> now<00:01:50.399> despite<00:01:50.819> all<00:01:50.880> that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
industrial boiler now despite all that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.410 
industrial boiler now despite all that
the<00:01:52.080> temperature<00:01:52.800> still<00:01:53.039> got<00:01:53.490> very<00:01:53.880> very<00:01:54.149> hot

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the temperature still got very very hot

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.380 
the temperature still got very very hot
well<00:01:54.840> well<00:01:55.470> above<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:56.039> boiling<00:01:56.310> point<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.910> we

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
well well above the boiling point and we

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.130 
well well above the boiling point and we
build<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.690> a<00:01:57.899> lot<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:58.500> steam<00:01:59.130> pressure<00:01:59.399> inside

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
build up a lot of steam pressure inside

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.669 
build up a lot of steam pressure inside
the<00:02:01.140> thicker<00:02:01.619> hot<00:02:02.160> sauce<00:02:03.050> kind<00:02:04.050> of<00:02:04.110> resisted

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
the thicker hot sauce kind of resisted

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.400 
the thicker hot sauce kind of resisted
being<00:02:05.550> blown<00:02:05.849> out<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.179> that<00:02:06.300> hole<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.780> once

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
being blown out of that hole and once

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.300 
being blown out of that hole and once
that<00:02:07.649> was<00:02:07.800> gone

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
that was gone

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.180 
that was gone
the<00:02:08.849> remaining<00:02:09.240> steam<00:02:09.660> pressure<00:02:09.929> inside<00:02:10.380> was

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
the remaining steam pressure inside was

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.949 
the remaining steam pressure inside was
that<00:02:11.400> pop<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.120> heard<00:02:12.360> there<00:02:12.599> was<00:02:12.720> still

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
that pop that you heard there was still

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.589 
that pop that you heard there was still
that<00:02:13.260> much<00:02:13.470> pressure<00:02:13.709> in<00:02:13.980> there<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.420> just<00:02:15.420> for

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
that much pressure in there and just for

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.780 
that much pressure in there and just for
the<00:02:15.660> record<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.020> did<00:02:16.200> try<00:02:16.470> using<00:02:16.950> my<00:02:17.160> infrared

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the record I did try using my infrared

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.790 
the record I did try using my infrared
heat<00:02:18.000> gun<00:02:18.209> on<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.540> one<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:19.440> could<00:02:19.650> not

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
heat gun on this one I just could not

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.780 
heat gun on this one I just could not
get<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.040> good<00:02:20.430> reading<00:02:21.390> with<00:02:21.630> it
