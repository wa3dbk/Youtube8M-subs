neat about this is that you could think
of<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.720> little<00:02:01.200> modules<00:02:02.040> these<00:02:02.250> little

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
of it as little modules these little

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.139 
of it as little modules these little
modules<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:04.040> gospel<00:02:05.040> progressions<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
modules of gospel progressions that you

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.389 
modules of gospel progressions that you
can<00:02:06.299> then<00:02:06.479> put<00:02:06.780> together<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.500> your<00:02:07.530> own<00:02:07.979> unique

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
can then put together in your own unique

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.819 
can then put together in your own unique
way<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.910> create<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.390> own<00:02:09.829> progressions

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
way to create your own progressions

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:17.170 
way to create your own progressions
stuff<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.720 

that<00:02:18.180> diminished<00:02:18.720> approach<00:02:19.200> them<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> six

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
that diminished approach them to the six

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.930
