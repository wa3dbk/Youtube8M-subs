I<00:06:35.760> think<00:06:36.570> what<00:06:36.660> does<00:06:36.810> it<00:06:36.990> is<00:06:37.140> is<00:06:37.920> a<00:06:37.980> mixture<00:06:38.460> of

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
I think what does it is is a mixture of

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.120 
I think what does it is is a mixture of
a<00:06:38.760> few<00:06:38.970> things<00:06:39.000> it's<00:06:39.480> all<00:06:39.660> mainly<00:06:40.590> coming<00:06:41.040> from
