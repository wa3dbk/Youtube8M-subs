00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello how about youtube friends I am 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.850
 apple and today I will share 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.920
 the top 5 tweets corresponding to 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.049
 February 2014 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.929
 we started one of those little things this 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.429
 it's called browser simply if we have 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.869
 several browsers installed in 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.300
 our devices as it can be 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.130
 google chrome or others allows us to choose 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.340
 which one we want to use as the default 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.020
 changing them only with a touch 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.370
 we continue with the position number 4 is 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.980
 very simple but it does its job to the 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.480
 perfection his name is assassins his 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.460
 task is very simple when we are in 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.809
 the multitasking bar will add a 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.120
 small visual effect of eyelashes 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.429
 lying down but what's really important 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.409
 is that if we slide the first screen 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.909
 up will close all the 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:43.949
 applications that we have open with 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.530
 just a touch we can also do 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.930
 a breath doing this twice 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.180
 now we move to position number 3 and it's the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.980
 turn to be and what you see in this we 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.350
 add a small padlock instead of the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.629
 unlock bar and from the settings 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.300
 we can configure 5 quick accesses to 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.800
 the applications that we want 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.540
 the quick camera button is also 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.119
 add this semicircle of shortcuts with 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.890
 logically the unlocking feels very 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.440
 well in both cases a screen or 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.540
 ipad as in an ipad what more 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.120
 I liked this tweet is that effect so 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.130
 fine that the padlock provides us 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.020
 We are already finishing but not before 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.910
 show the two best tweets of this 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.700
 month in the second place we find 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.290
 time past court pro this tweet 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.350
 defect modifies our password 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.420
 unlock by the hour for example if 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.690
 in the clock figure that are 22 30 the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.890
 password will be 22 30 the interesting thing about 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.360
 this is that every time you unlock 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.520
 We have our device will be done with a 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.960
 different code in the settings has 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.400
 some options such as the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.940
 password but with the numbers 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.860
 Invested work among others 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.080
 finally we reached number 1 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.430
 of this top this allows us to see videos 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.170
 in the background while for example 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.540
 we answer a medium 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.310
 his name is video paint is enlarged 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.170
 To our liking and to do it 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.020
 we just have to squeeze in the X 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.250
 is located at the top right on the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.080
 lower bar we have the button 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.720
 full screen in case we decide to 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.670
 see it in that size is great and 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.380
 I wanted to share it with you though 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.880
 its price is a bit high if 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.130
 they really need it they are not going to 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.780
 regret when buying it good 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.520
 friends this was the top 5 of tweets from 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.590
 February 2014 a very short video 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.040
 but to see those who can not
