00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.210
 but to all and welcome a new 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.040
 video on the channel I'm a class like 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.750
 always three goals a new video and then 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.460
 good background gameplay people will have 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.070
 a game in gears of war 3 that I had 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.390
 when and with the hops like the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.740
 departure was a little bit new and it's 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.410
 because we were just throwing the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.350
 We were there, having a good time and so 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.610
 I had not played fun for a while 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.120
 but what I come to you now on the day of 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.550
 today is an hour so the news of 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.140
 gears of war 4 we are going tentatively 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.379
 let's call it course by four or the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.909
 new software better said no and good 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.750
 Microsoft just confirmed that they 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:47.190
 It will take all the time necessary to 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.140
 finalize it phil spencer vice president 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.479
 from microsoft studios declared to be 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.979
 satisfied with the equipment in charge but 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:54.930
 discards any intention of 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.390
 press them with some tentative date 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 for the launch of this title the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.970
 truth is news that good we 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.799
 He could be very well personally I 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.540
 it falls very well because I would not like another 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.380
 I've seen you scamper down and you know 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.299
 georges and so on 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.840
 and I feel that there should take their 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.969
 time more than anything because 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.369
 the young lifebook is having many 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:21.189
 problems now that if they can not 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.130
 send the games to 1080 native and not 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.630
 can run at 60 frames and many 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.189
 things followed the software if you need 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.319
 as your rest obviously the 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.959
 people that to a certain extent we 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:33.310
 We dedicate to playing the software 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.509
 obviously we already want to have it fast 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.170
 we do not want a new game we want 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.100
 be playing this new material 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.959
 etcetera and to a certain extent that the 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.090
 software 3 is already getting tired 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.799
 not every time there is more extra cav go 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.479
 parties increasingly know more mistakes 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.009
 and more errors and I do not know if it's like 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.739
 they are already spending time because they are leaving 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.079
 to focus someone squarely on the new 

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:54.789
 software then does not mention that 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.950
 the performance of the software already yemen as 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.049
 I told him in addition to his reception 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.299
 part of the audience or we are 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.399
 factors that phil spencer mentions for 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.810
 rekindle and give it all the time 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.250
 necessary the project the truth I believe 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.940
 that this is a pretty thought 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.590
 good that is given in the pause they think 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.120
 well things still do not know if they go 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.480
 to continue with the story of marcus and 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.300
 they are going to make new characters 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.220
 or that they are going to do if it is going to be another 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.620
 Frecuenta is still a mystery without 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.599
 But you see that they want to take everything 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.050
 the necessary time they want to do the 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.630
 things well do not want to repeat 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.930
 this this factor so to take a 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.240
 project here to flash and so that they 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.710
 go wrong again because it 's two games 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.900
 followed so I think it would be the 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.720
 tomb of the sports software like that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.340
 very down now the saga and there will be 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.800
 wait to see what happens with this new 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.940
 delivery not to see if it can be removed 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.010
 if they can give you a 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.830
 a soda if they can turn it into a 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.080
 little bit cooler up to a certain point 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.700
 change some things like it's not 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.140
 the same thing the same thing obviously 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.120
 that we go to the extreme and do not try 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.680
 do an extremely different thing like 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.960
 they tried to do it even jon guards 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.910
 to get another kind of attention and 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.580
 everything that they maintain as the concept 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.790
 the gameplay that they try to innovate a 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.770
 little bit I do not know in some game modes 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.830
 that are raffled well with maps all that 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.240
 kind of things are what should be 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.430
 doing and surely they will be 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.290
 doing because they comment that no no 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.320
 They are in a hurry, it's not like that 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.820
 we buy the brand wey and we have to 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.800
 to remove pinches things and like hot bread 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.630
 they do not seem to want to take everything 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.730
 their time they want to do it well and the 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.190
 truth is something applauded for 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.140
 Microsoft already know that we have always 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.820
 said that good the companies always 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.590
 like money and money and right now 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.570
 like you are going to be thinking no 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.900
 then blacks studies despite 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.630
 doing it is a study that was founded in the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.250
 2012 as a recreation of microsoft 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.930
 vancouver as stated by the 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.150
 directive will take time before 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.040
 return the universe of going software and 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.470
 obviously they emphasize that this time it's going to 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.880
 be for xbox obviously for the 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.680
 people who are going to say is not that 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.940
 because you're not going to carry 360 and it's good 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.980
 a game that will come out tomorrow the 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.440
 news is saying it surely 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.930
 will leave us in 2016 over there I will 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.910
 I do not know on what date but there 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.410
 I more or less calculate that it is that year 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.209
 2016 has already dropped in price almost 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.700
 are going to be doing things for 360 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.980
 then obviously if it is to deliver 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.030
 it's just going to be for xbox on and once again 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.920
 here we emphasize it this time in xbox 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.150
 one so, well, I hope people will be 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.650
 liked the gameplay I hope you have them 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.960
 liked the news do not copy yourselves 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.450
 if you would have liked to get 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.080
 take off fast but it could be in what color 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.940
 then now I do like the things in the 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.180
 race then they go wrong so I 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.530
 I'm really happy with this with this 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.850
 time that you want to take with this 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.620
 time obviously as long as 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.380
 are working and so it is not a 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.910
 project that they forget it and they also come 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.520
 very good games what plans against 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.620
 titan zombies fire be in etcetera 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.330
 etcetera etcetera so good people already 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.920
 you know you should not leave a comment on 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.080
 what did you think I am not in leaving a like 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.490
 hurt very much not serve subscribe 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.660
 to the channel if the subscribed ones on the button 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.890
 here below social networks are 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.810
 I will leave in the description for any 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.980
 doubt that they have and without more to say we 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.070
 we see until the next 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.070
 bye
