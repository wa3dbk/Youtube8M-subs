00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hahaha, I want to thank you. 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.330
 Your interest to be here with me 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.190
 in this video and I'm going to record three videos 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.320
 in each video a new tip that will 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.540
 help you increase control over 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.010
 speed the dynamics to see 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.789
 otherwise an instrument in this case 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.160
 drums 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.830
 My name is Bruno Breton to those who do not 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.840
 You know I've played drums since I was 13 years old. 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.000
 I had some passages for some 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.730
 bands where I was born and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 I live there until now and the first in the first 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.790
 great leap forward was the experience I 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.469
 I had when I touched with the hand in the outbreak 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.239
 had a passage through the outbreak where I 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.300
 I made a part of the tour with them caught 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.680
 enough experience there and the audio so 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.000
 It was for me when I joined Charlie. 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.200
 brown when I received Charlie's invitation 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.239
 brown in 2008 and from there I was able to participate 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.680
 until the last disc recording three discs 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.510
 a dvd 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.070
 we won gold record among others 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.600
 prizes I also wanted to highlight a 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.670
 emmy that we win the finalization of a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.079
 personal dream and a group dream too 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.460
 with the best rock album of america 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.850
 latina in 2010 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.350
 I'm currently playing with strike where 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.720
 We are launching a new job. 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.430
 or we are in new things 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.770
 have always news then thank you 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.360
 always the affection that the crowd has and comes 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.430
 the company whenever there is always much 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.470
 novelty then let's go there first tip 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.299
 in this video I wanted 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.640
 in this first tip is an exercise to 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.140
 being very simple is because it is a 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.090
 single debuted that is you showed 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.430
 which is one with each hand you do not repeat 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.619
 Tomorrow is very simple, but this one is 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.210
 this bid must be simple 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.640
 it brings the complex by exercise 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.150
 infinite because the infinite requirement 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.220
 you can practice it slow during a 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.700
 without stopping and increasing the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.409
 dynamics, for example without making a 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.240
 stronger than the other you will keep 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.470
 same speed 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.470
 you can work with the metronome 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.939
 also the same force for one minute 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.149
 so it was gone but it would be more or less 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.149
 like this 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.410
 What does this exercise mean? 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.000
 control for one minute 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.310
 He's going to show you that he's going to have an hour. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.260
 on the side of the 30 40 seconds that 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.240
 automatically start a more beautiful 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.370
 the other to start automatically 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.110
 a good hand being you of this right hand 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.450
 wanting to force a little more then 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.200
 start with a minute the metronome would be 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.390
 ideal metronomy 80 or 70 at first a 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.090
 start by 70 at first metro in the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:49.550
 eight shakes per click that would be like this 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:51.770
 1 2 3 4 12 and it would be a click 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.360
 already a direct minute rests a 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.030
 minute direct rest minutes direct 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.100
 three times thereafter, the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.630
 22 points click and increase the 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.560
 time passes for a minute and a half but with 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.790
 two minutes 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.620
 I think that after the first of the second 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.660
 You will see a good difference there. 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.910
 at your speed of control and to 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.890
 to finish this first tip I wanted 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.300
 Talk about the drumstick because you 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.060
 hold here is in the right place for 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.610
 doing exercise is paramount code 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.290
 wake up is the comfort zone of each 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.000
 one starts out there only if you hold it 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.440
 too high you can not have a 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.690
 good use of the stick because of 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.970
 her balance point then you 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.650
 can not even drop it does not ask for 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.900
 You see where she is as she is. 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.110
 hitting and back a lot 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.850
 She's going to die, otherwise she will not have you. 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.380
 you will not be able to do anything if you are not 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.120
 good assurance assuring the stick tip 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.220
 that I give is to find the point of balance 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.910
 When you drop sticks, you 're going to stay. 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.769
 uniform here 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.180
 this is the right spot here is where you 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.040
 picks up sticks to start making your 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.450
 exercise understand the tip I give 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.790
 because surely the income will be 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.650
 much better and tip also another tip 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.450
 the fifth which also barretos that 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.040
 sometimes the crowd has several 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.739
 models of various types of wood 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.650
 sizes I would advise is you to start 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.540
 by a drumstick model 5a is a model 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.130
 traditional traditional fulfillment by the 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.840
 also does not go there nor 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.940
 very thick or very thin and very 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.070
 she can start with it. 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.690
 because according to your evolution you 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.590
 goes on the machine you have a 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.600
 need 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.730
 good guys this was the first tip 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.950
 I hope you liked it there. 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.170
 next video I'll get a little 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.900
 more in each hand, that's the one we made a 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.520
 single stroke nÃ© do slow the fastest 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.650
 passing by the subway as I explained in 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.750
 next video I'm going to go on top of 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.190
 each exercise a little individual and 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.020
 within this exercise we add 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.520
 also a turn with both hands to 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.780
 people coming to evolution interacting 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.870
 increasingly better and to complement 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.180
 these three days of our evolution 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.350
 and if you liked this first video 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.480
 be clever as soon as you edit the 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.410
 The second video, I'll send an email to 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.140
 You already have to wait and you can 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.150
 follow this sequence of videos 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.250
 and also for those who liked this video 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.870
 down here you can comment 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.830
 your doubt that I will see one by one to 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.360
 People are going to talk, we'll go 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.170
 interacting and beginning to take 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.810
 doubts 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.950
 Ok, so this is a hug and 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.950
 People see in the next video thanks
