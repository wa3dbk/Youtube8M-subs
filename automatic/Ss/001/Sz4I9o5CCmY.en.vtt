well<00:00:18.170> it's<00:00:18.550> runoff<00:00:19.720> and<00:00:20.720> I've<00:00:21.320> never<00:00:21.529> seen<00:00:21.860> the

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
well it's runoff and I've never seen the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.750 
well it's runoff and I've never seen the
river<00:00:22.369> this<00:00:23.360> high

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
river this high

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.990 
river this high
still<00:00:25.390> got<00:00:25.540> about<00:00:26.130> 10<00:00:27.130> feet<00:00:27.370> of<00:00:27.520> snow<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.880> some

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
still got about 10 feet of snow and some

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.220 
still got about 10 feet of snow and some
of<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.150> higher<00:00:28.300> elevations<00:00:28.510> so<00:00:28.990> it's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
of the higher elevations so it's

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.550 
of the higher elevations so it's
probably<00:00:29.529> only<00:00:29.619> gonna<00:00:29.740> get<00:00:29.980> higher<00:00:31.560> normally

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
probably only gonna get higher normally

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.600 
probably only gonna get higher normally

10 feet of water there's normally a big

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.950 
10 feet of water there's normally a big
Bluff<00:00:45.580> that<00:00:45.610> comes<00:00:46.030> out<00:00:46.210> here<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:46.600> you<00:00:46.840> can

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
Bluff that comes out here and you can

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.390 
Bluff that comes out here and you can
see<00:00:47.110> it<00:00:47.230> standing<00:00:47.620> out<00:00:47.770> the<00:00:47.980> water<00:00:48.160> gauge

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
see it standing out the water gauge

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.820 
see it standing out the water gauge
domitor<00:00:48.879> is<00:00:48.940> out<00:00:49.090> there<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:50.440> it's<00:00:50.590> under

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
I'm just going to keep digging here and

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.330 
I'm just going to keep digging here and
putting<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.180> through<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:29.280> through<00:01:30.280> the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
putting it through the through the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.359 
putting it through the through the
rocker<00:01:30.609> box<00:01:31.920> nice<00:01:32.920> nice<00:01:33.490> chunks<00:01:33.939> in<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.289> so

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
rocker box nice nice chunks in it so

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.090 
rocker box nice nice chunks in it so
which<00:01:37.030> brothers<00:01:37.479> were<00:01:37.659> here<00:01:37.960> but<00:01:38.350> they<00:01:38.380> either

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
which brothers were here but they either

which brothers were here but they either
had<00:01:39.369> to<00:01:39.490> work<00:01:39.670> or<00:01:40.560> couldn't<00:01:41.560> make<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:41.799> up<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:42.909> it

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
had to work or couldn't make it up so it

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.870 
had to work or couldn't make it up so it
came<00:01:43.450> up<00:01:43.600> by<00:01:43.720> myself<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:45.159> I'll<00:01:45.310> just<00:01:45.460> dig<00:01:45.670> out

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
came up by myself and I'll just dig out

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.020 
came up by myself and I'll just dig out
from<00:01:46.180> them<00:01:46.720> in<00:01:46.869> here<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.259> put<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.369> into<00:01:48.729> the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
from them in here and put it into the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.950 
from them in here and put it into the
trusty<00:01:50.250> rocker<00:01:51.250> box<00:01:51.640> as<00:01:52.149> you<00:01:52.360> can<00:01:52.509> see<00:01:52.689> there's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
trusty rocker box as you can see there's

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.039 
trusty rocker box as you can see there's
not<00:01:53.080> a<00:01:53.140> lot<00:01:53.409> of<00:01:53.439> room<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:54.000> work<00:01:55.000> around<00:01:55.479> here<00:01:55.659> so

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
not a lot of room to work around here so

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.529 
not a lot of room to work around here so
it's<00:01:56.640> right<00:01:57.640> up<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.649> right<00:01:59.649> up<00:01:59.829> to<00:02:00.009> my<00:02:00.130> feet

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
it's right up to the right up to my feet

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.580 
it's right up to the right up to my feet
but<00:02:01.539> anyhow<00:02:02.049> still<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> lot<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.740> fun<00:02:03.149> I'll<00:02:04.590> show

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
but anyhow still a lot of fun I'll show

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.870 
but anyhow still a lot of fun I'll show
you<00:02:05.649> some<00:02:05.860> other<00:02:05.920> glimpses<00:02:06.460> of<00:02:06.640> stuff<00:02:08.789> see<00:02:09.789> if

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
you some other glimpses of stuff see if

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.220 
you some other glimpses of stuff see if
I<00:02:09.910> can't<00:02:10.149> get<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.299> picture<00:02:10.600> through<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.989> trees

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
I can't get a picture through the trees

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.479 
I can't get a picture through the trees
of<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.530> mountain<00:02:11.890> it's<00:02:12.190> covered<00:02:12.640> in<00:02:12.760> fog<00:02:13.060> okay

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
of a mountain it's covered in fog okay

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.539 
of a mountain it's covered in fog okay
so<00:02:15.489> there<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:17.970> spring<00:02:18.970> runoff<00:02:20.549> here

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
so there you have it spring runoff here

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.570 
so there you have it spring runoff here
in<00:02:21.700> Idaho<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.870> I'll<00:02:23.440> show<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.190> what<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.400> get

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
in Idaho and I'll show you what I get

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.050 
in Idaho and I'll show you what I get
later<00:02:24.790> on

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.770 

okay<00:02:28.900> here<00:02:29.110> we<00:02:29.200> are<00:02:29.230> rocker<00:02:29.590> box<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.130> action

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
okay here we are rocker box in action

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.449 
okay here we are rocker box in action
you<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:31.900> see<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.230> it's<00:02:32.620> got<00:02:32.800> good<00:02:32.980> flow<00:02:33.220> down

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
you can see it it's got good flow down

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.930 
you can see it it's got good flow down
through<00:02:33.730> there<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:36.250> thing<00:02:36.400> pumps<00:02:36.700> about<00:02:36.910> a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
through there this thing pumps about a

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.690 
through there this thing pumps about a
half<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.390> gallon<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.900> stroke<00:02:39.240> so<00:02:41.190> get<00:02:42.190> good<00:02:42.430> flow

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
half a gallon a stroke so get good flow

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.100 
half a gallon a stroke so get good flow
coming<00:02:43.030> down<00:02:43.240> through<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.510> hardware<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:43.990> is

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
coming down through the hardware this is

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.150 
coming down through the hardware this is
one<00:02:44.260> hand<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:46.180> what<00:02:46.390> I've<00:02:46.510> been<00:02:46.600> doing<00:02:47.160> is

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160
