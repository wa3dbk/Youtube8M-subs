00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
was my prediction for from the last

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.250 
was my prediction for from the last
video<00:00:55.800> which<00:00:56.489> was<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.059> nature<00:00:57.539> codes<00:00:57.840> are

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
video which was that nature codes are

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.369 
video which was that nature codes are
actually<00:00:58.739> coming<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.250> look<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.059> wow<00:01:00.539> so

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
actually coming and look at this wow so

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.160 
actually coming and look at this wow so
basically<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.030> IV<00:01:03.480> codes<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
basically now we have the IV codes to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.160 
basically now we have the IV codes to
make<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:05.549> breed<00:01:06.060> Pokemon<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.659> get<00:01:06.780> perfect

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
make to breed Pokemon and get perfect

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.679 
make to breed Pokemon and get perfect
ivs<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:08.880> also<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.330> nature

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
ivs on them and we can also get nature

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.200 
ivs on them and we can also get nature
so<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.350> basically<00:01:10.610> go<00:01:11.610> into<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> wild

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
so you can basically go into the wild

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.679 
so you can basically go into the wild
catch<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.170> legit<00:01:13.890> shiny<00:01:14.159> pokemon<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.909> make<00:01:15.509> it

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
catch a legit shiny pokemon and make it

until they got an adamant or whatever
xerneas<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.790> know<00:01:41.909> whatever<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.450> then

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
xerneas so you know whatever and then

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.940 
xerneas so you know whatever and then
after<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.100> did<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.869> diancie<00:01:46.530> is

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
after they did that the like diancie is

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.819 
after they did that the like diancie is
on<00:01:47.130> Dan<00:01:47.640> sees<00:01:47.909> only<00:01:48.350> 33<00:01:49.670> IVs<00:01:51.799> xerneas<00:01:52.799> and

on Dan sees only 33 IVs xerneas and
yveltal<00:01:53.130> i<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.909> either<00:01:54.240> 3<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:54.780> 6<00:01:55.110> i<00:01:55.320> vs

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
yveltal i think are either 3 or 6 i vs

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.670 
yveltal i think are either 3 or 6 i vs
but<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> point<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.340> now<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.299> actually<00:01:57.680> get
