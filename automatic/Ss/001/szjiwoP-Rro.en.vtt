00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
and burn books guys let me know how you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.120 
and burn books guys let me know how you
would<00:02:51.090> prepare<00:02:51.360> if<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:52.020> mini<00:02:52.320> ice<00:02:52.560> age<00:02:52.830> does

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
would prepare if this mini ice age does

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.650 
would prepare if this mini ice age does
happen<00:02:53.460> where<00:02:53.610> even<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.910> bigger<00:02:54.210> Ice<00:02:54.420> Age

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
happen where even a bigger Ice Age

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.300 
happen where even a bigger Ice Age
