as<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:52.170> can<00:04:52.410> see<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:53.130> frame<00:04:53.460> bent<00:04:53.940> a<00:04:54.180> little

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
as you can see the frame bent a little

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.080 
as you can see the frame bent a little
at<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.990> back<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:55.680> it's<00:04:55.890> not<00:04:56.130> going<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.580> stay<00:04:56.880> up

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
at the back so it's not going to stay up

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.290 
at the back so it's not going to stay up
properly<00:04:57.660> and<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.410> fix<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:59.070> glue<00:04:59.580> two<00:04:59.940> rows

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300

vertically on the inside like shown and

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:14.510 
vertically on the inside like shown and
then<00:05:06.600> cut<00:05:06.870> out<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.290> excess<00:05:13.070> this<00:05:14.070> is<00:05:14.310> the

then cut out the excess this is the
finished<00:05:15.000> frame<00:05:15.510> and<00:05:15.780> it's<00:05:16.050> very<00:05:16.440> sturdy
