00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.000 

in<00:00:00.210> these<00:00:00.390> problems<00:00:00.840> we<00:00:01.050> are<00:00:01.079> calculating<00:00:01.890> the

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
in these problems we are calculating the

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.090 
in these problems we are calculating the
areas<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:03.319> parallelograms<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.620> a

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
areas of parallelograms and a

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.249 
areas of parallelograms and a
parallelogram<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.270> creature<00:00:06.779> like<00:00:07.020> this

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
parallelogram is a creature like this

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.129 
parallelogram is a creature like this
it's<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.589> four-sided<00:00:08.400> shape<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:09.000> it's<00:00:09.690> got<00:00:09.900> two

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
it's a four-sided shape and it's got two

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.160 
it's a four-sided shape and it's got two
sets<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.769> parallel<00:00:11.490> sides<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.719> are<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> same

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
sets of parallel sides that are the same

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.740 
sets of parallel sides that are the same
length<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> top<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.400> bottom<00:00:14.750> they

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
length so the top and the bottom they

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.180 
length so the top and the bottom they
are<00:00:15.809> parallel<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.379> each<00:00:16.560> other<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.070> they're

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
are parallel to each other and they're

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.950 
are parallel to each other and they're
the<00:00:17.310> same<00:00:17.490> length<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:18.000> see<00:00:18.180> here<00:00:18.420> 58<00:00:18.810> and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
the same length you can see here 58 and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.320 
the same length you can see here 58 and
58<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:20.100> sides<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> left<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.240> right

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
58 and the sides here the left and right

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.420 
58 and the sides here the left and right
sides<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:21.810> parallel<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.769> each<00:00:22.949> other<00:00:23.189> and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
sides are parallel to each other and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.800 
sides are parallel to each other and
also<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.150> same<00:00:24.330> length<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.170> case<00:00:25.230> 51

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
also the same length in this case 51

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.179 
also the same length in this case 51
it's<00:00:27.810> sort<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.170> like<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> rectangle<00:00:29.099> that's

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
it's sort of like a rectangle that's

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.269 
it's sort of like a rectangle that's
been<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> little<00:00:29.699> slanted<00:00:30.420> or<00:00:30.570> squished

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
been a little slanted or squished

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.440 
been a little slanted or squished
actually<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.399> rectangle<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> type<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
actually a rectangle is a type of

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.970 
actually a rectangle is a type of
parallelogram<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> special

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
parallelogram it's a special

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.069 
parallelogram it's a special
parallelogram<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.760> has<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.510> angles<00:00:36.899> 90

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
parallelogram that has all the angles 90

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.400 
parallelogram that has all the angles 90
degrees<00:00:37.670> if<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> rectangle<00:00:40.050> figuring

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
degrees if this was a rectangle figuring

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.020 
degrees if this was a rectangle figuring
out<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> area<00:00:40.890> would<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.100> pretty<00:00:41.489> easy<00:00:41.550> we

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
out the area would be pretty easy we

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.990 
out the area would be pretty easy we
just<00:00:42.300> multiply<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.780> length<00:00:43.140> times<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.649> width

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
just multiply the length times the width

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.970 
just multiply the length times the width
when<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.090> got<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.450> slanted<00:00:46.140> squished<00:00:46.620> kind

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
when you got this slanted squished kind

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.950 
when you got this slanted squished kind
of<00:00:47.100> creature<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.910> can't<00:00:48.120> really<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.750> so

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
of creature you can't really do that so

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.400 
of creature you can't really do that so
the<00:00:49.920> formula<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.910> actually<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.930> base

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the formula here is actually the base

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.189 
the formula here is actually the base
which<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.030> rectangle<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.930> would<00:00:55.050> usually

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
which in a rectangle we would usually

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.729 
which in a rectangle we would usually
call<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.710> length<00:00:55.949> times<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> height<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
call the length times the height and the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.459 
call the length times the height and the
height<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.489> not<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.420> side<00:01:00.809> it's

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
height here is not the side it's

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.200 
height here is not the side it's
actually<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.800> line<00:01:02.070> dropped<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> corner

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
actually a line dropped from the corner

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.570 
actually a line dropped from the corner
and<00:01:03.390> making<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.409> 90-degree<00:01:05.010> angle<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
and making a 90-degree angle with the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.460 
and making a 90-degree angle with the
opposite<00:01:06.000> side<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.570> you'll<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> dashed

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
opposite side so you'll see that dashed

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.130 
opposite side so you'll see that dashed
line<00:01:07.920> drawn<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.030> that's<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.689> height<00:01:09.900> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
line drawn in here that's the height of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.770 
line drawn in here that's the height of
the<00:01:10.560> parallelogram<00:01:11.119> but<00:01:12.119> once<00:01:12.420> you've<00:01:12.600> got

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the parallelogram but once you've got

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.810 
the parallelogram but once you've got
the<00:01:13.290> base<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> height<00:01:14.070> you're<00:01:14.520> good<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
the base and the height you're good to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.960 
the base and the height you're good to
go

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
go

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.730 
go
you<00:01:15.210> simply<00:01:15.570> multiply<00:01:15.720> those<00:01:16.140> two<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.590> this

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
you simply multiply those two so this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
you simply multiply those two so this
one<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.189> 58<00:01:17.880> times<00:01:19.070> 44<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.060> punch<00:01:21.299> that

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
one is 58 times 44 and if you punch that

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.550 
one is 58 times 44 and if you punch that
in<00:01:21.630> your<00:01:21.750> calculator<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> should<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:23.390> 2552

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
in your calculator you should get 2552

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.050 
in your calculator you should get 2552
now<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:25.950> told<00:01:26.130> us<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> dimensions<00:01:26.580> we're<00:01:27.000> in

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
now they told us the dimensions we're in

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.390 
now they told us the dimensions we're in
inches<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.439> area<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.100> remember

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
inches here but this is area so remember

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.149 
inches here but this is area so remember
this<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.970> square<00:01:30.540> inches<00:01:31.159> when

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
this is going to be square inches when

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.960 
this is going to be square inches when
we<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> answer<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.090> area<00:01:34.790> all<00:01:35.790> right

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
we get the answer for area all right

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.109 
we get the answer for area all right
let's<00:01:36.150> look<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.360> another<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:37.729> this<00:01:38.729> one<00:01:38.909> says

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
let's look at another one this one says

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.429 
let's look at another one this one says
find<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> area<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> parallelogram

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
find the area of the parallelogram

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.100 
find the area of the parallelogram
dimensions<00:01:41.369> are<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.549> centimeters<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
dimensions are in centimeters and the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.990 
dimensions are in centimeters and the
area<00:01:43.439> equals<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.979> base<00:01:44.250> times<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.909> height

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
area equals the base times the height

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.050 
area equals the base times the height
and<00:01:45.799> down<00:01:46.799> here<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.340> don't<00:01:47.579> see<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> measurement

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and down here I don't see a measurement

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.319 
and down here I don't see a measurement
for<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> base<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.100> know<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> same<00:01:51.119> as

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
for the base but I know it's the same as

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.389 
for the base but I know it's the same as
the<00:01:51.450> top<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.049> top<00:01:52.200> are<00:01:52.619> pair<00:01:52.890> top<00:01:53.250> and

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the top because the top are pair top and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.800 
the top because the top are pair top and
bottom<00:01:53.610> are<00:01:53.729> parallel<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.390> same<00:01:54.570> length

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
bottom are parallel and the same length

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.060 
bottom are parallel and the same length
so<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.259> 90<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.399> our<00:01:56.520> base<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.060> 90<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.070> our

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
so this is 90 so our base is 90 and our

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.940 
so this is 90 so our base is 90 and our
height<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.610> this<00:02:00.240> dashed<00:02:01.020> line<00:02:01.229> dropped<00:02:01.740> here

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
height is this dashed line dropped here

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.950 
height is this dashed line dropped here
from<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> corner<00:02:02.579> down<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.149> opposite

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
from the corner down to the opposite

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.440 
from the corner down to the opposite
side<00:02:04.200> at<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.590> right<00:02:04.860> angle<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.250> that's<00:02:05.430> 71<00:02:06.149> so

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
side at a right angle and that's 71 so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.070 
side at a right angle and that's 71 so
90<00:02:06.899> times<00:02:07.649> 71<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:09.060> should<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.629> six

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
90 times 71 and that should be six

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.320 
90 times 71 and that should be six
thousand<00:02:10.590> three<00:02:11.190> hundred<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.580> ninety<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
thousand three hundred and ninety and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.900 
thousand three hundred and ninety and
this

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
this

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.850 
this
a<00:02:12.940> centimeter<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.690> that'll<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:14.020> square

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
a centimeter so that'll be square

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.030 
a centimeter so that'll be square
centimeters<00:02:15.490> when<00:02:16.120> we<00:02:16.270> get<00:02:16.450> area<00:02:16.950> all<00:02:17.950> right

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
centimeters when we get area all right

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.320 
centimeters when we get area all right
let's<00:02:18.220> try<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.400> more

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.460 

so<00:02:22.330> one<00:02:22.420> says<00:02:22.630> find<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.020> area<00:02:23.320> of<00:02:23.410> the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
so one says find the area of the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.960 
so one says find the area of the
parallelogram<00:02:23.950> dimension<00:02:24.730> centered

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
parallelogram dimension centered

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.580 
parallelogram dimension centered
centimeters<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.600> this<00:02:25.990> one<00:02:26.170> looks<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.470> little

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
centimeters and this one looks a little

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.740 
centimeters and this one looks a little
bit<00:02:26.800> different<00:02:26.950> we've<00:02:27.910> got<00:02:28.060> our<00:02:28.150> base<00:02:28.420> here

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
bit different we've got our base here

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.470 
bit different we've got our base here
it's<00:02:28.930> 20<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.530> they're<00:02:33.250> equals<00:02:33.640> 20<00:02:34.060> times<00:02:34.300> the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
it's 20 so they're equals 20 times the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.480 
it's 20 so they're equals 20 times the
height<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.960> then<00:02:35.170> we've<00:02:35.710> got<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.920> dashed<00:02:36.310> line

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
height and then we've got a dashed line

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.790 
height and then we've got a dashed line
here<00:02:36.700> but<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.300> way<00:02:37.630> out<00:02:37.780> outside<00:02:38.590> the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
here but it's way out outside the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.290 
here but it's way out outside the
parallelogram<00:02:39.280> there's<00:02:39.730> another<00:02:40.000> dashed

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
parallelogram there's another dashed

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.750 
parallelogram there's another dashed
line<00:02:40.570> here<00:02:40.770> well<00:02:41.770> don't<00:02:42.040> get<00:02:42.160> confused<00:02:42.400> by

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
line here well don't get confused by

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.520 
line here well don't get confused by
that<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.270> dashed<00:02:43.690> line<00:02:43.840> right<00:02:44.170> here<00:02:44.380> with

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
that this dashed line right here with

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.160 
that this dashed line right here with
the<00:02:44.650> 26<00:02:45.160> on<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:46.180> height<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.810> this

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
the 26 on it is a height of this

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.660 
the 26 on it is a height of this
parallelogram<00:02:47.740> and<00:02:48.100> if<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.460> want<00:02:48.610> to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
parallelogram and if you want to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.520 
parallelogram and if you want to
convince<00:02:49.000> yourself<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.510> that<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:50.140> could<00:02:50.350> move

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
convince yourself of that you could move

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.670 
convince yourself of that you could move
this<00:02:50.800> thing<00:02:51.010> over<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:52.180> would<00:02:52.300> fit<00:02:52.680> exactly

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
this thing over and it would fit exactly

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.930 
this thing over and it would fit exactly
in<00:02:54.400> there<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:56.500> those<00:02:56.980> two<00:02:57.250> lines<00:02:57.490> are<00:02:57.670> really

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
in there so those two lines are really

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.700 
in there so those two lines are really
the<00:02:58.120> same<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:58.630> this<00:02:58.750> is<00:02:58.900> going<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.110> be<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.470> base

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
the same so this is going to be the base

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.760 
the same so this is going to be the base
which<00:03:00.040> is<00:03:00.190> 20<00:03:00.490> times<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.150> height<00:03:01.360> which<00:03:01.570> is<00:03:01.990> 26

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
which is 20 times the height which is 26

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.790 
which is 20 times the height which is 26
and<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.370> think<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.850> get<00:03:04.470> 520<00:03:05.470> when<00:03:05.680> you

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
and I think you get 520 when you

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.040 
and I think you get 520 when you
calculate<00:03:06.070> that<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.090> centimeters

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
calculate that and this is centimeters

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.910 
calculate that and this is centimeters
so<00:03:08.260> centimeters<00:03:09.030> squared<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:11.440> that's<00:03:11.680> how<00:03:11.890> to

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
so centimeters squared so that's how to

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.920 
so centimeters squared so that's how to
find<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.310> area<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:13.120> parallelogram

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
find the area of a parallelogram
