today<00:00:01.589> we're<00:00:01.890> gonna<00:00:02.010> review<00:00:02.490> our<00:00:02.970> diamond

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
today we're gonna review our diamond

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.380 
today we're gonna review our diamond
quartz<00:00:03.959> analog<00:00:04.710> chess<00:00:05.009> clock<00:00:05.279> now<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.210> clock

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
quartz analog chess clock now this clock

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.419 
quartz analog chess clock now this clock
is<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> step<00:00:06.930> up<00:00:07.140> from<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.470> basic<00:00:07.799> allied<00:00:08.130> chess

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
is a step up from the basic allied chess

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.000 
is a step up from the basic allied chess
clock<00:00:08.670> has<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> number<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.929> features<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.530> we

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
clock has a number of features that we

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.549 
clock has a number of features that we
like<00:00:11.219> better<00:00:11.900> one<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.200> have<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.320> much

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
like better one is you have a much

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.950 
like better one is you have a much
larger<00:00:13.830> display<00:00:14.549> for<00:00:15.269> each<00:00:15.509> side<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
larger display for each side of the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.160 
larger display for each side of the
clock<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.580> back<00:00:17.869> although<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:18.990> is

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
clock here on the back although this is

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.519 
clock here on the back although this is
an<00:00:19.289> analog<00:00:19.590> clock<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.220> actually<00:00:20.580> runs<00:00:20.910> on<00:00:21.330> a

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
an analog clock it actually runs on a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.870 
an analog clock it actually runs on a
double-a<00:00:22.529> battery<00:00:22.859> which<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.279> included<00:00:23.730> with

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
double-a battery which is included with

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.019 
double-a battery which is included with
the<00:00:23.970> clock<00:00:24.500> and<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.800> knobs<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.490> adjust<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the clock and the knobs to adjust the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.790 
the clock and the knobs to adjust the
times<00:00:27.330> are<00:00:27.510> much<00:00:27.630> easier<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:28.050> turn<00:00:28.380> than<00:00:28.680> on

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
times are much easier to turn than on

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.070 
times are much easier to turn than on
some<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.160> basic<00:00:29.550> clocks<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.179> overall<00:00:30.900> we

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
some of the basic clocks so overall we

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
some of the basic clocks so overall we
like<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.349> clock<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> lot<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> very<00:00:32.309> quiet

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
like this clock a lot it's a very quiet

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.240 
like this clock a lot it's a very quiet
clock<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.120> don't<00:00:33.300> hear<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> ticking<00:00:34.079> as<00:00:35.040> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
clock you don't hear the ticking as you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.459 
clock you don't hear the ticking as you
do<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> other<00:00:35.820> clocks<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:37.260> just

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
do with the other clocks and we just

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319 
do with the other clocks and we just
like<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.739> big<00:00:37.980> display<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.610> comes<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:39.000> it

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
like the big display that comes with it

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.600 
like the big display that comes with it
this<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.200> runs<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.829> any<00:00:41.010> other<00:00:41.160> analog

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
this is runs just like any other analog

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.130 
this is runs just like any other analog
clock<00:00:41.879> right<00:00:42.090> now<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.570> both<00:00:42.809> buttons

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
clock right now I have both buttons

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.170 
clock right now I have both buttons
depressed<00:00:43.770> half<00:00:44.100> way<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.730> kind<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.149> a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
depressed half way so it's kind of in a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.779 
depressed half way so it's kind of in a
pause<00:00:45.480> mode<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.590> store<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.070> clock<00:00:47.370> you

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
pause mode when you store this clock you

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.880 
pause mode when you store this clock you
could<00:00:48.180> insert<00:00:48.480> these<00:00:48.719> stop<00:00:49.320> guards<00:00:49.680> which

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
could insert these stop guards which

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.610 
could insert these stop guards which
come<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> clock<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.289> put<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.590> each

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
come with the clock and put one on each

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.619 
come with the clock and put one on each
side<00:00:52.770> they<00:00:53.309> comes<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:53.789> two<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.420> this

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
side they comes with two just like this

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
side they comes with two just like this
now<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> keep<00:00:55.440> your<00:00:55.649> battery<00:00:56.010> from<00:00:56.219> being<00:00:56.460> worn

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
now to keep your battery from being worn

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
now to keep your battery from being worn
down<00:00:56.879> keep<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.510> clock<00:00:57.719> from<00:00:57.989> running<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.379> one

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
down keep the clock from running on one

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.099 
down keep the clock from running on one
side<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.609> these<00:00:59.730> are<00:00:59.789> easy<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> come<00:01:00.719> out<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
side but these are easy to come out and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.260 
side but these are easy to come out and
when<00:01:01.289> you're<00:01:01.379> ready<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.680> start<00:01:01.890> playing<00:01:02.270> now

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
when you're ready to start playing now

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.820 
when you're ready to start playing now
to<00:01:03.600> use<00:01:03.750> an<00:01:03.840> analog<00:01:04.049> clock<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.619> fairly

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to use an analog clock it's fairly

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
to use an analog clock it's fairly
simple<00:01:05.159> that's<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> benefit<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> analog

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
simple that's the benefit of the analog

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
simple that's the benefit of the analog
clock<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.770> easy<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.159> set<00:01:08.430> easy<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
clock is that it's easy to set easy to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.240 
clock is that it's easy to set easy to
get<00:01:08.970> started<00:01:09.390> let's<00:01:10.110> say<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.799> wanted<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> play

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
get started let's say you wanted to play

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.010 
get started let's say you wanted to play
a<00:01:11.280> five-minute<00:01:11.820> blitz<00:01:12.060> game<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.869> now

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
a five-minute blitz game right now

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.539 
a five-minute blitz game right now
you'll<00:01:13.200> notice<00:01:13.439> both<00:01:13.710> clocks<00:01:14.010> read<00:01:14.280> twelve

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
you'll notice both clocks read twelve

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
you'll notice both clocks read twelve
o'clock<00:01:14.880> or<00:01:15.090> close<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.380> would<00:01:16.530> just

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
o'clock or close to it so we would just

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.990 
o'clock or close to it so we would just
take<00:01:16.830> these<00:01:17.040> little<00:01:17.280> settings<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.820> back

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
take these little settings in the back

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.380 
take these little settings in the back
we<00:01:18.210> would<00:01:18.390> turn<00:01:18.600> these<00:01:19.130> two<00:01:20.130> five<00:01:20.880> minutes<00:01:21.240> to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
we would turn these two five minutes to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.469 
we would turn these two five minutes to
12<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.960> each<00:01:25.189> now<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.790> disadvantage<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.299> an

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
12 on each now the disadvantage with an

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.569 
12 on each now the disadvantage with an
analog<00:01:27.840> clock<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.590> can't<00:01:29.280> get<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
analog clock is you just can't get it

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.370 
analog clock is you just can't get it
exactly<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> same<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.570> both<00:01:30.720> sides<00:01:30.780> or<00:01:31.259> it's

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
exactly the same on both sides or it's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.870 
exactly the same on both sides or it's
very<00:01:31.560> tough<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.100> where<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.520> get<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
very tough to do where you can get it to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.850 
very tough to do where you can get it to
the<00:01:33.030> second<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> digital<00:01:34.020> clock<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.829> I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the second on a digital clock but I

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.080 
the second on a digital clock but I
think<00:01:35.040> that's<00:01:35.189> fairly<00:01:35.369> close<00:01:35.700> when<00:01:35.970> you're

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
think that's fairly close when you're

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.090 
think that's fairly close when you're
ready<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> start<00:01:36.630> play<00:01:36.900> depress<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> button

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
ready to start play depress the button

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.340 
ready to start play depress the button
on<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.369> side<00:01:38.640> you'll<00:01:39.479> notice<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> other

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
on one side you'll notice that the other

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.649 
on one side you'll notice that the other
side<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> clock<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.210> little<00:01:42.450> red

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
side of the clock the the little red

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.109 
side of the clock the the little red
cross<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.649> starts<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.189> tick<00:01:44.430> slowly<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.000> let

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
cross there starts to tick slowly to let

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.780 
cross there starts to tick slowly to let
you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:45.689> time<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.140> ticking<00:01:46.470> down

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
you know that your time is ticking down

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.149 
you know that your time is ticking down
then<00:01:47.790> as<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> other<00:01:48.210> side<00:01:48.450> plays<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.979> red

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
then as the other side plays the red

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.740 
then as the other side plays the red
cross<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> other<00:01:50.850> side<00:01:51.090> starts<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> move

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
cross on the other side starts to move

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.170 
cross on the other side starts to move
now<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.250> had<00:01:53.369> time<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> video<00:01:53.909> we'd

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
now if we had time with the video we'd

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.429 
now if we had time with the video we'd
let<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.390> run<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:54.840> we'll<00:01:54.960> kind<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.200> speed

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
let it run down but we'll kind of speed

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.830 
let it run down but we'll kind of speed
things<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.490> time<00:01:56.759> runs<00:01:56.939> down<00:01:57.240> you'll<00:01:57.570> start

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
things up as time runs down you'll start

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.959 
things up as time runs down you'll start
to<00:01:57.960> see<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> little<00:01:58.649> red<00:01:58.770> flag<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.340> rise<00:01:59.640> up

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
to see the little red flag there rise up

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.569 
to see the little red flag there rise up
as<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.450> hand<00:02:00.659> gets<00:02:00.869> closer<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.500> you'll<00:02:02.369> know

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
as your hand gets closer and you'll know

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.120 
as your hand gets closer and you'll know
that<00:02:02.610> you've<00:02:03.000> lost<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:04.079> time<00:02:04.619> or<00:02:04.799> your<00:02:04.920> times

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that you've lost on time or your times

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.449 
that you've lost on time or your times
right<00:02:05.340> now<00:02:05.369> once<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.060> flag<00:02:06.390> falls<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:08.310> like

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
right now once that flag falls just like

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:08.869 
right now once that flag falls just like
that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.550 
that
and<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.239> that's<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.810> case<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.289> side<00:02:10.500> of

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
and so that's in this case this side of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.670 
and so that's in this case this side of
the<00:02:10.619> clocks<00:02:10.860> run<00:02:11.099> out<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.280> time

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
the game would be over you can also set

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.970 
the game would be over you can also set
this<00:02:14.500> clock<00:02:14.829> to<00:02:15.239> run<00:02:16.239> longer<00:02:17.170> than<00:02:17.319> just<00:02:17.739> short

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
this clock to run longer than just short

games<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.989> could<00:02:20.140> do<00:02:20.319> that<00:02:20.470> say<00:02:20.829> set<00:02:21.129> the

clock for 10 o'clock if that were the

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.649 
clock for 10 o'clock if that were the
case<00:02:23.950> you'd<00:02:24.129> have<00:02:24.189> a<00:02:24.280> 2<00:02:24.489> hour<00:02:24.640> game<00:02:24.939> the<00:02:25.420> flag

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
case you'd have a 2 hour game the flag

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.390 
case you'd have a 2 hour game the flag
would<00:02:25.900> fall<00:02:26.110> once<00:02:26.409> in<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.980> middle<00:02:27.189> of<00:02:27.310> the
