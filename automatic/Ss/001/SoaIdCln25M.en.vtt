00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.330 
how to play lover you should have come
over<00:00:09.660> by<00:00:09.900> Jeff<00:00:10.139> Buckley<00:00:10.500> we<00:00:10.650> just<00:00:10.830> looked<00:00:11.070> in

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
over by Jeff Buckley we just looked in

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.419 
over by Jeff Buckley we just looked in
part<00:00:11.580> one<00:00:11.820> at<00:00:12.090> how<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> play<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.950> beginning<00:00:14.309> of

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
part one at how to play the beginning of

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.430 
part one at how to play the beginning of
the<00:00:14.519> verse<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:15.059> guess<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.900> could<00:00:16.049> say<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.379> is

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the verse I guess you could say this is

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.019 
the verse I guess you could say this is
the<00:00:16.560> second<00:00:17.070> part<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> verse<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the second part of the verse it's the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.099 
the second part of the verse it's the
part<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.420> says<00:00:19.279> um<00:00:20.960> too<00:00:21.960> young<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:24.119> hold<00:00:24.689> on

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
part that says um too young to hold on

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.810 
part that says um too young to hold on
and<00:00:25.470> too<00:00:25.890> old<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.420> break<00:00:27.779> free<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.619> run

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
and too old to just break free and run

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.120 
and too old to just break free and run
and<00:00:30.320> so<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.619> kind<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> beginning

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and so this is kind of the beginning

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.950 
and so this is kind of the beginning
maybe<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.120> some<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.420> chords<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.870> you

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
maybe of some of the chords that you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.440 
maybe of some of the chords that you
would<00:00:34.110> not<00:00:34.260> be<00:00:34.320> familiar<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.239> unless<00:00:36.239> you're

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
would not be familiar with unless you're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.299 
would not be familiar with unless you're
just<00:00:36.540> really<00:00:36.870> into<00:00:37.079> jazzy<00:00:37.590> stuff<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.160> know

just really into jazzy stuff and know
some<00:00:38.489> strange<00:00:39.059> chords<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.370> came<00:00:41.550> out

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.310 
some strange chords but so we came out
of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> verse<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.570> kind<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> typical

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
4th fret this is kind of this is our

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.030 
4th fret this is kind of this is our
little<00:01:24.580> gateway<00:01:24.970> into<00:01:25.240> this<00:01:25.330> section<00:01:28.350> ok<00:01:29.350> now

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
little gateway into this section ok now

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.810 
little gateway into this section ok now
that's<00:01:30.220> that<00:01:30.670> third<00:01:30.940> note<00:01:31.210> this<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.900> 4th<00:01:32.230> fret

that's that third note this the 4th fret
it<00:01:33.820> becomes<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.300> foundation<00:01:34.750> for<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:34.960> chord

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.260 

Court<00:01:39.040> is<00:01:39.100> really<00:01:39.460> simple<00:01:39.820> it<00:01:39.939> couldn't<00:01:40.210> be

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
Court is really simple it couldn't be

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.389 
Court is really simple it couldn't be
simpler<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.869> guess<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.530> could<00:01:41.710> be<00:01:41.829> simpler<00:01:42.219> but

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
simpler I guess it could be simpler but

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.190 
simpler I guess it could be simpler but
it's<00:01:42.579> pretty<00:01:42.969> easy<00:01:43.210> pretty<00:01:43.570> straightforward

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
it's pretty easy pretty straightforward

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.039 
it's pretty easy pretty straightforward
it's<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.130> fourth<00:01:45.490> fret<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.450> fifth<00:01:46.930> string

gateway I just mean and this is what's
leading<00:05:07.580> us<00:05:07.700> into<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:08.000> next<00:05:08.210> section<00:05:09.730> which

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
leading us into the next section which

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.460 
leading us into the next section which
is<00:05:10.760> kind<00:05:11.060> of<00:05:11.120> our<00:05:11.240> bridge<00:05:11.570> that<00:05:11.990> sometimes<00:05:12.350> a

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
is kind of our bridge that sometimes a

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.530 
is kind of our bridge that sometimes a
man<00:05:12.620> gets<00:05:12.860> carried<00:05:13.100> away<00:05:13.220> part<00:05:13.790> now

man gets carried away part now

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.540 
man gets carried away part now
interestingly<00:05:15.080> enough<00:05:15.620> this<00:05:15.800> gateway<00:05:16.100> chord

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
interestingly enough this gateway chord

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.100 
interestingly enough this gateway chord
that<00:05:16.669> I<00:05:16.760> just<00:05:16.940> said<00:05:17.210> is<00:05:17.450> going<00:05:17.960> to<00:05:18.020> be

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
that I just said is going to be

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.690 
that I just said is going to be
different<00:05:18.530> three<00:05:18.950> different<00:05:19.190> times<00:05:19.370> in<00:05:19.610> the

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
different three different times in the

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.730 
different three different times in the
song<00:05:19.940> he<00:05:20.450> comes<00:05:20.660> around<00:05:20.780> to<00:05:20.960> this<00:05:21.110> section<00:05:21.620> of

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
song he comes around to this section of

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.740 
song he comes around to this section of
the<00:05:21.830> song<00:05:22.070> three<00:05:22.400> times<00:05:22.639> and<00:05:22.910> every<00:05:22.940> time<00:05:23.270> it

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
the song three times and every time it

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.480 
the song three times and every time it
leads<00:05:23.960> into<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.320> next<00:05:24.560> part<00:05:24.770> using<00:05:25.400> a

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
leads into the next part using a

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.610 
leads into the next part using a
different<00:05:25.820> chord<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.900> first<00:05:27.050> time<00:05:27.290> around<00:05:27.470> is

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
different chord the first time around is

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.230 
different chord the first time around is
this<00:05:27.770> F<00:05:27.950> sharp<00:05:28.510> major<00:05:30.760> later<00:05:31.760> on<00:05:31.940> it's<00:05:32.090> going

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
this F sharp major later on it's going

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.520 
this F sharp major later on it's going
to<00:05:32.300> be<00:05:32.360> at<00:05:32.720> core<00:05:32.960> that<00:05:33.110> you'll<00:05:33.200> see<00:05:33.350> in<00:05:33.440> a

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
to be at core that you'll see in a

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.370 
to be at core that you'll see in a
second<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:35.690> later<00:05:35.900> on<00:05:36.020> it's<00:05:36.140> going<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.290> be

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
second and later on it's going to be

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.330 
second and later on it's going to be
another<00:05:36.590> chord<00:05:36.890> that<00:05:36.980> you'll<00:05:37.070> see<00:05:37.190> in<00:05:37.280> a

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
another chord that you'll see in a

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.680 
another chord that you'll see in a
second<00:05:38.650> okay<00:05:39.650> but<00:05:40.340> I'll<00:05:40.880> just<00:05:40.940> make<00:05:41.180> that<00:05:41.419> note

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
second okay but I'll just make that note

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.250 
second okay but I'll just make that note
that<00:05:43.480> it'll<00:05:44.480> be<00:05:44.540> different<00:05:44.720> every<00:05:45.050> time

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
that it'll be different every time

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.130 
that it'll be different every time
and<00:05:45.530> you<00:05:46.460> can<00:05:46.610> print<00:05:46.880> out<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.570> chord<00:05:47.870> chart
