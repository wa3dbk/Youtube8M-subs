00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.859
 hi youtube today in guitar design me 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.859
 by joan sebastian 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.080
 for the arpeggio let's play on the bass 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.120
 and the ropes 321 we're going to make a 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.940
 very easy version of the arpeggio 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.280
 then we are going to touch something like that 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.280
 me and already 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.249
 we design 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.570
 I want to be 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.810
 everything I say 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.630
 and so we're going to keep changing according to 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.300
 we are going to keep this same arpey 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.110
 very easy to re minor 'we made the 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.700
 rope 4 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:53.210
 for sun we make the rope 6 for rafa 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.630
 we make the rope 6 too and that's 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.780
 all 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.750
 the second part leads to a very strumming 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.520
 easy that is mariachi strum and we're going 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.970
 to do simply with the nails radio 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.970
 down 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.990
 Yes sir 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.440
 about 34 23 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.440
 4 points 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.820
 and so we do the last stanza 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.610
 we start with the first verse and 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.830
 starting bigger we designed 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.280
 I want to be 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.600
 everything you like lesser ' 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.600
 re minor 'normally 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.530
 design my sun 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.750
 it's the fret 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.240
 and I authorize any adjustment we have already 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.820
 going again the greatest 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.640
 excuse me opposes what we do less' 3 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.620
 Sun 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.610
 I give my essence 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.610
 true that they have used 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.789
 to get these chimeras out again 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.789
 less 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.770
 Sun 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:24.990
 and we finish in two we are going to do it with the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.990
 strum so you can see how he is designing 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.590
 I want to be 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.700
 everything you like 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.700
 design me 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.099
 because I authorize any adjustment 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.099
 and remove me opposes what he wants 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.890
 I give you my essence and my truth 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.400
 so that it jumps its chimeras 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.790
 the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.540
 the second verse is very simple and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.209
 the third change a little they touch 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.610
 same the last two stanzas but the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.800
 first with arpeggio and the second with 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.970
 strum then we see we see these 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.120
 chords 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.500
 design again 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.300
 the kisses 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.350

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:37.340

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:40.780
 the world where I want to take you with 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.780
 and now also 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.120
 here what we did was a finger we passed 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.180
 to two 7a 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.620
 that we put the rope 3 in the back 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.540
 to me 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.540
 the wings and we went to fa 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.050
 right away 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.520
 nest in the sun and always return with me 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.620
 two 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:22.739
 again we do the same as me 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.739
 2 seventh I do not need more flares 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.320

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.760
 and we fall into two I'll do it again 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.310
 with slow arpeggios for you to see 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.000
 design me 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.320
 the kisses that 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.340
 fill out your passport 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.340
 to reach 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.780
 where I want 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.780
 part 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.220
 equality 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.900

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.700
 next to me 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.030
 finally the last stanza are 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.560
 exactly these same chords but 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.560
 with the strum 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.120
 design 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.720
 high wind 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.910
 with the same 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.860
 the stretch that never 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.860

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.630
 song 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:19.770
 the only difficult part is when we do 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:21.800
 double after 2 7a 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.760

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:43.400
 finally this part where there is music 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.400
