00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.089
 chips 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.370
 appears typical of your name 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.830
 not views on sleeping between my yoga 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.109
 learn to do around but have to start 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.300
 from the joint you know about this more 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.310
 characters that but yes the series stopped in 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.590
 1974 last episode just played 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.900
 River Seventh in the movie is also playing 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.390
 creativity again and summer fully usa 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.550
 during the soccer world cup in white 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.829
 west germany there in germany 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.569
 of course won from the Netherlands and that 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.829
 leads to a very aggressive response 

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:43.109
 from 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.460
 van jaap kooiman because he throws the 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.319
 television from the window 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.239
 typical Jaap Kooiman because you can 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:50.429
 of course not that the Netherlands 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.469
 it was actually losing game 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.289
 give it haha 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.309
 do you really think they hear look guys 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.899
 watch out 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:08.130
 mÃ¼ller and then that TV went without saying 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:10.920
 prama good people so yes that was again 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.579
 as one and again felt like a fish 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.590
 in the water 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.060
 it is in the very different tiesto I have one 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 really a whole story 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.560
 and it also goes a lot deeper than the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.020
 series of course because that is 20 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.409
 minutes and this is an hour and a half 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.990
 that's really one 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.200
 it guess the characters get much more 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.030
 deepened and that is very exciting and the 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.679
 I love your mother-in-law and I give 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.340
 to eat him a plate of earth 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.659
 be the start of swimming when it is 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.380
 not at all difficult to cock up 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.060
 I have played so long and you 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.939
 does the costume sit ali it puts you on 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.329
 And you 're just getting that money from us 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.789
 all of them 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.060
 we have it so long and so intensively 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.549
 done that he is also gerard immediately 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.979
 Sint and Jaap Paulus immediately 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.509
 from the mountain that is that it goes it goes 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.610
 naturally 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.140
 all characters come back so the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.549
 fans of the series are absolutely on their own 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.099
 Hints served Jan. 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.649
 that seemed ben in court he is 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:11.410
 but that looks good now it is 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.180
 is recognizable late 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.590
 no i hope people die 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.769
 find as it should have yet 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.769
 always 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.280
 I have taken the turn this time 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.960
 winch
