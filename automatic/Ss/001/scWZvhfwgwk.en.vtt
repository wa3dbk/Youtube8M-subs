00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.840
 if not, the number of beautiful ones is recent years 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.000
 appliance tom marketed design condition 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.619
 highly regarded where your company looks 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.980
 now to the sony xperia p 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.900
 beautiful device beautiful materials 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.359
 transparent bar at the bottom but 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.070
 evil processor left it on the net like 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.090
 it a bit behind but with the cost 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.470
 the xperia z 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.800
 they have changed that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.420
 xperia z gorgeous device is 5 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.190
 display full hd 13 megapixel camera 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.649
 quad-core processor snapdragon pro 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.510
 name it where everything is in and it 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.680
 the most important thing is that we keep pace 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.149
 with the competition 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.899
 let's take a look at the new 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.899
 sony flagship 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.000
 then he is xperia z the new 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.580
 sony flagship 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.070
 but pretty rectangular 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.560
 our scoop device we will be here 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.130
 during my walk at the front we see the 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.140
 large 5 inch full hd screen with each 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:17.890
 camera 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:19.810
 screen light in the casing nice lexus 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.490
 4 that it's about a path 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.110
 So a 5-inch screen long enough to say 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.810
 that bunch that really has a lot of hearing 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.580
 I put the nexus 4 on that one moment 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.990
 really just agrees and I like this 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.940
 well in the difference this is 4.7 this is 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.340
 done nicely in his giants 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.090
 the back is all the way in to them 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.240
 no french 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.790
 no weird thing done nice 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.830
 xperia to that in it the 13 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.990
 chew megapixel by bike 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.479
 I have already opted for purple 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.729
 a very very beautiful very beautiful color he 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.820
 is also available in black and white and 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.810
 we see two on this side 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.700
 and so shit inch for accessories who 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.950
 behind this flap she goes micro sd card 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.200
 at the bottom have none at all 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.659
 connection except the ring where you 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.330
 keycord who can coach that 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.890
 I don't know this headline well 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.230
 we will see a bit of what I am whole 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.470
 particularly like this poster some 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.090
 people call it a very big one 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.330
 physical on and off button 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.900
 nice silver the on and off button i like 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.180
 him beautiful 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.850
 it is a design choice that is daring 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.320
 but I see it I feel it I like it 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.299
 very beautiful is also very useful if 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.459
 you don't look in rio device or 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.340
 turn it off or then this for you really 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.560
 you can really serve it under the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.549
 volume buttons 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.440
 and the headphones at the top 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.209
 why are all those valves to this 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.580
 device is waterproof which covers 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.080
 sit there to make sure there is no water 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.880
 comes in 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.420
 Well valves are never my favorite 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.280
 been because it is flashing around it 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.950
 to get over and in the case of the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.160
 headphones are just the disadvantage that if 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.660
 you 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.330
 with them there comes some listening that it 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.490
 flap which is open and I just come 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.590
 really for making things happen once 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.240
 the traffic is running on newspaper and that 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.240
 it is then lost and not on your device 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.130
 more water is well defined choice 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.850
 sony fence made it gives a whole 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.530
 nice sleek smooth finish all around 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.510
 on your device 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.150
 we go inside for a moment 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.690
 look again beautiful 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.430
 fruit inch screen who my role with 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.920
 you sculpt 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.780
 nice screen activation well they have 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.150
 have their own leo directed over it 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.860
 but that is not the case in itself 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.260
 urgent present such as 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:47.770
 sense that is or touch with from samsung 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.420
 number of mandatory widgets animals just 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.930
 think off can channel if you don't 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.610
 used as looking in the fc we also see 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.720
 that it looks slightly different or 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.190
 stock android but it's all still 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.230
 what you say 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.890
 acceptable for the hardcore android 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.890
 they use some of their own 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.180
 applications included from sony and see 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.450
 the river in a row 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.430
 what my album films sonic leds 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.669
 they all know how to album 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.799
 always incredibly beautiful app that which 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:25.120
 made it a very nice one 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.940
 view is of her jacket this way 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.919
 so of all your photos you could be there 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.950
 completely loose in it 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.240
 Generate I can totally enjoy you 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.760

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.970
 season just make sure you have other 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.419
 emerge pictures show well 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.870
 very nice because you also 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:53.260

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.700
 so view all your photos on a globe 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.110
 but i can tell you i'm not in 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.760
 all that have been under my son is the 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.250
 needle photos deployed with gioteck such that 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.360
 you so come and demonstrate me in the 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.710
 institutions is also an important one 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.050
 the addition of van sony and that is over 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.419
 energy again around 5 inch screen 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.639
 also use a lot of energy 5 inches 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.169
 to send a full HD movie 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.610
 that's why they have the voice and offer 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.370
 created 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.169
 15 o'clock is now my darling and 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.120
 Standby time if you vote remote 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.740
 turn off the ship for another eight hours 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.689
 no less than seven hours 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.169
 what is that voice and did you offer it 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:36.050
 ramoudt actually does what your device does 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.150
 is off on your screen is to stop 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.889
 innovative then he throws all 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.539
 connections the out except the bell 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.849
 connection is to be no data 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:46.189
 picked up your gmail from boy what's 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:49.069
 up call that does not except 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.840
 which apps post and you 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.180
 from must participate so it is by me 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.949
 it's what's up and by the wild who's 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.810
 and googles that always goes on 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.189
 but all other apps team themselves a lot 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.110
 not so important because want 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:01.789
 be kept informed 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.930
 they don't do it until you see the screen 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.949
 activates 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.840
 all those connections are restored 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.330
 activated and you can also if you 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.659
 receive inspiration or feel very smart 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.190
 done 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.810
 You do need one that is not all 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.479
 receive ultimate notifications 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.460
 and you can get that on location that we do have PC 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.699
 can receive between outlets 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.710
 it saves 7 hours i have to say i 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:25.819
 those seven hours at not really seen back 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:28.460
 but I come up with reasonably large 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:31.159
 I use my fun I can 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.789
 a whole day with the device on 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:38.240
 stroke so apparently that voice works 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:40.279
 offer well what a very nice one 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.740
 applications in welcome you earlier video 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:46.430
 show is the juices smartphone ex you 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.330
 You can use certain situations from 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.449
 if i have one 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.370
 while driving to Kenwood 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.199
 car radio connects what needs then 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.270
 happen to the hulten bluetooth on there 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.710
 I make the sound louder and softer in it 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.150
 can all bet I can even 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.699
 say if getting in the car nothing wrong 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.000
 to indicate that he will then send a text message 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:06.620
 sends to someone your girlfriend your father 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.629
 your mother around me is in the car so me 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.939
 Come on, you will all be automated 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:11.700
 in itself very nice it makes a difference 

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:13.860
 the act 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:17.100
 for example, if you switch on your headset 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.080
 that automatic player is about well hop 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.810
 very handy a bit of a variation 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.690
 happen on the cultivation nfc 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.430
 and so when I connect something then a 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.900
 they really like that happening 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.370
 done at sony 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.880
 of course there are even more things 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.620
 in not connecting 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.200
 throw throw at your television well 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:41.190
 we are all apps that pretty well me 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:44.370
 a further study 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:47.730
 but for me it's for this 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:51.180
 review not really not really important 

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.460
 in short, sony xperia z gives a nice shape 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.780
 device 

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.940
 specifications and very good 

00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:00.780
 camera in the review you can get some samples 

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:03.870
 will see a yard very very soon 

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:06.750
 also continues to work very fast 

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.760

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.550
