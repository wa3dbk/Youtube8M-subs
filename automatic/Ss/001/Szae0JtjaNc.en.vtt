00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
really bad one um why I say that is

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.890 
really bad one um why I say that is
because<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.009> right<00:00:14.280> here<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.900> recently

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
because of this right here I recently

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.740 
because of this right here I recently
got<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.410> $25<00:00:17.160> gift<00:00:17.430> card<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.210> thought<00:00:18.420> what

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
got a $25 gift card and I thought what

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.590 
got a $25 gift card and I thought what
better<00:00:18.990> way<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.380> spend<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.070> then<00:00:20.420> runescape<00:00:21.420> so

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
better way to spend it then runescape so

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.359 
better way to spend it then runescape so
I<00:00:21.630> thought<00:00:21.810> membership<00:00:22.320> now<00:00:22.769> already<00:00:23.039> got<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
I thought membership now already got the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.269 
I thought membership now already got the
six<00:00:23.640> month<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.960> then<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.109> saw<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.439> keys<00:00:25.769> option

six month and then I saw the keys option

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.950 
six month and then I saw the keys option
now<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.519> know<00:00:26.699> what<00:00:27.060> people<00:00:27.090> think<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.660> keys<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960

was my case I probably should have done
this<00:05:01.090> around<00:05:01.500> why<00:05:02.500> i<00:05:02.830> didn't<00:05:03.220> had<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.370> amazon

this around why i didn't had the amazon

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.810 
this around why i didn't had the amazon
gift<00:05:04.360> card<00:05:04.600> but<00:05:05.560> i<00:05:05.590> probably<00:05:05.860> should<00:05:06.730> have

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
gift card but i probably should have

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
done it around if i had the card around

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.430 
done it around if i had the card around
where<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.550> snowballs<00:05:10.150> were<00:05:10.420> where<00:05:11.170> i<00:05:11.200> could

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
where the snowballs were where i could

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.230 
where the snowballs were where i could
get<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:11.920> bunch<00:05:12.130> of<00:05:12.220> snowballs<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:12.790> hopefully
