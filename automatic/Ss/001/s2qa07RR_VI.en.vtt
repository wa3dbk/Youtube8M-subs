00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
a part of the team is something special

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.369 
a part of the team is something special
and<00:03:48.349> not<00:03:49.010> always<00:03:49.819> winning<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.959> know<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.169> got

and not always winning you know you got
it<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.680> got<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:51.919> accept<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.700> losses<00:03:53.150> too

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
it you got to accept the losses too

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.119 
it you got to accept the losses too
that's<00:03:53.720> why<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:53.840> think<00:03:54.049> it's<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:54.349> very<00:03:54.379> you<00:03:55.099> know

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
that's why I think it's so very you know

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.000 
that's why I think it's so very you know
important<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:56.169> coaches<00:03:57.169> and<00:03:57.349> teachers<00:03:57.560> and

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
important that coaches and teachers and

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.030 
important that coaches and teachers and
parents<00:03:59.049> understand<00:04:00.049> you<00:04:00.530> know<00:04:00.680> what<00:04:00.889> they're

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
parents understand you know what they're

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.270 
parents understand you know what they're
doing<00:04:01.069> and<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:02.000> role<00:04:02.239> that<00:04:02.510> they're<00:04:02.689> playing

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.809 

take<00:04:07.280> him<00:04:07.430> up

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
take him up

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.640 
take him up
I<00:04:07.849> feel<00:04:08.150> like<00:04:08.299> Bradshaw<00:04:08.840> wanted<00:04:09.290> nothing<00:04:09.620> more

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
I feel like Bradshaw wanted nothing more

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.830 
I feel like Bradshaw wanted nothing more
than<00:04:10.099> to<00:04:10.250> prove<00:04:10.819> to<00:04:10.969> his<00:04:11.150> coach<00:04:11.359> that<00:04:11.599> he<00:04:11.750> is

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
than to prove to his coach that he is

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.050

the best you're first because this is

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.500

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
just a high school movie it's not just

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.999 
just a high school movie it's not just
you<00:04:56.210> know<00:04:56.330> a<00:04:56.360> relationship<00:04:56.659> movie<00:04:57.259> it's<00:04:57.800> all

you know a relationship movie it's all

00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:59.620 
you know a relationship movie it's all
of<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.250> it<00:04:58.400> much<00:04:58.520> more<00:04:58.820> we're<00:04:59.210> here<00:04:59.419> to<00:04:59.509> be

of that it much more we're here to be

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.480

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
entertained but at the same time I think

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.050 
entertained but at the same time I think
that<00:05:01.909> you<00:05:02.180> should<00:05:02.360> leave<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:03.020> movie<00:05:04.060> feeling

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
that you should leave a movie feeling

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.240 
that you should leave a movie feeling
educated<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:05.720> feeling<00:05:06.050> like<00:05:06.949> you<00:05:07.070> learned

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
educated to feeling like you learned

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.189 
educated to feeling like you learned
something<00:05:07.490> about<00:05:08.150> yourself<00:05:08.630> you're<00:05:08.870> only<00:05:09.020> as

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
something about yourself you're only as

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.659
