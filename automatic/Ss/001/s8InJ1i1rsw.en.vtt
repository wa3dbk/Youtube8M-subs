mirror my dog and hotel in Taipei and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.970 
mirror my dog and hotel in Taipei and
well<00:00:15.570> we're<00:00:15.750> not<00:00:15.870> sharing<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.350> room<00:00:18.980> like

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
well we're not sharing the room like

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.929 
well we're not sharing the room like
that<00:00:21.470> couple<00:00:22.470> systems<00:00:22.949> set<00:00:23.189> up<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.609> they<00:00:23.789> are

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
that couple systems set up and they are

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.250 
that couple systems set up and they are
the<00:00:24.740> z68<00:00:25.740> or<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> z68<00:00:27.150> if<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.840> know<00:00:27.960> from

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the z68 or the z68 if you you know from

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.099 
the z68 or the z68 if you you know from
England<00:00:28.619> or<00:00:28.769> Australia<00:00:29.689> so<00:00:30.689> we're<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:31.019> to

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
England or Australia so we're going to

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.770 
England or Australia so we're going to
look<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.130> them<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.550> specifically<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.450> Intel

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
look at them and specifically the Intel

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.020 
look at them and specifically the Intel
Smart<00:00:34.380> Response<00:00:34.590> technology<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:38.879> have

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
Smart Response technology and so we have

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.060 
Smart Response technology and so we have
two<00:00:39.239> systems<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.870> front<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.140> us<00:00:40.260> today<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.860> we

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
two systems in front of us today and we

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.670 
two systems in front of us today and we
want<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.340> show<00:00:41.520> how<00:00:42.329> much<00:00:42.360> faster<00:00:43.050> Intel<00:00:43.469> Smart

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
want to show how much faster Intel Smart

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.190 
want to show how much faster Intel Smart
Response<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.520> versus<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> hard<00:00:45.840> drive<00:00:46.050> only

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
Response is versus a hard drive only

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.770 
Response is versus a hard drive only
system<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.489> both<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> these<00:00:48.059> systems<00:00:48.300> are

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
system so both of these systems are

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.350 
system so both of these systems are
identically<00:00:49.440> configured<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:51.090> only

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
identically configured the only

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.450 
identically configured the only
difference<00:00:51.750> being<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.559> has<00:00:52.829> Intel

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
difference being this one has Intel

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.490 
difference being this one has Intel
Smart<00:00:53.640> Response<00:00:54.110> they're<00:00:55.110> both<00:00:55.289> gigabyte<00:00:56.210> z68

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
Smart Response they're both gigabyte z68

what<00:01:08.850> type<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.090> SSD<00:01:09.600> does<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.380> been<00:01:10.409> in

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
what type of SSD does that have been in

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
what type of SSD does that have been in
the<00:01:11.130> system<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> benefit<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.900> main

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the system so the benefit the main

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.070 
the system so the benefit the main
benefit<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.610> Intel<00:01:14.610> Smart<00:01:14.729> Response<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.540> for

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
benefit of Intel Smart Response is for

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.760 
benefit of Intel Smart Response is for
people<00:01:16.470> who<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.979> low<00:01:17.790> capacity<00:01:18.420> SSDs<00:01:19.080> like

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
people who have low capacity SSDs like

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.100 
people who have low capacity SSDs like
and<00:01:20.159> these<00:01:20.460> systems<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.090> both<00:01:21.210> 20<00:01:21.600> gigabyte

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and these systems are both 20 gigabyte

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.980 
and these systems are both 20 gigabyte
SSDs<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.729> use<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.119> low<00:01:24.390> capacity

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
SSDs so you can use that low capacity

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.560 
SSDs so you can use that low capacity
SSD<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> lot<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> caching<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
SSD and do a lot of caching on to that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810 
SSD and do a lot of caching on to that
so<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.500> almost<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.430> had<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.610> much

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
so it's almost as if you had a much

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.390 
so it's almost as if you had a much
higher<00:01:30.090> capacity<00:01:30.439> SSD<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.979> you've<00:01:32.130> loaded

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
higher capacity SSD that you've loaded

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.429 
higher capacity SSD that you've loaded
your<00:01:32.610> OS<00:01:33.030> onto<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.780> you've<00:01:33.960> loaded<00:01:34.259> your

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
your OS onto and you've loaded your

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.249 
your OS onto and you've loaded your
applications<00:01:35.310> onto<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.329> reality<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
applications onto but in reality all of

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.440 
applications onto but in reality all of
those<00:01:37.380> applications<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> OS<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.909> loaded<00:01:39.329> onto

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
those applications and OS is loaded onto

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.899 
those applications and OS is loaded onto
a<00:01:39.630> normal<00:01:40.110> regular<00:01:40.380> hard<00:01:40.799> drive<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
a normal regular hard drive right is it

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.670 
a normal regular hard drive right is it
very<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> automatic<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.140> very<00:01:43.320> easy<00:01:43.530> for

Response technology no get sweetness

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.980 
Response technology no get sweetness
here<00:02:18.480> big<00:02:18.750> come<00:02:18.960> on<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.320> skew<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.430> know<00:02:20.990> they

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
here big come on and skew you know they

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.260 
here big come on and skew you know they
going<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.460> set<00:02:23.460> up<00:02:23.580> systems<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.060> we're<00:02:24.180> gonna

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
going to set up systems so we're gonna

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.800 
going to set up systems so we're gonna
see<00:02:24.570> what<00:02:25.490> how<00:02:26.490> effective<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.150> technology

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
see what how effective this technology

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.960 
see what how effective this technology
is<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.200> let's<00:02:28.860> go<00:02:29.100> on<00:02:29.340> three<00:02:30.060> two<00:02:30.870> one

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.670 

so<00:02:35.970> again<00:02:36.210> like<00:02:36.360> these<00:02:36.570> are<00:02:36.780> both<00:02:36.960> identical

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
so again like these are both identical

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.000 
so again like these are both identical
systems<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.910> one<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.270> right<00:02:39.980> has<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
systems the one on the right has the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.090 
systems the one on the right has the
Smart<00:02:41.700> Response<00:02:41.870> SST<00:02:42.870> technology<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.860> one<00:02:43.980> on

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
Smart Response SST technology the one on

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.200 
Smart Response SST technology the one on
the<00:02:44.220> left<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:45.650> traditional<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:48.090> a

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
the left is traditional just a

00:02:48.210 --> 00:03:03.380 
the left is traditional just a
traditional<00:02:48.750> hard<00:02:49.110> drive

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.450 

to<00:03:03.960> basically<00:03:04.260> what<00:03:04.470> we're<00:03:04.620> looking<00:03:04.650> for<00:03:04.950> here

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
to basically what we're looking for here

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.290 
to basically what we're looking for here
is<00:03:05.490> for<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.980> system<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.550> right<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.180> you

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
is for the system on the right so you

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.490 
is for the system on the right so you
get<00:03:09.510> into<00:03:09.840> Windows<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.850> finish<00:03:11.850> loading

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
get into Windows and finish loading

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.040 
get into Windows and finish loading
before<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.760> system<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.240> left<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.930> can

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
before the system on the left you can

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.910 
before the system on the left you can
see<00:03:16.110> it's<00:03:16.380> in<00:03:16.530> there<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:17.550> it's<00:03:17.670> loaded<00:03:18.920> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
see it's in there and it's loaded the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.830 
see it's in there and it's loaded the
system<00:03:20.280> on<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.430> left<00:03:20.580> is<00:03:20.850> still<00:03:21.209> going<00:03:21.540> and

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
system on the left is still going and

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.949 
system on the left is still going and
it's<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.950> hourglass<00:03:23.520> is<00:03:23.850> still<00:03:24.150> ticking<00:03:24.420> over

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
it's the hourglass is still ticking over

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.470 
it's the hourglass is still ticking over
and<00:03:25.320> now<00:03:25.410> it's<00:03:25.560> done<00:03:25.760> say<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.820> know<00:03:27.180> there<00:03:27.360> was

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
and now it's done say you know there was

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.650 
and now it's done say you know there was
you<00:03:28.110> know<00:03:28.850> time<00:03:29.850> difference<00:03:30.180> there<00:03:30.450> and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
you know time difference there and

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.660 
you know time difference there and
that's<00:03:31.290> one<00:03:31.470> that's<00:03:31.709> just<00:03:31.800> a<00:03:32.040> start<00:03:32.310> up<00:03:32.430> time

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
that's one that's just a start up time

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.729 
that's one that's just a start up time
there's<00:03:33.510> gonna<00:03:33.569> be<00:03:33.750> other<00:03:33.900> benefits<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.590> this

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
there's gonna be other benefits to this

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.199 
there's gonna be other benefits to this
technology<00:03:35.280> as<00:03:35.400> well<00:03:35.610> but<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:35.940> just<00:03:36.030> a

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
technology as well but this is just a

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.550 
technology as well but this is just a
quick<00:03:36.360> look<00:03:36.630> at<00:03:37.200> what<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.280> can<00:03:38.400> expect<00:03:38.430> from

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
quick look at what you can expect from

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.430 
quick look at what you can expect from
this<00:03:40.560> technology<00:03:40.980> on<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.690> z68<00:03:42.690> platform<00:03:43.230> and

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
this technology on the z68 platform and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.430 
this technology on the z68 platform and
then<00:03:44.100> gigabyte<00:03:44.760> motherboards<00:03:45.330> that<00:03:45.420> would

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.949 

shut<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.620> shutdown<00:03:49.980> time<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:50.850> on<00:03:51.000> one<00:03:51.269> though

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
shut that shutdown time so on one though

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.960 
shut that shutdown time so on one though
these<00:03:52.739> guys<00:03:52.950> will<00:03:53.160> turn<00:03:53.310> off<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.489> system<00:03:53.850> will

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
these guys will turn off the system will

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:08.990 
these guys will turn off the system will
save<00:03:54.180> time<00:03:54.450> shuts<00:03:54.959> down<00:03:55.110> first<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:57.709> 331

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000 

and<00:04:09.570> that's<00:04:09.750> off<00:04:12.200> now<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.260> other<00:04:13.500> myself<00:04:13.860> so

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
and that's off now the other myself so

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.340 
and that's off now the other myself so
that<00:04:14.190> was<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.850> was<00:04:15.390> a<00:04:15.450> little<00:04:15.480> slow<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.900> guess<00:04:16.230> I'm

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
that was I was a little slow I guess I'm

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.380 
that was I was a little slow I guess I'm
calling<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.890> system<00:04:17.430> on<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.579> rise<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:18.030> yeah

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
calling the system on the rise but yeah

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.990 
calling the system on the rise but yeah
you<00:04:18.630> can<00:04:18.810> see<00:04:19.049> this<00:04:19.230> technology<00:04:19.950> does<00:04:20.760> work

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
you can see this technology does work

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.180 
you can see this technology does work
and<00:04:21.680> there<00:04:22.680> are<00:04:22.770> definite<00:04:23.400> speed<00:04:24.680> legacy<00:04:25.680> kind

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
and there are definite speed legacy kind

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.420 
and there are definite speed legacy kind
of<00:04:26.340> improvements<00:04:27.240> here
