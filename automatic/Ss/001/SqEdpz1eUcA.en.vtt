00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.799 

nice<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.869> fresh<00:00:28.140> me<00:00:32.269> flatten<00:00:33.269> it<00:00:33.360> out<00:00:33.480> boom

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.439 
nice and fresh me flatten it out boom
the<00:00:34.199> idea<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.680> get<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.949> probably<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:36.059> 15

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449

to<00:00:36.540> 16<00:00:36.989> inch<00:00:37.170> pizza<00:00:44.360> when<00:00:45.360> I'm<00:00:45.449> doing<00:00:45.690> right

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
to 16 inch pizza when I'm doing right

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.189 
to 16 inch pizza when I'm doing right
now<00:00:45.869> is<00:00:46.019> I'm<00:00:46.260> forming<00:00:46.650> crust<00:00:47.960> trying<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.049> stay

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
now is I'm forming crust trying to stay

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.479 
now is I'm forming crust trying to stay
off<00:00:49.229> of<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.619> so<00:00:49.799> I<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.010> keep<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.339> little

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
off of that so I can keep a little

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:00.250 
off of that so I can keep a little
minimal<00:00:50.940> crust<00:00:51.210> gone

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.420 

just<00:01:00.920> like<00:01:01.130> that<00:01:02.290> once<00:01:03.290> I<00:01:03.410> complete<00:01:03.800> my<00:01:03.829> circle

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
just like that once I complete my circle

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.430 
just like that once I complete my circle
then<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:04.670> start<00:01:04.970> stretching<00:01:05.330> all<00:01:06.080> I'm<00:01:06.320> really

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
then I start stretching all I'm really

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.990 
then I start stretching all I'm really
doing<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.890> kind<00:01:07.250> of<00:01:07.310> pulling<00:01:07.550> it<00:01:07.700> out<00:01:07.820> with

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
doing is kind of pulling it out with

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.609 
doing is kind of pulling it out with
this<00:01:08.120> hand<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.600> just<00:01:08.720> rotating<00:01:09.260> it<00:01:09.290> with<00:01:09.409> that

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
this hand and just rotating it with that

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.859 
this hand and just rotating it with that
hand<00:01:09.970> trying<00:01:10.970> to<00:01:11.030> keep<00:01:11.240> as<00:01:11.420> much<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.780> the

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
hand trying to keep as much in the

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.160 
hand trying to keep as much in the
middle<00:01:12.110> as<00:01:12.229> I<00:01:12.350> can<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:14.750> we<00:01:14.930> don't<00:01:15.080> get

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
middle as I can so that we don't get

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.700 
middle as I can so that we don't get
weak<00:01:16.010> spots<00:01:19.990> staying<00:01:20.990> away<00:01:21.170> from<00:01:21.350> that<00:01:21.500> cross

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
weak spots staying away from that cross

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.960 
weak spots staying away from that cross
