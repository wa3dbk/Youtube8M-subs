the<00:02:54.590> answer<00:02:54.620> I<00:02:55.250> would<00:02:55.310> say<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:56.090> um<00:02:57.340> yes<00:02:58.340> for<00:02:58.640> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
the answer I would say is um yes for the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.240 
the answer I would say is um yes for the
most<00:02:58.880> part<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.500> the<00:03:00.500> only<00:03:00.620> reason<00:03:00.739> I<00:03:01.069> do<00:03:01.130> that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
most part and the only reason I do that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.930 
most part and the only reason I do that
is<00:03:01.610> because<00:03:02.000> um<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:03.310> mean<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.400> just<00:03:04.430> sit<00:03:04.760> in<00:03:04.790> front

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
is because um I mean I just sit in front

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.509 
is because um I mean I just sit in front
of<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.180> TV<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.599> eat<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.500> know<00:03:06.650> sometimes<00:03:07.220> but

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
of the TV and eat you know sometimes but

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.370 
of the TV and eat you know sometimes but
one<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.360> reasons<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:08.720> do<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:09.019> is<00:03:09.170> because

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
one of the reasons I do that is because

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.940 
one of the reasons I do that is because
I<00:03:09.560> believe<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:09.980> food<00:03:10.459> is<00:03:10.819> an<00:03:11.569> eating<00:03:12.080> should
