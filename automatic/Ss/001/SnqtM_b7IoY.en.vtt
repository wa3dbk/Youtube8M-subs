boom<00:02:14.400> purple<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:16.230> next<00:02:16.500> one<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.740> is

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
boom purple and the next one I have is

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.460 
boom purple and the next one I have is
in<00:02:17.280> cherry<00:02:17.610> red<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:19.050> cherry

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
in cherry red and it is just a cherry

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.590 
in cherry red and it is just a cherry
red<00:02:19.710> color<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.640> think<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.060> has<00:02:21.210> more<00:02:21.540> of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
red color but I think it has more of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.680 
red color but I think it has more of
like<00:02:21.870> an<00:02:22.230> orangish<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:24.330> looks

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
like an orangish to it so it just looks

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.530 
like an orangish to it so it just looks
like<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.760> these<00:02:26.760> are<00:02:26.880> all<00:02:27.030> all<00:02:27.480> very

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
like that these are all all very

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.830 
like that these are all all very
moisturizing<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.520> really<00:02:29.790> like<00:02:30.000> these<00:02:30.210> so

that I've picked up I would say the only
one<00:07:20.520> that<00:07:20.670> I<00:07:20.700> really<00:07:20.760> don't<00:07:21.240> like<00:07:22.700> are<00:07:23.700> these

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330 
one that I really don't like are these

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.360 
one that I really don't like are these
which<00:07:24.780> are<00:07:24.900> the<00:07:24.960> Maybelline<00:07:25.320> Hydra<00:07:25.680> shine<00:07:25.920> and

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.370 
which are the Maybelline Hydra shine and

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.840 
which are the Maybelline Hydra shine and
campy<00:07:26.970> which<00:07:27.270> was<00:07:27.480> the<00:07:27.690> brown<00:07:27.990> color<00:07:28.350> and<00:07:28.850> also

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:29.850 
campy which was the brown color and also

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.900 
campy which was the brown color and also
the<00:07:30.030> one<00:07:30.180> in<00:07:30.450> the<00:07:30.570> white<00:07:30.690> color<00:07:31.310> so<00:07:32.310> I'm<00:07:32.700> not

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:32.910 
the one in the white color so I'm not

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.280 
the one in the white color so I'm not
sure<00:07:32.970> if<00:07:33.180> the<00:07:33.450> Dollar<00:07:33.630> Tree<00:07:33.720> got<00:07:34.080> these

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.290 
sure if the Dollar Tree got these

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.960 
sure if the Dollar Tree got these
because<00:07:34.710> there<00:07:34.950> were<00:07:35.100> their<00:07:35.280> colors<00:07:35.640> that

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:35.970 
because there were their colors that

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.220 
because there were their colors that
weren't<00:07:36.210> selling<00:07:36.630> because<00:07:36.780> they<00:07:37.020> were<00:07:37.080> in

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.230 
weren't selling because they were in

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.010 
weren't selling because they were in
awkward<00:07:37.710> colors<00:07:38.540> just<00:07:39.540> kind<00:07:39.780> of<00:07:39.900> pay

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 
awkward colors just kind of pay

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.960 
awkward colors just kind of pay
attention<00:07:40.050> to<00:07:40.590> the<00:07:40.680> bottom<00:07:40.830> because<00:07:41.400> they

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:41.970 
attention to the bottom because they

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.730 
attention to the bottom because they
really<00:07:42.300> do<00:07:42.480> let<00:07:42.720> you<00:07:42.840> know<00:07:42.990> what<00:07:43.260> color<00:07:43.500> they

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 
really do let you know what color they

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.230 
really do let you know what color they
are<00:07:43.770> they're<00:07:44.190> pretty<00:07:44.340> spot-on<00:07:44.730> with<00:07:45.090> their

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 
are they're pretty spot-on with their

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.000 
are they're pretty spot-on with their
little<00:07:45.480> color<00:07:45.690> swatch<00:07:46.080> on<00:07:46.320> the<00:07:46.410> bottom<00:07:46.710> so

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.010 
little color swatch on the bottom so

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.640 
little color swatch on the bottom so
these<00:07:47.880> are<00:07:48.330> questionable<00:07:48.870> but<00:07:49.230> all<00:07:49.350> the<00:07:49.470> other

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:49.650
