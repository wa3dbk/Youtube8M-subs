for<00:01:38.130> both<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.399> real<00:01:38.579> system<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.689> swing<00:01:40.020> so

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
for both the real system and to swing so

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.649 
for both the real system and to swing so
amazing<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.850> go<00:01:41.969> and<00:01:42.090> play<00:01:42.179> 18<00:01:42.630> holes

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.630 
with the robot break the machine I
thought<00:01:55.679> it<00:01:59.869> was<00:02:00.869> nice<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.140> high<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.189> then

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
thought it was nice and high so then

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.130 
thought it was nice and high so then
what<00:02:02.789> we<00:02:02.909> would<00:02:03.060> do<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.539> we<00:02:03.810> would<00:02:03.840> take<00:02:04.079> that

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
what we would do is we would take that

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.270 
what we would do is we would take that
and<00:02:04.560> then<00:02:04.679> we<00:02:04.829> could<00:02:04.979> give<00:02:05.099> you<00:02:05.130> a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and then we could give you a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.709 
and then we could give you a
recommendation<00:02:05.489> as<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.209> what<00:02:06.450> would<00:02:06.569> be<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
recommendation as to what would be the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.350 
recommendation as to what would be the
best<00:02:06.959> club<00:02:07.229> for<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.069> myself<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:09.209> an

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
best club for you because I myself is an

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.619 
best club for you because I myself is an
individualistic<00:02:10.049> game<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:11.489> not<00:02:11.730> something

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
individualistic game it's not something

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.960 
individualistic game it's not something
your<00:02:13.110> club<00:02:13.440> could<00:02:14.040> not<00:02:14.220> fit<00:02:14.430> me<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.760> vice

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
your club could not fit me and vice

our<00:03:25.650> genes<00:03:25.800> made<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.010> fantastic<00:03:26.190> sport<00:03:26.730> he's

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
our genes made a fantastic sport he's

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.660 
our genes made a fantastic sport he's
kind<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.630> penned<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.110> here<00:03:28.380> behind

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
kind of penned in here behind

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.100 
kind of penned in here behind
bulletproof<00:03:29.670> glass<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.420> think<00:03:30.450> he<00:03:30.720> was<00:03:30.840> saying

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
bulletproof glass I think he was saying

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.080 
bulletproof glass I think he was saying
and<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:31.950> he's<00:03:32.100> really<00:03:32.130> great<00:03:32.460> sport<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.820> let<00:03:32.970> us

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
and so he's really great sport to let us

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.460
