how<00:01:55.300> it<00:01:55.360> works<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:56.140> start<00:01:56.800> from<00:01:56.950> point<00:01:57.250> and

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
how it works is you start from point and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.350 
how it works is you start from point and
then<00:01:58.480> you<00:01:58.630> just<00:01:58.840> drag<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.460> stuff<00:02:00.970> in<00:02:01.120> here
