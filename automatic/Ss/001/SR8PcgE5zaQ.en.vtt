00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.400
 there are very good youtube here and I know that 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.990
 commenting and I bring you a gameplay of 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.120
 a normal game good for well but 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.590
 normal a gameplay because in my opinion that 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.110
 you're going to like it a lot 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.240
 Pretty funny is not a nuclear 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.429
 vale is a game of signed bassoon 66 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.619
 2 with the scorpion with fast fire and 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.690
 good you will say these of the pot not like 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.520
 this happens to put this fire gun fast 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.560
 and well, you asked me for a nuclear 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.109
 this weapon in this game almost almost 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.119
 I also take it out because I'm going a bit 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.619
 crazy too and as you can see I do not have gusts 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.239
 to go to nuclear but I wanted to bring 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.590
 a normal game with her and she has 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.399
 come out this great game that really 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.170
 I do not stop killing is a weapon that is very 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.880
 difficult very difficult to tame with fire 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 fast either I do not know why but I 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.730
 playing a little bit with her because 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.200
 I took point to go last shot in the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.600
 head that you metal sniper awesome 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.519
 we go 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.500
 As I said, I had to play some 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.420
 how many games with her to tame the 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.219
 that sometimes I shoot from little to little to 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.559
 that I do not leave because you know that the 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.969
 scorpion has a lot of recoil and already 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.829
 If you put the fire quickly, 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.839
 greatly increases the recoil that happens 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.670
 Well, up close, it's a fucking beast 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.520
 You will see that there are many each face that 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.440
 is that we go and kill them as if telling me 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.210
 you eat you know it's mine problem 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.100
 that you are killing me with this I of 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.930
 close and good, you also see that the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.600
 gusts that I take are of air attack 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.729
 I carry the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.320
 the stealth helicopter took the ub sad 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.729
 I was going to see a moment of departure that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.799
 You see, they're going to accumulate from so much 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.810
 get out so fast because they're streaks 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.820
 while making up - involved with 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.250
 they are rats that are very close 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.689
 fast as you get the bone then 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.940
 can easily reach the air and the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.259
 The helicopter and the 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.000
 helicopter because it is killing more than 100 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.289
 he looks sad like that when you are 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.450
 seeing then up close is an authentic 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.619
 machine this weapon as I tell you not me 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.270
 took out the nuclear in this game because 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.460
 I was not going for it either, it created like a streak 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.630
 of 20 something and it just looked like I was 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.850
 I was running out of time I had 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.440
 opportunity to go for it gives me a game 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.539
 very much and it kills the two requests 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.610
 of gameplay are because I have no value anymore 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.050
 is weapon burns the bullets so 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.119
 say it if you do not put him as I have 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.220
 I the cannon expanded or has forgotten 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.319
 forget to kill two followed 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.509
 because it's impossible almost nothing the 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.130
 bullets disappear when you kill one 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.679
 as for example here so imagine 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.780
 to kill two people and kill them without 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.130
 the loader extended so they are super 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.019
 indispensable by rapid fire the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.000
 extended padlock and super indispensable 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.590
 also the long cannon since the fire 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.480
 quickly takes away the weapon's reach 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.950
 the scope and distance does not kill 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.750
 then the long cannon kills a little 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.360
 more as you are seeing 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.800
 and you will see then also 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.900
 kill me the distances the truth that is 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.010
 a pretty good weapon but as I say 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.390
 I think it's the hardest one in 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.610
 control of the game by the theme of 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.560
 recoil and all that but if you have a 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.270
 pretty firm finger and you have the good ones 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.340
 hell, I think you can finish it 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.959
 dominating as I miss her if you want a 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.040
 nuclear with this weapon in the comments 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.660
 because I think it can be quite 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.280
 fun in this case as I say I was not going 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.080
 for her but arrives I can try that 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.790
 why not and here you are also seeing 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.050
 the new cyborg camouflage that we 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.760
 had brought gameplay with them there was already 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.560
 promised a nuclear with him but hey 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.880
 everything that is made to wait since yesterday 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.260
 I climbed a nuclear one and it had not gone up two 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.000
 nuclear followed would not be a little 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.530
 although sometimes I have done it will be a bit 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.170
 crazy because I do not play much with 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.489
 exams and I'm right now without many 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.750
 nuclear so I have to start at 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.280
 play to get me out I wanted to take them out 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.380
 be in play for today because it was going to be 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.430
 competitive but I tell you but I said 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.110
 I'm not going to give you a bit of the tabarra with 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.300
 the competitive and I will raise this 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.530
 game that is quite entertaining and 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.670
 Well, also talk a little bit 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.500
 about this I think it's the first 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.090
 situation that kill me in danger you see 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.980
 as many times they let me touch a 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.170
 tooth is to flee here I try to cancel 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.790
 the recharge but having the charger 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.890
 extended the recharge is a little bit more 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.480
 slow and give a little before 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.319
 finish finishing the recharge and that's why 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.599
 they kill me then you will see 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.150
 and the same thing happens to me when they kill me 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.379
 nuclear so good this game on play 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.840
 background and we're going to talk about the special 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.909
 25,000 that we will surely arrive tomorrow 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.499
 or happened the safest and you will be me 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.599
 asking what are you thinking for the 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:45.269
 special 25,000 because I have not weigh 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.439
 other things I will not celebrate this 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.819
 week because this week I have a 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.280
 last exam but it waits for me in the 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.719
 next week that I have free and I will do 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.219
 two streams are you looking good I'll 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.780
 do a streaming playing with my 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.280
 partners in league mode is to say for 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.689
 that you see how I play molina and all that 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.069
 that can be quite entertaining to 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.780
 see if people do not peel it a lot because 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.519
 there are many people that as you know in mode 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.200
 league is pulled and that's why I want to play a 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.180
 team because if I start playing with 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.560
 two more we play loose at 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.000
 end always gets you with people who are going 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.980
 leaving the fixed games that low 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.340
 and last is shots with the scorpion of 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.470
 far impressive good as I said 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.060
 and then good apart from the streaming of 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.109
 mobile was going to do a streaming that with 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.729
 you that I have not done for a long time 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.349
 when with subscribers the idea would be 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.430
 then do the same thing from the other time but 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.680
 this time I could play with 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.120
 you public ones really gives me 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.560
 a little bit of anger to play public with 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.690
 you because when we make a 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.520
 playing with your in private we are 18 if 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.900
 I'm not wrong and when we put a 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.950
 public as much as we see 9 no 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.960
 so 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.690
 it would be the first nine that come together 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.950
 I would leave the group open and 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.120
 select to play with me and see 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.820
 if we do not get some good game 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.410
 obviously as you know everyone 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.820
 he has his good games but if you have 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.740
 bad games so do not expect that 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.420
 so to speak, do and always do 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.040
 a nuclear or mega always a departure 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.390
 of this style because it is not like that or 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.440
 everyone has their good parts and 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:00.630
 bad then all the respective subject 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.160
 that you ask me you know that I have 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.160
 pending the current with the players 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.540
 of competitive the top gameplays I have 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.860
 also the nuclear-minded series 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.240
 how good yesterday I made the episode that the 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.310
 I also had a little left almost 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.810
 I had a whole week without uploading the one 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.669
 almost two weeks forgiveness without uploading it 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.810
 also the montage theme that I told you 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.950
 of kalu tico another has not been able to play 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.840
 a lot so I do not have any clip 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.580
 interesting yes I have but they would be 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.910
 readers would already be a little shit 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.139
 and such triple triple triple forgiveness fit 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.180
 not triple would be a kippa with one click 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.540
 pretty good and profiles well I do not know 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.360
 pretty simple pretty simple clicks 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.470
 things and I know simple enough and then 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.060
 I also have crisis war 2 of 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.770
 competitive to make a new assembly 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.960
 as I said I have also clips so 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.320
 I link to about three or four I also have 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.150
 thought good saved the clips of 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.340
 public to do the assembly of the 50 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.560
 nuclear and if we reach the 100's 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.690
 nuclear that will not walk the thing up 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.000
 that the new game is made and in 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.889
 all that, not that you have 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.780
 patience do not follow much do not demand me 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.310
 a lot these days because you know I'm 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.840
 of exams and I do not dedicate all the 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.310
 time I would like youtube but as 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.870
 I told you in yesterday's gameplay 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.479
 evidently first there are the studies 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.760
 and then until youtube so I do not 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.920
 ask for pears to elm and be patient 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.260
 you have to understand what 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.330
 As I said, I would like to dedicate 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.310
 more time both to play and to draw 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.200
 gameplays how to make videos a little 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.300
 best more level but as I say 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.160
 can not as I like to fulfill and always 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.360

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.350

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.940

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.740

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.940
 year protection that I and focus more 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.560
 in the studios and leave a little aside 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.200
 youtube and do not want to upload videos 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.910
 newspapers but I think you deserve that 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.440
 of this is that upload daily videos 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.030
 because really every day 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.350
 you are super good with both the guides 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.150
 as competitive as with the 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.490
 public and I'm a little sorry that you 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.010
 you stay a day without seeing it without seeing a 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.990
 gameplay not so I understand that that 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.690
 it may not be not involved in the 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.280
 rehostia but that are printed for 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.570
 you not to fulfill and here and 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.450
 to thank you for all the support that 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.550
 dais not then as you are seeing already 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.990
 We are finishing the game just 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.670
 nothing was left and I'm good because I'm going 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.530
 try to force the nuclear because I do not 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.570
 come to give time anyway here 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.310
 I start and good starts jce for failure 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.810
 the first shots I try to cancel the 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.490
 recharge does not give me time and they kill me the same 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.110
 that before I run out of bullets so 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.240
 as I said before super indispensable 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.740
 he looks and how he moves up and I 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.099
 lowering it with your finger there 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.810
 How could I tell you what you have 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:24.250
 what to do with this weapon is always 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.690
 scavenger because if you can not say 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.729
 goodbye to bullets loader extended and 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.560
 Long reed is worth that with rapid fire 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:31.720
 I mean without rapid fire also what 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.819
 I carry like this instead of carrying fast fire 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.680
 so he took off the third accessory or I 

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:38.160
 I put a tail where it is sheathed and 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.930
 then I wear the 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.340
 the east as the vest is called for 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.870
 want an explosive atr in this case to 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.400
 vest so good I had a little bit of 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.300
 lucky they did not throw me anything and now 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.590
 you have the death chamber of 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.880
 helicopter with the dragon title 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.290
 I hope you like this gameplay 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.940
