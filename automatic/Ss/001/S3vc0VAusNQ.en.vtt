tilda original pure basmati rice now
there's<00:00:11.940> two<00:00:12.120> methods<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.509> cooking<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.929> rice

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
there's two methods of cooking this rice

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.990 
there's two methods of cooking this rice
you<00:00:13.590> can<00:00:13.710> use<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> traditional<00:00:14.130> absorption

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
you can use the traditional absorption

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.150 
you can use the traditional absorption
method<00:00:15.150> or<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.690> pasta<00:00:16.109> cooking<00:00:16.350> method<00:00:16.710> the

one I'm going to show you here is how to

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.630 
one I'm going to show you here is how to
use<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.869> absorption<00:00:19.590> method<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.310> first<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
use the absorption method so first of

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.040 
use the absorption method so first of
all<00:00:20.730> when<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.850> comes<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.180> quantities<00:00:21.570> Tilda

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
all when it comes to quantities Tilda

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.500 
all when it comes to quantities Tilda
will<00:00:22.080> recommend<00:00:22.590> 60<00:00:23.010> grams<00:00:23.220> per<00:00:23.519> person<00:00:24.029> which

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
will recommend 60 grams per person which

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.939 
will recommend 60 grams per person which
is<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.779> have<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.109> here<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
is what I have in here but for the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.230 
is what I have in here but for the
demonstration<00:00:26.519> purposes<00:00:26.820> I'm<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.029> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
demonstration purposes I'm going to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.580 
demonstration purposes I'm going to
double<00:00:27.539> those<00:00:27.630> quantities<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.380> you'll<00:00:28.500> have

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
double those quantities so you'll have

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.410 
double those quantities so you'll have
enough<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.980> serve<00:00:29.160> two<00:00:29.369> people<00:00:29.820> now<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.359> I

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
enough to serve two people now what I

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.209 
enough to serve two people now what I
have<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.869> 120<00:00:31.560> grams<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> rice<00:00:32.189> and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
have here is 120 grams of the rice and

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.830 
have here is 120 grams of the rice and
it's<00:00:32.579> been<00:00:32.730> soaking<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.270> cold<00:00:33.540> water<00:00:33.750> for

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
it's been soaking in cold water for

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.760 
it's been soaking in cold water for
about<00:00:34.050> 30<00:00:34.320> minutes

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
about 30 minutes

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.440 
about 30 minutes
this<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.399> softens<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> grain<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.360> you

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
this just softens the grain and if you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.910 
this just softens the grain and if you
have<00:00:36.600> time<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.649> not<00:00:37.770> essential

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
have time do it but it's not essential

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.860 
have time do it but it's not essential
if<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.370> don't<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> need<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.570> now<00:00:39.719> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
if you don't and all I need to do now is

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.450 
if you don't and all I need to do now is
rinsed<00:00:40.170> under<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.469> cold<00:00:40.649> tap<00:00:40.890> until<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
rinsed under the cold tap until the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.160 
rinsed under the cold tap until the
water<00:00:41.640> runs<00:00:41.820> clear<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.600> getting<00:00:42.840> rid<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.020> any

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
water runs clear just getting rid of any

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.250 
water runs clear just getting rid of any
excess<00:00:43.530> starch<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.870> need<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> do

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
excess starch so now all you need to do

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
excess starch so now all you need to do
is<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.530> drain<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:49.950> rice<00:00:50.190> through<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> sieve

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
is just drain your rice through a sieve

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.360 
is just drain your rice through a sieve
and<00:00:52.370> then<00:00:53.370> hold<00:00:53.610> under<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> cold<00:00:54.120> running<00:00:54.570> tap

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
and then hold under a cold running tap

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:05.850 
and then hold under a cold running tap
just<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> get<00:00:56.670> rid<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.879> any<00:00:57.030> excess<00:00:57.480> starch

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.920 

so<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:06.890> rice<00:01:07.250> has<00:01:07.430> been<00:01:07.460> drained<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.420> let's

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
so a rice has been drained and let's

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.219 
so a rice has been drained and let's
just<00:01:09.110> tip<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:09.470> into<00:01:09.619> a<00:01:09.799> saucepan<00:01:11.020> now<00:01:12.020> when

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
just tip that into a saucepan now when

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.960 
just tip that into a saucepan now when
it<00:01:12.350> comes<00:01:12.439> to<00:01:12.590> quantities<00:01:13.040> of<00:01:13.159> water<00:01:13.340> for<00:01:13.909> the

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
it comes to quantities of water for the

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.950 
it comes to quantities of water for the
absorption<00:01:14.210> method<00:01:14.689> which<00:01:14.810> is<00:01:14.930> the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
absorption method which is the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.600 
absorption method which is the
traditional<00:01:15.140> method<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:15.770> we're<00:01:15.890> using<00:01:16.040> the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
traditional method that we're using the

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.550 
traditional method that we're using the
general<00:01:16.970> guideline<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.509> one<00:01:17.869> part<00:01:18.110> rise<00:01:18.350> to

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
general guideline is one part rise to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.160 
general guideline is one part rise to
two<00:01:18.740> parts<00:01:19.039> water<00:01:19.220> so<00:01:19.759> for<00:01:19.940> our<00:01:20.060> 120<00:01:20.720> grams<00:01:20.930> our

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
two parts water so for our 120 grams our
