00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.900 
your ammo so it'll be easier to take out
long-range<00:01:35.620> targets<00:01:36.040> because<00:01:36.190> you<00:01:36.700> won't<00:01:36.850> be

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
long-range targets because you won't be

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.700 
long-range targets because you won't be
losing<00:01:37.150> all<00:01:37.450> your<00:01:37.480> ammo<00:01:37.750> at<00:01:38.020> different<00:01:38.410> um<00:01:38.530> as

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
losing all your ammo at different um as

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.120 
losing all your ammo at different um as
by<00:01:39.280> not<00:01:39.550> hitting<00:01:39.670> your<00:01:39.880> target<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.530> two<00:01:41.830> verse

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
by not hitting your target the two verse

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.980 
by not hitting your target the two verse
rounds<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.760> three<00:01:42.940> bear<00:01:43.150> arms<00:01:43.540> are<00:01:43.690> kind

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
rounds and the three bear arms are kind

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.930 
rounds and the three bear arms are kind
of<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.170> nice<00:01:44.320> balance<00:01:44.770> between<00:01:44.860> accuracy<00:01:45.460> and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
of a nice balance between accuracy and

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.000 
of a nice balance between accuracy and
the<00:01:46.150> rate<00:01:46.300> of<00:01:46.420> fire<00:01:46.659> so<00:01:47.260> on<00:01:47.440> you<00:01:47.590> can<00:01:47.620> probably

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
the rate of fire so on you can probably

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.890 
the rate of fire so on you can probably
go<00:01:48.100> for<00:01:48.280> those<00:01:48.430> middle<00:01:48.820> range<00:01:49.000> engagements

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
go for those middle range engagements

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.440 
go for those middle range engagements
for<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.770> guys<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.190> then<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.670> automatic<00:01:52.270> fire

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
for you guys and then the automatic fire

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.780 
for you guys and then the automatic fire
is<00:01:52.690> best<00:01:53.020> for<00:01:53.290> close<00:01:53.500> range<00:01:53.650> as<00:01:54.100> like<00:01:54.340> you're

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
is best for close range as like you're

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.700 
is best for close range as like you're
not<00:01:54.940> going<00:01:55.120> to<00:01:55.180> have<00:01:55.330> much<00:01:55.630> accuracy<00:01:56.230> but<00:01:56.620> you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
not going to have much accuracy but you

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.440 
not going to have much accuracy but you
can<00:01:56.830> just<00:01:56.980> fully<00:01:57.310> untape<00:01:58.000> down<00:01:58.150> your<00:01:58.330> enemies

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
can just fully untape down your enemies

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.390 
can just fully untape down your enemies
with<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.930> fully<00:01:59.200> auto<00:01:59.380> mode<00:01:59.680> however<00:02:00.100> there

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
with the fully auto mode however there

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.340 
with the fully auto mode however there
will<00:02:00.580> be<00:02:00.790> a<00:02:00.820> lot<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.420> recoil<00:02:01.659> so<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.170> got<00:02:02.320> a

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
will be a lot of recoil so you got a

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.219 
will be a lot of recoil so you got a
bear<00:02:02.560> in<00:02:02.740> mind<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:03.010> that<00:02:03.540> now<00:02:04.540> my<00:02:04.659> next<00:02:04.810> tip<00:02:05.050> is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
bear in mind of that now my next tip is

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.410 
bear in mind of that now my next tip is
about<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.830> shooting<00:02:06.220> stance<00:02:06.490> now<00:02:07.270> you're

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
about the shooting stance now you're

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.699 
about the shooting stance now you're
going<00:02:07.510> to<00:02:07.600> be<00:02:07.690> most<00:02:07.930> stable<00:02:08.229> when<00:02:08.590> you're

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
going to be most stable when you're

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.740 
going to be most stable when you're
firing<00:02:08.979> from<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.429> prone<00:02:09.729> or<00:02:09.909> crowd<00:02:10.300> spacious

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
firing from a prone or crowd spacious

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.170 
firing from a prone or crowd spacious
position<00:02:11.409> so<00:02:11.620> bear<00:02:11.889> in<00:02:11.920> mind<00:02:12.219> of<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.519> and<00:02:12.730> I'm

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
position so bear in mind of that and I'm

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.830 
position so bear in mind of that and I'm
don't<00:02:13.450> if<00:02:13.749> you<00:02:13.989> can<00:02:14.499> don't<00:02:14.859> be<00:02:15.069> i'm<00:02:15.249> shooting

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840

don't if you can don't be i'm shooting
in<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> upright<00:02:16.739> vertical<00:02:16.980> position<00:02:17.670> as<00:02:17.790> most

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
in the upright vertical position as most

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.910 
in the upright vertical position as most
of<00:02:18.420> your<00:02:18.540> body<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.900> exposed<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.590> you're<00:02:19.800> going

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
of your body is exposed and you're going

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.589 
of your body is exposed and you're going
to<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.099> taking<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.459> out<00:02:20.580> more<00:02:20.849> easily<00:02:21.180> than<00:02:21.269> if

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
to be taking it out more easily than if

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.360 
to be taking it out more easily than if
you<00:02:21.780> are<00:02:21.900> actually<00:02:22.050> prone<00:02:22.500> as<00:02:22.769> well<00:02:23.129> as<00:02:23.250> that

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
you are actually prone as well as that

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.680 
you are actually prone as well as that
like<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.580> said<00:02:23.849> before<00:02:23.940> when<00:02:24.330> you're<00:02:24.450> prone

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
like I said before when you're prone

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.000 
like I said before when you're prone
you're<00:02:24.870> going<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.200> increased<00:02:25.680> accuracy

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
you're going to have increased accuracy

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.040 
you're going to have increased accuracy
so<00:02:26.700> it's<00:02:26.879> better<00:02:27.030> just<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.330> be<00:02:27.420> prone<00:02:27.810> and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
so it's better just to be prone and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.390 
so it's better just to be prone and
everything<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.709> only<00:02:28.860> time<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.069> should<00:02:29.160> be

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
everything the only time you should be

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.559 
everything the only time you should be
really<00:02:29.700> standing<00:02:29.970> up<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:30.360> you're<00:02:30.480> just

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
really standing up as if you're just

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.970 
really standing up as if you're just
rushing<00:02:30.870> about<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.410> taking<00:02:31.680> out<00:02:31.769> all<00:02:31.800> the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.100 
it's really hard to get your aim on
target<00:03:02.849> because<00:03:03.000> I'm<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.660> enemy<00:03:03.750> keeps

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
target because I'm the enemy keeps

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.229 
target because I'm the enemy keeps
jumping<00:03:04.410> about<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:04.860> hipfire<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.489> do<00:03:05.700> really

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
jumping about so hipfire can do really

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.780 
jumping about so hipfire can do really
well<00:03:06.390> in<00:03:06.450> those<00:03:06.720> situations<00:03:07.430> now<00:03:08.430> my<00:03:08.549> fourth

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
well in those situations now my fourth

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.449 
well in those situations now my fourth
tip<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.269> using<00:03:09.870> thinking<00:03:10.799> about<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.099> recoil

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
tip is using thinking about the recoil

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.940 
tip is using thinking about the recoil
compensation<00:03:12.299> now<00:03:13.019> all<00:03:13.260> weapons<00:03:13.680> in

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
compensation now all weapons in

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.160 
compensation now all weapons in
battlefield<00:03:14.459> 4<00:03:14.549> have<00:03:14.970> some<00:03:15.360> form<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.780> recoil

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
battlefield 4 have some form of recoil

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.170 
battlefield 4 have some form of recoil
so<00:03:16.500> I'm<00:03:16.680> trying<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.099> get<00:03:17.190> used<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.549> it<00:03:17.579> for<00:03:18.030> each

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
so I'm trying to get used to it for each

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.369 
so I'm trying to get used to it for each
different<00:03:18.360> weapon<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:18.870> going<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.079> save<00:03:19.200> some

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
different weapon it's going to save some

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.900 
different weapon it's going to save some
time<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.769> get<00:03:19.889> used<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.190> but<00:03:20.340> over<00:03:20.579> time<00:03:20.730> you

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
time to get used to but over time you

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.910 
time to get used to but over time you
should<00:03:20.970> get<00:03:21.209> used<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.660> now<00:03:21.920> compensating

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
should get used to it now compensating

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.500 
should get used to it now compensating
for<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.370> can<00:03:23.400> either<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.000> move<00:03:24.269> your

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
for it you can either you move your

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.300 
for it you can either you move your
mouse<00:03:24.660> up<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:25.049> little<00:03:25.290> bit<00:03:25.410> or<00:03:25.560> use<00:03:25.829> your<00:03:25.950> analog

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
mouse up a little bit or use your analog

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.009 
mouse up a little bit or use your analog
stick<00:03:26.609> pusher<00:03:26.790> up<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.120> little<00:03:27.359> bit<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.660> then

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
stick pusher up a little bit and then

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.479 
stick pusher up a little bit and then
this<00:03:28.200> will<00:03:28.350> kind<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.769> thumb<00:03:28.950> till<00:03:29.160> your<00:03:29.280> weapon

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
this will kind of thumb till your weapon

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.190 
this will kind of thumb till your weapon
back<00:03:29.609> down<00:03:29.819> because<00:03:30.180> most<00:03:30.359> of<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.630> recoil<00:03:31.049> is

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
back down because most of the recoil is

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.220 
back down because most of the recoil is
from<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.560> muzzle<00:03:31.739> climbing<00:03:32.250> upwards<00:03:33.019> now<00:03:34.019> if

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
from the muzzle climbing upwards now if

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.410 
from the muzzle climbing upwards now if
you<00:03:34.440> add<00:03:34.590> an<00:03:34.769> angled<00:03:35.190> vertical<00:03:35.700> low<00:03:35.910> angled

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
you add an angled vertical low angled

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.789 
you add an angled vertical low angled
grip<00:03:36.480> not<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.780> vertical<00:03:37.230> grip<00:03:37.380> if<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:37.590> had<00:03:37.680> an

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
grip not a vertical grip if you had an

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.289 
grip not a vertical grip if you had an
angled<00:03:38.160> grip<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.549> will<00:03:38.730> help<00:03:38.849> reduce<00:03:39.120> the

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
angled grip this will help reduce the

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.660 
angled grip this will help reduce the
recoil<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.930> little<00:03:40.200> bit<00:03:40.349> but<00:03:40.799> I'm<00:03:40.980> mainly<00:03:41.340> it's

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
recoil a little bit but I'm mainly it's

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.280 
recoil a little bit but I'm mainly it's
down<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.239> just<00:03:42.480> pushing<00:03:42.690> your<00:03:42.930> mouse<00:03:43.049> up

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
down to you just pushing your mouse up

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.890 
down to you just pushing your mouse up
or<00:03:43.500> your<00:03:43.620> analog<00:03:43.950> stick<00:03:44.190> up<00:03:44.389> now<00:03:45.389> finally

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
or your analog stick up now finally

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.960 
or your analog stick up now finally
think<00:03:46.230> about<00:03:46.440> your<00:03:46.590> reloading<00:03:47.220> now<00:03:47.700> when<00:03:47.940> you

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
think about your reloading now when you

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.940 
think about your reloading now when you
reload<00:03:48.480> um<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:49.049> does<00:03:49.230> take<00:03:49.500> quite<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.739> lot<00:03:49.919> of

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
reload um it does take quite a lot of

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.140 
reload um it does take quite a lot of
time<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.430> if<00:03:50.549> you're<00:03:50.669> in<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.790> combat<00:03:51.090> situation

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
time so if you're in a combat situation

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.300 
time so if you're in a combat situation
where<00:03:51.900> there's<00:03:52.109> still<00:03:52.200> enemies<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:53.190> would

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
where there's still enemies you would

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.039 
where there's still enemies you would
have<00:03:53.579> to<00:03:53.639> probably<00:03:54.000> switch<00:03:54.419> to<00:03:54.540> your<00:03:54.630> pistol

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
have to probably switch to your pistol

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.099 
have to probably switch to your pistol
I'm<00:03:55.290> rather<00:03:55.650> than<00:03:55.799> reload<00:03:56.250> because<00:03:56.849> um<00:03:57.120> means

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
I'm rather than reload because um means

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.479 
I'm rather than reload because um means
that<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.470> switching<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.069> pistol<00:03:59.370> is

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
that the switching to the pistol is

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.190 
that the switching to the pistol is
quicker<00:03:59.819> than<00:03:59.910> reloading<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:00.900> can<00:04:01.079> take

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
quicker than reloading so you can take

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.809 
quicker than reloading so you can take
all<00:04:01.349> your<00:04:01.500> enemies<00:04:01.650> I'm<00:04:02.010> quicker<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.639> eat

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
all your enemies I'm quicker and eat

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.909 
all your enemies I'm quicker and eat
more<00:04:02.970> easily<00:04:03.269> whenever<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.349> reload<00:04:04.680> just

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
more easily whenever you reload just

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.589 
more easily whenever you reload just
make<00:04:05.069> sure<00:04:05.190> you're<00:04:05.370> in<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.519> safe<00:04:05.700> location<00:04:05.849> free

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
make sure you're in a safe location free

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.629 
make sure you're in a safe location free
from<00:04:06.810> hostiles<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.620> all<00:04:08.010> kinds<00:04:08.370> of<00:04:08.430> other

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
from hostiles and all kinds of other

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.879 
from hostiles and all kinds of other
enemy<00:04:09.060> targets<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.959> yeah<00:04:10.530> just<00:04:10.739> make<00:04:10.859> sure

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
enemy targets and yeah just make sure

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.620 
enemy targets and yeah just make sure
you're<00:04:11.160> safe<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.730> then<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:12.000> can<00:04:12.120> reload<00:04:12.450> a

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
you're safe and then you can reload a

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.960 
you're safe and then you can reload a
happily<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.200> make<00:04:13.590> sure<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.829> don't<00:04:14.010> die<00:04:14.190> so

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
happily and make sure you don't die so
