00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
starting to lean bend forward like why

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.210 
starting to lean bend forward like why
is<00:00:26.439> this<00:00:26.619> happening

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
is this happening

crooked and they look and they look they
don't<00:00:34.420> look<00:00:34.690> like<00:00:34.900> scoliosis<00:00:35.260> but<00:00:35.920> they're

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
don't look like scoliosis but they're

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.700 
don't look like scoliosis but they're
not<00:00:36.160> walking<00:00:36.670> straight<00:00:37.410> understand<00:00:38.410> when<00:00:38.650> you

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
not walking straight understand when you

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.490 
not walking straight understand when you
have<00:00:38.740> scoliosis<00:00:39.310> a<00:00:39.700> spinal<00:00:40.180> curvature<00:00:40.690> it's<00:00:41.380> a

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
have scoliosis a spinal curvature it's a

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.080 
have scoliosis a spinal curvature it's a
side<00:00:41.770> curve<00:00:42.160> your<00:00:42.910> curve<00:00:43.180> it's<00:00:44.110> go<00:00:44.290> sideways

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
side curve your curve it's go sideways

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.540 
side curve your curve it's go sideways
okay

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.040 

crooked<00:00:51.550> like<00:00:51.730> this<00:00:54.450> but<00:00:55.450> what<00:00:55.570> people<00:00:55.870> don't

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
crooked like this but what people don't

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.800 
crooked like this but what people don't
realize<00:00:56.620> is<00:00:57.210> when<00:01:00.030> when<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.060> spine<00:01:01.420> curves

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
realize is when when a spine curves

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.520 
realize is when when a spine curves
sideways<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:04.059> convex<00:01:04.689> portion<00:01:05.320> or<00:01:05.439> the

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
sideways the convex portion or the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.610 
sideways the convex portion or the
portion<00:01:05.860> that<00:01:06.009> curves<00:01:06.369> out<00:01:06.780> rotates<00:01:07.780> back<00:01:08.230> and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
portion that curves out rotates back and

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.230 
portion that curves out rotates back and
throws<00:01:09.250> you<00:01:09.400> forward<00:01:09.670> so<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:11.380> said<00:01:11.800> right<00:01:12.240> let

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
throws you forward so I said right let

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.990 
throws you forward so I said right let
me<00:01:13.360> check<00:01:13.659> to<00:01:14.020> see<00:01:14.620> if<00:01:14.920> your<00:01:15.250> legs<00:01:15.490> are<00:01:15.670> even

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
me check to see if your legs are even

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.020 
me check to see if your legs are even
because<00:01:16.300> that<00:01:16.930> knee<00:01:17.230> they<00:01:17.500> put<00:01:17.830> in<00:01:18.010> may<00:01:18.880> have

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
because that knee they put in may have

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.640 
because that knee they put in may have
been<00:01:19.240> too<00:01:19.420> long<00:01:20.040> he<00:01:21.040> goes<00:01:21.190> what<00:01:21.430> yes<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:23.470> can

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
been too long he goes what yes what can

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.010 
been too long he goes what yes what can
I<00:01:23.740> do<00:01:23.800> well<00:01:24.520> have<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.030> knee<00:01:25.300> surgery<00:01:25.510> on<00:01:25.900> the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
I do well have a knee surgery on the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.260 
I do well have a knee surgery on the
other<00:01:26.170> one<00:01:26.470> make<00:01:26.979> it<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.220> one<00:01:27.430> long<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:27.940> your

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
other one make it that one long and your

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.200 
other one make it that one long and your
even<00:01:28.830> he<00:01:29.830> didn't<00:01:30.130> like<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.430> idea<00:01:31.049> yet<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.970> I

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
even he didn't like that idea yet so I

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.840 
even he didn't like that idea yet so I
said<00:01:34.570> well<00:01:34.720> then<00:01:34.900> if<00:01:35.170> that's<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.500> case<00:01:35.850> let's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
said well then if that's the case let's

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.000 
said well then if that's the case let's
come<00:01:37.240> up<00:01:37.270> with<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.600> solution<00:01:38.080> so<00:01:38.620> let's<00:01:38.830> check

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
come up with the solution so let's check

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:47.370 
come up with the solution so let's check
his<00:01:39.159> leg<00:01:39.340> face<00:01:39.940> down<00:01:40.210> ray

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.749 

yeah<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.710> called<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:50.710> short<00:01:51.710> okay<00:01:54.549> this<00:01:55.549> is

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
yeah I called this short okay this is

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.889 
yeah I called this short okay this is
his<00:01:55.940> new<00:01:56.150> knee<00:01:56.920> this<00:01:57.920> poor<00:01:58.220> guy<00:01:58.540> went<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.689> take

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
care of his knee whoever did it didn't

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.410 
care of his knee whoever did it didn't
take<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.930> time<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.680> measure<00:02:03.890> properly<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.210> now

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
take the time to measure properly so now

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.810 
take the time to measure properly so now
they<00:02:05.780> just<00:02:05.960> created<00:02:06.490> significant<00:02:07.490> problems

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
they just created significant problems

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.729 
they just created significant problems
for<00:02:07.880> his<00:02:08.149> back<00:02:08.450> spying<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.229> everything<00:02:09.590> else

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
for his back spying and everything else

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.880 
for his back spying and everything else
and<00:02:10.610> he<00:02:10.700> was<00:02:10.850> walking<00:02:11.260> limping<00:02:12.260> down<00:02:12.530> with<00:02:12.770> his

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
and he was walking limping down with his

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.030 
and he was walking limping down with his
right<00:02:13.100> side<00:02:13.370> it's<00:02:13.940> quite<00:02:14.180> apparent<00:02:14.480> why

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
right side it's quite apparent why

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.850 
right side it's quite apparent why
there's<00:02:16.040> no<00:02:16.280> solution<00:02:16.850> for<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.239> okay<00:02:18.110> his<00:02:18.590> leg

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
there's no solution for it okay his leg

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.830 
there's no solution for it okay his leg
is<00:02:19.069> short<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.730> it's<00:02:20.600> significantly<00:02:21.170> short

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
is short and it's significantly short

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.270 
is short and it's significantly short
the<00:02:23.840> only<00:02:24.110> thing<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.769> I<00:02:24.800> know<00:02:24.950> how<00:02:25.220> to

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
the only thing that I know how to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.059 
the only thing that I know how to
correct<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:26.000> again<00:02:26.420> new<00:02:26.959> need<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.800> extend

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
correct this is again new need to extend

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.630 
correct this is again new need to extend
the<00:02:28.220> bone<00:02:28.430> quite<00:02:29.420> radical<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:31.190> sometimes

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
the bone quite radical and sometimes

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.460 
the bone quite radical and sometimes
depending<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.180> who<00:02:32.269> did<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.750> one<00:02:32.959> they<00:02:33.290> may
