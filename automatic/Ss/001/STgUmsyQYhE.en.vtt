playing video games on and I'm coming
from<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.640> keyboard<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.540> has<00:03:17.660> cherry<00:03:18.440> MX<00:03:18.680> blue

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
from a keyboard that has cherry MX blue

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.130 
from a keyboard that has cherry MX blue
key<00:03:19.489> switches<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.180> will<00:03:20.630> put<00:03:20.780> an<00:03:20.870> annotation

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
key switches and will put an annotation

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.600 
key switches and will put an annotation
on<00:03:22.100> my<00:03:22.370> face<00:03:22.780> for<00:03:23.780> went<00:03:24.680> over<00:03:24.860> different<00:03:24.890> kinds

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
on my face for went over different kinds

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.320 
on my face for went over different kinds
of<00:03:25.730> Cherry<00:03:26.030> MX<00:03:26.270> key<00:03:26.750> switches<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:28.330> the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
of Cherry MX key switches and the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.060 
of Cherry MX key switches and the
difference<00:03:29.660> was<00:03:29.780> obviously<00:03:30.320> no<00:03:30.470> there<00:03:30.860> they

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
difference was obviously no there they

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.420 
difference was obviously no there they
are<00:03:31.100> different<00:03:31.700> this<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:33.350> membrane<00:03:33.980> switch

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
are different this is a membrane switch

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.270 
are different this is a membrane switch
so<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.760> keys<00:03:34.940> wobble<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.660> little<00:03:35.720> more<00:03:36.280> it

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
so the keys wobble a little more it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.610 
so the keys wobble a little more it
doesn't<00:03:37.550> have<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:37.670> click<00:03:37.970> at<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.270> bottom<00:03:38.620> but

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
doesn't have a click at the bottom but

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.140 
doesn't have a click at the bottom but
it<00:03:39.709> still<00:03:39.920> has<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.070> tactile<00:03:40.520> bump<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.030> that's

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
it still has a tactile bump and that's

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.479 
it still has a tactile bump and that's
the<00:03:41.300> part<00:03:41.570> that<00:03:41.630> I<00:03:41.810> like<00:03:42.020> so<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:42.860> tactile<00:03:43.190> bump

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
the part that I like so the tactile bump

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.930 
the part that I like so the tactile bump
is<00:03:43.730> where<00:03:43.880> you<00:03:43.940> can<00:03:44.060> actually<00:03:44.330> feel<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:45.110> press

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
is where you can actually feel it press

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.900 
is where you can actually feel it press
so<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:46.970> had<00:03:47.270> no<00:03:47.480> problem<00:03:47.510> using<00:03:48.080> this<00:03:48.380> tonight

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
so I had no problem using this tonight

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.560 
so I had no problem using this tonight
didn't<00:03:49.910> affect<00:03:50.209> my<00:03:50.360> game<00:03:50.420> play<00:03:50.900> any<00:03:52.570> worked

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570
