whirlwind but because you may know or do

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.950 
whirlwind but because you may know or do
not<00:00:27.420> know<00:00:27.660> when<00:00:28.439> she<00:00:28.650> attacks<00:00:29.039> she<00:00:29.820> turns<00:00:30.599> she

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
not know when she attacks she turns she

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.690 
not know when she attacks she turns she

spins around and attacks all the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.920 
spins around and attacks all the
buildings<00:00:33.090> she<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.480> hit<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.760> she<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.570> used

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
buildings she can hit so she is not used

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.080 
buildings she can hit so she is not used
a<00:00:37.110> lot<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.649> lower<00:00:38.129> levels<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.969> higher

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
a lot in lower levels and the higher

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.090 
a lot in lower levels and the higher
levels<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.930> she's<00:00:40.230> not<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.770> powerful

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
levels because she's not that powerful

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.290 
levels because she's not that powerful
for<00:00:41.850> how<00:00:42.360> much<00:00:42.600> she<00:00:43.230> costs<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.040> think<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
for how much she costs I think and the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.560 
for how much she costs I think and the
time<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:46.039> takes<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.340> create<00:00:47.489> her<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.059> 50

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
time it takes to create her it's like 50

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.290 
time it takes to create her it's like 50
minutes<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.500> long<00:00:49.739> time<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:51.030> they

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
minutes and that's a long time so they

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.049 
minutes and that's a long time so they
say<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> forums<00:00:52.170> she<00:00:52.500> felt<00:00:53.010> underachieved

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
say on the forums she felt underachieved

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.450 
say on the forums she felt underachieved
so<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.539> gave<00:00:54.719> her<00:00:54.899> some<00:00:54.930> more<00:00:55.320> training<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.039> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
so we gave her some more training and a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.060 
so we gave her some more training and a
new<00:00:56.640> skill<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.210> born<00:00:57.920> reintroducing<00:00:58.920> the

new skill was born reintroducing the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.430 
new skill was born reintroducing the
Valkyrie<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.850> work<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.480> wild<00:01:00.809> whirlwind

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
multiple targets that are placed close

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:06.530 
multiple targets that are placed close
to<00:01:06.060> each<00:01:06.119> other

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540

want to see you in action as well check
this<00:01:08.820> spot<00:01:09.090> later<00:01:09.330> today<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.350> will<00:01:11.130> upload

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
this spot later today so I will upload

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.080 
this spot later today so I will upload
some<00:01:11.580> footage<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.740> later<00:01:13.740> today<00:01:13.979> or<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
some footage like later today or in the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.770 
some footage like later today or in the
tomorrow<00:01:15.930> probably<00:01:16.740> later<00:01:17.040> today<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:18.240> yeah

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
tomorrow probably later today but yeah

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.100 
tomorrow probably later today but yeah
and<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.909> will<00:01:21.090> change<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.810> higher

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and I think this will change the higher

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.469 
and I think this will change the higher
leagues<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.729> Champions<00:01:24.180> League<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
leagues like in a Champions League the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.330 
leagues like in a Champions League the
high<00:01:24.600> level<00:01:24.869> gameplay<00:01:25.229> because<00:01:25.830> they<00:01:26.189> will

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
high level gameplay because they will

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.969 
high level gameplay because they will
definitely<00:01:26.670> try<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.330> out<00:01:27.570> because<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.380> like

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
definitely try it out because it's like

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.510 
definitely try it out because it's like
she<00:01:29.570> is<00:01:30.570> I'm<00:01:30.900> not<00:01:31.079> not<00:01:31.409> sure<00:01:31.680> how<00:01:32.009> much<00:01:32.280> better

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520

she's<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.450> she's<00:01:33.720> definitely<00:01:34.170> better<00:01:34.470> so

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
she's now but she's definitely better so

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.770 
she's now but she's definitely better so
