gonna want to come to its Wembley again
and<00:01:45.840> beat<00:01:46.380> us<00:01:47.509> what<00:01:48.509> good<00:01:48.720> players<00:01:48.840> but

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
and beat us what good players but

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.350 
and beat us what good players but
certain<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> back<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.549> our<00:01:50.610> minds<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.210> if

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
certain the back of our minds we know if

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.780 
certain the back of our minds we know if
we<00:01:51.509> get<00:01:51.630> good<00:01:51.840> result<00:01:52.140> here<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.579> we're<00:01:53.579> near

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
we get good result here then we're near

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.090 
we get good result here then we're near
enough<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.899> think<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.680> will<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.799> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
enough there so I think it will be a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.020 
enough there so I think it will be a
great<00:01:56.460> incentive<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> plays<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:59.030> it's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
great incentive for the plays and it's

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.370 
great incentive for the plays and it's
going<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> tough<00:02:00.630> job<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:00.960> we're

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
going to be a tough job but we're

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.569 
going to be a tough job but we're
confident<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> players<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.399> we've

confident with the players that we've

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.789 
confident with the players that we've
got<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:03.030> don't<00:02:03.180> see<00:02:03.329> why<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.689> can't<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:04.590> can't
