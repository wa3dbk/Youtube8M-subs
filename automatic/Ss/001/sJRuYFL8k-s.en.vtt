mil<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.000> my<00:00:21.150> theory<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:21.720> I'll<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.350> I'll

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
mil for my theory what I'll do is I'll

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.370 
mil for my theory what I'll do is I'll
be<00:00:22.920> saying<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.400> if<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.300> give<00:00:24.449> me<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.779> mil<00:00:25.080> um

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
be saying out if you give me one mil um

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.529 
be saying out if you give me one mil um
then<00:00:25.949> i'll<00:00:26.070> give<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> theory<00:00:26.789> i<00:00:26.880> actually

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
then i'll give you the theory i actually

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.870 
then i'll give you the theory i actually
am<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.349> give<00:00:28.529> them<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.859> me<00:00:29.039> give<00:00:29.730> them

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
am going to give them to me give them

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.279 
am going to give them to me give them
the<00:00:29.910> theory<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:30.420> they<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.660> give<00:00:30.960> me<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> one

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
the theory if they do give me the one

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.659 
the theory if they do give me the one
mil<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.160> will<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:32.399> really<00:00:32.579> interesting

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
mil so this will be really interesting

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.030 
mil so this will be really interesting
to<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.510> basically<00:00:33.989> who<00:00:34.200> trusts<00:00:34.620> me<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.950> who

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to see basically who trusts me and who

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
to see basically who trusts me and who
doesn't<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:35.910> i<00:00:35.940> don't<00:00:36.059> know<00:00:36.270> any<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.600> these

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
doesn't now i don't know any of these

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.229 
doesn't now i don't know any of these
people<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:38.520> were<00:00:38.670> them<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.030> wouldn't

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
people so if I were them I wouldn't

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.810 
people so if I were them I wouldn't
trust<00:00:39.540> me<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.230> we'll<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.739> goes<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.160> so
