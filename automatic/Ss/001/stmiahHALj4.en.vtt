00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.640
 Very respectful person very affectionate very 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.960

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.860

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.980
 I'm sorry 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.490
 I had a traumatic childhood I have a moon 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.930
 in the aquarium I say it and that's what they've 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.290
 request that of the testimony I remember 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.669
 and is that this figure that has been my 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.460
 mother 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.890
 has tried to do it or I do not know I think neither 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.469
 he tried because he never held his role 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.359

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:47.640
 isolated because I also now have 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.320
 assumed as that moon I agreed with those 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.329
 cuts with my memory because I really 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.059
 towards cancer would make us cry 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.399
 every time every thing that I remember and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.670
