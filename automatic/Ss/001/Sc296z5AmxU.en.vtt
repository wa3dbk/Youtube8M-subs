00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
really really easily they come off the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.760 
really really easily they come off the
sheet<00:02:05.790> very<00:02:06.420> easily<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:07.049> notice<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.530> some

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
sheet very easily you notice in some

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.130 
sheet very easily you notice in some
stickers<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:09.270> try<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> take<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> sticker<00:02:10.050> off

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
stickers you try to take the sticker off

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.780 
stickers you try to take the sticker off
and<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.500> takes<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> paper<00:02:11.099> underneath<00:02:11.459> with

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and it takes the paper underneath with

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.490 
and it takes the paper underneath with
it<00:02:12.000> because<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.450> adhesive<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.080> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
it because the adhesive is so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.020 
it because the adhesive is so
a strong<00:02:13.830> well<00:02:14.070> these<00:02:14.220> don't<00:02:14.490> do<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.850> like

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
a strong well these don't do that like

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.510

they're not too thin either which just

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.350 
they're not too thin either which just
makes<00:02:38.130> them<00:02:38.310> really<00:02:38.490> really<00:02:38.580> durable<00:02:39.060> and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
makes them really really durable and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.300 
makes them really really durable and
easy<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.780> put<00:02:40.020> on<00:02:40.050> which<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.500> really<00:02:40.650> like<00:02:40.890> very
