00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.090
 but before opting woman is so so 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.150
 here is the video the video that will us 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.600
 rejoice the video of the gti this titan 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.060
 blacks 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.769
 in addition it is the version 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.840
 specific to gilles yabi so 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.360
 delivered with a cooling that one 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.040
 can change 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.540
 as you can see here we have 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.520
 all removed to some cooling 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.219
 reference and there we have the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.629
 cooling windforce minutes force 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.039
 600 watts 2 gigabits with on the top 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.850
 all a force that goes logically 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.510
 Illuminate three fans of 80 mm 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.800
 to cool the map a huge 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.690
 cooling we see the copper part 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.320
 the heat pipes the fins it's really 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.570
 very impressive at the bundle level 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:11.310
 we also have in a small box 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:16.740
 dider cab then there a cable hdmi a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.740
 power cable 8 pin a cable 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.250
 feeding bike adapter dvi 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.570
 towards vga is also you see it at 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.450
 background another plan did your little mouse 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.640
 we're going for a tour of the famous 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.270
 I was an exciting blacks so so the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.110
 titan and on black background we see that the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.180
 radiator was tinted in black as one 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.340
 can notice the level of the map 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.659
 these two cooling systems that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.320
 is pretty classic now at 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.079
 nvidia for the map rather at the office of 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.490
 range we see the name of the brand that has 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.299
 been stuck there the geforce gtx r it's 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.860
 clear obviously the year card 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.259
 thus requires pine to pine for 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.750
 operate we find a black pcb 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.829
 behind it is rather pretty 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.170
 the whole is very clean we are 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.409
 always been very very fan of this 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.269
 nvidia signed cooling 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.489
 at the level of the exits we find two 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:21.299
 outputs dvi output hdmi output 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.569
 display port wanted to take a tour of the 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.569
 map 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.690
 now we will dwell on the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.640
 characteristics then this gt which 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.370
 quoting black obviously embarks with at 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.299
 110 in 28 nanometers 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.489
 the map offers 48 rohff 240 tenuous so 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.489
 at the level of the characteristics it is 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.980
 pretty close to some gtx 790 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.860
 especially that we also find from 1888 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.260
 okay the big difference is done 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.480
 on the amount of memory this titan 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.260
 blacks in boat simply if 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.329
 gigabyte of gddr5 interfaced in 384 bits 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.670
 it's impressive at the 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.849
 frequency we put an oc version of 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.480
 at j lives so we have 1000 6 billion 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:19.019
 on the gpu and the boost 2.0 a goes up to 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.709
 1111 billion the memory is at 1750 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.230
 billion 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.060
 of course we tested the map and we 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.170
 book a 13-2 very quickly we will even you 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.760
 make a montage video or a force 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.599
 600 boxes live it may be 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.599
 pretty funny there
