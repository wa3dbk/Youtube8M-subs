this video I'm going to be showing you

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.589 
this video I'm going to be showing you
my<00:00:12.269> latest<00:00:12.509> project<00:00:12.840> spark<00:00:13.380> project<00:00:14.450> it's<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
my latest project spark project it's a

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.570 
my latest project spark project it's a
car<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> I've<00:00:18.779> been<00:00:19.020> working<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.160> for

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
car so I've been working on this for

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.929 
car so I've been working on this for
about<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.210> day<00:00:21.449> about<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.320> day<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.430> think<00:00:26.430> I

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
about a day about a day and I think I

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.609 
about a day about a day and I think I
think<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.539> turned<00:00:27.750> out<00:00:27.869> really<00:00:28.230> really<00:00:28.380> well

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
think it turned out really really well

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.700 
think it turned out really really well
this<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.130> only<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.640> first<00:00:29.849> part<00:00:30.349> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
this is only the first part this is the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.569 
this is only the first part this is the
first<00:00:31.920> step

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
first step

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.080 
first step
the<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.180> frame<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:34.620> next<00:00:35.040> step<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.940> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the the frame the next step is going to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.130 
the the frame the next step is going to
be<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:37.440> body<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.190> making<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.329> solid<00:00:39.899> right<00:00:40.110> now

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
be the body so making it solid right now

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.260 
be the body so making it solid right now
it's<00:00:40.469> not<00:00:40.590> solid<00:00:40.950> I'm<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.670> making<00:00:42.149> it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it's not solid I'm going to be making it

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.810 
it's not solid I'm going to be making it
solid<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.809> next<00:00:42.899> step<00:00:48.530> it's<00:00:49.530> very

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
solid for the next step it's very

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.549 
solid for the next step it's very
tedious<00:00:51.110> doing<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.710> tedious<00:00:53.520> work

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
tedious doing this it is tedious work

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:03.830 
tedious doing this it is tedious work
but<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.890> came<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.309> really<00:00:56.460> well

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.970 

so<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.220> whole<00:01:05.670> car<00:01:06.390> aside<00:01:07.170> from<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> wheels

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
so the whole car aside from the wheels

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.700 
so the whole car aside from the wheels
and<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.670> steering<00:01:08.910> wheel<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.420> made<00:01:09.990> from<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
and the steering wheel is made from a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.450 
and the steering wheel is made from a
rope<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.030> strand<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.570> rope<00:01:12.890> part<00:01:13.890> prop

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
rope the the strand of rope part prop

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
rope the the strand of rope part prop
and<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.750> log<00:01:15.990> beam<00:01:16.380> prop<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> whole<00:01:18.570> thing<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and the log beam prop the whole thing is

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.100 
and the log beam prop the whole thing is
made<00:01:20.040> from<00:01:20.280> those<00:01:20.520> two<00:01:20.790> props<00:01:21.090> glued<00:01:21.900> together

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
made from those two props glued together

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.890 
made from those two props glued together
and<00:01:22.530> rotate<00:01:22.980> it<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:23.430> oh<00:01:23.930> my<00:01:24.930> goodness<00:01:26.900> it's

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and rotate it and oh my goodness it's

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.050 
and rotate it and oh my goodness it's
crazy<00:01:29.330> so<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.840> doors<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.710> doors<00:01:31.920> oh<00:01:32.250> actually

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.390 
work
they<00:01:35.400> snap<00:01:35.790> shut<00:01:36.210> quite<00:01:37.080> easily<00:01:37.260> I<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.160> think

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
they snap shut quite easily I I think

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.750 
they snap shut quite easily I I think
that<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.910> think<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:39.330> came<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:40.020> well<00:01:40.760> pretty

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
that I think they came out well pretty

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.469 
that I think they came out well pretty
well<00:01:44.630> yeah<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.840> mean<00:01:45.900> that's<00:01:46.650> basically<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.580> in

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
well yeah I mean that's basically it in

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.690 
well yeah I mean that's basically it in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
my next there's going to be two more

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.170 
my next there's going to be two more

videos in this series the next one is

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.120 
videos in this series the next one is
going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.080> be<00:01:56.570> giving<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.660> a<00:01:57.810> body<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.410> then

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
going to be giving it a body and then

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.740 
going to be giving it a body and then
the<00:01:59.310> next<00:01:59.820> one<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:01.490> coding<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.580> I'm<00:02:02.910> gonna<00:02:03.630> make

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the next one is coding it I'm gonna make

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.650 
the next one is coding it I'm gonna make
it<00:02:03.960> drivable<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.060> wheels<00:02:06.270> turn

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
it drivable and the like the wheels turn

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.330 
it drivable and the like the wheels turn
when<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.290> turn<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.869> car<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
when you turn this is the car the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.260 
when you turn this is the car the
real-life<00:02:11.640> car<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.360> based<00:02:13.310> my<00:02:14.310> project<00:02:14.850> off<00:02:15.030> of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
real-life car I based my project off of

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.930 
real-life car I based my project off of
I<00:02:15.510> had<00:02:16.230> these<00:02:16.440> four<00:02:16.860> pictures<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.550> work<00:02:17.700> off<00:02:17.910> of

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
I had these four pictures to work off of

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.140 
I had these four pictures to work off of
and<00:02:19.190> not<00:02:20.190> much<00:02:20.900> not<00:02:21.900> much<00:02:21.960> but<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:23.670> turned<00:02:23.970> out

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
and not much not much but it turned out

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.180 
and not much not much but it turned out
really<00:02:24.420> well

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
really well

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.100 
really well
a<00:02:26.280> lot<00:02:26.970> better<00:02:27.150> than<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.450> thought<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.750> would<00:02:27.960> to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
a lot better than I thought it would to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.610 
a lot better than I thought it would to
be<00:02:28.230> completely<00:02:28.560> honest<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.190> really<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.750> really

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
be completely honest I really I really

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.430 
be completely honest I really I really
didn't<00:02:31.920> know<00:02:32.040> how<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.340> would<00:02:32.430> turn<00:02:32.460> out<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:33.440> it

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
didn't know how it would turn out but it

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.990 
didn't know how it would turn out but it
turned<00:02:34.740> out<00:02:34.920> really<00:02:34.980> well<00:02:37.250> yeah<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.850> next

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
turned out really well yeah but the next

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.500 
turned out really well yeah but the next
step<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:40.550> really<00:02:41.550> even<00:02:42.210> more

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
step is going to be really even more

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.810 
step is going to be really even more
tedious<00:02:45.410> I'm<00:02:46.410> gonna<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.250> cover<00:02:47.550> the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
tedious I'm gonna have to cover the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.370 
tedious I'm gonna have to cover the
whole<00:02:48.120> thing<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:49.040> cubes<00:02:51.170> because<00:02:52.170> that's

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
whole thing in cubes because that's

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.410 
whole thing in cubes because that's
that's<00:02:52.680> really<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.280> only<00:02:53.460> thing<00:02:53.850> that

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
that's really like the only thing that

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.390 
that's really like the only thing that
that<00:02:54.960> I'm<00:02:55.110> able<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.410> use<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.980> would<00:02:56.190> look

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
that I'm able to use that would look
