the 13 we can we can to become unlucky
to<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.100> masses<00:02:44.490> because<00:02:44.930> everyone<00:02:45.930> was<00:02:46.170> just

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
to the masses because everyone was just

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.460 
to the masses because everyone was just
starting<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:46.980> fear<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.490> number<00:02:48.350> that's<00:02:49.350> not

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
starting to fear that number that's not

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.590 
starting to fear that number that's not
the<00:02:49.770> only<00:02:49.950> reason<00:02:50.130> there<00:02:50.700> are<00:02:50.820> other<00:02:51.090> reasons

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
the only reason there are other reasons

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.640 
the only reason there are other reasons
why<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.750> number<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.140> considered<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.620> be

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
why the number is considered to be

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.560 
why the number is considered to be
unlucky<00:02:53.720> in<00:02:54.720> numerology<00:02:55.460> for<00:02:56.460> example<00:02:56.880> 12<00:02:57.330> is

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
unlucky in numerology for example 12 is

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.660 
unlucky in numerology for example 12 is
considered<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.140> be<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.470> good<00:02:59.040> number<00:02:59.250> it's

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
considered to be a good number it's

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.750 
considered to be a good number it's
considered<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.300> perfect<00:03:00.840> number<00:03:01.760> 12

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
considered to be a perfect number 12

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.290 
considered to be a perfect number 12
plus<00:03:03.030> 1<00:03:03.300> equals<00:03:03.780> 13<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.530> 13<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.700> number<00:03:06.060> that

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
plus 1 equals 13 and 13 is a number that

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.760 
plus 1 equals 13 and 13 is a number that
is<00:03:06.680> just<00:03:07.820> one<00:03:08.820> more<00:03:09.570> than<00:03:09.900> perfect

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
is just one more than perfect

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.980 
is just one more than perfect
it's<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.610> means<00:03:11.940> transgression<00:03:12.840> it

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
it's just it means transgression it

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.900 
it's just it means transgression it
means<00:03:14.060> going<00:03:15.060> too<00:03:15.330> far<00:03:16.040> which<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.070> why<00:03:17.460> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
means going too far which is why the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.510 
means going too far which is why the
number<00:03:18.090> 13<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:19.020> considered<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.710> be<00:03:19.800> unlucky<00:03:20.010> in

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
number 13 is considered to be unlucky in

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.610 
number 13 is considered to be unlucky in
numerology<00:03:22.820> if<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.030> have<00:03:24.210> a<00:03:24.240> number<00:03:25.110> 13<00:03:25.500> in
