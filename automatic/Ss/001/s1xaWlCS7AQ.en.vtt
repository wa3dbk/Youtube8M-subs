Groom: Please Inspector, the wedding is in 2 hours. You must find the ring.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Inspector (thinking): HMMM, DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF HIM...

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.500
Inspector (thinking): AND WHO IS THE WOMAN IN WHITE AND WHY IS SHE CRYING?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.500

Bride: So how will you find my wedding ring?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.000
Inspector (thinking): AS I THOUGHT: ASKING DIFFICULT QUESTIONS ALREADY. PERHAPS HER MOTHER WILL BE NICER.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:32.500
M.O.B: I am that person Inspector. I am the mother of the bride. Can I help you?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Inspector (thinking): AT LAST, THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE. ALWAYS START WITH THE BOSS.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Inspector: Do you know where the ring is?

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.000
M.O.B: Oh, Inspector, don't waste time with me, you should talk to the groom.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.500
M.O.B: He owes the best man £5000.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.000
Inspector (thinking): HMMM THE WOMAN IS CLEARLY MAD...

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Inspector (thinking): BUT CAN IT BE A COINCIDENCE THAT THE GROOM OWES £5000 AND THE MISSING RING IS WORTH EXACTLY £5000??!!

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Inspector (thinking): TIME TO SPEAK TO THE GROOM....

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.000
Inspector: Hey groom, come here!

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.500
Groom: What's the matter Inspector?

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.500
Inspector (thinking): WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.500
Inspector (thinking): DON'T GET COY WITH ME.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.000
Inspector: Don't you think it seems like a strange time to get married, when you have a £5000 debt?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.500
Groom: I don't know what you are talking about.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.000
Groom: Listen Inspector, you must find the ring: I have to get married today.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.000
Groom: You should speak to the bridesmaid.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Groom: She is in love with me. I think she took the ring to stop the wedding.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Inspector (thinking): SO, THE BRIDESMAID WANTS TO MARRY THE GROOM. WELL, THAT'S CONFUSING!

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.000
Inspector: Maybe I will speak to the bridesmaid, but you haven't....

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Bride: Inspector! Inspector! There's something I have to tell you... in private.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.000
Inspector (thinking): OH NO NOT THE BRIDE AGAIN. CALM DOWN DEAR

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.000
Inspector: Come with me and tell me what you have to tell me.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Bride: My mother's never liked the groom - she doesn't think he is good enough for me. She is always .... (fading out)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Inspector (thinking): HMM, MY MOTHER-IN-LAW WAS JUST THE SAME... SHE DOESN'T THINK THE GROOM IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE DAUGHTER...

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Bride: ...my mother wants me to marry the best man but he is a bad man! You should ask him about his racing horse

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:09.000
Inspector (thinking): HMM, WELL I HAVEN'T LEARNT MUCH SO FAR... EXCEPT SOME VERY USEFUL NEW ENGLISH WORDS.
