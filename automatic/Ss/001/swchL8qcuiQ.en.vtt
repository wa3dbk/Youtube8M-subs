00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.089
 hi beauties in this tutorial les 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.870
 He taught how to create an easy bedia look 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.870
 and pretty 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.990
 Start by mixing mi6 and cream and first 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.820
 and applying it all over my face I'm going to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.480
 create a luminosity and a skin 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.480
 perfect 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.920
 I continue with my covergirl makeup 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.720
 applying it from the center of the face 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.940
 out with a hair brush 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.980
 synthetic this makes it improve the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.790
 application and it's easier to be able 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.790
 blur it 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.309
 once the base dries a little I come back 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.320
 to replicate in areas that I feel that still 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.969
 lack of coverage but now with my 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.449
 fingers to not sweep the product that already 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.449
 I put 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.290
 I continue with correction to illuminate 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.790
 the high areas of the face and blurs 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.440
 with fingers is the best tool 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.440
 for creamy products 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.680
 it's called correction and base with dust 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.680
 translucent 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.160
 and went on to create color to my face with 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.160
 This browser s 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.260
 very well now I give color to my 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.239
 cheeks with a blush in medium pink and 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.330
 He ended with the illuminator finish 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.620
 shining in the high areas this creates a 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.620
 beautiful luminous skin effect 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.110
 very well now he applied gel on my eyebrows 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.110
 as tests as well as on the eyelids 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.940
 and I'm going to take the neutral palette of 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.770
 citi color with the most coffee tone 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.770
 I'm going to create the basin 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.300
 I take the color more clarito to illuminate 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.300
 the lacrimal 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.060
 and with that golden tone, iridescent to coral 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.060
 I apply it by the mobile eyelid 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.220
 to emphasize the external zone I apply 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.940
 this bronze coffee color and I mix it 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.940
 with the rest 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.890
 I finish with the light of the bone of 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.890
 eyebrows with a shade in vanilla mate 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:53.159
 and to give more focus to the look 

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:54.959
 applied a brown eyeliner inside the 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.649
 water line and left the top 

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:57.649
 without delineating 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.670
 sad eyelash and applied two layers of 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.670
 mascara 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.699

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.830

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.689
