00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.770
 Today I show you what I mean 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.000
 tomato plants from geisa we are 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.500
 us on my balcony garden and i have 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 since tomato plants in the pot 1 set 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.840
 Then let's have a look at tomato spirits 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.340
 Man so not too many 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.250
 side shoots and the tomatoes 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.710
 be pretty big yourself because otherwise 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.469
 they do not form too much small ones then 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.910
 right after mature 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:40.829
 That's why you should do this about once a week 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.469
 week tomato the tomato from stingy and 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.879
 I'll show you how to do it 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.890
 I already have quite a few here 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.320
 I have not done anything because 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.320
 I wanted to show you the video 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.339
 because I wanted you all in the video 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.339
 demonstrate 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.839
 now look here 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.420
 we already have such a small one here 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.750
 We simply removed the pages 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.060
 with a kink and best you mind 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.630
 the tomato in the morning so that the little ones 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:18.460
 Sores set to dry quickly 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.850
 so that there is no fungus there 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.990
 can 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.390
 We have some down here as well 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.830
 side shoots, for example, are the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.240
 already pretty big, of course, is better 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:34.240
 if you have it removed before 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.060
 can also be a very stable 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.830
 develop main strain 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.720
 I've been here this is also so 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.720
 a typical page occurs 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.700
 if we leave too 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.700
 Here you can see nice again 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.560
 st 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.400
 camera up here above we have the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.400
 Nice capital 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.730
 he runs after 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.040
 I would recommend it at the bottom 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:13.070
 the gears just open 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.740
 and possibly the lowest because 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.920
 if earth comes to the plant or on 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.820
 the leaves then it is also 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.900
 more susceptible to various diseases 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.370
 then I could actually too 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.550
 finally click on it should also 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.550
 then 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.920
 You can see a whole look here as well 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.500
 first flowers and yes 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.090
 and I'll be sure of you in a few 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.750
 weeks show how the plant 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.750
 has developed 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.040
 until then your christian von
