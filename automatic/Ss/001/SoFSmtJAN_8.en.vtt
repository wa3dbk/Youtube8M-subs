yeah<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.560> mean<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:34.920> think<00:03:34.980> today<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.430> was<00:03:35.670> really

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
yeah I mean I think today I was really

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.140 
yeah I mean I think today I was really
lucky<00:03:36.540> also<00:03:36.810> lack<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.189> first<00:03:38.459> Iraq<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:38.909> was

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
lucky also lack in the first Iraq I was

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.559 
lucky also lack in the first Iraq I was
losing<00:03:39.480> three<00:03:39.720> zero<00:03:40.049> five<00:03:40.379> two<00:03:40.439> and<00:03:41.299> I<00:03:42.299> think

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
losing three zero five two and I think

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.460 
losing three zero five two and I think
if<00:03:42.689> I<00:03:42.840> lose<00:03:43.049> this<00:03:43.650> sectional<00:03:45.109> it<00:03:46.109> would<00:03:46.319> have

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
if I lose this sectional it would have

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.099 
if I lose this sectional it would have
been<00:03:46.790> even<00:03:47.790> tougher<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.599> I<00:03:48.659> gather<00:03:48.870> we<00:03:49.049> were

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
been even tougher so I gather we were

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.839 
been even tougher so I gather we were
lucky<00:03:49.319> there<00:03:49.650> then<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:49.950> won<00:03:50.099> the<00:03:50.220> second<00:03:50.639> and

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849
