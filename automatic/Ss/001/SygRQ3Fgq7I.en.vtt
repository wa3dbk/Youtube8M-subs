00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.990
 I'm going to show you how to sew an automatic is 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.990
 a simple and practical arrangement 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.210
 There are several sizes and there are 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.510
 different shades transparent black and 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.510
 nickel 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.180
 in automatic it serves to close or join 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.300
 two fabrics so that they are not fixed 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.920
 doing the function of button and buttonhole but 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.489
 with the difference that the automatic 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.489
 you do not see 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.900
 Now I'm going to show you how to sew for 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.760
 example in an American lady since 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.950
 sometimes by the chest area it 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.350
 open us I'll sew it with a 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.570
 automatic large and with a thread of another 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.270
 color so that it stands out on the garment and 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.840
 you can see it well the automatic has 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.840
 the parts 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.650
 the thickest part is the one that goes in the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.930
 area where the buttons go and goes 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.310
 always centered this is very big 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.160
 had to put one more chiquitito 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.500
 so that it does not look and the other part that 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.300
 this idea is finer because it is in the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.120
 area where the eyelets go by the 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.100
 inside 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.100
 let's start sewing that side 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.090
 if you realize the automatic has 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.060
 several holes around then there are 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.380
 Two ways to sew or pass stitches 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.159
 Between hole and hole 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.130
 the stitches around or sewing on 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.490
 the fabric small stitches I'm going to 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.799
 put like this 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.380
 where once we have centered the 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.520
 automatic 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.880
 we started sewing 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.289
 he takes a piece of cloth and turns to 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.289
 put in the same place 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.100
 will be two or three stitches to go to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.900
 next hole can pass 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.530
 directly by the part of by the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.620
 top part 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.840
 what we do is go through the part of 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.680
 down the fabric and look for the hole 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.680
 following 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.690
 we squeeze a little bit and do the same 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.690
 with the next two or three stitches 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.040
 to the third and we go through again 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.040
 in the next hole 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.180
 but all this I am doing 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.940
 now with a white thread so that 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.620
 we see it but it can be done 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.910
 with the tone of the garment that you go to 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.810
 sew and it is quite pretty subject and 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.810
 they are not respected 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.870
 to finish we passed the needle for the 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.770
 reverse and we finish by the part of the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.430
 center 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.380
 and this is now pretty because it 's from 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.880
 a color that is not the tone of the fabric if 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.370
 out of a similar color they are not 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.920
 notary 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.100
 we see some stitches to finish 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.840
 all right 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.720
 what I have not commented also is that I have 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.250
 put the double thread if we leave it 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.750
 simple we would have to give some 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.750
 last more dried to each hole 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.780
 she would be sewed 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.740
 the next part to place it in the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.960
 Exact site what you can do is 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.960
 button the buttons around 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.190
 and with the needle 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:04.070
 is in this part more or less in the 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.890
 little hole with your finger always always 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.030
 they play well then it's pretty much in the 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.120
 area you see and you will be 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.530
 centered once you have the measure 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.769
 here 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.510
 you take that as a reference with the needle 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.780
 but you must not start with the part of 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.690
 outside that you would see the knot of the thread 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:29.110
 then take it out and get a little trick 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.980
 only that it's going to be the center for 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.980
 put the other part 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.409
 to see this goes now for the part of 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.289
 inside 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.839
 when putting the other part it does not matter that the 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.029
 flax to be seen the other way around but in 

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:49.179
 this is so because it would be the right of the 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:51.380
 jacket then as you see this part 

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:54.050
 has two fabrics 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.940
 It will separate fabric hood 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.500
 inside and the one outside then only 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.200
 the automatic only has to 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.390
 stitched by this part if it were a 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.310
 shirt or any other garment only 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.430
 we have to take beige if I give a 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.620
 stitch here 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.240
 would not look on this side but if I give it 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.060
 strong 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.620
 taking the two fabrics we see 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.320
 then you just have to take the cloth 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.900
 inside 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:24.470
 and we do the same place centered 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.120
 and we started to sew holes but 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.120
 only taking a cloth 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.750
 and this is going to stay fixed only 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.780
 on that web and on the part of by the 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.760
 part of the outside is not going to see anything 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.290
 then you have to do the same as the 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.290
 another sewing 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.820
 choosing only this fabric and 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.820
 we look for the other hole 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.849
 how this moves a lot we have to 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.780
 catch well with both fingers 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:11.430
 so that we are centered 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.430
 and we continue to know the holes 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.350
 to finish on the other side we have 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.660
 past the needle on the back for 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:24.040
 finish well in this case only 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:28.610
 we would have to take the fabric from inside 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:32.080
 we are a few stitches to finish it off 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.080
 on this side we would not be seen 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.639
 and I would also be with 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.629
 Let's see 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.629
 so you can see 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.500
 this as I said now you see a lot 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.780
 because we have made it very big and with 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.940
 a look that stands out very much if we had 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.500
 what to put you also have to tell 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.330
 that I have set for you as an example in 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.790
 a jacket that usually 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.050
 jackets are open then if the 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.030
 we are open 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.400
 especially this bracket would see us 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.100
 then this is usually done in 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.410
 shirts or in areas where you do not wear 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.800
 open the garment so it does not look 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:21.550
 but you see this is the way to put it 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:24.490
 now with the pressure 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:27.600
 it stays we are fixed the part 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.600
 we want to not be opened 

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:35.750
 this would be inside 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:38.500
 and if we want to open it to remove it 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.500
 it would be like that
