00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.939
 really nick lighten their pleasure of 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.669
 find you today for a 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.230
 any new video is a tutorial and the 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.259
 presentation of the four venom x 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.400
 available on the mac is not dlc 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.690
 devastation of call of duty kid so 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.850
 first of all I will explain 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.730
 how do these venomous x work so 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.199
 to pull the facts from this vein 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.940
 man you just have to press the 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.110
 default key on your controller 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.790
 and to trigger the explosion or 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.780
 the effect of the venom it will be necessary to support 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.220
 on the default key so aim on 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.739
 will start first with the venom 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.629
 craft so then to build 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.299
 besides any venom you 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.489
 must have already passed the spawn then passed 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.049
 the moment when there is the tentacle of 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.610
 kraken once this is done you will have a 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.890
 door to destroy and then again a 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.360
 other door so the one you see at 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.610
 the screen to get the city ​​map 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.000
 to mix then to take the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.280
 first two pieces beyond the venom x 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.770
 it will simply have to be searched 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.570
 little crazy things that are 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.730
 kinds of red toolboxes like 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.470
 you see on the screen so first you 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.060
 will need the nucleic battery 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.400
 and then the genomics loader 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.020
 disabled and then that's where we 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.570
 let's take a look at it seems to me that 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.590
 it's a small can of the number of bowl 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.460
 are I believe something like that 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.440
 I do not know how that's 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.080
 is called so you have four 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.850
 types if you find a yom symbol 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:49.090
 with no color written next to 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.049
 pick up the bottle of fine yonne 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.030
 when you can simply 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.039
 pick up the piece this will be the venom x 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.450
 homemade so the one that throws venom 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.789
 of scorpion as you observe at 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.350
 the screen so then you just have in 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.850
 swing once you trigger 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.429
 the explosion will be made of scorpion venom 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.479
 and will have the same effect to aliens as 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.459
 it does you when you're in full 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.929
 in the native of arles venom of scorpion 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.099
 this kick ass is really the balls 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.819
 it's extremely expensive love and 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.840
 clothes in there 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.610
 then we'll go to the pink venom so 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.590
 so lifted no more also the bottle of 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.390
 beaulieu pink men and the effect of 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.340
 this one it's just that it's done 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.950
 the effect of the new aliens that were 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.140
 included in europe in may day so 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.400
 it's shaped like I call it 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.709
 plants vs. zombies so it's plants 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.790
 who are going who are shooting at the aliens this 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.620
 times as they are allied with voodoo 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.549
 I do not find too useful what they 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.720
 not take all the time on 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.370
 aliens of whom for me this vein man 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.379
 is literally cardboard I hate her 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.829
 is that they arrive after I 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.540
 prefer it's the venom x blue so with 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.480
 the bottle of beautiful blue liam then 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.510
 this one is the effect of this vein 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.980
 man will be just a radius 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.269
 electric when you would trigger it 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.450
 so frankly it's a big fat 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.739
 uncle carnage groups and conches them 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.970
 rhinos is really effective you him in 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.769

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.269
 trigger us in rebate years he has you 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.440
 triggered the rio of the earth to the dishes 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.739
 packaged it's weighed it's really 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.410
 excellent 7.7 venom me I loved it and 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.760
 now we will go to the last 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.160
 venom she had named orange and 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.519
 this one this is there frankly 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.349
 it's big mihocko paul big carnage 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.940
 that blue venom so if the bottle 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.510
 orange beaulieu 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.400
 once you have kraft is so the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.319
 venom and so for kraft and I you 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.690
 explain anyway we must do on the 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.849
 default key select and then 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.239
 press the x key for xbox or 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.530
 still soon square for the ps3 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.680

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.019
 what if this vein but the huge 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.350
 some fucking explosion so if 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.450
 you have a stadium in front of Lille 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.580
 swing a ball of venom in there 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.930
 you trigger that makes an explosion and 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.690
 then fire which remain so the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.430
 aliens going on the rays of fire bah 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.640
 served will simply burn and blow 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.020
 it will kill them again for a few 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.610
 seconds in the hard effect 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.500
 and that's about all 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.940
