00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.440 
windows are purpose are tinted
purple<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.790> see<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:20.000> seats<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.300> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
purple and you can see the seats and the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.240 
purple and you can see the seats and the
wheel<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.810> there<00:01:21.960> which<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.980> nice

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
wheel in there which is a really nice

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.920 
wheel in there which is a really nice
touch<00:01:23.550> I<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.300> lot

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
touch I like that a lot

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.470 
touch I like that a lot
one<00:01:25.830> thing<00:01:26.010> I<00:01:26.100> did<00:01:26.250> notice<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
one thing I did notice is that the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.400 
one thing I did notice is that the
wheels<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> back<00:01:28.800> arm<00:01:29.700> farther<00:01:30.630> spec<00:01:31.230> are

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
wheels on the back arm farther spec are

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.260 
wheels on the back arm farther spec are
spaced<00:01:31.740> farther<00:01:32.040> apart<00:01:32.190> than<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.910> wheels<00:01:33.150> in

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
spaced farther apart than the wheels in

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.980 
spaced farther apart than the wheels in
the<00:01:33.330> front<00:01:33.530> now<00:01:34.940> they're<00:01:35.940> not<00:01:36.120> any<00:01:36.390> bigger

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the front now they're not any bigger

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.920 
the front now they're not any bigger
they're<00:01:37.230> just<00:01:37.440> spaced<00:01:37.740> farther<00:01:38.010> apart<00:01:38.160> and

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
they're just spaced farther apart and

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.150 
they're just spaced farther apart and
this<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.170> come<00:01:40.620> into<00:01:40.770> play<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.010> the

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
this will come into play in the

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.590 
this will come into play in the
transformation<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:42.030> you'll<00:01:42.210> see<00:01:43.220> but<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.600> think

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
transformation as you'll see but I think

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.050 
transformation as you'll see but I think
he's<00:01:45.690> a<00:01:45.720> good<00:01:45.900> is<00:01:46.380> great<00:01:47.040> showpiece<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:47.730> mine

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
he's a good is great showpiece now mine

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.180 
he's a good is great showpiece now mine
does<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.660> an<00:01:48.780> error<00:01:49.080> or<00:01:49.410> an<00:01:49.620> production

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
does have an error or an production

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.690 
does have an error or an production
problem<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:52.310> don't<00:01:53.310> know<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.520> you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
problem right here I don't know if you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.190 
problem right here I don't know if you
could<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:54.150> it<00:01:55.070> but<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:57.060> got<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> pretty<00:01:57.960> good

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
could see it but it's got a pretty good

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.650 
could see it but it's got a pretty good
chunk<00:01:58.560> taken<00:01:58.920> out<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.460> probably<00:01:59.970> from<00:02:00.270> just

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
chunk taken out of it probably from just

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.980 
chunk taken out of it probably from just
an<00:02:01.200> error<00:02:01.470> with<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> machine<00:02:02.190> casting<00:02:02.990> but

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
an error with the machine casting but

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.560 
an error with the machine casting but
let's<00:02:04.260> go<00:02:04.410> ahead<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.650> transform<00:02:05.010> him<00:02:05.570> start

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
let's go ahead and transform him start

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.300 
let's go ahead and transform him start
off<00:02:06.720> we<00:02:06.900> have<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.110> split<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> legs<00:02:07.680> apart<00:02:07.860> or

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
off we have to split the legs apart or

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.490 
off we have to split the legs apart or
split<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> back<00:02:08.969> apart<00:02:09.329> a<00:02:09.479> little<00:02:09.629> bit<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
split the back apart a little bit to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.130 
split the back apart a little bit to
allow<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:11.159> top<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.670> flip<00:02:11.909> up

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
allow the top to flip up

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.200 
allow the top to flip up
you<00:02:14.140> know<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.680> actually<00:02:15.030> starting<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
you know this is actually starting the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.030 
you know this is actually starting the
transformation<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.020> what's<00:02:17.319> called<00:02:17.530> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
transformation this is what's called the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.720 
transformation this is what's called the
attack<00:02:18.580> mode

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
attack mode

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.460 
attack mode
whatever<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.090> think<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.750> attack<00:02:23.020> mode<00:02:23.290> is

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
whatever I think the attack mode is

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.420 
whatever I think the attack mode is
really<00:02:24.310> stupid<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:25.540> we<00:02:26.319> pop<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.770> gun<00:02:26.950> off<00:02:27.130> now

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
really stupid but we pop the gun off now

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.150 
really stupid but we pop the gun off now
begun<00:02:27.880> has<00:02:29.580> little<00:02:31.110> pieces<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.380> plastic<00:02:32.830> here

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.550 
begun has little pieces of plastic here
that<00:02:33.430> actually<00:02:33.910> fit<00:02:34.240> into<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:34.840> hole<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.110> it

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
that actually fit into this hole so it

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.240 
that actually fit into this hole so it
doesn't<00:02:35.830> wiggle<00:02:36.100> around<00:02:36.220> at<00:02:36.640> all<00:02:37.020> but<00:02:38.250> I'm

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
doesn't wiggle around at all but I'm

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.350 
doesn't wiggle around at all but I'm
going<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.520> kind<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:39.940> start<00:02:40.300> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
going to kind of start the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.330 
going to kind of start the
transformation<00:02:41.260> or<00:02:41.380> I'm<00:02:41.860> going<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.130> do<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
transformation or I'm going to do the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.910 
transformation or I'm going to do the
transformation<00:02:42.970> now<00:02:43.319> we're<00:02:44.319> starting<00:02:44.560> by

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
transformation now we're starting by

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.620 
transformation now we're starting by
flipping<00:02:45.370> this<00:02:45.640> up<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.030> then<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.420> turn

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
flipping this up and then I just turn

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.050 
flipping this up and then I just turn
that<00:02:46.660> over<00:02:47.250> or<00:02:48.250> turn<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.730> over<00:02:49.000> because

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
that over or turn that over because

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.540 
that over or turn that over because
that's<00:02:49.330> part<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.690> transformation<00:02:50.550> now

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
that's part of the transformation now

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.979 
that's part of the transformation now
we're<00:02:51.670> going<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.910> flip<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.390> feet<00:02:52.660> out<00:02:57.989> I'm

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
we're going to flip the feet out I'm

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.440 
we're going to flip the feet out I'm
going<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.320> move<00:03:00.190> these<00:03:00.400> tabs<00:03:00.790> out<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.209> move<00:03:01.360> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
going to move these tabs out to move the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.110 
going to move these tabs out to move the
wheels<00:03:01.660> out<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:02.320> will<00:03:02.470> become

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
wheels out and this will become

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.699 
wheels out and this will become
necessary<00:03:04.120> here<00:03:04.720> in<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.870> second<00:03:05.320> as<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.500> just

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
necessary here in a second as I just

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.240 
necessary here in a second as I just
wiggle<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.280> leg<00:03:06.700> out<00:03:07.530> take<00:03:08.530> this<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.950> flip<00:03:09.070> it

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
wiggle the leg out take this and flip it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.360 
wiggle the leg out take this and flip it
down

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.860 

and<00:03:18.370> then<00:03:18.670> we're<00:03:18.849> gonna<00:03:18.970> straighten<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.659> legs

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
and then we're gonna straighten the legs

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.770 
and then we're gonna straighten the legs
out<00:03:21.870> now<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:23.260> just<00:03:23.950> pop<00:03:24.459> these<00:03:24.790> panels<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.540> little

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
out now I just pop these panels a little

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.259 
out now I just pop these panels a little
bit<00:03:26.730> there<00:03:27.730> we<00:03:27.879> go<00:03:28.980> we<00:03:29.980> lift<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.370> hips<00:03:30.549> out<00:03:30.730> we

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
bit there we go we lift the hips out we

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.170 
bit there we go we lift the hips out we
pull<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.599> hips<00:03:31.750> out<00:03:32.370> now<00:03:33.370> for<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.610> top<00:03:33.819> we

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
pull the hips out now for the top we

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.170 
pull the hips out now for the top we
split<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.660> apart<00:03:35.250> I'd<00:03:36.250> like<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.700> turn<00:03:36.879> this

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
split that apart I'd like to turn this

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.110 
split that apart I'd like to turn this
all<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.690> way<00:03:37.780> turn<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.230> hands<00:03:38.470> up<00:03:39.090> let<00:03:40.090> me

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
all the way turn the hands up let me

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.350

pull<00:03:40.420> down<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:42.220> if<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.430> face<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:42.970> we<00:03:43.030> turn<00:03:43.239> it

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
pull down and if the face and we turn it

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.000 
pull down and if the face and we turn it
around<00:03:43.450> flip<00:03:44.379> it<00:03:44.500> up<00:03:44.909> last<00:03:45.909> but<00:03:46.120> not<00:03:46.239> least

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010

complaint with the figure is one this

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.480 
complaint with the figure is one this
back<00:05:14.660> part<00:05:14.960> gets<00:05:15.320> in<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.560> way<00:05:15.710> when<00:05:16.160> you<00:05:16.250> try

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
back part gets in the way when you try

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.219 
back part gets in the way when you try
to<00:05:16.520> move<00:05:16.760> his<00:05:16.910> arms<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.680> two<00:05:20.020> doesn't<00:05:21.020> really

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
to move his arms and two doesn't really

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.430 
to move his arms and two doesn't really
look<00:05:21.410> like<00:05:21.620> he's<00:05:21.770> got<00:05:21.950> elbows<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:23.350> don't<00:05:24.350> know

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
look like he's got elbows I don't know

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.480 
look like he's got elbows I don't know
what<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:24.830> would<00:05:24.950> call<00:05:25.190> that<00:05:25.250> joint<00:05:26.080> but<00:05:27.490> it's

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
what you would call that joint but it's

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.830 
what you would call that joint but it's
just<00:05:28.640> like<00:05:28.820> the<00:05:28.970> rest<00:05:29.120> of<00:05:29.270> his<00:05:29.360> arms<00:05:29.600> just<00:05:29.750> kind

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
just like the rest of his arms just kind

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.680 
just like the rest of his arms just kind
of<00:05:29.990> hanging<00:05:30.500> there<00:05:30.910> this<00:05:31.910> isn't<00:05:32.120> actually<00:05:32.300> my

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
of hanging there this isn't actually my

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.659 
of hanging there this isn't actually my
least<00:05:32.960> favorite<00:05:33.590> figure<00:05:33.890> of<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:34.160> line<00:05:34.370> I

10

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.129 
10
he<00:06:25.319> was<00:06:25.469> $10<00:06:26.129> he<00:06:26.219> was<00:06:26.340> roughly<00:06:26.699> $11<00:06:27.659> for<00:06:27.870> a<00:06:27.960> big

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
he was $10 he was roughly $11 for a big

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.980 
he was $10 he was roughly $11 for a big
bad<00:06:28.289> toy<00:06:28.439> store<00:06:28.740> he<00:06:29.460> is<00:06:29.610> on<00:06:29.849> shelves<00:06:30.360> now<00:06:30.539> for

bad toy store he is on shelves now for

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.800 
bad toy store he is on shelves now for
roughly<00:06:31.860> 1099<00:06:32.699> I<00:06:33.000> think<00:06:33.240> that<00:06:33.360> was<00:06:33.479> the<00:06:33.599> price

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
roughly 1099 I think that was the price

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.409 
roughly 1099 I think that was the price
of<00:06:33.960> Toys<00:06:34.139> R<00:06:34.259> Us<00:06:34.409> that<00:06:34.620> I<00:06:34.680> saw<00:06:34.860> last<00:06:35.150> once<00:06:36.150> again

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
of Toys R Us that I saw last once again

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.540 
of Toys R Us that I saw last once again
I<00:06:36.629> gave<00:06:37.050> him<00:06:37.169> an<00:06:37.289> 8<00:06:37.560> out<00:06:37.800> of<00:06:37.830> 10<00:06:38.099> and<00:06:38.430> that's

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
I gave him an 8 out of 10 and that's

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.119 
I gave him an 8 out of 10 and that's
actually<00:06:38.939> the<00:06:39.389> lowest<00:06:40.110> score<00:06:40.439> of<00:06:40.680> any<00:06:40.860> of<00:06:41.009> the
