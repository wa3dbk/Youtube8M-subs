conversion<00:00:13.280> here<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> oh<00:00:15.230> you<00:00:16.230> know<00:00:17.150> 2003

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
conversion here is a oh you know 2003

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.920 
conversion here is a oh you know 2003
hid<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:21.529> this<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.920> wiring<00:00:23.130> harness<00:00:23.930> for

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
hid and this is the wiring harness for

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.990 
hid and this is the wiring harness for
the<00:00:24.990> OEM<00:00:25.740> hid<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:28.250> this<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.420> leveler

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
the OEM hid and this is for the leveler

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.670 
the OEM hid and this is for the leveler
of<00:00:33.000> course<00:00:33.300> they're<00:00:33.510> cut<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
of course they're cut so you have to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.740 
of course they're cut so you have to
splice<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.460> into<00:00:36.200> your<00:00:37.200> car<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.390> let<00:00:39.390> me<00:00:39.420> show

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
splice it into your car and let me show

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.750 
splice it into your car and let me show
you<00:00:39.809> guys<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:41.690> have<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.960> one<00:00:43.579> pretty<00:00:44.579> much

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
you guys I have this one pretty much

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.430 
you guys I have this one pretty much
done<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:51.170> this<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
done this is what you will have this is

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.660 
done this is what you will have this is
for<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.890> low<00:00:53.070> beam<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:58.100> do<00:00:59.100> those<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.489> two

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
for the low beam and do those are two

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.920 
for the low beam and do those are two
wires<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.210> power<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.800> ground<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.690> didn't<00:01:03.690> want

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
wires of power and ground I didn't want

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.700 
wires of power and ground I didn't want
to<00:01:04.489> cut<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.260> not<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.320> my<00:01:08.030> om<00:01:09.030> harness

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
to cut this and not have my om harness

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.580 
to cut this and not have my om harness
just<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.860> case<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> future<00:01:13.350> I've

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
just in case and in the future I've

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.330 
just in case and in the future I've
decided<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.369> part<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.820> or<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.310> headlight

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.890 

so<00:01:20.340> these<00:01:20.460> are<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> two<00:01:21.000> wires<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:22.220> these<00:01:23.220> two

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
so these are the two wires and these two

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.859 
so these are the two wires and these two
go<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:27.659> white<00:01:27.900> what's<00:01:28.829> green<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
go up to this the white what's green and

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.550 
go up to this the white what's green and
the<00:01:30.869> red<00:01:31.140> was<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> yellow<00:01:33.170> those<00:01:34.170> two<00:01:34.380> are<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the red was a yellow those two are the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.149 
the red was a yellow those two are the
fog<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.610> high<00:01:35.790> beam<00:01:36.619> those<00:01:37.619> are<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.009> high

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
fog or the high beam those are the high

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.830 
fog or the high beam those are the high
beams<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.670> these<00:01:39.329> two<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.500> black<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.009> white

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
beams and these two the black and white

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.090 
beams and these two the black and white
the<00:01:42.840> white<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> red<00:01:44.149> are<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> hid<00:01:46.229> from

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the white and the red are the hid from

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.130 
the white and the red are the hid from
the<00:01:47.280> OEM<00:01:47.579> unit<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:52.220> yeah<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.659> these<00:01:54.659> ones<00:01:54.930> you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the OEM unit and yeah so these ones you

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.160 
the OEM unit and yeah so these ones you
get<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:56.009> splice<00:01:56.340> them<00:01:56.520> into<00:01:56.960> your<00:01:57.960> power

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
get you just splice them into your power

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.090 
get you just splice them into your power
and<00:01:58.439> ground<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:59.219> go<00:01:59.460> to<00:02:01.729> your

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
and ground that go to your

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.840 
and ground that go to your
balus<00:02:05.100> i<00:02:06.890> haven't<00:02:07.890> hooked<00:02:08.039> up<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.490> leveler

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
balus i haven't hooked up the leveler

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.350 
balus i haven't hooked up the leveler
yet<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:10.229> might<00:02:10.979> make<00:02:11.190> another<00:02:11.220> video<00:02:11.819> sometime

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
yet I might make another video sometime

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.030 
yet I might make another video sometime
showing<00:02:13.170> how<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.380> do<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:15.380> note<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
showing how to do that and note that the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.199 
showing how to do that and note that the
leveler<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:18.000> connected<00:02:18.810> at<00:02:19.319> this<00:02:19.530> time

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
leveler is not connected at this time

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.930 
leveler is not connected at this time
I'm<00:02:21.209> not<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.569> do<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:22.190> right<00:02:23.190> now<00:02:23.250> because

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
I'm not going to do it right now because

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.780 
I'm not going to do it right now because
I'm<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.330> make<00:02:24.780> my<00:02:24.989> own<00:02:25.110> harness<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.790> can

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
I'm going to make my own harness I can

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.630 
I'm going to make my own harness I can
power<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.180> from<00:02:27.450> inside<00:02:31.100> it's<00:02:32.100> also<00:02:32.250> really

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
power it from inside it's also really

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.020 
power it from inside it's also really
late<00:02:32.970> at<00:02:33.120> night<00:02:33.150> right<00:02:33.870> now<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.880> it's<00:02:35.880> not

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
late at night right now so it's not

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.580 
late at night right now so it's not
probably<00:02:36.360> not<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.630> best<00:02:36.660> time<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.410> make<00:02:37.440> a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
probably not the best time to make a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.910 
probably not the best time to make a
guide<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.340> if<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.269> put<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:39.600> all<00:02:39.810> back<00:02:40.080> I'm<00:02:40.680> not

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
guide but if I put this all back I'm not

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.580 
guide but if I put this all back I'm not
going<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.160> take<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.459> back<00:02:41.610> apart<00:02:42.260> just<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.470> do

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
going to take you back apart just to do

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.759 
going to take you back apart just to do
a<00:02:43.620> video<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.750> here<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.440> want<00:02:46.650> to

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
a video so here it is I just want to

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.650 
a video so here it is I just want to
show<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.040> guys<00:02:48.320> because<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.890> did<00:02:50.370> look<00:02:50.640> up<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
show you guys because I did look up the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.490 
show you guys because I did look up the
OEM<00:02:52.130> hid<00:02:53.130> conversion<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:54.120> new<00:02:54.810> silica<00:02:55.200> dot-org

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
OEM hid conversion on new silica dot-org

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.080 
OEM hid conversion on new silica dot-org
but<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:57.090> know<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.330> been<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.690> long<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:57.989> the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
but you know it's been so long that the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.750 
but you know it's been so long that the
the<00:03:00.090> original<00:03:00.450> thread<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.900> now<00:03:01.160> broken<00:03:02.160> up<00:03:02.550> and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
the original thread is now broken up and

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.920 
the original thread is now broken up and
I<00:03:03.540> can't<00:03:04.200> really<00:03:04.350> see<00:03:04.650> any<00:03:04.800> guides<00:03:05.580> on<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.900> I

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
I can't really see any guides on it so I

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.420 
I can't really see any guides on it so I
just<00:03:07.200> wanted<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.500> make<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> video<00:03:07.860> guide<00:03:08.220> and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
just wanted to make a video guide and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.500 
just wanted to make a video guide and
show<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.700> guys<00:03:09.590> how<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.620> do<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:14.299> right<00:03:15.299> now<00:03:15.360> I

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
show you guys how to do it right now I

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.920 
show you guys how to do it right now I
just<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:17.030> just<00:03:18.200> tied<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:20.060> wires<00:03:21.060> together<00:03:21.390> and

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
just I just tied the wires together and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.750 
just I just tied the wires together and
just<00:03:22.290> put<00:03:22.530> lucky<00:03:22.709> old<00:03:22.890> tape<00:03:23.130> around<00:03:23.430> them<00:03:23.579> I

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
just put lucky old tape around them I

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.180 
just put lucky old tape around them I
just<00:03:24.239> want<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.450> do<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.630> like<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.170> for<00:03:25.530> now<00:03:25.590> so

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
just want to do it like this for now so

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.199 
just want to do it like this for now so
I<00:03:26.910> could<00:03:26.970> see<00:03:27.329> if<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.600> everything<00:03:28.170> works<00:03:28.470> and

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
I could see if it everything works and

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.960 
I could see if it everything works and
the<00:03:30.209> correct<00:03:30.510> way<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.140> probably<00:03:31.519> tap<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.760> or

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the correct way is to probably tap it or

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.729 
the correct way is to probably tap it or
if<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.720> do<00:03:35.720> twist<00:03:36.720> them<00:03:36.870> together<00:03:37.049> make<00:03:37.709> sure

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
if you do twist them together make sure

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.190 
if you do twist them together make sure
you<00:03:37.950> solder<00:03:38.250> these<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:39.000> wires<00:03:39.209> together<00:03:39.510> and

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
you solder these the wires together and

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.130 
you solder these the wires together and
use<00:03:40.380> shrink<00:03:40.709> wrap<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:42.060> way<00:03:42.209> it's<00:03:42.989> really

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
use shrink wrap that way it's really

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.759 
use shrink wrap that way it's really
it's<00:03:43.680> really<00:03:44.130> protected<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.590> it's<00:03:46.590> why<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
it's really protected and it's why the

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.610 
it's really protected and it's why the
safest<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.900> most<00:03:49.380> efficient<00:03:50.160> way<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.310> do<00:03:50.579> it

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
safest and most efficient way to do it

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.069 
safest and most efficient way to do it
so<00:03:53.750> once<00:03:54.750> once<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.010> all<00:03:56.070> hooked<00:03:56.280> up

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
so once once you have it all hooked up

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:03.210 
so once once you have it all hooked up
and<00:03:58.079> go<00:03:58.350> ahead<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.560> test<00:03:58.829> it

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.240 

of<00:04:04.220> course<00:04:04.460> they<00:04:04.610> can<00:04:04.760> hear<00:04:05.000> that<00:04:05.180> hid<00:04:05.750> hum

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
of course they can hear that hid hum

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.630 
of course they can hear that hid hum
coming<00:04:07.250> from<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.700> Obiang<00:04:08.030> ballast<00:04:09.430> was<00:04:10.430> a

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
coming from the Obiang ballast was a

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:20.470 
coming from the Obiang ballast was a
good<00:04:10.850> thing<00:04:16.810> there's<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.900> light<00:04:18.170> there<00:04:19.480> I'll

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
good thing there's a light there I'll

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.540 
good thing there's a light there I'll
show<00:04:20.720> you

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:36.190 

Huygens<00:04:29.830> high<00:04:30.830> beams<00:04:31.130> work<00:04:34.900> they're<00:04:35.900> really

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
Huygens high beams work they're really

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.430 
Huygens high beams work they're really
bright<00:04:37.360> well<00:04:38.360> compare<00:04:39.140> that<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:41.440> black

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
bright well compare that to a black

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.880 
bright well compare that to a black
housing<00:04:42.710> hid<00:04:45.040> system<00:04:46.150> this<00:04:47.150> was<00:04:47.710> this<00:04:48.710> one

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
housing hid system this was this one

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.610 
housing hid system this was this one
right<00:04:49.010> here<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:50.290> of<00:04:51.290> course<00:04:51.560> that's<00:04:51.770> our<00:04:53.080> H<00:04:54.080> om

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
right here and of course that's our H om

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.700 
right here and of course that's our H om
HIV<00:04:56.530> so<00:04:57.880> there<00:04:58.880> you<00:04:58.970> have<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.470> it's<00:05:00.470> going<00:05:00.650> to

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
HIV so there you have it it's going to

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.590 
HIV so there you have it it's going to
be<00:05:00.830> probably<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.400> same<00:05:01.700> on<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.060> passenger

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
be probably the same on the passenger

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.310 
be probably the same on the passenger
side<00:05:03.910> if<00:05:04.910> not<00:05:05.300> I<00:05:05.570> will<00:05:06.580> show<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.640> guys<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.750> think

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
side if not I will show you guys I think

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.130 
side if not I will show you guys I think
there<00:05:09.500> is<00:05:09.650> anything<00:05:09.890> different<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:11.020> there<00:05:12.020> you

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
there is anything different so there you

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.020 
there is anything different so there you
go<00:05:12.290> these<00:05:13.070> two<00:05:13.990> white<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.230> green<00:05:16.000> red<00:05:17.000> and

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
go these two white and green red and

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.210 
go these two white and green red and
yellow<00:05:17.440> go<00:05:18.440> to<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:19.190> high<00:05:19.340> beam<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:21.380> white

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
yellow go to the high beam and the white

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.780 
yellow go to the high beam and the white
in<00:05:22.400> black<00:05:23.169> red<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:24.350> white<00:05:24.850> go<00:05:25.850> to<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:26.120> HIDs<00:05:27.790> so

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
in black red and white go to the HIDs so

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.960 
in black red and white go to the HIDs so
have<00:05:29.030> fun<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:29.919> enjoy<00:05:30.919> your<00:05:31.400> new<00:05:31.460> life<00:05:31.700> all

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
have fun and enjoy your new life all

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.110 
have fun and enjoy your new life all
right

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
right

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.000 
right
once<00:05:32.360> you're<00:05:32.570> done<00:05:33.110> wiring<00:05:33.380> everything<00:05:33.860> up

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
once you're done wiring everything up

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.600 
once you're done wiring everything up
your<00:05:34.910> OEM<00:05:35.290> HIDs<00:05:36.290> should<00:05:36.650> be<00:05:36.860> working<00:05:37.600> so<00:05:38.600> let's

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
your OEM HIDs should be working so let's

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:47.020 
your OEM HIDs should be working so let's
turn<00:05:40.610> it<00:05:40.790> on<00:05:40.880> and<00:05:41.120> see<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:41.930> difference<00:05:46.030> there

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
turn it on and see the difference there

00:05:47.030 --> 00:06:09.080 
turn it on and see the difference there
we<00:05:47.120> go

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.870 

and<00:06:09.419> on<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:09.900> Left<00:06:10.169> I<00:06:10.560> haven't<00:06:11.370> changed<00:06:11.730> them

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
and on the Left I haven't changed them

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.290 
and on the Left I haven't changed them
yet<00:06:12.090> so<00:06:12.690> those<00:06:13.050> are<00:06:13.350> the<00:06:14.040> black<00:06:14.280> housing<00:06:14.520> HIDs

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
yet so those are the black housing HIDs

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:24.040 
yet so those are the black housing HIDs
I<00:06:16.550> can<00:06:17.550> see<00:06:17.730> if<00:06:17.820> I<00:06:17.940> can<00:06:18.060> comparison<00:06:18.780> of<00:06:19.110> them

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.810 

and<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:25.260> left<00:06:25.470> one<00:06:25.650> the<00:06:25.680> angle<00:06:26.100> is<00:06:26.250> a<00:06:26.550> little

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
and the left one the angle is a little

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.420 
and the left one the angle is a little
too<00:06:26.940> high<00:06:30.470> kind<00:06:31.470> of<00:06:31.500> blinding<00:06:31.740> the<00:06:32.040> camera

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
too high kind of blinding the camera

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:41.360 
too high kind of blinding the camera
more<00:06:35.900> but<00:06:37.250> for<00:06:38.250> what<00:06:38.400> I<00:06:38.430> see<00:06:38.850> the<00:06:39.300> OEM<00:06:39.660> HIDs<00:06:40.500> the

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
more but for what I see the OEM HIDs the

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:55.929 
more but for what I see the OEM HIDs the
output<00:06:41.820> is<00:06:42.150> a<00:06:42.180> lot<00:06:42.600> more<00:06:43.550> in<00:06:45.380> these

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:55.939 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:02.370 

so<00:06:56.939> they<00:06:57.479> have<00:06:57.749> it

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.850 

I<00:07:02.470> hope<00:07:03.160> you<00:07:03.340> guys<00:07:04.290> found<00:07:05.290> this<00:07:05.470> video<00:07:05.710> a

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
I hope you guys found this video a

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.640 
I hope you guys found this video a
little<00:07:06.130> useful<00:07:06.670> and<00:07:07.630> no<00:07:07.780> wiring<00:07:08.080> can<00:07:08.470> be

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
little useful and no wiring can be

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.110
