looks prettier so this is a this is

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.379 
looks prettier so this is a this is
glossy<00:03:27.419> this<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:28.470> matte<00:03:28.739> finish<00:03:29.389> the

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
glossy this is like matte finish the

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.170

keys<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:31.019> keys<00:03:31.169> are<00:03:31.379> just<00:03:31.760> kind<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:32.910> mix

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
keys the keys are just kind of a mix

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.949 
keys the keys are just kind of a mix
between<00:03:33.419> the<00:03:33.780> both<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.109> guess<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.470> know<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:35.959> guess

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
between the both I guess I know I guess

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.150 
between the both I guess I know I guess
I<00:03:37.079> might<00:03:37.230> as<00:03:37.290> well<00:03:37.500> take<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:37.859> off<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.129> there

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
I might as well take that off of there

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.229 
I might as well take that off of there
even<00:03:38.489> though<00:03:40.730> now<00:03:41.730> it's<00:03:41.910> going<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.090> be

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
even though now it's going to be

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:52.069 
even though now it's going to be
fingerprint<00:03:42.780> heaven<00:03:43.109> but<00:03:47.449> let's<00:03:48.449> see<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:51.079> don't

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
fingerprint heaven but let's see I don't

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.539 
fingerprint heaven but let's see I don't
know<00:03:52.139> it<00:03:52.260> doesn't<00:03:52.530> show<00:03:52.620> fingerprints<00:03:53.099> up<00:03:53.310> yet

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
know it doesn't show fingerprints up yet

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.890 
know it doesn't show fingerprints up yet
but<00:03:53.760> sometimes<00:03:54.150> that's<00:03:54.299> pretty<00:03:54.599> deceiving

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
but sometimes that's pretty deceiving

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.750 
but sometimes that's pretty deceiving
like<00:03:55.290> I've<00:03:55.440> had<00:03:55.620> products<00:03:56.099> new<00:03:56.280> products

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
like I've had products new products

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.210 
like I've had products new products
sometimes<00:03:57.720> don't<00:03:58.319> show<00:03:58.620> fingerprints<00:03:59.040> as

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
sometimes don't show fingerprints as

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.759 
sometimes don't show fingerprints as
much<00:03:59.400> as<00:03:59.519> old<00:03:59.699> product<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.269> maybe<00:04:00.540> once<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.620> age

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
much as old product so maybe once it age

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.379 
much as old product so maybe once it age
is<00:04:01.949> a<00:04:01.980> little<00:04:02.250> bit<00:04:02.400> it'll<00:04:02.639> show<00:04:02.910> some<00:04:03.150> stuff

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
is a little bit it'll show some stuff

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.539 
is a little bit it'll show some stuff
but<00:04:03.690> uh<00:04:03.750> apparently<00:04:04.349> it<00:04:04.709> has<00:04:04.859> three<00:04:05.220> different

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
but uh apparently it has three different

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.309 
but uh apparently it has three different
modes<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:06.150> noticed<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.690> whenever<00:04:06.989> i<00:04:07.139> bought

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
modes I noticed that whenever i bought

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.159 
modes I noticed that whenever i bought
it<00:04:07.500> for<00:04:08.370> different<00:04:09.090> users<00:04:09.299> or<00:04:09.720> something

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
it for different users or something

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.939 
it for different users or something
there's<00:04:11.129> a<00:04:11.250> play<00:04:11.699> play<00:04:12.419> pause<00:04:12.690> rewind<00:04:12.949> forward

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
there's a play play pause rewind forward

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.550 
there's a play play pause rewind forward
there's<00:04:14.849> some<00:04:14.970> volumes<00:04:15.449> oh<00:04:15.780> there's<00:04:16.229> probably

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
there's some volumes oh there's probably

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.089 
there's some volumes oh there's probably
for<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.180> for<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.209> liq<00:04:18.479> keyboard<00:04:18.959> Owen<00:04:19.500> let's

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
for the for the liq keyboard Owen let's

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.409 
for the for the liq keyboard Owen let's
see<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.250> guys<00:04:20.370> know<00:04:20.549> apparently<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.209> one

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
see you guys know apparently this one

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.360 
see you guys know apparently this one
it's<00:04:21.719> lit<00:04:22.049> up

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
it's lit up

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.550 
it's lit up
read<00:04:22.610> instead<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.720> just<00:04:23.840> like<00:04:23.990> white<00:04:24.260> like

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
read instead of just like white like

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.980 
read instead of just like white like
most<00:04:24.830> of<00:04:24.949> them<00:04:25.040> probably<00:04:25.660> so<00:04:26.660> that's

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
most of them probably so that's

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.370 
most of them probably so that's
interesting<00:04:27.530> i<00:04:27.590> guess<00:04:27.770> i<00:04:28.840> guess<00:04:29.840> besides<00:04:30.229> that

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
interesting i guess i guess besides that

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.860 
interesting i guess i guess besides that
