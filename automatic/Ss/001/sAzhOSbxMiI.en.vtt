00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
you need to decide what's the right

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.240 
you need to decide what's the right
starter<00:00:05.879> scope<00:00:06.120> for<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.919> until<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.010> scopes

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
starter scope for you until the scopes

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.620 
starter scope for you until the scopes
do<00:00:08.400> two<00:00:08.580> things<00:00:08.790> they<00:00:08.970> allow<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.450> see

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
do two things they allow you to see

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.570 
do two things they allow you to see
faint<00:00:09.929> objects<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.740> they<00:00:10.920> allow<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.340> see

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
faint objects and they allow you to see

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.060 
faint objects and they allow you to see
small<00:00:11.940> objects<00:00:12.389> faint<00:00:13.259> objects<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.920> be

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
small objects faint objects and be

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.980 
small objects faint objects and be
outside<00:00:14.460> our<00:00:14.610> solar<00:00:14.849> system<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.509> they<00:00:15.750> tend

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
outside our solar system and they tend

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.620 
outside our solar system and they tend
to<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.109> big<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.650> fuzzy<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.699> so-called<00:00:18.150> deep

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
to be big and fuzzy the so-called deep

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.929 
to be big and fuzzy the so-called deep
sky<00:00:18.960> objects<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.590> know<00:00:19.740> galaxies<00:00:20.520> globular

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
sky objects you know galaxies globular

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.840 
sky objects you know galaxies globular
clusters<00:00:21.630> nebulae<00:00:22.380> supernova<00:00:23.189> remnants<00:00:23.670> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
clusters nebulae supernova remnants and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.120 
clusters nebulae supernova remnants and
so<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.990> small<00:00:25.320> objects<00:00:25.710> tend<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.039> be

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
so on the small objects tend to be

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.660 
so on the small objects tend to be
bright<00:00:27.060> double<00:00:27.900> stars<00:00:28.199> star<00:00:29.099> clusters

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
bright double stars star clusters

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.630 
bright double stars star clusters
planets<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.840> on

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
planets and so on

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.100 
planets and so on
magnification<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:33.059> largely<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.510> red<00:00:33.719> herring

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
magnification is largely a red herring

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.580 
magnification is largely a red herring
here<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.500> basically<00:00:34.980> all<00:00:35.250> about<00:00:35.730> aperture

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
here it's basically all about aperture

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.380 
here it's basically all about aperture
the<00:00:37.590> ability<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> telescope<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.059> faint

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the ability of a telescope to see faint

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.360 
the ability of a telescope to see faint
objects<00:00:39.809> basically<00:00:40.140> oh<00:00:40.379> should<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.860> square

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
objects basically oh should the square

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.630 
objects basically oh should the square
of<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.210> aperture<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.370> double

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
of the aperture so that is if you double

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.580 
of the aperture so that is if you double
the<00:00:44.670> size<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.149> aperture<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.079> get<00:00:46.260> four

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the size of the aperture you get four

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.440 
the size of the aperture you get four
times<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:47.190> many<00:00:47.340> photons<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.239> allows

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
times as many photons and that allows

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.750 
times as many photons and that allows
you<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> see<00:00:48.870> much<00:00:49.140> fainter<00:00:49.559> objects<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you to see much fainter objects the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.580 
you to see much fainter objects the
larger<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> diameter<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> telescope<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
larger the diameter of the telescope the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.100 
larger the diameter of the telescope the
smaller<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.520> object<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.180> telescope<00:00:54.809> has<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
smaller the object the telescope has the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.680 
smaller the object the telescope has the
capability<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.370> see<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.239> time<00:00:57.539> it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
capability to see but this time it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.119 
capability to see but this time it
basically<00:00:58.109> goes<00:00:58.289> linearly<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
basically goes linearly with the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.639 
basically goes linearly with the
aperture<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.879> is<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.570> double<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> aperture

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
aperture that is you double the aperture

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.950 
aperture that is you double the aperture
then<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:02.820> objects<00:01:03.239> about<00:01:03.449> half<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
then you can see objects about half the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.800 
then you can see objects about half the
size<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> where's<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> problem<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.540> hear<00:01:06.689> you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
size so where's the problem I hear you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.480 
size so where's the problem I hear you
ask<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.260> begin<00:01:07.560> scope<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> better<00:01:08.220> right

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
ask the begin scope the better right

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.179 
ask the begin scope the better right
well<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> degree<00:01:09.780> yes<00:01:10.229> however<00:01:10.979> there<00:01:11.159> are

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
well to a degree yes however there are

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.609 
well to a degree yes however there are
other<00:01:11.430> limitations<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> telescope<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
other limitations on the telescope the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.980 
other limitations on the telescope the
first<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.040> most<00:01:14.100> obvious<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.729> sky<00:01:15.180> all

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
first and most obvious is the sky all

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.899 
first and most obvious is the sky all
scopes<00:01:16.409> are<00:01:16.680> essentially<00:01:17.070> useless<00:01:17.369> under<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
scopes are essentially useless under a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.450 
scopes are essentially useless under a
cloudy<00:01:18.150> sky<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:19.259> even<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:20.070> cloudy

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
cloudy sky but even if it's not cloudy

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.820 
cloudy sky but even if it's not cloudy
the<00:01:20.820> sky<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.420> commonly<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> greater<00:01:22.380> limiting

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the sky is commonly a greater limiting

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.520 
the sky is commonly a greater limiting
factor<00:01:23.369> than<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.090> telescope<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.900> you're

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
factor than the telescope if you're

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.440 
factor than the telescope if you're
looking<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:25.890> framed<00:01:26.189> objects<00:01:26.640> such<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:26.850> nebula

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
looking at framed objects such as nebula

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.109 
looking at framed objects such as nebula
these<00:01:27.780> tend<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.229> big<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.979> fuzzy<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.430> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
these tend to be big and fuzzy and so

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.819 
these tend to be big and fuzzy and so
the<00:01:30.299> darkness<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> clarity<00:01:31.560> that's

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the darkness and the clarity that's

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.310 
the darkness and the clarity that's
basically<00:01:32.310> how<00:01:32.549> transparent<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.360> skies<00:01:33.720> are

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
basically how transparent the skies are

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.980 
basically how transparent the skies are
the<00:01:34.380> principal<00:01:35.189> factors<00:01:35.729> if<00:01:35.939> your<00:01:36.689> skies

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the principal factors if your skies

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.050 
the principal factors if your skies
murky<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> lot<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.310> light<00:01:38.490> pollution<00:01:38.820> or

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
murky or is a lot of light pollution or

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.630 
murky or is a lot of light pollution or
there's<00:01:39.299> even<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.290> full<00:01:40.500> moon<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> sky<00:01:41.070> you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
there's even a full moon in the sky you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.850 
there's even a full moon in the sky you
can<00:01:41.790> lastly<00:01:42.180> forget<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.020> big<00:01:43.560> scope

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
can lastly forget about it a big scope

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
can lastly forget about it a big scope
under<00:01:44.189> those<00:01:44.340> circumstances<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:46.079> an

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
under those circumstances is just an

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080 
under those circumstances is just an
expensive<00:01:46.920> way<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.220> making<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.549> hard<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.880> look

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
expensive way of making it hard to look
