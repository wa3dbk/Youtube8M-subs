rod or anything like that on the wood so

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.130 
rod or anything like that on the wood so
I<00:01:13.540> plan<00:01:14.170> on<00:01:14.409> reusing<00:01:14.950> that<00:01:15.579> floor<00:01:15.939> and<00:01:16.390> just

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
I plan on reusing that floor and just

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.899 
I plan on reusing that floor and just
basically<00:01:17.290> framing<00:01:18.159> out<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.310> metal<00:01:18.670> frame

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
basically framing out a metal frame

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.319 
basically framing out a metal frame
underneath<00:01:19.299> here<00:01:20.700> underneath<00:01:21.700> what<00:01:22.030> i<00:01:22.060> have

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
underneath here underneath what i have

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.109 
underneath here underneath what i have
here<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.869> dropping<00:01:23.439> that<00:01:23.890> into<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.579> after

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
here and dropping that into it after

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.300 
here and dropping that into it after
it's<00:01:25.659> completely<00:01:26.200> stained<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.770> sealed<00:01:27.039> up

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
it's completely stained and sealed up

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.410 
it's completely stained and sealed up
again<00:01:28.799> removing<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:30.009> axle<00:01:30.399> obviously<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.270> the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
again removing the axle obviously so the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.849 
again removing the axle obviously so the
actual<00:01:31.600> will<00:01:31.899> be<00:01:31.990> attached<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.619> steel

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
actual will be attached to the steel

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.529 
actual will be attached to the steel
frame<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.460> tongue<00:01:33.670> will<00:01:33.850> be<00:01:33.969> attached<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
frame the tongue will be attached to the

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.120 
frame the tongue will be attached to the
steel<00:01:34.780> frame<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.079> this<00:01:35.350> will<00:01:35.500> basically<00:01:35.619> be<00:01:35.979> a

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
steel frame and this will basically be a

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.870 
steel frame and this will basically be a
box<00:01:36.430> that's<00:01:36.729> bolted<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:39.189> floor<00:01:39.609> that's

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
box that's bolted to it or floor that's

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.170 
box that's bolted to it or floor that's
bolted<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.899> sideboards<00:01:42.180> I'll

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
bolted to it the sideboards I'll

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.279 
bolted to it the sideboards I'll
probably<00:01:43.659> utilize<00:01:44.619> them<00:01:44.950> for<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.399> time<00:01:45.640> being

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
probably utilize them for the time being

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.859 
probably utilize them for the time being
but<00:01:48.090> they're<00:01:49.090> not<00:01:49.210> going<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.479> stay<00:01:49.689> they're

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
but they're not going to stay they're

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.859 
but they're not going to stay they're
not<00:01:49.929> going<00:01:50.109> to<00:01:50.170> be<00:01:50.289> permanent<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:52.420> we'll<00:01:52.630> see

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
not going to be permanent what we'll see

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.419 
not going to be permanent what we'll see
because<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.500> do<00:01:53.560> want<00:01:53.679> to<00:01:53.950> get<00:01:54.070> this<00:01:54.219> to<00:01:54.399> the

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
because I do want to get this to the

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.730 
because I do want to get this to the
point<00:01:54.789> where<00:01:54.909> I<00:01:54.969> could<00:01:55.149> actually<00:01:55.299> use<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.869> but

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
point where I could actually use it but

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.410 
point where I could actually use it but
this<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.100> long-term<00:01:57.609> project<00:01:57.939> that<00:01:58.329> I'm

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
this is a long-term project that I'm

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.239 
this is a long-term project that I'm
hoping<00:01:58.719> to<00:01:58.810> have<00:01:58.960> wrapped<00:01:59.259> up<00:01:59.469> you<00:01:59.920> know<00:02:00.009> by

wanted it number one is big enough for a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.729 
wanted it number one is big enough for a
project<00:02:14.310> polaris<00:02:15.310> cyclone<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:17.349> that's<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.709> plus

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
project polaris cyclone so that's a plus

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.820 
project polaris cyclone so that's a plus
it<00:02:18.640> also<00:02:18.790> has<00:02:19.150> all<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.569> extra<00:02:19.750> space<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.349> here

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
it also has all this extra space in here

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.199 
it also has all this extra space in here
for<00:02:21.489> firewood<00:02:22.000> when<00:02:22.180> we<00:02:22.330> go<00:02:22.510> camping<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:25.060> the

for firewood when we go camping but the
big<00:02:25.360> part<00:02:25.629> is<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.989> it's<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.530> GM<00:02:27.280> bolt<00:02:27.580> pattern

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
big part is is it's a GM bolt pattern

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.619 
big part is is it's a GM bolt pattern
it's<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.140> GM<00:02:29.440> six<00:02:29.830> lug<00:02:30.099> bolt<00:02:30.400> pattern<00:02:30.849> at<00:02:31.180> six<00:02:31.480> on

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
it's a GM six lug bolt pattern at six on

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.300 
it's a GM six lug bolt pattern at six on
five<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.140> half<00:02:32.170> which<00:02:32.799> is<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.069> same<00:02:33.250> thing

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310

hardware none of the hard Wars even
rusted<00:03:23.290> out<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:23.560> they<00:03:23.680> must<00:03:23.889> have<00:03:23.980> been

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
rusted out so they must have been

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.430 
rusted out so they must have been
keeping<00:03:24.489> this<00:03:24.609> inside<00:03:25.060> or<00:03:25.480> covered<00:03:26.079> up<00:03:26.200> really

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
exception of the tongue so like I said

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.660 
exception of the tongue so like I said
they<00:03:41.349> must<00:03:41.560> have<00:03:41.650> been<00:03:41.799> they<00:03:42.220> must<00:03:42.459> add<00:03:42.609> the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
they must have been they must add the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.309 
they must have been they must add the
wood<00:03:42.970> part<00:03:43.180> covered<00:03:43.599> up<00:03:43.690> with<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.840> tarp<00:03:44.170> or

wood part covered up with a tarp or
something<00:03:44.650> over<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.920> years<00:03:45.220> because<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.730> don't

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
something over the years because I don't

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.909 
something over the years because I don't
even<00:03:46.540> see<00:03:46.690> any<00:03:46.720> mildew<00:03:47.380> or<00:03:47.530> anything<00:03:47.889> like

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
so anyway sit tight take a look at what

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.259 
so anyway sit tight take a look at what
the<00:03:56.799> plans<00:03:57.069> are<00:03:57.280> supposed<00:03:57.579> to<00:03:57.639> look<00:03:57.819> like<00:03:57.880> i've

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
the plans are supposed to look like i've

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.530 
the plans are supposed to look like i've
got<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> 3d<00:03:59.250> 3d<00:04:00.250> drawing<00:04:00.579> of<00:04:00.849> what<00:04:00.880> i<00:04:01.030> want<00:04:01.329> it<00:04:01.419> to

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
got a 3d 3d drawing of what i want it to

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.330 
got a 3d 3d drawing of what i want it to
look<00:04:01.690> like<00:04:01.750> it's<00:04:02.290> going<00:04:03.099> to<00:04:03.160> be<00:04:03.280> modular<00:04:03.790> so

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
look like it's going to be modular so

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.210 
look like it's going to be modular so
basically<00:04:06.340> it's<00:04:06.489> going<00:04:06.639> to<00:04:06.700> be<00:04:06.819> a<00:04:06.849> flat<00:04:07.329> floor

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
basically it's going to be a flat floor

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.610 
basically it's going to be a flat floor
that<00:04:10.049> has<00:04:11.049> little<00:04:11.709> change<00:04:12.100> into

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
that has little change into

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.930 
that has little change into
a<00:04:13.680> few<00:04:13.980> different<00:04:14.310> types<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:15.889> setups<00:04:16.889> so<00:04:17.729> it'll

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
a few different types of setups so it'll

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.759 
a few different types of setups so it'll
have<00:04:17.970> like<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.510> stake<00:04:18.750> bed<00:04:18.959> style<00:04:19.500> like<00:04:19.739> this

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
have like the stake bed style like this

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.460 
have like the stake bed style like this
is<00:04:20.280> where<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.690> sides<00:04:21.930> will<00:04:22.139> be<00:04:22.229> able<00:04:22.320> to

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
is where the sides will be able to

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.620 
is where the sides will be able to
change<00:04:22.770> out<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.580> just<00:04:23.760> like<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.150> said<00:04:24.360> just<00:04:24.389> a

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
change out and just like I said just a

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.140 
change out and just like I said just a
few<00:04:24.660> different<00:04:25.169> types<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.530> setups<00:04:26.010> so<00:04:26.880> that

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
few different types of setups so that

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.300 
few different types of setups so that
depending<00:04:27.720> on<00:04:27.720> what<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.080> need<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.410> have<00:04:29.070> that

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
depending on what I need I have that

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.490 
depending on what I need I have that
ability<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.479> change<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.930> trailer<00:04:31.320> around<00:04:32.270> so

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
ability to change the trailer around so

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.110 
ability to change the trailer around so
anyway<00:04:34.500> that's<00:04:34.710> what<00:04:34.860> we<00:04:34.979> got<00:04:35.130> going<00:04:35.490> on<00:04:35.610> if

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120
