00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.320
 Unam scientists seek to mitigate the 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.660
 Parkinson 's disease through 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.190
 silymarin extract the experts 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.680
 they found that this wild plant 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.900
 has neuroprotective properties that 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.400
 could benefit the human organism 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.439
 in the face of this condition 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.119
 The extract can be used to 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.109
 mitigate the effects of that condition 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.279
 due to its antioxidant properties and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.140
 anti-inflammatory what we hope is 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.849
 that as soon as you have a diagnosis 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.670
 early to start treatment 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.920
 with silymarin and try this 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.300
 way to prevent the progression of the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.430
 disease you have to remember that the 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.870
 patients are deteriorating with the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.390
 progression of the disease go 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.309
 losing self-sufficiency can no longer 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.070
 eating alone can not be abandoned 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.890
 example then at the time that 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.570
 have an early diagnosis try 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.600
 prevent further deterioration of the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.820
 patient with the use of the sina and the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.530
 Parkinson's is a disease 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.899
 neurodegenerative nervous system 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.150
 central whose appearance may originate 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.800
 in the mutation of some genes though 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.870
 exposure to certain toxins 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.710
 environmental issues also explains the 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.810
 disease 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.509
 these factors produce degeneration 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.100
 from a zone of the brain called 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.840
 substance black the neurons that form 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.420
 such a region are responsible for 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.420
 produce dopamine and you have to remember 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.430
 that in parkinson levels are lost 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.399
 of dopamine in the substance nigra in the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.710
 already striated, silymarin is a 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.280
 abstract and contain several elements 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.929
 within these elements we have some 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.090
 flavonoids and the structure of 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.280
 flavonoids is what will give us the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.780
 antioxidant property depending on the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.299
 dose with which one administers the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.069
 Silymarin also has an effect 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.200
 anti-inflammatory and we try different 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.750
 dose in the disease model of 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.789
 parkinson which is a model with mouse in 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.030
 where we induce a Parkinson's syndrome 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.280
 and ccoo with a toxin and what we saw is 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.039
 that we had a dose-response curve 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.689
 very beautiful go with the treatment of the 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.909
 silymarin retaining the levels of 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.009
 dopamine the researcher of the unam 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.470
 said that a second phase of the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.630
 study involves determining the dose 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.730
 suitable for oral administration of 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.920
 silymarin extract the doctor 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.870
 ChavarrÃ­a added that, in parallel , 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.500
 seek to resolve related issues 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.450
 with your app 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.790
 once the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.440
 investigations to determine dose and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.990
 administration of the extract of 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.330
 silymarin the subsequent phase would consist 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.220
 in looking for a clinical laboratory where 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.370
 is possible in the oriented tests 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.370
 to humans to prove their effectiveness 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.370
 neuroprotector
