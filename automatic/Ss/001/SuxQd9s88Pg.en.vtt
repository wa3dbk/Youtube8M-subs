00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.880
 already if the feet on the parts of the body most often forgotten 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.710
 until we have a problem we realize that in addition to supporting 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.760
 our feet are also indispensable to realize our 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.479
 activities 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:16.770
 Augustine Arias 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.240
 davis science and technology increasingly have more demanding applications and 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.560
 complex in our common life 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.819
 the land 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.800
 we have joined the development of biomedical research 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.120
 and almost anthropometric to achieve the best material design solutions 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.120
 and control systems 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.670
 at the mendoza technology research center 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.820
 we have set ourselves an especially complex goal 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.150
 develop the best safety shoes on the market 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.730
 ohl adequate protective footwear requires primarily protecting the foot 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.880
 against work risks 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.090
 also provides comfort and hygiene for a day of constant movement 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.580
 and durability against wear by extreme agents such as chemicals 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.390
 river ter I am tired of more advanced and innovative protection 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.200
 with the technology and new generation materials 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.290
 to meet protection needs 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.020
 but the most important thing is that the user 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.190
 fruit of the work done by the feet 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.190
 what favors better performance 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.080
 the elements of the neighboring nation of women developing shoes 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.970
 security are the following 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.840
 form developed under anthropometric and biomechanical studies 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.260
 The iger sole is comfortable and resistant to abrasion due to the 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.640
 combination of high performance materials and its double density is 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.500
 excellent to cushion the impact of the step against the ground while offering 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.830
 high wear resistance does not deform contact with oils and 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.010
 satisfactorily meets the tests and entity apac 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.060
 the radial design takes into account both the flexion of the foot and the best way 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.060
 of expelling water from the sole 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.379
 the insoles are antibacterial and thermal like all the 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.509
 internal materials of footwear 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:23.249
 excellent for absorbing impacts and distributing plantar pressures 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.769
 also has the active system by means of independent templates 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.769
 the adjustment of the cancer can be customized 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.019
 the festive anatomical protection helmet recognizes the shape of the foot 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.169
 allowing natural movement while offering total protection 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
 against impacts and compression 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.629
 the chassis has the purpose of offering a better support of the weight of the body 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.879
 on the roadway its design and materials dictated by Tokyo 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:04.429
 The construction strokes unlike traditional systems offers greater 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.429
 lightness and flexibility 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.920
 The cut is also has the specifications for a footwear 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.849
 protection that attached to the sole by an automated injection system 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.579
 direct, which results in virtually one-piece shoes 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:34.299
 Our products have been satisfactorily evaluated the laboratories of 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.399
 physical and chemical biomechanical tests of the closure 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:52.019
 the technological innovation of the line that I will love you 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.169
 in a world to manco alias of protective footwear 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.719
 but beyond 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.419
 takes him to own or 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.419
 the technology that tomorrow will be indispensable 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.029
 has added 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:08.029
 lawyer 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.129
 do not 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.459
 but
