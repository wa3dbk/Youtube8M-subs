00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.449 
well until I got to the last line up
here<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:47.840> I<00:03:47.930> smudged<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:48.769> I<00:03:49.100> was<00:03:49.280> really

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
here and I smudged it and I was really

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.490 
here and I smudged it and I was really
frustrated<00:03:49.790> because<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:50.510> had<00:03:50.840> done<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:51.290> well

and<00:03:51.769> I<00:03:52.220> was<00:03:52.250> ready<00:03:52.579> to<00:03:52.760> toss<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:53.540> then<00:03:54.019> I

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
and I was ready to toss it and then I

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.110 
and I was ready to toss it and then I
decided<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:54.799> I<00:03:55.130> really<00:03:55.160> wanted<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.880> sell
