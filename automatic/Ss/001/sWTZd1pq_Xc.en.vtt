00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.680 
wonderful as you can see that sin now so
probably<00:03:27.220> best<00:03:27.489> if<00:03:27.550> you<00:03:27.640> double<00:03:27.910> D<00:03:28.000> clutch

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.960 

let's<00:03:31.690> do<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.900> gently

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
let's do it gently

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.060 
let's do it gently
I'll<00:03:33.960> try<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.170> again<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.590> minute<00:03:34.680> might<00:03:34.950> be

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
I'll try that again in a minute might be

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.860 
I'll try that again in a minute might be
operator<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.610> it

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.130 

otherwise

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:04:08.370 

talking<00:03:43.920> much<00:03:44.069> these<00:03:44.100> pretty<00:03:44.520> much<00:03:44.670> spot<00:03:44.880> on

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.350 

she<00:04:08.740> had<00:04:09.070> big<00:04:09.910> branches<00:04:10.360> I'm<00:04:10.510> interesting

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.790 

I<00:04:14.420> guess<00:04:14.990> that's<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.260> beauty<00:04:15.530> of<00:04:15.560> having<00:04:15.650> to

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
I guess that's the beauty of having to

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.660 
I guess that's the beauty of having to
fork<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.100> joint<00:04:17.350> into<00:04:18.350> third<00:04:21.430> okay<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.550> time

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
fork a joint into third okay that time

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:23.590 
fork a joint into third okay that time
in<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:22.850> second<00:04:23.090> I<00:04:23.150> think<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.330> might<00:04:23.420> be<00:04:23.480> an

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
in a second I think it might be an

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.770 
in a second I think it might be an
operator<00:04:23.900> out<00:04:24.110> we'll<00:04:24.890> try<00:04:25.040> again<00:04:25.160> in<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.340> minute

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.369 

into<00:04:30.380> third

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:33.379 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.110 

no<00:04:34.379> I<00:04:34.590> think<00:04:35.340> it's<00:04:35.490> just<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.699> was<00:04:35.789> putting<00:04:36.030> in

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.850 
no I think it's just I was putting in
the<00:04:36.210> one<00:04:36.360> putting<00:04:37.199> it<00:04:37.349> in<00:04:37.409> the<00:04:37.469> wrong<00:04:37.560> place

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
the one putting it in the wrong place

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.820 
the one putting it in the wrong place
