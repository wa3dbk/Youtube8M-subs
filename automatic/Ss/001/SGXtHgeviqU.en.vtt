00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.309
 then he decided on a new tool 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.800
 to organize for his work and 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.290
 started surfing the internet 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.840
 He came next to an infinite number 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.180

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.130
 if he ordered everything individually 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.990
 suddenly the desperate one heard 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:19.790
