00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
it shoots your opponent down from

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
it shoots your opponent down from

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
searching their deck and such that's

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.569 
searching their deck and such that's
really<00:00:46.410> powerful<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.129> make<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
really powerful you can make it a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.670 
really powerful you can make it a
special<00:00:47.730> summon<00:00:48.329> which<00:00:48.510> sometimes<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.469> deck

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
special summon which sometimes the deck

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.619 
special summon which sometimes the deck
can<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.219> trouble<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.239> not

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
can have trouble with that but not

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.479 
can have trouble with that but not
really<00:00:51.899> because<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.770> access<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
really because if you have access to a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.090 
really because if you have access to a
absolute<00:00:54.480> zero<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.649> doesn't<00:00:55.980> matter

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
absolute zero it really doesn't matter

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.060 
absolute zero it really doesn't matter
it's<00:00:56.430> irrelevant<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.570> yeah<00:00:58.289> he<00:00:58.530> acts<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
it's irrelevant but up yeah he acts as a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.979 
it's irrelevant but up yeah he acts as a
light<00:00:59.399> type<00:00:59.640> monster<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.690> use<00:01:00.840> them

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
light type monster and you can use them

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.660 
light type monster and you can use them
for<00:01:01.020> miracle<00:01:01.559> fusion<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.250> really

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
for miracle fusion so that's really

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.390 
for miracle fusion so that's really
really<00:01:03.030> good<00:01:03.239> no<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.110> next<00:01:04.409> rdd<00:01:04.890> warrior<00:01:05.250> Lady

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
really good no the next rdd warrior Lady

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.000 
really good no the next rdd warrior Lady
also<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> light<00:01:06.479> type<00:01:06.720> monster<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> thing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
also a light type monster but the thing

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.980 
also a light type monster but the thing
is<00:01:08.040> odds<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:08.909> you're<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.960> able

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
is odds are you're not going to be able

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.070 
is odds are you're not going to be able
to<00:01:10.590> remove<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.820> monster<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.810> court

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
to remove a monster with this court

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840 
to remove a monster with this court
unless<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.619> Ram<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> like

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
unless you Ram this and the like

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.210 
unless you Ram this and the like
something<00:01:15.479> yourself<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:16.590> most<00:01:16.860> likely

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
something yourself because most likely

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.740 
something yourself because most likely
your<00:01:17.430> opponent<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.210> using<00:01:18.420> up

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
your opponent is going to be using up

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.539 
your opponent is going to be using up
resources<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> get<00:01:20.220> rid<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.430> this

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
resources just to get rid of this

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.160 
resources just to get rid of this
because<00:01:20.759> they're<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.210> men<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.509> don't<00:01:21.930> want<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
because they're like men I don't want to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.590 
because they're like men I don't want to
lose<00:01:22.320> my<00:01:22.350> monster<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.159> that's<00:01:23.640> what<00:01:24.330> makes

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
lose my monster so that's what makes

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.679 
lose my monster so that's what makes
this<00:01:24.750> card<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.530> good<00:01:26.150> unless<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.360> know<00:01:27.509> they

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
this card so good unless you know they

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.630 
this card so good unless you know they
have<00:01:27.869> something<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.320> they<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:29.070> afford<00:01:29.189> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
have something that they can afford to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.130 
have something that they can afford to
get<00:01:29.759> rid<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.720> don't<00:01:30.750> care

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
get rid of and they really don't care

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560 
get rid of and they really don't care
but<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.950> know<00:01:32.070> odds<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.579> they're<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
but you know odds are they're going to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.300 
but you know odds are they're going to
want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> use<00:01:33.840> maybe<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.290> smashing<00:01:34.860> ground<00:01:35.070> or

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
maybe some umbreon Akande bouncer you

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.960 
maybe some umbreon Akande bouncer you
know<00:01:37.799> something<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.640> want<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> get

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
control so automatically he's a 1800

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.459 
control so automatically he's a 1800
he's<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> fire<00:01:56.909> guy<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.479> he<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> target<00:01:58.290> for

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
mass change and he's also a fire guy for

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.810 
mass change and he's also a fire guy for
Nova<00:02:03.780> master<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> really<00:02:05.310> powerful

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
two guys on the board so and then of

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.880 
two guys on the board so and then of
course<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.370> spell<00:02:36.730> cards<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.960> super

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
course the spell cards you have super

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.660 
course the spell cards you have super
polymerization<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.620> easily<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.250> best

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
polymerization this is easily the best

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.480 
polymerization this is easily the best
card<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.210> game<00:02:43.360> now<00:02:43.920> hear<00:02:44.920> me<00:02:44.950> out<00:02:45.100> before

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
unfortunate but that's kind of where

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.719
