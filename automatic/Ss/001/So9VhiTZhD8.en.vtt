lesson<00:00:21.960> off<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.439> some<00:00:22.619> theory<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.789> music

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
lesson off with some theory it's a music

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.160 
lesson off with some theory it's a music
theory<00:00:24.449> alright<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.670> major<00:00:26.880> scale<00:00:27.170> you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
theory alright so in a major scale you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.990 
theory alright so in a major scale you
have<00:00:28.199> triads<00:00:28.890> for<00:00:29.130> each<00:00:29.250> scale<00:00:29.519> degree<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
have triads for each scale degree and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.709 
have triads for each scale degree and
these<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> Triads<00:00:31.439> are<00:00:31.560> major<00:00:32.719> 135

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
these are what the Triads are major 135

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:44.470 
these are what the Triads are major 135
minor<00:00:34.260> minor<00:00:35.250> major<00:00:35.600> major<00:00:36.600> minor<00:00:37.640> diminished

furthermore<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.930> part<00:00:46.230> harmonies<00:00:46.680> which

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
furthermore for part harmonies which

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.869 
furthermore for part harmonies which
would<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.579> be<00:00:47.670> 1<00:00:47.940> 3<00:00:48.300> 5<00:00:48.510> 7<00:00:48.860> go<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.280> major

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
would just be 1 3 5 7 go like this major

thing within a major scale or things
with<00:01:09.450> animes<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.780> would<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.200> called<00:01:10.500> modes

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
with animes that would be called modes

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.620 
with animes that would be called modes
and<00:01:12.500> all<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.799> modes<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.310> modes<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:15.090> just

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and all that modes are modes are just

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
and all that modes are modes are just
the<00:01:16.080> major<00:01:16.320> scale<00:01:16.710> starting<00:01:17.159> off<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
the major scale starting off of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.510 
the major scale starting off of
different<00:01:18.060> degrees<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.500> if<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.830> take<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.250> major

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
different degrees so if you take a major

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.660 
different degrees so if you take a major
and<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> start<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.330> off<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.630> B<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:23.100> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and you start it off of B and then you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.020 
and you start it off of B and then you
play<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.299> major<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.530> would<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.850> up

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
play a major as you would then you go up

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.429 
play a major as you would then you go up
to<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> high<00:01:27.450> B<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.900> start<00:01:28.200> coming

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
to a high B and then you start coming

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.990 
to a high B and then you start coming
down<00:01:31.310> now<00:01:32.310> you're<00:01:32.460> actually<00:01:32.729> playing<00:01:32.939> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
down now you're actually playing a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.880 
down now you're actually playing a
different<00:01:33.329> mode<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.200> once<00:01:34.470> up<00:01:34.590> having<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
different mode so once up having the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.149 
different mode so once up having the
same<00:01:34.950> key<00:01:35.400> signatures<00:01:35.909> regular<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.900> major<00:01:37.200> but

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
same key signatures regular a major but

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.249 
same key signatures regular a major but
it's<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:39.060> actually<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.420> different<00:01:39.750> scale<00:01:39.960> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it's it's actually a different scale and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.830 
it's it's actually a different scale and
so<00:01:40.680> uh<00:01:41.030> these<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> modes<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.720> got

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so uh these are all the modes you got

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.310 
so uh these are all the modes you got
major<00:01:44.479> technically<00:01:45.479> known<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.689> Ionian

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
major technically known as Ionian

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:57.000 
major technically known as Ionian
commonly<00:01:46.740> known<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:47.009> major<00:01:47.250> then

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:19.870 

Aeolian<00:01:58.010> commonly<00:01:58.730> known<00:01:58.880> as<00:01:59.030> minor<00:02:18.880> alright

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
Aeolian commonly known as minor alright

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.660 
Aeolian commonly known as minor alright
so<00:02:20.150> um<00:02:20.650> what<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.770> might<00:02:21.950> have<00:02:22.310> noticed

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
so um what you might have noticed

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.750 
so um what you might have noticed
already<00:02:22.850> is<00:02:23.270> that<00:02:23.750> each<00:02:24.350> scale<00:02:25.040> degree<00:02:25.580> is

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
already is that each scale degree is

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.730 
already is that each scale degree is
gonna<00:02:26.120> have<00:02:26.360> its<00:02:26.510> own<00:02:26.660> chord<00:02:26.990> in<00:02:27.170> its<00:02:27.320> own<00:02:27.410> mode

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
gonna have its own chord in its own mode

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.400 
gonna have its own chord in its own mode
which<00:02:28.580> essentially<00:02:29.150> means<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.600> every<00:02:30.260> chord

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
which essentially means that every chord

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.190 
which essentially means that every chord
corresponds<00:02:33.410> with<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.530> mode<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.750> what<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:35.959> is

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
corresponds with a mode and what this is

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.920 
corresponds with a mode and what this is
is<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.530> basis<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.130> soloing<00:02:38.030> modally<00:02:38.570> what

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
is the basis of soloing modally what

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.830 
is the basis of soloing modally what
you're<00:02:39.170> gonna<00:02:39.320> do<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.910> see<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.150> chord<00:02:41.570> and

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
you're gonna do is you see a chord and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.810 
you're gonna do is you see a chord and
you<00:02:42.110> know<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.740> mode<00:02:43.040> that's<00:02:43.280> gonna<00:02:43.430> go<00:02:43.700> with

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
you know the mode that's gonna go with

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.340 
you know the mode that's gonna go with
it<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:46.300> so<00:02:47.300> for<00:02:47.540> instance<00:02:47.570> if<00:02:47.990> you're<00:02:48.110> an<00:02:48.200> A

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
it and so for instance if you're an A

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.410 
it and so for instance if you're an A
major<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.580> take<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.880> fourth<00:02:50.150> degree

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
major and you take the fourth degree

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.199 
major and you take the fourth degree
which<00:02:50.570> is<00:02:50.600> d<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.700> four-part<00:02:53.150> harmony

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
which is d and the four-part harmony

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.510 
which is d and the four-part harmony
there<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.870> D<00:02:54.350> major<00:02:54.560> 7<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.959> scale<00:02:57.260> then<00:02:58.220> to

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
there is D major 7 and the scale then to

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:11.020 
there is D major 7 and the scale then to
go<00:02:58.700> with<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.970> chord<00:02:59.330> would<00:02:59.989> be<00:03:00.050> deleting

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.340 

all<00:03:12.030> right<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.390> now<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.600> apply<00:03:13.020> this<00:03:13.080> to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350
