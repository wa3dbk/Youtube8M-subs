00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
really cool MOC I definitely think it

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.500

turned<00:03:28.349> out<00:03:28.470> good<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:29.250> actually<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.849> somewhat

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
turned out good it actually is somewhat

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.020

of<00:03:30.629> an<00:03:30.720> old<00:03:30.870> monk<00:03:31.230> but<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.590> think<00:03:32.069> I<00:03:32.280> might<00:03:33.000> be

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
of an old monk but I think I might be

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.379 
of an old monk but I think I might be
repurposing<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.139> for<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.760> world<00:03:35.760> war<00:03:35.910> two<00:03:36.150> MOC

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.190 
tutorial on how to do that jet ski I
think<00:03:41.639> it's<00:03:41.760> pretty<00:03:42.060> sighs<00:03:42.389> accurate<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:42.989> did

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
think it's pretty sighs accurate I did

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.800 
think it's pretty sighs accurate I did
that<00:03:43.349> myself<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:45.000> front<00:03:45.299> looks<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.660> little

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
that myself and the front looks a little

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.289 
that myself and the front looks a little
big<00:03:46.109> but<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.680> think<00:03:47.220> it's<00:03:47.340> pretty<00:03:47.579> accurate<00:03:47.790> so

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
big but I think it's pretty accurate so

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.680 
big but I think it's pretty accurate so
that<00:03:48.680> was<00:03:49.680> my<00:03:49.980> battlefield<00:03:50.519> 4<00:03:50.819> parcel<00:03:51.419> storm
