00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.769
 when the siren calls 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.389
 we are where we are 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.219
 we went to the disaster 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.009
 and we know that we have the concern of the people and the love of our family 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.619
 but we are confident 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.659
 each of the volunteer firemen without an angel that protects him 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.310
 we are so sorry 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.020
 many times we risk our lives we act in accidents fires of 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.480
 homes and fields 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.570

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.050
 we go the sinister trusting in the companion that we have next 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.580
 the rest is made by our protective angel 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.900
 I could see in his eyes 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.970
 all the immense humanity 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.380
 the sadness the anguish impotence of not being able to do anything 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.540
 If I had wanted it to be in my mother 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.330
 my wife my friends and all those people if they ask me 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.310
 because I do what I do and I discovered karlovic 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.399
 the reason for what it is
