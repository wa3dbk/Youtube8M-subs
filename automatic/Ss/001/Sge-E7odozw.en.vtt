I've<00:00:15.360> got<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> quick<00:00:15.990> technique<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:17.190> creating

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
I've got a quick technique for creating

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.269 
I've got a quick technique for creating
an<00:00:17.699> abstract<00:00:18.359> image<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.080> Photoshop<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.010> this

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
an abstract image in Photoshop and this

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.609 
an abstract image in Photoshop and this
is<00:00:20.430> very<00:00:20.640> easy<00:00:20.730> technique<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.410> very

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
is very easy technique and it's very

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.080 
is very easy technique and it's very
versatile<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.550> create<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.820> lot<00:00:24.029> of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
versatile you can create a lot of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.390 
versatile you can create a lot of
interesting<00:00:24.600> effects<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.800> key<00:00:26.070> for

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
interesting effects with it the key for

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.730 
interesting effects with it the key for
this<00:00:26.550> technique<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.390> start<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:28.380> an<00:00:28.560> image

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
this technique is to start with an image

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.429 
this technique is to start with an image
that<00:00:29.519> has<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.789> lot<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.269> interesting<00:00:30.750> color<00:00:31.109> and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
that has a lot of interesting color and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.889 
that has a lot of interesting color and
texture<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.329> great<00:00:33.540> part<00:00:33.750> about

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
texture to it and the great part about

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.200 
texture to it and the great part about
this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.219> doesn't<00:00:35.399> really<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
this is that it doesn't really have to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.750 
this is that it doesn't really have to
be<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.450> fantastic<00:00:37.290> image<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.920> could<00:00:38.520> be

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
be a fantastic image it could be

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.240 
be a fantastic image it could be
something<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> took<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.050> phone

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
something you took with your phone

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.650 
something you took with your phone
anytime<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.850> an<00:00:42.000> interesting<00:00:42.210> shot

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
anytime that you see an interesting shot

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.930 
anytime that you see an interesting shot
with<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> lot<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.230> vibrant<00:00:43.680> color<00:00:43.920> grab<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
with a lot of vibrant color grab the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
with a lot of vibrant color grab the
shot<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.960> use<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
shot and you can use it in this

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.619 
shot and you can use it in this
technique<00:00:47.070> what<00:00:47.730> I'm<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> begin

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
technique what I'm going to do is begin

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.170 
technique what I'm going to do is begin
by<00:00:49.289> duplicating<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.309> background<00:00:50.730> layer<00:00:50.910> with

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
by duplicating the background layer with

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.889 
by duplicating the background layer with
ctrl<00:00:52.110> or<00:00:52.350> command<00:00:52.379> J<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:54.390> I'm<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
ctrl or command J and then I'm going to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.220 
ctrl or command J and then I'm going to
immediately<00:00:55.500> run<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.329> Gaussian<00:00:57.329> blur<00:00:57.570> filter

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
immediately run a Gaussian blur filter

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.950 
immediately run a Gaussian blur filter
by<00:00:58.649> choosing<00:00:58.859> filter<00:00:59.309> blur<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.960> then

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
by choosing filter blur and then

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.920 
by choosing filter blur and then
Gaussian<00:01:01.230> blur<00:01:02.120> I'm<00:01:03.120> going<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> blur<00:01:03.629> this

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
Gaussian blur I'm going to blur this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.789 
Gaussian blur I'm going to blur this
quite<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> bit<00:01:05.060> about<00:01:06.060> 75<00:01:06.810> pixels<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.560> case

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
quite a bit about 75 pixels in this case

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.100 
quite a bit about 75 pixels in this case
just<00:01:08.100> enough<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.700> keep<00:01:08.880> all<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.630> patches<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
just enough to keep all the patches of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.880 
just enough to keep all the patches of
color<00:01:10.320> intact<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.720> blur<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.740> it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
color intact but to blur it so that it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.820 
color intact but to blur it so that it
doesn't<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.630> reveal<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.799> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
doesn't really reveal what this is a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.510 
doesn't really reveal what this is a
photo<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.750> I'll<00:01:18.750> click<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.200> OK<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.400> I'm

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
photo of I'll click on OK and then I'm

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.700 
photo of I'll click on OK and then I'm
going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.729> duplicate<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.659> blurred<00:01:22.409> layer

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
going to duplicate this blurred layer

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.370 
going to duplicate this blurred layer
one<00:01:23.009> more<00:01:23.220> time<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.850> ctrl<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.360> command<00:01:24.390> J<00:01:25.110> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
one more time with ctrl or command J and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.200 
one more time with ctrl or command J and
I'm<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.100> turn<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.490> top<00:01:26.759> layer<00:01:26.970> off

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
I'm going to turn that top layer off

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.569 
I'm going to turn that top layer off
I'll<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.680> my<00:01:28.829> original<00:01:28.979> blurred

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
I'll go back to my original blurred

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.550 
I'll go back to my original blurred
layer<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.930> layer<00:01:31.110> we'll<00:01:31.320> start

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
layer and this is the layer we'll start

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.460 
layer and this is the layer we'll start
working<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:32.119> what<00:01:33.119> we'll<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.780> we'll<00:01:33.960> simply

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
working on what we'll do is we'll simply

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.600 
working on what we'll do is we'll simply
begin<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.610> manipulate<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.840> layer<00:01:37.610> by

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
begin to manipulate this layer by

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.969 
begin to manipulate this layer by
choosing<00:01:38.909> free<00:01:39.630> transform<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.860> get

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
choosing free transform and we can get

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.980 
choosing free transform and we can get
to<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.189> by<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> Edit<00:01:41.909> menu<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.329> then

this<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> grid<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.500> handles

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
this we have a grid and we have handles

this we have a grid and we have handles
and<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.790> drag<00:02:03.030> these<00:02:03.180> handles<00:02:03.600> around<00:02:03.899> to

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
and we can drag these handles around to

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.399 
and we can drag these handles around to
manipulate<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.399> image<00:02:05.899> what<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.930> want<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.259> do

interesting abstract looks here I think

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.940 
interesting abstract looks here I think
that's<00:02:28.689> good<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.200> I'm<00:02:29.290> going<00:02:29.469> to<00:02:29.530> click<00:02:29.799> on

that by clicking the check mark here now
we've<00:03:08.900> got<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.230> two<00:03:09.440> layers<00:03:09.740> with<00:03:10.400> distinctly

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
we've got the two layers with distinctly

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.690 
we've got the two layers with distinctly
different<00:03:11.240> patterns<00:03:12.100> we<00:03:13.100> can<00:03:13.130> start<00:03:13.490> mixing

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
different patterns we can start mixing

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.000 
different patterns we can start mixing
them<00:03:14.030> together<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:15.410> do<00:03:15.530> that<00:03:15.710> we'll

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
them together and to do that we'll

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.530 
them together and to do that we'll
choose<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.430> layer<00:03:16.640> blending<00:03:16.850> modes<00:03:17.300> from

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
choose the layer blending modes from

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.260 
choose the layer blending modes from
here<00:03:17.780> in<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.020> layers<00:03:18.230> panel<00:03:18.760> there<00:03:19.760> are<00:03:19.790> many

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
here in the layers panel there are many

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.480 
here in the layers panel there are many
and<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.540> can<00:03:20.570> try<00:03:20.900> them<00:03:21.110> all<00:03:21.290> but<00:03:22.010> some<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.430> the

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
and you can try them all but some of the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.110 
and you can try them all but some of the
more<00:03:22.670> interesting<00:03:22.910> ones<00:03:23.150> are<00:03:23.690> overlay<00:03:24.320> and

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
more interesting ones are overlay and

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.700 
more interesting ones are overlay and
soft<00:03:26.120> light<00:03:28.630> it's<00:03:29.630> fun<00:03:29.960> to<00:03:30.140> cycle<00:03:30.500> through

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
soft light it's fun to cycle through

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.410 
soft light it's fun to cycle through
these<00:03:30.860> different<00:03:31.130> modes<00:03:31.490> to<00:03:31.730> see<00:03:32.000> how<00:03:32.240> they

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
these different modes to see how they

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.820 
these different modes to see how they
look<00:03:34.030> let's<00:03:35.030> try<00:03:35.240> another<00:03:35.450> technique<00:03:35.830> I'll

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
look let's try another technique I'll

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.110 
look let's try another technique I'll
make<00:03:37.100> another<00:03:37.340> copy<00:03:37.670> of<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:38.000> background

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
make another copy of the background

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.640 
make another copy of the background
layer<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:39.130> move<00:03:40.130> that<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.640> top<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:41.650> then

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
layer and move that to the top and then

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.710 
layer and move that to the top and then
we'll<00:03:42.800> go<00:03:42.920> ahead<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.400> blur<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.360> one<00:03:44.570> the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
we'll go ahead and blur this one the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.980 
we'll go ahead and blur this one the
same<00:03:44.960> way<00:03:45.730> now<00:03:46.730> we'll<00:03:46.970> enter<00:03:47.150> free<00:03:47.450> transform

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
same way now we'll enter free transform

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.790 
same way now we'll enter free transform
and<00:03:48.790> once<00:03:49.790> again<00:03:49.940> choose<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.510> warp<00:03:50.750> mode

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
and once again choose the warp mode

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.130 
and once again choose the warp mode
but<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:53.820> time<00:03:54.060> we'll<00:03:54.270> warp<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.720> little<00:03:55.020> bit

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
but this time we'll warp a little bit

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.170 
but this time we'll warp a little bit
differently<00:03:55.530> I'm<00:03:56.040> going<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.370> take<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.700> corner

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
differently I'm going to take the corner

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.050 
differently I'm going to take the corner
and<00:03:57.360> bend<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.410> inward<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.160> stretch<00:03:59.580> it<00:03:59.760> out<00:03:59.880> of

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
and bend it inward and stretch it out of

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.450 
and bend it inward and stretch it out of
shape<00:04:00.330> I'll<00:04:01.200> take<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.620> other<00:04:01.830> corner<00:04:02.160> and

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
shape I'll take the other corner and

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.590 
shape I'll take the other corner and
bend<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.150> over<00:04:03.270> as<00:04:03.600> well<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.820> in<00:04:05.820> doing<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:06.150> we

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
bend it over as well and in doing so we

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.900 
bend it over as well and in doing so we
can<00:04:06.780> create<00:04:07.080> some<00:04:07.710> unusual<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.610> once<00:04:08.760> again

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
can create some unusual and once again

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.990 
can create some unusual and once again
abstract<00:04:09.690> shapes<00:04:10.080> and<00:04:10.470> we<00:04:11.340> can<00:04:11.490> let<00:04:11.640> this<00:04:11.760> go

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
abstract shapes and we can let this go

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.890 
abstract shapes and we can let this go
wherever<00:04:12.300> our<00:04:12.690> imagination<00:04:13.500> leads<00:04:13.770> us<00:04:14.720> we<00:04:15.720> can

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
wherever our imagination leads us we can

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.979 
wherever our imagination leads us we can
commit<00:04:16.230> this<00:04:16.380> transform<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.370> once<00:04:18.299> again<00:04:18.450> we

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
commit this transform and once again we

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.470 
commit this transform and once again we
can<00:04:19.170> choose<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.470> blending<00:04:20.160> mode<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.700> in<00:04:21.390> this

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
can choose a blending mode and in this

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.140 
can choose a blending mode and in this
case<00:04:21.720> we'll<00:04:21.930> choose<00:04:22.110> soft<00:04:22.440> light<00:04:22.820> we<00:04:23.820> can<00:04:24.000> move

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
case we'll choose soft light we can move

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.670 
case we'll choose soft light we can move
this<00:04:24.360> around<00:04:24.890> we<00:04:25.890> can<00:04:26.070> distort<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.610> further

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
this around we can distort it further

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.130 
this around we can distort it further
and<00:04:28.790> we<00:04:29.790> can<00:04:29.940> do<00:04:30.060> pretty<00:04:30.270> much<00:04:30.390> whatever<00:04:30.750> we

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
and we can do pretty much whatever we

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.230 
and we can do pretty much whatever we
like<00:04:31.350> with<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:32.790> great<00:04:33.000> thing<00:04:33.180> about

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
like with it the great thing about

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.450 
like with it the great thing about
working<00:04:33.540> with<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.900> layers<00:04:34.200> here<00:04:34.530> is<00:04:34.740> that<00:04:35.370> we

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
working with the layers here is that we

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.510 
working with the layers here is that we
can<00:04:35.640> go<00:04:35.790> back<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.890> if<00:04:37.890> we<00:04:38.010> don't<00:04:38.190> like<00:04:38.340> what

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
can go back and if we don't like what

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.460 
can go back and if we don't like what
we're<00:04:38.670> doing<00:04:38.700> we<00:04:39.240> can<00:04:39.390> simply<00:04:39.780> replace<00:04:40.110> one

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
we're doing we can simply replace one

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.800 
we're doing we can simply replace one
layer<00:04:40.680> with<00:04:40.890> a<00:04:40.920> new<00:04:41.160> one<00:04:41.330> so<00:04:42.330> here<00:04:42.540> we'll<00:04:42.690> go

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
layer with a new one so here we'll go

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.700 
layer with a new one so here we'll go
back<00:04:43.050> into<00:04:44.000> free<00:04:45.000> transform<00:04:45.630> and<00:04:45.930> try

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
back into free transform and try

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.110 
back into free transform and try
something<00:04:47.130> maybe<00:04:47.250> just<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.730> little<00:04:47.760> bit

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
something maybe just a little bit

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.180 
something maybe just a little bit
different<00:04:48.630> once<00:04:49.110> again<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.650> sky's<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:49.950> limit

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
different once again the sky's the limit

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.610 
different once again the sky's the limit
here<00:04:50.790> you<00:04:51.060> have<00:04:51.270> all<00:04:51.540> these<00:04:51.810> handles<00:04:52.320> all

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
here you have all these handles all

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.140 
here you have all these handles all
these<00:04:52.860> controls<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:54.840> can<00:04:55.020> create

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
these controls and you can create

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.570 
these controls and you can create
virtually<00:04:57.150> any<00:04:57.390> kind<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.870> shape<00:04:58.140> imaginable

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
virtually any kind of shape imaginable

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.840 
virtually any kind of shape imaginable
I'll<00:04:59.580> just<00:04:59.910> drag<00:05:00.150> these<00:05:00.360> around<00:05:00.660> like<00:05:00.930> so<00:05:01.260> and

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
I'll just drag these around like so and

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.420 
I'll just drag these around like so and
we'll<00:05:02.850> commit<00:05:03.180> that<00:05:03.390> and<00:05:03.660> see<00:05:03.900> how<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.230> looks

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
we'll commit that and see how it looks

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.920 
we'll commit that and see how it looks
let's<00:05:05.430> go<00:05:05.640> ahead<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:06.150> try<00:05:06.480> some<00:05:06.510> different

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
let's go ahead and try some different

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.330 
let's go ahead and try some different
blending<00:05:07.500> modes<00:05:08.540> there's<00:05:09.540> lighten<00:05:11.060> screen

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
blending modes there's lighten screen

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.040 
blending modes there's lighten screen
color<00:05:14.340> dodge<00:05:16.160> linear<00:05:17.160> dodge<00:05:17.660> lighter<00:05:18.660> color

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
color dodge linear dodge lighter color

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.390 
color dodge linear dodge lighter color
and<00:05:19.290> so<00:05:19.980> on<00:05:20.160> I<00:05:20.460> kind<00:05:21.270> of<00:05:21.360> like<00:05:21.570> overlay<00:05:22.400> again

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
and so on I kind of like overlay again

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.460 
and so on I kind of like overlay again
we<00:05:23.550> could<00:05:23.730> continue<00:05:24.090> adding<00:05:24.600> more<00:05:24.780> layers<00:05:25.050> and

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
we could continue adding more layers and

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.620 
we could continue adding more layers and
blending<00:05:25.890> them<00:05:25.980> together<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.640> even<00:05:27.419> add

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
blending them together and even add

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.610 
blending them together and even add
additional<00:05:28.350> layers<00:05:28.560> from<00:05:28.830> other<00:05:29.130> images<00:05:30.620> one

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
additional layers from other images one

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.200 
additional layers from other images one
additional<00:05:32.040> interesting<00:05:32.490> technique<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.030> can

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
additional interesting technique you can

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.210 
additional interesting technique you can
try<00:05:33.419> if<00:05:33.690> you<00:05:33.810> have<00:05:34.080> a<00:05:34.350> subscription<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:35.040> the

shapes now you don't have to be an
expert<00:05:41.490> in<00:05:41.550> 3d<00:05:41.880> to<00:05:42.330> do<00:05:42.480> this<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:42.990> I'll<00:05:43.110> show

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
expert in 3d to do this and I'll show

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.030 
expert in 3d to do this and I'll show
you<00:05:43.320> how<00:05:43.590> it's<00:05:43.770> done

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
you how it's done

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.700 
you how it's done
first<00:05:45.030> what<00:05:45.210> I'll<00:05:45.300> do<00:05:45.480> is<00:05:45.720> I'll<00:05:45.930> create<00:05:46.169> a<00:05:46.260> copy

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
first what I'll do is I'll create a copy

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.909 
first what I'll do is I'll create a copy
of<00:05:47.070> this<00:05:47.970> entire<00:05:48.360> image<00:05:48.630> on<00:05:49.110> its<00:05:49.260> own<00:05:49.380> layer<00:05:49.560> by

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
of this entire image on its own layer by

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.659 
of this entire image on its own layer by

option shift e on the Mac
this<00:05:58.090> creates<00:05:58.479> a<00:05:58.720> new<00:05:58.930> layer<00:05:58.960> at<00:05:59.319> the<00:05:59.349> top<00:05:59.440> of

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
this creates a new layer at the top of

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.640 
this creates a new layer at the top of
the<00:05:59.889> stack<00:06:00.160> with<00:06:01.150> all<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:01.870> contents<00:06:02.440> that<00:06:02.500> are

visible on that layer now we'll choose

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.399 
visible on that layer now we'll choose
from<00:06:05.379> the<00:06:05.470> 3d<00:06:05.800> menu<00:06:05.979> and<00:06:06.659> we'll<00:06:07.659> pick<00:06:07.840> new<00:06:08.229> mesh

workspace<00:06:25.419> will<00:06:25.750> help<00:06:25.900> us<00:06:26.020> out<00:06:26.819> so<00:06:27.819> here's<00:06:28.060> the

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
workspace will help us out so here's the

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.939

sphere and with the move tool selected

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.839 
sphere and with the move tool selected
we<00:06:30.430> can<00:06:30.580> see<00:06:30.759> that<00:06:30.909> we<00:06:31.030> can<00:06:31.180> move<00:06:31.300> it<00:06:31.449> around

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
but what we're going to want to do is to

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.809 
but what we're going to want to do is to
notice<00:06:38.379> that<00:06:38.409> we<00:06:38.740> have<00:06:38.889> a<00:06:38.919> light<00:06:39.189> here<00:06:39.550> that's

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:39.819 
notice that we have a light here that's

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:42.149 
notice that we have a light here that's
creating<00:06:40.270> a<00:06:40.360> shadow<00:06:40.629> and<00:06:41.110> we<00:06:41.619> may<00:06:41.770> not<00:06:41.919> want

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:42.159 
creating a shadow and we may not want

that<00:06:42.399> shadow<00:06:42.789> on<00:06:43.059> the<00:06:43.209> image<00:06:43.539> and<00:06:43.809> if<00:06:44.379> we<00:06:44.499> don't

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:44.679 
that shadow on the image and if we don't

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:46.409 
that shadow on the image and if we don't
we<00:06:44.949> can<00:06:45.099> just<00:06:45.279> make<00:06:45.459> sure<00:06:45.639> that<00:06:45.909> we've<00:06:46.089> chosen

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:49.929 
our 3d layer we can go to the 3d panel

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:54.239 
our 3d layer we can go to the 3d panel
and<00:06:50.349> choose<00:06:51.159> that<00:06:51.189> light<00:06:51.849> and<00:06:52.919> then<00:06:53.919> here<00:06:54.159> in

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:54.249 
and choose that light and then here in

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:56.760 
and choose that light and then here in
the<00:06:54.339> properties<00:06:54.819> panel<00:06:55.229> we<00:06:56.229> can<00:06:56.259> deselect
