Miguel Cotto at the WBC 160-pound title
but<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:40.010> fight<00:05:40.220> will<00:05:40.400> probably<00:05:40.669> take<00:05:40.820> place

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
but the fight will probably take place

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.190 
but the fight will probably take place
at<00:05:41.410> 154<00:05:42.410> because<00:05:42.830> um<00:05:43.630> Freddie<00:05:44.630> Roach<00:05:44.900> is

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
at 154 because um Freddie Roach is

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.380 
at 154 because um Freddie Roach is
probably<00:05:46.160> thinking<00:05:46.400> Miguel<00:05:46.910> probably

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
probably thinking Miguel probably

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.140
