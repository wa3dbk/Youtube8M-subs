00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
have volumes that's a little trick for

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.480 
have volumes that's a little trick for
you<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.319> difference

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.390 

and<00:03:54.580> here's<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.750> final<00:03:56.050> result<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.830> my<00:03:57.130> hair

totally straight and it's been about an

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.250 
totally straight and it's been about an
hour<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.610> a<00:04:00.670> half<00:04:00.790> now<00:04:00.820> so<00:04:01.810> that's<00:04:01.960> how<00:04:02.080> long

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
hour and a half now so that's how long

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.310 
hour and a half now so that's how long
it<00:04:02.410> took<00:04:02.560> but<00:04:02.800> you<00:04:03.070> can<00:04:03.220> see<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.430> have<00:04:03.700> a<00:04:04.290> lot<00:04:05.290> of
