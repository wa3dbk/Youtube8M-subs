00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
distracted by a lot of other things in

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.580 
distracted by a lot of other things in
life<00:05:28.710> like<00:05:29.100> schooling<00:05:30.090> um<00:05:30.360> trying<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:31.260> find<00:05:31.500> a

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
life like schooling um trying to find a

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.940 
life like schooling um trying to find a
job<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:32.280> just<00:05:32.669> in<00:05:32.910> general<00:05:33.440> trying<00:05:34.440> to<00:05:34.740> focus

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
job and just in general trying to focus

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.670 
job and just in general trying to focus
solving<00:05:35.910> some<00:05:36.090> of<00:05:36.210> his<00:05:36.360> problems<00:05:36.930> in<00:05:37.139> life<00:05:37.349> and

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
solving some of his problems in life and

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.710 
solving some of his problems in life and
just<00:05:37.889> try<00:05:38.190> and<00:05:38.250> enjoy<00:05:38.460> it<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:39.000> best<00:05:39.210> he<00:05:39.419> can

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
just try and enjoy it the best he can

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.640 
just try and enjoy it the best he can
now<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:40.889> think<00:05:40.950> I<00:05:41.610> should<00:05:41.639> have<00:05:42.180> left<00:05:42.510> him<00:05:43.020> to

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
now I think I should have left him to

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.890 
now I think I should have left him to
make<00:05:43.830> a<00:05:43.860> video<00:05:44.130> about<00:05:44.340> what<00:05:45.060> happened<00:05:45.660> to<00:05:45.780> his

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
make a video about what happened to his

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.529 
make a video about what happened to his
channel<00:05:46.260> but<00:05:46.680> I<00:05:46.919> figured<00:05:47.729> that<00:05:47.820> since<00:05:48.240> he

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
channel but I figured that since he

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.420 
channel but I figured that since he
doesn't<00:05:48.750> have<00:05:48.900> a<00:05:49.050> microphone<00:05:49.470> for<00:05:50.280> his

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
doesn't have a microphone for his

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.850 
doesn't have a microphone for his
computer<00:05:50.910> anyway<00:05:51.300> and<00:05:51.690> he<00:05:51.780> probably<00:05:52.020> won't<00:05:52.590> be

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
computer anyway and he probably won't be

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.980 
computer anyway and he probably won't be
getting<00:05:53.190> one<00:05:53.220> anytime<00:05:53.669> soon<00:05:54.180> as<00:05:54.419> much<00:05:54.690> as<00:05:54.840> he

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
getting one anytime soon as much as he

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.409 
getting one anytime soon as much as he
says<00:05:55.260> that<00:05:55.440> he<00:05:55.680> himself<00:05:56.400> would<00:05:56.639> love<00:05:57.000> to<00:05:57.240> do

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
says that he himself would love to do

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.650 
says that he himself would love to do
video<00:05:58.410> game<00:05:58.650> commentaries<00:05:59.430> because<00:05:59.789> he<00:06:00.419> also

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
video game commentaries because he also

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.870 
video game commentaries because he also
watches<00:06:01.229> some<00:06:01.440> video<00:06:01.650> game<00:06:01.919> commentators

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
watches some video game commentators

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.839

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
happy Thanksgiving and my next video I'm

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.420 
happy Thanksgiving and my next video I'm
not<00:06:40.800> sure<00:06:41.070> when<00:06:41.219> I'm

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
not sure when I'm

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.129 
not sure when I'm
for<00:06:41.699> my<00:06:41.759> next<00:06:41.940> video<00:06:42.180> I<00:06:42.330> think<00:06:42.389> it<00:06:42.750> might<00:06:42.960> be

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
for my next video I think it might be

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.340 
for my next video I think it might be
that<00:06:43.290> primal<00:06:43.860> prey<00:06:44.360> playthrough<00:06:45.360> I<00:06:45.660> talked

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
that primal prey playthrough I talked

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.469 
that primal prey playthrough I talked
about<00:06:46.470> a<00:06:46.650> while<00:06:46.919> back<00:06:46.949> or<00:06:47.759> something

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
about a while back or something

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.390 
about a while back or something
completely<00:06:48.660> random<00:06:49.020> I'm<00:06:49.320> not<00:06:49.530> too<00:06:49.740> sure<00:06:50.039> but<00:06:50.250> I

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
completely random I'm not too sure but I

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.310 
completely random I'm not too sure but I
can<00:06:50.550> almost<00:06:50.669> guarantee<00:06:51.030> the<00:06:51.600> primal<00:06:52.050> prey

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
can almost guarantee the primal prey

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.830 
can almost guarantee the primal prey
