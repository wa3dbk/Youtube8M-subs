00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:20.459 
very loose and this I love because it

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:22.790 
very loose and this I love because it
looks<00:06:20.879> polished<00:06:21.209> and<00:06:21.689> kind<00:06:21.959> of<00:06:22.080> bohemian

then I don't bring it all the way to the
bottom<00:06:32.459> because<00:06:32.580> we're<00:06:32.789> gonna<00:06:32.879> loosen<00:06:33.240> it<00:06:33.360> up
