register<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> face<00:01:08.630> person<00:01:09.630> simply<00:01:09.810> stands

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
register a face person simply stands

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.930 
register a face person simply stands
right<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.680> front<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:11.159> those<00:01:11.430> cameras

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
right in front of all those cameras

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.289 
right in front of all those cameras
while<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> robot<00:01:12.990> takes<00:01:13.290> digital<00:01:13.740> photos

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
while the robot takes digital photos

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.810 
while the robot takes digital photos
capturing<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> series<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> facial<00:01:16.770> images<00:01:17.010> now

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
capturing a series of facial images now

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.609 
capturing a series of facial images now
these<00:01:18.000> images<00:01:18.540> are<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:18.810> programmed<00:01:19.350> into

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
these images are then programmed into

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.950 
these images are then programmed into
Massimo's<00:01:20.280> database<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.060> linked<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
Massimo's database and linked to the

so the next time awesome oh sees me it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.550 
so the next time awesome oh sees me it
compares<00:01:25.909> my<00:01:26.149> patient<00:01:26.689> tomography<00:01:27.020> the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
compares my patient tomography the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.679 
compares my patient tomography the
images<00:01:28.040> stored<00:01:28.280> his<00:01:28.399> memory<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.509> can

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
images stored his memory and it can

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.240 
images stored his memory and it can
recognize<00:01:30.200> them<00:01:30.549> okay<00:01:31.960> awesome

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
recognize them okay awesome

recognize them okay awesome
my<00:01:34.400> family<00:01:34.760> is<00:01:34.880> hope<00:01:35.060> just<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.300> little<00:01:35.540> bit

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
my family is hope just a little bit

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.840 
my family is hope just a little bit
later<00:01:35.810> possible<00:01:36.590> memorize<00:01:37.070> their<00:01:37.310> faces<00:01:37.730> as

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
later possible memorize their faces as

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.230 
later possible memorize their faces as
well

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.480 

they<00:01:40.659> see<00:01:40.720> also<00:01:41.259> those<00:01:41.409> ability<00:01:41.799> to<00:01:41.979> walk<00:01:42.189> and

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
they see also those ability to walk and

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.550 
they see also those ability to walk and
maintain<00:01:42.939> balance<00:01:43.450> even<00:01:43.840> while<00:01:44.229> changing

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
maintain balance even while changing

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.310 
maintain balance even while changing
direction<00:01:44.890> is<00:01:45.640> called<00:01:46.030> prediction<00:01:46.720> movement

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
direction is called prediction movement

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.260 
direction is called prediction movement
control<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.460> see<00:01:48.670> when<00:01:48.850> out<00:01:48.970> getting<00:01:49.240> these

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
control you see when out getting these

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.109 
control you see when out getting these
types<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:49.780> turns<00:01:50.080> possible<00:01:50.979> plans<00:01:51.430> its<00:01:51.820> next

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
types of turns possible plans its next

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.899 
types of turns possible plans its next
move<00:01:52.270> they<00:01:52.899> almost<00:01:53.049> like<00:01:53.320> thinking<00:01:53.619> ahead

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
move they almost like thinking ahead

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.490 
move they almost like thinking ahead
immediately<00:01:54.909> adjust<00:01:55.450> its<00:01:55.780> balance<00:01:56.259> for<00:01:56.470> a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
immediately adjust its balance for a

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.590 
immediately adjust its balance for a
smooth<00:01:56.830> change<00:01:57.189> of<00:01:57.340> direction<00:01:57.460> all<00:01:58.360> without
