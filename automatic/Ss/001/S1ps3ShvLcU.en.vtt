00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.989
 the eyes 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:19.110
 Bible speaks guys who're saying that 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.529
 Pee pee br and it transcends ivory 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.840
 clay commented on by carla rodeiro goals 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.050
 this time the continuation of our series 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.739
 of the queens troicki with all the weapons and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.559
 street is the vector of all when 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.300
 they without the red dot really the most 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.220
 of people problems often use it 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 with red dot is I was using it with the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.140
 grip and the buccal brake is for me was the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.160
 The best combination is that I got it. 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.980
 I found myself using red dot but I 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.400
 never saw need to use red dot there 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.320
 I had a gun with 11s off the ground and 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.020
 I started playing with her and I went well and 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.239
 I ended up creating a class and gave this 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.119
 class that I ended up getting the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.130
 Who are you? Where do you know I am? 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.830
 Arriving there condominium is coming in 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.720
 Sunday leaving the front is this map 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.090
 lÃ©o is a map that will probably have 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.600
 more who in this series is the map with 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.690
 But you like to play it there and the tracks 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.070
 where but mostly this is the bridge 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.409
 many two are the ones I like best 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.420
 play this way 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.180
 fink my strategy on this map from there 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.280
 was to stay kind on top of that house from there 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.670
 that you can hear enough face already 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.770
 You know where you're always coming from. 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.930
 let it stay banners and ways and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.720
 will lead not wanted to be relaxing 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.060
 right there on the bottom of the flag or there 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.880
 on the right there behind that one on that 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.549
 white house alexandra is not good to stay 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.850
 in relation to this small place is where 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.670
 then the enemies are the flag like that and 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.770
 they ended up reborn there x time that 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.299
 the face was beautiful, right you saw 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.310
 I did not see it either 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.320
 but I almost die and then demand 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.729
 I'm going down the stairs and I will see and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.319
 But I almost died for him to leave. 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.529
 practically the same class as 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.790
 I was always using it and it's using 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:19.799
 the main pecs are pomegranate 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.140
 pistols business were not nothing is in 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:27.569
 main species I was using 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:32.549
 prepared marathon lightweight is stable o 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.889
 Dead silence and only this one. 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.500
 I do not think there's any more of a kind 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.790
 anteater stiller and related describes 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.609
 space the bonuses 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.859
 I was using it in music, and that one 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:47.250
 There comes a birth meeting here. 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:49.019
 symbol of the data that he was now 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.419
 the flag if then arrived me 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.879
 relating well in that area back there 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:03:00.599
 and does not have a very physical space is ours 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:03.299
 has 11 fixed and related on that side there 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.519
 or from that other side there then yes 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.230
 that was a lot of luck since he had three 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.480
 faces are not lacking also attacked 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.609
 a grenade when he was able to escape 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.129
 That I turned red as hell in that 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.230
 time and I was just watching Miranda there not to 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.230
 die score and get alive does not 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.949
 know how his immense luck that 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.569
 Time is the crowd practically includes this 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.699
 There is not much to talk about. 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.159
 I hope you have it, it's not 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.440
 did not like this series in this 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.840
 video and other videos then gives a 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.510
 force and with that one that favorite 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.540
 to help in the diffusion, I do not know how many 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.299
 already there it is almost near the can and one 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.310
 face is like ballistics and closes is very 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.930
 well you 're playing like this and do not 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.879
 put up with a schiphol bullet when I 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.590
 it was in the style I think I do not know 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.870
 I was not playing at stopping and I was not 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.060
 was also playing partly because of 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.939
 one person only in two 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.459
 is a very compact and full game without the 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.470
 sport such name because not why I 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.629
 I do not like it until I get easy to get the can 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.000
 but business you will play the other 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.759
 time everything comes out of the game inclusive 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.220
 It takes too long for you to find a match. 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:16.919
 Decent that you can stay until the end 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.539
 If nobody leaves the match then play 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.430
 but still an appliance with a two 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.310
 Just people to talk and such. 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.400
 Being alone is boring in this 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.169
 It's also a game I almost die for. 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.550
 those who do not know when you're with a 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:35.710
 ballistic vechi and someone is with 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.240
 cnj is the yearning fmj but that one 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.850
 little bonfire 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.890
 is the balance that china does not work a 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.930
 thing that I did not know then all the time 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.240
 I was dying to fish in human sight 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.950
 very fast I realized that yes it is 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.110
 when I caught carpex and not when 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.480
 hit the last guy there I thought 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.860
 Who I was there is already a 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.570
 desperate that she was not finding 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.600
 No one I did not like when he stayed 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.330
 with flags and I prefer that he school 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.340
 rich in this house and 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.110
 always used this side that all the time 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.350
 I was leaving to get the 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.970
 attack who is not that galera liked the 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.400
 video, do not forget to leave that 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.110
 that the favorite to help in the dissemination 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.900
 being enrolled in the channel sign up for 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.740
 some place has some place pre-registered 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:24.510
 sign up and see the next video galera 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.510
 I do not go
