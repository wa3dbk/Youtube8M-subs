00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello this video will be 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.089
 fairly short just wanted to 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.189
 look like a separate dive video 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.740
 sony xperia z1 compact smartphone 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.960
 and at the same time buy watches sony smartwatch 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.560
 sw2 smartphones sony xperia z1 compact 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.600
 protection at level 55 and 58 that is it 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.820
 dive to a depth of one and a half meters 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.310
 being there for an hour if i 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.529
 I remember correctly with sony smartwatch sw2 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.930
 this and the writer i.e. depth to meter 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.429
 and the time spent under water until half an hour 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.590
 but do not forget that the sea 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.040
 water this device still does not 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.600
 teeth 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.250
 but accordingly the main direction 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.899
 applying protection in these devices and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.219
 this is the use of these devices under 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.989
 rain or for example when finding 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.120
 bathroom, however, do not tighten 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.079
 I will actually z1 compact 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 goes to the water and there is a stub 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.809
 closed send sony smartwatch 2 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.010
 sw2 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.010
 Well, respectively, test call 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.930
 here's a challenge passes answer and 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.000
 generally use touch 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.550
 underwater display on xperia z1 compact 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.540
 It will not work on the clock, too, on the buttons 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.950
 the clock does not respond well, and probably at the same time 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.510
 worth seeing as a parade like 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.780
 sony xperia z1 compact 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.340
 can work with a wet screen now 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.070
 their early seems enough to me 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.870
 wet from unlocking scrolling 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.760
 There is enough screen for you 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:39.790
 Well, I think it will be better seen 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.350
 droplets that he's wet no you 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.619
 extra reactions to drops 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.690
 No, I need to open my browser 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.460
 accordingly, too, wet, too, wet 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.460
 you can still not wet them a little and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.970
 see here scrolling page in 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.150
 principle is quite doable even when 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.830
 Now there is a wet finger in hours 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.910
 this is a little worse but 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.310
 principle of reaction to get them 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:11.019
 some kind can be appropriate for 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.030
 comparison tried with a wet finger 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.090
 do something on samsung galaxy display 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:22.480
 laptop 3 here we call the chrome browser and 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:25.330
 try to look through Yandex or close 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.030
 at least some window in principle 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.500
 of course the sheet and that is if the fingers 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.260
 wet but not too wet then somehow 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.690
 to use the display even as everything is already there 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.310
 went to the buttons under the screen too 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.549
 don't want to react to a wet finger 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.620
 so in this respect sony xperia z1 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.670
 compact looks more interesting 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.650
 than other devices 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.590
 Well, that 's so small happened 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.769
 Thank you for your attention video 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.769
 look
