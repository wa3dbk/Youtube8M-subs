00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:13.559
 this is a sony portable radio 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:17.090
 He is a very well well-compacted model. 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:23.609
 a nice stereo sound 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:26.990
 it uses two AAA batteries to recommend aa 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.390
 buy rechargeable batteries 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:37.230
 while the ones are loading us in Tony 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:40.399
 osanah on top stay normal here on 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.399
 right lateral 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:01:08.420
 and tunes to fm, and synchronization is 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:26.390
 it's logic that 's nice player 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:29.750
 his situation here on the back of it 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.710
 ends up having the light loudspeakers with the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.440
 order his minister to buffer more 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.619
 people hear even more high-pitched sounds 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.650
 has not got a very strong beat it's not 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:48.430
 a good jbl sound so the bigger ones 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.550
 but if you are thinking about accounting 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.570
 a fine thing to put 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:00.550
 to keep listening to the radio for good 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.550
 when the battery lasts about 20 hours 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:13.880
 I try to leave my home and vote 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.430
 He picks up the sound input here. 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:23.180
 of your iphone mobile 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:29.250
 anything that's got to where 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:34.120
 also a reasonable volume 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:38.290
 If you increase too much, you 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:42.750
 high-pitched shades but only sold on the 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.750
 average of $ 30 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.920
 maybe there's something better than trying 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:53.230
 new ones but this one was because 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.500
 It worked for me. I think it's cool if you're in 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.060
 traveling the United States will 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.799
 buy a little sound is like a 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.379
 portable radio 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.290
 This one is super cool, but I do not know 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.650
 forget to buy by law carried 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.700
 because if you listen directly to the sound 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.640
 high 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.640
 The island is going, that's it, it's okay
