00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.530
 I'm nina vollmer and I am the 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.530
 founder and designer and sophie 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.110
 The idea for really actually came 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.939
 when I was three or four years old 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.789
 self-employed as a designer 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.800
 and bought me my first macbook pro 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.000
 have and, well when I this network 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.009
 I had to buy one, too 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.369
 packaging for something nice 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.869
 which suits me and at the time so 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.100
 I 've been searching really long 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.839
 Nothing found me anything 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.519
 I should have fallen in the way I had to 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.420
 the time I just was flexible 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.519
 a lot on the way 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.920
 I worked from home at the 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.269
 I have traveled a lot and myself 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.890
 would say that that's how it is 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.690
 first moment was where I thought 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.930
 I have to have my own laptop bag 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.129
 make and get the idea there 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.239
 out keep the brand right 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.799
 create talking and look for names 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.150
 and well that takes a while 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.949
 It's the right name for you 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.559
 Finds what the product fits and what 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.269
 just memorable and finally 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.700
 really came after several attempts, 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.390
 the content on looki looki i find 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.520
 on 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.479
 not only sounds beautiful but it has 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.479
 also short dress 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.940
 In 2011, I traveled to Hong Kong and 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.650
 I met an agent there 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.560
 it made possible the first round 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.960
 to make and production in less 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.610
 to produce a print at all 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.470
 when I was in hongkong for example 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.060
 was and in the markets that have 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.700
 scary so I do not know why 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.800
 paradise designer active through the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.600
 streets and I do not know there is 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.940
 own streets where there are different substances 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.460
 So holding would be of no interest 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.229
 for technical stuff and as me 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.430
 I noticed somehow suki 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.300
 can be so much more than in the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.700
 laptop bag 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.200
 how can that too from that vicky can too 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.170
 be there for men as well as can for 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.890
 Travelers at 1 so travel for that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.190
 potential of suu kyis just a lot bigger 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.080
 also always in the head so mentally 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.700
 I'm miles away from where 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.700
 I just started last year 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.030
 so 2012 will be the starting shot and as well 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.830
 the official as we the team 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.160
 have increased and also stepped up 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.620
 have fit marketing and we 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.410
 We really had a tremendous feedback 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.180
 were in the junior battle butter and afterwards 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.560
 represented in an awful lot of magazines 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.330
 petra soli and after that we were too 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.819
 completely sold out so it was real 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.459
 great that you just do not have any ware on 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.599
 camp have and that demand and 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.790
 Can you drive like that but I had 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.069
 First , make sure that stops 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.150
 it looks so perfect somehow 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:57.299
 But it has an age-old delivery 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:00.970
 I would say covetousness 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:05.310
 Of course , they are traveling a lot 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.989
 are like her nephew worn by poor and 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.299
 again and will want to look now 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.610
 I really wear my last one 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.580
 tomorrow into the office and back so from 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.329
 so my bag is a daily one 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.490
 companion and even if I do not stop 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.880
 my laptop with me 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.450
 I'll go out in the evening 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.450
 in a smaller form
