a new video talking about a new theory

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.950 
a new video talking about a new theory
that<00:00:18.710> I<00:00:18.770> came<00:00:18.890> up<00:00:19.189> with<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:19.759> I<00:00:20.270> kind<00:00:20.779> of<00:00:20.840> came

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
that I came up with and I kind of came

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.260 
that I came up with and I kind of came
up<00:00:21.140> with<00:00:21.290> it<00:00:21.470> I<00:00:21.500> have<00:00:21.830> a<00:00:21.860> lot<00:00:22.070> of<00:00:22.099> different

up with it I have a lot of different

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.600 
up with it I have a lot of different
ideas<00:00:23.270> to<00:00:23.540> kind<00:00:23.750> of<00:00:23.810> back<00:00:24.110> it<00:00:24.320> up<00:00:24.500> but<00:00:25.250> before<00:00:25.399> I

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
ideas to kind of back it up but before I

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.069 
ideas to kind of back it up but before I
jump<00:00:25.939> into<00:00:26.090> it<00:00:26.390> I<00:00:26.480> kind<00:00:26.509> of<00:00:26.720> want<00:00:26.899> to<00:00:26.930> do<00:00:27.050> a

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
jump into it I kind of want to do a

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.990 
jump into it I kind of want to do a
little<00:00:27.320> disclaimer<00:00:27.739> obviously<00:00:28.669> this<00:00:28.790> is<00:00:28.970> not

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
little disclaimer obviously this is not

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.729 
little disclaimer obviously this is not
one<00:00:29.450> hundred<00:00:29.540> percent<00:00:29.750> true<00:00:30.349> this<00:00:30.590> is

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739 
one hundred percent true this is

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.819 
one hundred percent true this is
something<00:00:31.070> that<00:00:31.160> I<00:00:31.399> came<00:00:31.460> up<00:00:31.880> with<00:00:32.710> it's<00:00:33.710> a

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
something that I came up with it's a

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.440 
something that I came up with it's a
theory<00:00:34.130> basically<00:00:34.550> which<00:00:35.059> means<00:00:35.300> it's

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
theory basically which means it's

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.389 
theory basically which means it's
plausible<00:00:35.690> but<00:00:36.200> it's<00:00:36.590> not<00:00:36.800> confirmed<00:00:37.130> it's

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
plausible but it's not confirmed it's

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.400 
plausible but it's not confirmed it's
not<00:00:37.550> true<00:00:37.760> or<00:00:38.000> anything<00:00:38.300> like<00:00:38.329> that<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.110> if

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
not true or anything like that so if

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.329 
not true or anything like that so if
there's<00:00:39.590> anybody<00:00:39.829> who's<00:00:40.040> gonna<00:00:40.129> leave

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
there's anybody who's gonna leave

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.040 
there's anybody who's gonna leave
comments<00:00:40.760> that<00:00:40.850> says<00:00:41.059> oh<00:00:41.300> this<00:00:41.750> is<00:00:41.899> impossible

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
comments that says oh this is impossible

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.770 
comments that says oh this is impossible
because<00:00:42.649> of<00:00:42.769> this<00:00:42.920> this<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:43.519> this<00:00:43.780> you

was a person who created zombies now you
guys<00:01:00.409> probably<00:01:00.559> wonder<00:01:00.829> what<00:01:01.190> does<00:01:01.460> that<00:01:01.640> mean

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
doesn't mean he was in a lab creating

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.280 
doesn't mean he was in a lab creating
them<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.580> it's<00:01:05.449> not<00:01:05.659> in<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.900> way<00:01:06.050> that<00:01:06.229> you

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
not the one who had was some brilliant

the the idea that he came up with in

the the idea that he came up with in
purgatory<00:03:57.180> mode<00:03:57.450> let's<00:03:58.440> remember<00:03:58.800> that<00:03:58.980> you

zombies storyline just happened around
1930s<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.120> know<00:04:09.240> 1920s<00:04:10.110> actually<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:12.210> it

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
1930s you know 1920s actually so is it

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.540 
1930s you know 1920s actually so is it
possible<00:04:12.750> now<00:04:13.440> obviously<00:04:13.920> there<00:04:14.130> are<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.310> few

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
possible now obviously there are a few

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.190 
possible now obviously there are a few
things<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:15.060> you<00:04:15.150> can<00:04:15.570> say<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.990> you<00:04:16.080> know

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
things that you can say that you know

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.200 
things that you can say that you know
kind<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.500> disprove<00:04:16.980> this<00:04:17.190> idea<00:04:17.580> you<00:04:17.910> know<00:04:18.000> how

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
kind of disprove this idea you know how

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.580 
kind of disprove this idea you know how
would<00:04:18.390> he<00:04:18.450> know<00:04:18.480> about<00:04:18.690> any<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.380> events

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
would he know about any of the events

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.010 
would he know about any of the events
World<00:04:20.070> War<00:04:20.310> how<00:04:20.880> would<00:04:21.030> he<00:04:21.120> know<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.299> Germany

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
World War how would he know that Germany

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.180 
World War how would he know that Germany
was<00:04:22.170> going<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.410> be<00:04:22.530> an<00:04:22.620> events<00:04:22.920> where<00:04:23.070> they're

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
was going to be an events where they're

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.950 
was going to be an events where they're
trying<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.820> know<00:04:23.850> just<00:04:24.240> after<00:04:24.630> World<00:04:24.840> War

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
trying to you know just after World War

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.860 
trying to you know just after World War
Two<00:04:25.140> and<00:04:25.680> all<00:04:25.800> that<00:04:25.950> kind<00:04:26.160> of<00:04:26.250> stuff<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:27.120> how<00:04:27.690> is

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
Two and all that kind of stuff so how is

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.300 
Two and all that kind of stuff so how is
it<00:04:27.900> possible<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.440> he<00:04:28.680> would<00:04:28.830> know<00:04:28.980> all<00:04:29.160> about

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
it possible that he would know all about

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.250 
it possible that he would know all about
this<00:04:29.669> so<00:04:29.880> obviously<00:04:30.600> there's<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.900> couple<00:04:31.169> of

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
this so obviously there's a couple of

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.140 
this so obviously there's a couple of
loopholes<00:04:31.740> by<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.010> idea<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.640> central<00:04:33.060> idea

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
loopholes by the idea the central idea

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.950 
loopholes by the idea the central idea
is<00:04:33.570> there

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
is there

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.670 
is there
is<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.289> possible<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:35.100> L<00:04:35.639> Arlington<00:04:36.680> created

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
is it possible that L Arlington created

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.590 
is it possible that L Arlington created
a<00:04:37.770> zombie<00:04:38.160> story<00:04:38.430> line<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:39.180> whole<00:04:39.330> zombie

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
a zombie story line the whole zombie

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.540 
a zombie story line the whole zombie
idea<00:04:40.139> is<00:04:40.319> a<00:04:40.350> comic<00:04:40.830> book<00:04:41.039> that<00:04:41.220> was<00:04:41.340> later

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
idea is a comic book that was later

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.120 
idea is a comic book that was later
rejected<00:04:41.910> by<00:04:42.240> someone<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:43.410> let<00:04:43.830> me<00:04:43.860> know<00:04:44.009> what

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
rejected by someone so let me know what

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.170 
rejected by someone so let me know what
you<00:04:44.220> guys<00:04:44.310> think<00:04:44.550> in<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.759> comments<00:04:45.150> section

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
you guys think in the comments section

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.120 
you guys think in the comments section
below<00:04:45.569> this<00:04:45.960> was<00:04:46.169> an<00:04:46.289> idea<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.650> little<00:04:46.770> bit<00:04:46.979> of<00:04:47.009> a

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
below this was an idea a little bit of a

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.950 
below this was an idea a little bit of a
theory<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.580> was<00:04:47.669> going<00:04:47.940> around<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.479> kind<00:04:48.930> of

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
theory it was going around I kind of

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.270 
theory it was going around I kind of
wanted<00:04:49.169> to<00:04:49.289> make<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.440> video<00:04:49.620> on<00:04:49.889> at<00:04:50.039> night<00:04:50.250> just

wanted to make a video on at night just

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.460 
wanted to make a video on at night just
right<00:04:50.669> now<00:04:50.819> had<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.120> time<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:51.690> sit<00:04:52.050> down<00:04:52.080> and

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
right now had the time to sit down and
