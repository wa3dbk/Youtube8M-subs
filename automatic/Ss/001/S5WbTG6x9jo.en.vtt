view to be able to see the effect I'm
going<00:00:34.900> to<00:00:34.960> pan<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.380> camera<00:00:35.410> and<00:00:35.980> as<00:00:36.579> you'll

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
going to pan the camera and as you'll

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.340

notice<00:00:37.030> our<00:00:37.180> space<00:00:37.450> detective<00:00:37.960> is<00:00:38.079> going

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
notice our space detective is going

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.259 
notice our space detective is going
across<00:00:38.560> the<00:00:38.860> sign<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.400> logo

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.490 

now<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:44.329> reason<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:44.989> this<00:00:45.109> is<00:00:45.170> only

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
now the reason that this is only

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.130 
now the reason that this is only
available<00:00:46.190> in<00:00:46.370> camera<00:00:46.789> view<00:00:46.820> is<00:00:47.180> if<00:00:47.719> you're<00:00:47.930> in

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
available in camera view is if you're in

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.619 
available in camera view is if you're in
panel<00:00:48.530> view<00:00:48.769> or<00:00:48.980> directors<00:00:49.519> for<00:00:49.699> you<00:00:49.789> it<00:00:50.390> gets

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
panel view or directors for you it gets

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.410 
panel view or directors for you it gets
a<00:00:50.780> little<00:00:50.899> difficult<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:51.969> move<00:00:52.969> things<00:00:53.210> around

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
a little difficult to move things around

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.750 
a little difficult to move things around
on<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.870> UI<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:54.589> keep<00:00:55.129> track<00:00:55.339> of<00:00:55.399> what<00:00:55.550> you're

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
is floating in space I can simply

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:55.469 
is floating in space I can simply
increase<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.229> size<00:01:47.469> of<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.770> panel<00:01:54.479> and

increase the size of the panel and
you'll<00:01:56.439> see<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:57.630> when<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.659> go<00:01:58.840> back<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.049> camera

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
you'll see that when I go back to camera

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:07.440 
you'll see that when I go back to camera
view<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:06.340> looks<00:02:06.549> like<00:02:06.700> everything's<00:02:07.179> floating

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
view it looks like everything's floating

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.430 
view it looks like everything's floating
over<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.810> artboard<00:02:10.019> I'll<00:02:11.019> zoom<00:02:11.319> out

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
over the artboard I'll zoom out

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.170 
over the artboard I'll zoom out
significantly<00:02:12.190> here<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:12.549> you<00:02:12.610> can<00:02:12.819> see<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.150> a
