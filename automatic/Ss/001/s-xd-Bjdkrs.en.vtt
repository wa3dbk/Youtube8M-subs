00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
neither of the latter tap as it turns

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.870 
neither of the latter tap as it turns
out<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.820> was<00:01:14.940> a<00:01:15.289> bulk<00:01:16.289> up<00:01:16.610> Poliwrath<00:01:17.610> or

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
out it was a bulk up Poliwrath or

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.320 
out it was a bulk up Poliwrath or
whatever<00:01:18.149> so<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:19.110> sub<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:20.030> sleep<00:01:21.030> or

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
whatever so this sub or a sleep or

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
whatever so this sub or a sleep or
something<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.660> that<00:01:21.720> would've<00:01:21.990> been<00:01:22.050> pretty

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
something like that would've been pretty

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.090 
something like that would've been pretty
bad<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.860> me

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
bad for me

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.279 
bad for me
but<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.460> changed<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.450> counter<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.020> time

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
but I changed the counter that time

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.109 
but I changed the counter that time
because<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.190> know<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> lot<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.610> them<00:01:26.820> don't<00:01:27.000> have

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
because I know a lot of them don't have

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.850 
because I know a lot of them don't have
waterfall<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.780> ice<00:01:27.899> punch<00:01:28.229> they<00:01:28.470> use<00:01:28.619> ice

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
waterfall and ice punch they use ice

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
waterfall and ice punch they use ice
punch<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.369> fighting<00:01:29.759> move<00:01:29.940> or<00:01:30.270> something

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
punch and fighting move or something

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.499 
punch and fighting move or something
like<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.710> uh<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.280> don't<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.179> just<00:01:33.210> I

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
like that but uh I don't know I just I

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.180 
like that but uh I don't know I just I
use<00:01:33.690> counter<00:01:34.050> that<00:01:34.170> time<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.470> figured<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.830> ko

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
use counter that time I figured I can ko

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.029 
use counter that time I figured I can ko
it<00:01:35.460> anyway<00:01:35.819> and<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.479> bring<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.200> Gengar<00:01:37.649> here

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.430 
it anyway and so I bring in Gengar here
and<00:01:38.450> I'm<00:01:39.450> kind<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.780> hoping<00:01:39.869> he'll<00:01:40.200> think

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
and I'm kind of hoping he'll think

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.070 
and I'm kind of hoping he'll think
t-bolt<00:01:41.030> because<00:01:42.030> that's<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.420> standard<00:01:42.899> gang

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
t-bolt because that's what standard gang

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.570 
t-bolt because that's what standard gang
gars<00:01:43.289> would<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.039> this<00:01:44.160> one's<00:01:44.369> got<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
gars would have but this one's got a

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.160 
gars would have but this one's got a
psychic<00:01:44.910> going<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.840> doesn't<00:01:46.110> even

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
psychic going on and it doesn't even

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.260 
psychic going on and it doesn't even
kill<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.709> I<00:01:46.800> was<00:01:46.920> surprised<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.610> was<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:47.880> man<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
kill it I was surprised I was like man I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.440 
kill it I was surprised I was like man I
know<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.110> an<00:01:49.200> unbaked<00:01:49.670> but<00:01:50.670> still<00:01:51.119> that's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
know it's an unbaked but still that's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.760 
know it's an unbaked but still that's
that's<00:01:52.200> crazy

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that's crazy

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.999 
that's crazy
so<00:01:53.190> then<00:01:53.489> the<00:01:53.610> poison<00:01:53.819> doesn't<00:01:54.209> even<00:01:54.420> kill<00:01:54.690> him

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
so then the poison doesn't even kill him

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.770 
so then the poison doesn't even kill him
which<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.340> suppose<00:01:56.940> it's<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.300> really<00:01:57.539> a<00:01:57.569> big

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
which I suppose it's not really a big

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.990 
which I suppose it's not really a big
deal<00:01:57.840> because<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:59.129> as<00:01:59.459> long<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.700> he<00:01:59.819> doesn't

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
deal because it as long as he doesn't

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.490 
deal because it as long as he doesn't
have<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.149> priority<00:02:00.720> move<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.050> is<00:02:01.200> which<00:02:01.379> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
have a priority move that is which I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.139 
have a priority move that is which I
knew<00:02:01.619> he<00:02:01.739> wouldn't<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.670> allows<00:02:02.819> me<00:02:02.970> just

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
knew he wouldn't have it allows me just

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.969 
knew he wouldn't have it allows me just
to<00:02:03.239> finish<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.569> off<00:02:03.720> anyway<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.200> whatever

fighting so it's gonna hurt whatever the
hell<00:02:27.269> comes<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.930> fortunately<00:02:28.830> Bri<00:02:29.340> Liam

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
hell comes in and fortunately Bri Liam

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.360 
hell comes in and fortunately Bri Liam
comes<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:31.440> was<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.950> was<00:02:32.099> huge<00:02:32.340> for

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
comes in and that was that was huge for

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.250 
comes in and that was that was huge for
me<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.610> didn't<00:02:32.910> think<00:02:33.060> he'd<00:02:33.300> bring<00:02:33.480> Breloom<00:02:33.959> cuz

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
me I didn't think he'd bring Breloom cuz

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.110 
me I didn't think he'd bring Breloom cuz
fighting<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:34.920> seed<00:02:35.160> bomb<00:02:35.340> don't<00:02:35.700> work<00:02:35.910> on

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
fighting and seed bomb don't work on

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.990 
fighting and seed bomb don't work on
poison<00:02:36.660> but<00:02:36.900> he<00:02:36.989> did<00:02:37.170> anyway<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.160> guess<00:02:38.849> he

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
poison but he did anyway so I guess he

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.059 
poison but he did anyway so I guess he
figured<00:02:39.180> he's<00:02:39.540> slower<00:02:39.900> which<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.500> good<00:02:40.709> for<00:02:40.920> me

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
figured he's slower which is good for me

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.720 
figured he's slower which is good for me
because<00:02:41.400> he<00:02:41.879> probably<00:02:42.269> was<00:02:42.660> faster<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.730> he

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
because he probably was faster and he

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.850 
because he probably was faster and he
probably<00:02:45.120> could<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.450> spord<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.080> still<00:02:46.739> made

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
probably could have spord and still made

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.649 
probably could have spord and still made
some<00:02:47.010> trouble<00:02:47.459> if<00:02:47.549> he<00:02:47.670> had<00:02:47.819> leech<00:02:48.090> seed<00:02:48.359> and

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
some trouble if he had leech seed and

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.500 
some trouble if he had leech seed and
stone<00:02:48.930> edge<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.890> guess<00:02:50.879> maybe<00:02:51.090> he<00:02:51.269> didn't

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
stone edge but I guess maybe he didn't

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.730 
stone edge but I guess maybe he didn't
so<00:02:51.810> good<00:02:52.109> for<00:02:52.260> me

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
so good for me

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.550 
so good for me
and<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:53.430> get<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.730> little<00:02:53.940> bit<00:02:54.150> on<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> nuke<00:02:55.290> area

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.740

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.520 
but not much I use torment cuz I knew

why<00:04:15.300> so<00:04:15.810> I'm<00:04:16.799> afraid<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.430> extreme<00:04:17.820> speed

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170

but<00:04:19.170> at<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.560> same<00:04:19.770> time<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:19.980> think<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.430> might

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
but at the same time I think I might

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.120 
but at the same time I think I might
live<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.120> bullet<00:04:21.900> punch<00:04:22.110> won't<00:04:22.410> do<00:04:22.830> enough

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130
