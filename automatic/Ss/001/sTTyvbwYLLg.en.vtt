00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.960
This is not my idea of progress -- let me
show you what I mean.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.560
They say an eco-friendly house can't be built
in 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.650
I'm Allen Smith, join me as I push the limits
with time, budget and creativity with the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.860
Garden Home Challenge, exclusively on eHow
Home.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.530
You know, it's important to pay attention
to the little details.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.500
Subtleties and not communicating, well, they'll
get you in trouble.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.280
What's happening back here is we're not putting
tile on, we're taking tile off.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.300
Which is very painful to watch.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.039
What happened was we -- using subway tile,
and we decided we're gonna use white.

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.210
But, as you now, there are like a million
different colors of white in paint, and it

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.219
just happens that there's not quite a million
colors in tile, but almost.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.609
We have a subtle difference in the color the
tile that's going in in the kitchen -- it

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.539
is supposed to be white.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.670
And what's going in upstairs is called Arctic
White, which is whiter.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.270
That wasn't discovered until it actually went
up on the walls, and you could see the light

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.790
against it, and then it was very apparent.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.850
You can see right here --hope the camera can
pick this up-- we have Arctic White here,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.630
and this is white.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.820
Soâ€¦

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.770
We gotta change all this back out to white
-- not good.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.720
The good news is that they can take a chisel
and gently tap at each one of these tiles

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.039
and save most of them.

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.060
They can take them off.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.270
They just set these on Friday, and so they've
only been setting up for a couple of days.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.549
And we'll save them and reuse them, so we're
really just out the labor and the time, which

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.700
both are precious.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.000
But it just is what it is.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.050
So come here and take a look at the boxes.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.689
So let me show you what I meant by subtlety,
paying attention to detail and so forth.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.770
These are the boxes that the tile come in.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.649
At a glance, they look the same.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.899
If you look a little closer, you can see that
this number and this number are the same,

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.530
which indicates the shade -- but over here's
color -- color.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.360
This particular color's called white, and
it's color 100.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.280
And this particular tile is called Arctic
White, and it's color number 190.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.670
So it's apparent now, once we're looking a
little closer.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.420
So, as they say, hindsight is 20/20, right?

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.490
When Miguel asked me, I was probably in a
rush.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.490
I saidâ€¦

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.390
He asked me what color of tile was gonna be
upstairs and what color tile was gonna be

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.640
downstairs -- I said, white.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.950
So I didn't distinguish the subtle differences
between these two, and then when he started

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.760
laying the tile, he didn't notice it until
he came in this morning.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.230
And when the light was on it and it was all
lit up, you could see the subtle differences

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.660
between the two tile colors.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.590
So now he's correcting the problem.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.440
I'm just happy we discovered it, and we can
take care of it now, and there wasn't, like,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.340
you know, a million pieces of this stuff left.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.340
So I guess this update on the house is really
a cautionary tale.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.730
And that is: Make sure that you read the detail.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.550
Hey, if you're enjoying our updates, tell
a friend a friend about them.

just hope we can make our deadline.
