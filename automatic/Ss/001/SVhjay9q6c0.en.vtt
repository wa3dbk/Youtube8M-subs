and that was for school we had to finish
it<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:19.140> rid<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.439> her<00:00:19.560> about<00:00:19.740> two<00:00:19.980> months<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
it up we rid of her about two months and

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
it up we rid of her about two months and
we<00:00:20.820> finished<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.539> gave<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:23.090> four<00:00:24.090> stars<00:00:24.390> I

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
think I didn't love it as much as I

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.980 
think I didn't love it as much as I
think<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:26.640> people<00:00:26.880> did<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.359> also<00:00:27.480> thought

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
think some people did but I also thought

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.480 
think some people did but I also thought

was a very good classic and one of the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.220 
was a very good classic and one of the
better<00:00:29.640> ones<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.029> I've<00:00:30.119> read<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
better ones that I've read and for the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.780 
better ones that I've read and for the
second<00:00:31.619> book<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.890> i<00:00:31.980> read<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.369> May<00:00:32.579> was
