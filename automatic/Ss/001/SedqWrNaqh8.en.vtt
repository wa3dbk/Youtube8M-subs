00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
Sennheiser wireless lab kit and keep in

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
Sennheiser wireless lab kit and keep in
mind<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.689> wireless<00:01:55.170> lab<00:01:55.350> kit<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.799> a

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
mind that this wireless lab kit is a

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.819 
mind that this wireless lab kit is a
$600<00:01:56.820> kit<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.719> could<00:01:57.810> easily<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.439> replaced

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
$600 kit and it could easily be replaced

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.149 
$600 kit and it could easily be replaced
by<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.820> guy<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:01.110> quality<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.950> par

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
by this guy if the quality is up to par

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.880 
by this guy if the quality is up to par
so<00:02:02.219> let's<00:02:02.939> go<00:02:03.060> ahead<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.570> switch<00:02:03.899> over<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.380> the

clip mic digital with the apogee metal

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.779 
clip mic digital with the apogee metal
recorder<00:02:07.590> app<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.009> see<00:02:08.310> how<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.550> sounds

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
recorder app and see how that sounds

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.449 
recorder app and see how that sounds
