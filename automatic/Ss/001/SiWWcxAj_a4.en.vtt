three-dimensional shape with a hole in

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.990 
three-dimensional shape with a hole in
it<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.500> then<00:00:07.800> adding<00:00:08.069> two<00:00:08.309> additional<00:00:08.790> holes

it and then adding two additional holes

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.759 
it and then adding two additional holes
to<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.389> shape<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:10.200> let's<00:00:10.349> go<00:00:10.440> ahead<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.620> get

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
to that shape so let's go ahead and get

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.959 
to that shape so let's go ahead and get
started<00:00:11.129> we're<00:00:11.249> gonna<00:00:11.309> add<00:00:11.519> open<00:00:11.999> a<00:00:12.059> part<00:00:12.269> file

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
started we're gonna add open a part file

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.059 
you're gonna click on the point then
we're<00:03:43.269> gonna<00:03:43.359> dimension<00:03:43.959> make<00:03:44.349> this<00:03:44.500> hole<00:03:44.739> one

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
we're gonna dimension make this hole one

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.999 
we're gonna dimension make this hole one
inch<00:03:45.280> oops<00:03:46.109> we're<00:03:47.109> gonna<00:03:47.199> make<00:03:47.349> it<00:03:47.470> in<00:03:47.709> the

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:48.009 
inch oops we're gonna make it in the

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:49.589 
inch oops we're gonna make it in the
middle<00:03:48.310> of<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.519> block<00:03:48.729> and<00:03:49.030> then<00:03:49.180> one<00:03:49.419> inch

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
middle of the block and then one inch

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:57.330 
middle of the block and then one inch
from<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:50.079> bottom<00:03:50.709> side<00:03:52.019> okay<00:03:55.530> okay<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:57.219> we

from this bottom side okay okay so we

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.209 
from this bottom side okay okay so we
just<00:03:57.639> used<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.180> point<00:03:58.540> tool<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.889> create<00:04:00.189> a

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:00.219 
just used the point tool to create a

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.249 
just used the point tool to create a
single<00:04:00.729> point<00:04:01.180> wherever<00:04:01.659> you<00:04:01.930> want<00:04:02.139> the

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:02.259 
single point wherever you want the

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.689 
single point wherever you want the
center<00:04:02.620> of<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.829> hole<00:04:02.979> so<00:04:03.219> let's<00:04:03.400> right<00:04:03.669> click

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699 
center of the hole so let's right click

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.619

done right click finish sketch and now

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.879 
done right click finish sketch and now
to<00:04:07.689> create<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.229> second<00:04:08.560> hole<00:04:08.650> we're<00:04:08.769> gonna

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
to create the second hole we're gonna

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.709 
to create the second hole we're gonna
use<00:04:09.069> the<00:04:09.189> hole<00:04:09.400> tool<00:04:09.759> and<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.329> whole<00:04:10.479> tool

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:10.719 
use the hole tool and the whole tool

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.479 
use the hole tool and the whole tool
creates<00:04:11.139> holes<00:04:11.379> but<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.739> gives<00:04:11.889> us<00:04:11.979> a<00:04:12.039> lot<00:04:12.250> more

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
creates holes but it gives us a lot more

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.849 
creates holes but it gives us a lot more

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
top of the hole how

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.839 
top of the hole how
the<00:04:26.419> counterbore<00:04:26.930> is<00:04:27.169> now<00:04:28.039> debt<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.550> depth<00:04:28.729> of

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
the counterbore is now debt the depth of

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.300 
the counterbore is now debt the depth of
the<00:04:28.909> hole<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.930> size<00:04:30.169> of<00:04:30.319> the<00:04:30.379> hole<00:04:30.530> if<00:04:31.250> we

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
the hole and the size of the hole if we

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.100 
the hole and the size of the hole if we
remove<00:04:31.669> the<00:04:31.849> top<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.090> we<00:04:32.360> just<00:04:32.569> had<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.840> depth

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
remove the top and we just had the depth

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.369 
remove the top and we just had the depth
and<00:04:33.319> the<00:04:33.379> height<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:34.460> we're<00:04:34.580> gonna<00:04:34.669> go<00:04:34.879> ahead

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:35.379 
and the height so we're gonna go ahead

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.659 
and the height so we're gonna go ahead
also<00:04:36.379> the<00:04:36.500> termination<00:04:37.069> we<00:04:37.190> can<00:04:37.340> just<00:04:37.550> say

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
also the termination we can just say

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.930 
also the termination we can just say
through<00:04:37.970> all<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.659> removes<00:04:39.050> that<00:04:39.229> doubt<00:04:39.940> that

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
through all that removes that doubt that

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.700 
through all that removes that doubt that
removes<00:04:41.509> how<00:04:41.659> far<00:04:42.020> we<00:04:42.139> want<00:04:42.259> to<00:04:42.349> go<00:04:42.409> through

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
removes how far we want to go through

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.480 
removes how far we want to go through
the<00:04:42.800> block<00:04:43.009> okay<00:04:44.500> so<00:04:45.500> we<00:04:45.650> can<00:04:45.800> see<00:04:46.009> we<00:04:46.220> can<00:04:46.370> go

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
the block okay so we can see we can go

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.550 
the block okay so we can see we can go
ahead<00:04:46.669> and<00:04:46.819> see<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.300> an<00:04:47.599> example<00:04:47.960> right<00:04:48.500> here

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
ahead and see a an example right here

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.460 
ahead and see a an example right here
okay<00:04:49.280> so<00:04:50.240> through<00:04:50.509> all<00:04:50.690> in<00:04:50.900> this<00:04:51.020> case<00:04:51.229> would

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
okay so through all in this case would

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.439 
okay so through all in this case would
only<00:04:51.620> get<00:04:51.860> us<00:04:52.009> to<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.310> first<00:04:52.610> hole<00:04:52.879> before<00:04:53.240> the

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
only get us to the first hole before the

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.270 
only get us to the first hole before the
that's<00:04:53.870> where<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.169> material<00:04:54.590> in<00:04:54.740> so<00:04:55.159> we

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
that's where the material in so we

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.790 
that's where the material in so we
wanted<00:04:55.490> to<00:04:55.550> go<00:04:55.639> all<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.000> way<00:04:56.330> through<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.990> the

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
wanted to go all the way through the the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.219 
wanted to go all the way through the the
block<00:04:58.039> we'd<00:04:58.310> have<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.639> say<00:04:58.870> we<00:04:59.870> want<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.110> go<00:05:00.169> two

block we'd have to say we want to go two

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.170 
block we'd have to say we want to go two
inches<00:05:00.740> or<00:05:00.949> three<00:05:01.280> inches<00:05:01.310> through<00:05:01.879> the<00:05:01.969> block

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
inches or three inches through the block

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.540 
inches or three inches through the block
okay<00:05:02.780> always<00:05:03.440> one<00:05:03.650> Joe<00:05:03.830> just<00:05:04.099> a<00:05:04.190> little<00:05:04.430> bit

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
we can also change the diameter of the

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.230 
we can also change the diameter of the
hole<00:05:10.940> let's<00:05:11.300> go<00:05:11.449> 0.5<00:05:12.020> make<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.860> hole<00:05:12.979> bigger

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
hole let's go 0.5 make the hole bigger

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.260 
hole let's go 0.5 make the hole bigger
then<00:05:14.240> we<00:05:14.330> go<00:05:14.449> ahead<00:05:14.659> and<00:05:14.810> click<00:05:15.020> OK<00:05:16.210> okay<00:05:17.210> so

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.890 
then we go ahead and click OK okay so
there's<00:05:17.599> our<00:05:17.990> third<00:05:18.650> hole<00:05:19.659> all<00:05:20.659> right<00:05:20.719> now

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
there's our third hole all right now

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.550 
there's our third hole all right now
let's<00:05:21.139> if<00:05:21.409> we<00:05:21.590> wanted<00:05:21.830> to<00:05:21.889> view<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:24.050> holes<00:05:24.289> and

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
let's if we wanted to view the holes and

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.140 
let's if we wanted to view the holes and
how<00:05:24.680> they<00:05:24.830> intersect<00:05:25.099> we<00:05:25.520> might<00:05:25.699> at<00:05:25.819> the<00:05:25.909> top

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
how they intersect we might at the top

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.990 
how they intersect we might at the top
and<00:05:26.560> under<00:05:27.560> shake<00:05:27.830> hidden<00:05:28.159> and<00:05:28.460> then<00:05:28.729> we<00:05:28.849> have

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
and under shake hidden and then we have

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.330 
and under shake hidden and then we have
this<00:05:29.150> nice<00:05:29.479> these<00:05:30.229> in<00:05:30.440> this<00:05:30.560> view<00:05:30.979> of<00:05:31.159> how
