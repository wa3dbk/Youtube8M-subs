00:00:01.157 --> 00:00:02.807
 Scene 7 

00:00:03.387 --> 00:00:07.983
 Lights on platform 9 3/4 turn on. 19 years later 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:18.158
 A driving magician blows the whistle and shouts: All aboard! 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.277
 All aboard the Hogwarts Express! 

00:00:27.163 --> 00:00:28.799
 Very good son. 

00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:31.168
 This is. 

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:34.271
 Your first day of school. 

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:38.376
 Dad, I'm scared. You can come with me? 

00:00:38.656 --> 00:00:41.740
 No, son. My time at Hogwarts is over. 

00:00:42.648 --> 00:00:44.038
 But listen to me ... 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.212
 You should not be afraid to start something new. 

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:54.605
 You have the name of the two bravest men I met. 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.364
 So get on that train, Albus Scarfy Potter. 

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:08.203
 Because now you will go to Hogwarts. 

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:13.100
 Now you will go to school. 

00:01:15.604 --> 00:01:19.381
 Now that you can go to Hogwarts. 

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:24.544
 I hope you find that pool. 

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:33.619
 With witches, magicians and magical creatures. 

00:01:34.098 --> 00:01:39.011
 With goblins, ghosts, and a magical feast. 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.954
 It's everything I loved and everything you'll see. 

00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:47.746
 In Hogwarts. 

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:49.570
 Hogwarts. 

00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:54.044
 I'm glad you can go. 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.258
 Thanks Dad. 

00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:00.360
 See you next year, boy. 

00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:02.493
 I love you. 

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:08.653
 Oh no! I'll miss the train to Hogwarts! Come on, daddies! We are late! 

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:11.012
 We are going, we are going. 

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:19.501
 I'm sorry it was my fault. 

00:02:19.757 --> 00:02:20.868
 Not at all... 

00:02:21.144 --> 00:02:22.272
 It was my fault. 

00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:25.896
 I know you? 

00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:32.552
 How weird! My scar hurts a little. 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.944
 Good see you later! 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.776
 Voldemort 

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:43.990
 That was Harry Potter! 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.280
 I already know Quirell. I hear everything you hear. 

00:02:53.057 --> 00:02:55.715
 -I should ... - No, no. 

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:57.583
 Single... 

00:02:58.183 --> 00:02:59.559
 Let it go. 

00:03:01.412 --> 00:03:03.297
 You know? Harry Potter ... 

00:03:03.628 --> 00:03:05.362
 It helped me once. 

00:03:06.757 --> 00:03:08.908
 He taught me something. 

00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:11.804
 He taught me that ... 

00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:15.347
 It's okay to let go ... 

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:18.911
 The things that harm us 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.695
 He taught me to open my heart to new things. 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.523
 Harry Potter gave me a new family. 

00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:33.598
 He taught me to love. 

00:03:36.996 --> 00:03:41.664
 And I guess that's what Harry Potter is about. 

00:03:48.492 --> 00:03:50.486
 There comes a time ... 

00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:56.202
 In which you must move on, Quirell. 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.882
 A time when you should let go even Harry Potter. 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.244
 And this is good. 

00:04:06.403 --> 00:04:07.825
 Voldemort ... 

00:04:08.377 --> 00:04:10.965
 Yes, Squirell? 

00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:16.219
 'Good' is wonderful. 

00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:24.765
 The end.
