00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.389 

I<00:00:44.300> think<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.230> issue<00:00:45.440> for<00:00:45.800> Ferguson<00:00:46.129> in<00:00:46.370> the

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
I think the issue for Ferguson in the

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:47.920 
I think the issue for Ferguson in the
early<00:00:46.670> returns<00:00:46.760> but<00:00:47.030> just<00:00:47.270> been<00:00:47.390> an<00:00:47.480> absence

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
early returns but just been an absence

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.360 
early returns but just been an absence
of<00:00:48.020> green<00:00:48.260> mana<00:00:48.469> no<00:00:48.710> that<00:00:48.890> was<00:00:48.920> definitely<00:00:49.190> the

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
of green mana no that was definitely the

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.500 
of green mana no that was definitely the
issue<00:00:49.550> because<00:00:49.879> he<00:00:49.969> just<00:00:50.120> found<00:00:50.210> out<00:00:50.329> of<00:00:50.449> the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
issue because he just found out of the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.880 
issue because he just found out of the
previous<00:00:50.840> turn<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:51.230> now<00:00:51.350> here's<00:00:51.559> sleeps<00:00:51.770> me
