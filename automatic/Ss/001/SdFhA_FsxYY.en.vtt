here<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:52.230> kind<00:01:52.410> of

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.840 

there's<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.560> couple<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:06.010> different<00:02:06.400> reasons<00:02:06.520> to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
there's a couple of different reasons to

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.249 
there's a couple of different reasons to
trace<00:02:07.150> means<00:02:07.480> some<00:02:07.660> people<00:02:07.780> just<00:02:08.110> have<00:02:08.170> a

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
trace means some people just have a

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.230 
trace means some people just have a
difficult<00:02:08.740> time<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.009> proportion<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:09.910> another

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
difficult time of proportion and another

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.180 
difficult time of proportion and another
big<00:02:10.479> reason<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.869> trace<00:02:11.050> it's<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.380> major<00:02:11.740> major

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
big reason to trace it's a major major

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.070 
big reason to trace it's a major major
time<00:02:12.550> saver<00:02:12.580> like<00:02:13.480> if<00:02:13.570> I'm<00:02:13.660> going<00:02:13.810> through<00:02:14.050> a

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
time saver like if I'm going through a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.450 
time saver like if I'm going through a
period<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.470> my<00:02:14.500> life<00:02:14.590> where<00:02:15.010> I'm<00:02:15.100> really

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
period in my life where I'm really

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.910 
period in my life where I'm really
really<00:02:15.610> busy<00:02:16.050> sometimes<00:02:17.050> I'll<00:02:17.380> just<00:02:17.410> make<00:02:17.830> an

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
really busy sometimes I'll just make an

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.740 
really busy sometimes I'll just make an
outline<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.640> few<00:02:18.880> pictures<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.450> want<00:02:19.660> to

draw outline them and then I'll have

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.740

want<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.440> be<00:02:33.840> really<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.020> be<00:02:35.140> you're<00:02:35.980> going

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
want it to be really to be you're going

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.290 
want it to be really to be you're going
to<00:02:36.340> take<00:02:36.550> tape<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.950> got<00:02:39.070> me<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.250> bunch<00:02:39.430> and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
to take tape you got me a bunch and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:48.390 
to take tape you got me a bunch and
you're<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.959> tape<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.980> want<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.280> be

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
you're going to tape it you want to be

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.480 
you're going to tape it you want to be
so<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.670> stays<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:48.940> place<00:02:50.190> doesn't<00:02:51.190> do<00:02:51.280> me<00:02:51.459> much

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
so it stays in place doesn't do me much

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.040 
so it stays in place doesn't do me much
good<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.940> trace<00:02:52.180> if<00:02:52.360> it's<00:02:52.510> moving<00:02:52.690> all<00:02:52.930> around

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
good to trace if it's moving all around

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.870 
good to trace if it's moving all around
so<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.470> just<00:02:53.680> want<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:53.980> kind<00:02:54.130> of<00:02:54.280> secure

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
so you just want it kind of secure

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.310 
2b pencil and you are just going to
outline<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:03.190> you're<00:03:03.340> just<00:03:03.400> going<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.640> trace

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
outline it you're just going to trace

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.140 
outline it you're just going to trace
the<00:03:05.320> harder<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.250> press<00:03:06.520> down<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.880> more

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150

the harder you press down the the more
the<00:03:10.480> thicker<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.110> lines<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.920> will<00:03:12.040> transfer

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
the thicker the lines that will transfer

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:27.880 
the thicker the lines that will transfer
then<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.019> have<00:03:14.170> more<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.830> work<00:03:14.950> from

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
be I'm deduced a jewel but Messier work

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.190 
be I'm deduced a jewel but Messier work
today<00:03:33.920> just<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.310> get<00:03:34.490> this<00:03:34.700> idea<00:03:35.450> up<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:36.020> just

want to give the idea out you can take a

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.690 
want to give the idea out you can take a
lot<00:03:39.140> of<00:03:39.290> time<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.800> mean<00:03:40.070> it<00:03:40.220> depends<00:03:40.550> if<00:03:40.640> you

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
lot of time I mean it depends if you

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.730 
lot of time I mean it depends if you
just<00:03:40.850> need<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.090> proportion<00:03:41.660> for<00:03:42.080> it<00:03:42.170> is<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:42.710> a

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
just need the proportion for it is so a

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.350 
just need the proportion for it is so a
lot<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.070> body<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.610> get<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.880> proportion

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
lot of a body to get the proportion

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.390 
lot of a body to get the proportion
right<00:03:44.510> that's<00:03:44.690> fine<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:45.650> may<00:03:45.830> want<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.190> take

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
right that's fine you may want to take

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.490 
right that's fine you may want to take
more<00:03:46.730> time<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.450> pretty<00:03:47.720> much<00:03:47.870> just<00:03:47.930> trace<00:03:48.350> out

accurate<00:05:05.310> you<00:05:05.370> try<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.610> trace<00:05:06.060> some<00:05:06.270> times

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
accurate you try to trace some times

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.660 
accurate you try to trace some times
things<00:05:06.810> will<00:05:06.870> come<00:05:07.020> out<00:05:07.140> distorting<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:07.980> then

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
things will come out distorting and then

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.950 
things will come out distorting and then
you<00:05:08.760> have<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:08.970> distorted<00:05:09.390> line<00:05:09.510> so<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:09.780> can't

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
you have the distorted line so you can't

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.630 
you have the distorted line so you can't
really<00:05:10.140> see<00:05:10.470> where<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.680> proportions<00:05:11.310> inside

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
really see where the proportions inside

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.010 
really see where the proportions inside
should<00:05:11.790> be<00:05:11.850> so<00:05:12.180> if<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.360> have<00:05:12.510> another<00:05:12.810> one

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
should be so if you have another one

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.530 
should be so if you have another one
printed<00:05:13.470> out<00:05:13.680> you<00:05:14.640> can<00:05:14.850> still<00:05:15.150> have<00:05:15.510> a

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
printed out you can still have a

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.570 
printed out you can still have a
reference<00:05:16.140> to<00:05:16.320> a<00:05:16.470> rough<00:05:16.740> reference<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.400> work

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
reference to a rough reference to work

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.770 
reference to a rough reference to work
from<00:05:17.820> that<00:05:18.060> isn't<00:05:19.610> distorted<00:05:20.610> by<00:05:20.730> the<00:05:20.790> tracing

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780

from that isn't distorted by the tracing
lines<00:05:21.930> you've<00:05:22.110> already<00:05:22.290> done<00:05:27.140> now<00:05:28.140> again<00:05:28.350> this

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
lines you've already done now again this

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.940 
lines you've already done now again this
is<00:05:28.680> just<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.950> messy<00:05:29.460> quick<00:05:30.230> sketch<00:05:31.230> to<00:05:31.590> show

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
is just a messy quick sketch to show

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.010 
is just a messy quick sketch to show
everybody<00:05:32.340> you<00:05:32.760> can<00:05:32.970> do<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:33.240> much<00:05:33.750> better

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
everybody you can do a much better

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:54.480 
everybody you can do a much better
version<00:05:34.320> of<00:05:34.680> this<00:05:35.390> feature

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.460 

just<00:05:55.150> do<00:05:55.270> this<00:05:55.389> over<00:05:55.660> some<00:05:55.930> of<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.080> shadowing

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
just do this over some of the shadowing

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:05.490 
just do this over some of the shadowing
and<00:05:56.830> stuff<00:05:57.039> comes<00:05:57.310> in

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.260 

so<00:06:06.070> thing<00:06:06.190> if<00:06:06.310> you<00:06:06.400> don't<00:06:06.550> get<00:06:06.700> it<00:06:06.820> right<00:06:07.000> the

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
so thing if you don't get it right the

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.090 
so thing if you don't get it right the
first<00:06:07.780> time<00:06:07.960> it<00:06:08.290> takes<00:06:08.440> you<00:06:08.530> a<00:06:08.560> couple<00:06:08.830> tries

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
first time it takes you a couple tries

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.370 
first time it takes you a couple tries
you<00:06:09.760> can<00:06:12.270> retrace<00:06:13.270> over<00:06:13.690> I<00:06:13.810> recommend

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
you can retrace over I recommend

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.660 
you can retrace over I recommend
actually<00:06:14.560> printing<00:06:14.950> out<00:06:15.040> a<00:06:15.070> whole<00:06:15.250> new<00:06:15.400> page

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
actually printing out a whole new page

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.860 
actually printing out a whole new page
because<00:06:15.940> it's<00:06:16.120> really<00:06:16.390> hard<00:06:16.600> to<00:06:16.720> see

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
because it's really hard to see

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.930 
because it's really hard to see
accurately<00:06:17.530> where<00:06:18.280> everything<00:06:18.640> is<00:06:18.760> when

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
accurately where everything is when

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.880 
accurately where everything is when
you've<00:06:19.060> already<00:06:19.300> put<00:06:19.990> lines<00:06:20.260> on<00:06:20.500> it<00:06:20.530> so<00:06:20.830> I

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
you've already put lines on it so I

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.610 
you've already put lines on it so I
really<00:06:21.190> recommend<00:06:22.020> just<00:06:23.020> putting<00:06:23.320> on<00:06:23.440> another

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
really recommend just putting on another

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.230 
really recommend just putting on another
picture<00:06:24.070> if<00:06:24.220> it<00:06:24.340> takes<00:06:24.520> you<00:06:24.640> a<00:06:24.670> few<00:06:24.910> tries<00:06:25.180> to

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
picture if it takes you a few tries to

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:55.460 
picture if it takes you a few tries to
get<00:06:25.630> this<00:06:25.860> technique<00:06:26.860> down

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.100 

okay<00:06:56.250> now<00:06:56.550> something<00:06:56.880> I<00:06:56.970> always<00:06:57.360> do<00:06:57.570> before<00:06:58.080> I

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
okay now something I always do before I

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.290 
okay now something I always do before I
officially<00:06:58.380> pull<00:06:58.950> it<00:06:59.040> off<00:06:59.160> fishing<00:06:59.340> very<00:06:59.820> very

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
officially pull it off fishing very very

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.350 
officially pull it off fishing very very
carefully<00:07:00.840> what's<00:07:01.020> up<00:07:01.170> the<00:07:01.350> tape<00:07:01.560> and<00:07:02.360> then

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
carefully what's up the tape and then

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.540 
carefully what's up the tape and then
you<00:07:03.780> just<00:07:04.230> look<00:07:04.710> through<00:07:04.890> to<00:07:05.040> see<00:07:05.160> if<00:07:05.340> you<00:07:05.430> got

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
you just look through to see if you got

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.830 
you just look through to see if you got
details<00:07:06.120> make<00:07:06.330> sure<00:07:06.480> you're<00:07:06.600> not<00:07:06.660> missing

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 
details make sure you're not missing

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.310 
details make sure you're not missing
anything<00:07:08.480> looks<00:07:09.480> like<00:07:09.660> I<00:07:10.670> get<00:07:11.670> it<00:07:11.820> okay<00:07:12.320> all

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
anything looks like I get it okay all

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.360 
anything looks like I get it okay all
right<00:07:13.440> so<00:07:13.710> there<00:07:13.860> you<00:07:14.010> go

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
right so there you go

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.690 
right so there you go
you<00:07:15.300> see<00:07:15.480> if<00:07:15.600> you<00:07:15.750> can<00:07:15.960> see<00:07:16.380> it<00:07:16.530> just<00:07:16.860> fine<00:07:17.280> dad

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:17.700 
you see if you can see it just fine dad

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:26.060 
you see if you can see it just fine dad
can't<00:07:18.090> really<00:07:18.210> see<00:07:18.480> it<00:07:18.570> let<00:07:18.960> me<00:07:19.050> zoom<00:07:19.260> in<00:07:25.070> just

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070 
can't really see it let me zoom in just

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.530 
can't really see it let me zoom in just
for<00:07:26.340> a<00:07:26.370> little<00:07:26.610> bit<00:07:26.700> so<00:07:26.760> you<00:07:26.850> can<00:07:26.880> really<00:07:27.180> see

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540 
for a little bit so you can really see

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:34.160 
for a little bit so you can really see
it<00:07:31.880> there<00:07:32.880> you<00:07:33.060> go<00:07:33.180> all<00:07:33.480> right<00:07:33.540> you<00:07:33.840> get<00:07:34.110> the

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.170 
it there you go all right you get the

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.950 
it there you go all right you get the
basic<00:07:34.560> idea<00:07:34.680> it<00:07:35.010> could<00:07:35.190> be<00:07:35.250> clearer<00:07:35.670> but<00:07:36.210> it's

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 
basic idea it could be clearer but it's

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.120 
basic idea it could be clearer but it's
really<00:07:37.080> hard<00:07:37.320> all<00:07:37.560> right<00:07:37.740> so<00:07:37.920> when<00:07:38.040> you're

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.130 
really hard all right so when you're

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.250 
really hard all right so when you're
done<00:07:38.280> you<00:07:38.610> just<00:07:38.640> still<00:07:39.420> want<00:07:39.540> to<00:07:39.660> fix<00:07:39.840> it<00:07:40.050> you

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:40.260 
done you just still want to fix it you

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.530 
done you just still want to fix it you
can<00:07:40.410> darken<00:07:40.650> the<00:07:40.770> lines<00:07:40.800> and<00:07:41.310> everything<00:07:41.730> all

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:42.540 
can darken the lines and everything all

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.330 
can darken the lines and everything all
right<00:07:42.630> and<00:07:42.900> that<00:07:43.080> is<00:07:43.290> how<00:07:43.530> you<00:07:43.590> trace<00:07:44.100> onto

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340 
right and that is how you trace onto

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.250 
right and that is how you trace onto
your<00:07:44.460> sketchbook<00:07:45.030> no<00:07:45.240> tracing<00:07:45.660> paper<00:07:45.780> needed

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.260 
your sketchbook no tracing paper needed

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.340 
your sketchbook no tracing paper needed
all<00:07:47.250> right
