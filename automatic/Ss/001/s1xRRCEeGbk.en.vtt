00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.869
 so 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.400
 you saw good night this was not the 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.920
 match to draw points here in the 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.300
 true the two most parties 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.680
 important will be at home probably 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.850
 to take points or with Celtic and Betis 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.559
 that we are aware of the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.510
 difficulties that presented today especially 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.949
 when it will seem like a loser 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.930
 it was difficult we came with another intention 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.230
 more or less of not reaching a result 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.360
 so bulky but good at the end like 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.949
 well says our goal of the week 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.140
 that comes from winning at home the Celtic and 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.949
 was still plugged in until the end our 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.949
 objective that arrogance 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.700
 with the change 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.110
 that was going to go up is I was complaining 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.200
 I want to play that night it was real 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.119
 gifted gifts and give two minutes 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.189
 ninth time with one player less 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.350
 team like almería that has cost me 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.759
 cost the first goal of it when 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.439
 I think it's good the first part to think 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.939
 that they were having opportunities that 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.110
 esteban was intervening well good 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.310
 we are balanced, we are 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.659
 defending well did not cost a little 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.460
 of arriving we have arrived very little 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.750
 logically at the door of diego lopez 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.820
 yes we have taken many corners that 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.770
 buildings in the bernabéu 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.990
 and good one thing as clear that this 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.280
 It would be if I were outside and I would ask 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.720
 to enter even if he had an injury to 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.750
 make the change but he said 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.130
 could not be in one and another have done if 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.430
 better than what he has done to us 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.130
 hurt 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.760
 good night francisco diary of almería 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.760
 after the 1st 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.650
 but he said there was a little option 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.570
 engaged in the arenal madrid with a 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.970
 fall of corona you have commented on the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.600
 wardrobe the player himself if he looked 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.210
 penal 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.800
 we have commented nothing the truth that has 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.080
 been in the area will still be missing 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.119
 been a good penalty, I could not talk to 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.289
 him of that subject and the few occasions that 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.270
 we had the first time at the end 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.560
 that us possible that exclusion and I repeat 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.440
 that we have taken a lot of races for 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.209
 see and well I've done a little more 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.640
 strategy damage that has not been lacking 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.930
 but it was very difficult and we understand that 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.220
 our week is the one that starts tomorrow 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.020
 starting tomorrow we train in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.400
 When we arrived in Almeria and prepare a 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.180
 fundamental match for us to 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.140
 the city and for all 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.790
 like Alberto but live for the 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.379
 feeling that has said for you that they are 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.549
 late at home he said they were now 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.219
 same with the teles that is a play off 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.930
 of five games what he had left would see 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:44.450
 I do not know how strongly you want with what 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.159
 you see feasible yes it depends on these two 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.049
 matches how many points that splash make 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.000
 missing two more points that hurt me now 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.069
 same that is a macro match valladolid 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.099
 right now that is the one that marks the one 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.629
 mark the permanence and we other 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.790
 goal is that game in the guide 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.170
 I raise a group of permanence with 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.810
 valladolid and getafe right now and 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.129
 we are ready prepared but 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.689
 mentally strong because we have lived 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.060
 situations very much like the one 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.739
 we are now throughout the year and in 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.769
 that good sense because we have a lot 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.540
 learned so we're going to make a 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.620
 valuation of these five parties as 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.180
 they did what happened when they 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.950
 ascended when doing the team and 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.669
 we are convinced that year and we are going 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.669
 it is in first vision 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.220
 good friendships absence of the struggle 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.870
 world I wanted to ask after the game 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.720
 shown by real madrid today in the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.660
 light match favorite candidate to win 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.880
 the league 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.020
 it's true that we talk about the 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.090
 absence that I'm going to have madrid in fact 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.730
 that 11 of ronaldo 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.400
 good of important people but in the end 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.790
 is that any level player 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.319
 very high right now and if it's true that 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.050
 right now maybe the atletico madrid 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.750
 it can be a little bit above so much 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.940
 madrid like from barcelona under my modest 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.349
 but good, well, we understand that 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.209
 is madrid the last five games with 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.760
 the level that you have is surely going to 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.900
 be very close to competing the title 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.900
 with him I say godmother 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.599
 yes, good evening, here behind 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.920
 josemaría naselo radio cooperative 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.290
 chile that commented in the chain be that 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.050
 hans martínez was sold to play titular 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.630
 in today's match as you have seen him in 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.070
 his debut on the team and how he sees it for 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.359
 the remaining games that remain if you create 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.040
 that will be able to matter the ownership 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.580
 Thank you 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.890
 frankly ok it 's pretty good from 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.390
 it has been quite pretty well 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.340
 we are happy hopefully you will contribute 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.440
 the five remaining matches because 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.820
 we need the 21 games that is the 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.990
 template one hundred percent and right now 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.500
 hang it is and therefore we are 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.500
 happy 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.449
 of 5 matches 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.020
 right now 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.879
 what are your accounts 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.069
 later it could be worth two matches two 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.389
 victories it 's impossible to realize how 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.470
 is the competition is very difficult 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.030
 win for team that is very down 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.099
 how is blake like getafe like those 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.750
 one like us is very difficult to do 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.490
 account only our goal is to take 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.810
 a victory more than Valladolid without 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.159
 value and win next week because no 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.020
 forces to make another one but at the moment 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:11.259
 we have to action the victory more than 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.349
 it and get a point to getafe like that 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.639
 to do get to 39 40 to 38 now 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.110
 same is impossible for the next 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.940
 we have to get to 33 the week that 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.159
 come we can not think of 38 because 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.750
 first of the 33 we cast a barrier of 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.210
 the 30 points that is costing us 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.539
 a lot to go out so think the 33 and then 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.539
 we will see 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.290
 very good thanks
