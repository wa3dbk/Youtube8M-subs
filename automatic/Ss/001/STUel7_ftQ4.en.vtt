in many ways the prestige range is an

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.160 
in many ways the prestige range is an
affordable<00:00:46.469> Legend<00:00:47.250> range<00:00:47.870> there's<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> lot<00:00:49.079> of

similarities<00:00:49.800> there<00:00:50.149> perhaps<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.360> bit<00:00:51.480> more

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
similarities there perhaps a bit more

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.470 
similarities there perhaps a bit more
similarities<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.070> pads<00:00:53.399> than<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> the

traditional<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.540> probably<00:01:06.720> noticed<00:01:07.170> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
traditional as you probably noticed that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.460 
traditional as you probably noticed that
pre-curved<00:01:07.890> sausage<00:01:08.400> fingers<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> there's<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
pre-curved sausage fingers so there's a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.679 
pre-curved sausage fingers so there's a
lot<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.650> pros<00:01:10.979> prefer<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:11.880> think<00:01:12.570> it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
lot of pros prefer that they think it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.149 
lot of pros prefer that they think it
offers<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.080> bit<00:01:13.260> more<00:01:13.409> protection<00:01:13.799> it's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
offers a little bit more protection it's

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.679 
offers a little bit more protection it's
a<00:01:14.189> bit<00:01:14.310> more<00:01:14.490> traditional<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.330> that's<00:01:15.540> how

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
a bit more traditional and that's how

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.679 
a bit more traditional and that's how
most<00:01:15.869> gloves<00:01:16.200> used<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:18.270> yeah<00:01:18.479> what<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
most gloves used to be and yeah what I

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.940 
most gloves used to be and yeah what I
quite<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.049> about<00:01:19.080> these<00:01:19.409> ones<00:01:19.590> normally<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
quite like about these ones normally a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.859 
quite like about these ones normally a
fun<00:01:20.159> sausage<00:01:20.520> fingers<00:01:20.850> little<00:01:21.030> bit<00:01:21.240> stiff<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
fun sausage fingers little bit stiff and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.170 
fun sausage fingers little bit stiff and
they're<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.830> know<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:22.979> very<00:01:23.130> flexible<00:01:23.759> these

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
they're you know not very flexible these

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.789 
they're you know not very flexible these
ones<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.479> seem<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:24.990> perhaps<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.560> tad<00:01:25.740> more

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
ones just seem to be perhaps a tad more

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.230 
ones just seem to be perhaps a tad more
flexible<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.549> most<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.880> everything<00:01:27.060> will

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
flexible and most of everything will

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.719 
flexible and most of everything will
take<00:01:27.390> too<00:01:27.600> long<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.080> wear<00:01:28.350> them<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.890> get

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
take too long to wear them in and get

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.160 
take too long to wear them in and get
them<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> really<00:01:30.210> mould<00:01:30.540> around<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.990> then<00:01:31.079> I'm

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
them to really mould around and then I'm

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.050 
them to really mould around and then I'm
told<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.500> when<00:01:31.650> after<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.670> used<00:01:32.850> them

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
on the bulky side if I'm honest you know

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.940 
on the bulky side if I'm honest you know
might<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.810> slight<00:01:49.110> criticism<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:49.799> you're

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
might be slight criticism but you're

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.740 
might be slight criticism but you're
seeing<00:01:50.130> unqualified<00:01:50.909> lives<00:01:51.240> these<00:01:51.390> days<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
seeing unqualified lives these days and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.969 
seeing unqualified lives these days and
you<00:01:51.810> certainly<00:01:51.990> know<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.290> getting<00:01:52.530> good

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
you certainly know it's getting good

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.679 
you certainly know it's getting good
protection<00:01:53.369> there<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:53.759> least<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.600> a

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
protection there at least it's a

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.130 
protection there at least it's a
sheepskin<00:01:55.200> leather<00:01:55.590> palm<00:01:55.890> very<00:01:56.430> supple

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
sheepskin leather palm very supple

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.030 
sheepskin leather palm very supple
another<00:01:58.140> thing<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.350> quite<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
another thing I quite like is on the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.249 
another thing I quite like is on the
thumb<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.430> don't<00:01:59.610> get<00:01:59.670> any<00:01:59.880> mesh<00:02:00.600> or<00:02:00.869> airflow

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
thumb you don't get any mesh or airflow

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.139 
thumb you don't get any mesh or airflow
unlike<00:02:01.560> quite<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.070> gloves<00:02:02.729> these<00:02:02.880> days

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
unlike quite a lot of gloves these days

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.340 
unlike quite a lot of gloves these days
and<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.689> makes<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.049> look<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.290> little

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
and I think that makes it look a little

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.179 
and I think that makes it look a little
more<00:02:04.560> traditional

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
more traditional

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.899 
more traditional
you're<00:02:05.880> getting<00:02:06.090> that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
you're getting that

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.740 
you're getting that
all<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.570> way<00:02:07.689> across<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.819> yeah<00:02:10.060> decent

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
all the way across and so yeah decent

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.880 
all the way across and so yeah decent
quality<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:11.200> course<00:02:11.500> you're<00:02:11.590> not<00:02:11.680> getting

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
quality of course you're not getting

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.860 
quality of course you're not getting
Pitt<00:02:12.099> hard<00:02:12.340> leather<00:02:12.580> which<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.510> seeing<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.840> lot

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
Pitt hard leather which is seeing a lot

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.479 
Pitt hard leather which is seeing a lot
of<00:02:14.110> top<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.530> gloves<00:02:14.980> but<00:02:15.160> you've<00:02:15.280> got<00:02:15.400> to

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
of top and gloves but you've got to

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.130 
of top and gloves but you've got to
remember<00:02:15.610> these<00:02:15.819> gloves<00:02:16.090> on<00:02:16.360> knock<00:02:16.629> top<00:02:16.900> and

remember these gloves on knock top and
despite<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.220> quality<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:18.760> most<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.870> press

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
despite the quality on most the press

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.289 
despite the quality on most the press
but<00:02:20.500> all<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.890> prestige<00:02:21.099> rage<00:02:21.549> being<00:02:21.940> top

but all of the prestige rage being top

level<00:02:29.920> protection<00:02:30.430> these<00:02:30.580> gloves<00:02:30.849> so<00:02:31.420> I

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
level protection these gloves so I

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.580 
level protection these gloves so I
actually<00:02:31.660> want<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.959> put<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.530> test

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
actually want to put that to the test

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.259 
actually want to put that to the test
and<00:02:33.069> see<00:02:33.310> for<00:02:33.459> myself

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269

subscriber<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:35.140> was<00:02:35.230> recommending<00:02:35.709> we<00:02:35.769> do<00:02:35.890> the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
subscriber I was recommending we do the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.039 
subscriber I was recommending we do the
mallet<00:02:36.280> test<00:02:36.519> whilst<00:02:36.819> holding<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.299> bat<00:02:37.510> now<00:02:37.750> so

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
mallet test whilst holding a bat now so

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.449 
mallet test whilst holding a bat now so
I<00:02:38.110> think<00:02:38.200> that's<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.560> good<00:02:38.739> idea<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.160> moving

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
I think that's a good idea so moving

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.130 
I think that's a good idea so moving
forward<00:02:39.730> we'll<00:02:39.849> do<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:40.720> I'll<00:02:40.810> start<00:02:41.049> by

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
forward we'll do that so I'll start by

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.780 
forward we'll do that so I'll start by
doing<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.440> top<00:02:41.709> hand<00:02:41.950> as<00:02:42.129> it<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.310> holding<00:02:42.670> this

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
doing the top hand as it is holding this

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:54.089 
doing the top hand as it is holding this
f-18<00:02:43.660> but<00:02:49.950> being<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:51.069> bit<00:02:51.340> but<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.980> think<00:02:53.980> myself

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
f-18 but being a bit but I think myself

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.800 
f-18 but being a bit but I think myself
pretty<00:02:54.519> hard<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:54.910> that's<00:02:55.150> pretty<00:02:55.510> good<00:02:55.720> as

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
pretty hard so that's pretty good as

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.830 
pretty hard so that's pretty good as
well<00:02:55.840> down<00:02:56.680> at<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.890> bottom<00:02:57.450> do<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.540> fingers

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
well down at the bottom do the fingers

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.000 
well down at the bottom do the fingers
first<00:03:03.870> much<00:03:04.870> better<00:03:05.140> protection<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.799> lead

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
first much better protection on the lead

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.830 
first much better protection on the lead
to<00:03:06.250> thing<00:03:06.519> is<00:03:06.670> if<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:06.879> had<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> criticism<00:03:07.329> if<00:03:07.750> you

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
to thing is if I had a criticism if you

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.420 
to thing is if I had a criticism if you
don't<00:03:08.049> actually<00:03:08.230> get<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.620> reinforcement

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
don't actually get the reinforcement

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.190 
don't actually get the reinforcement
fiber<00:03:09.700> reinforcement<00:03:10.629> on<00:03:10.780> these<00:03:10.959> other

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
fiber reinforcement on these other

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.599 
fiber reinforcement on these other
fingers<00:03:11.560> like<00:03:11.769> you<00:03:11.859> don't<00:03:12.040> quite<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.340> lot<00:03:12.459> with
