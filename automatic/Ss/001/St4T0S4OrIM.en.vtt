00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.109 
what it comes down to is basically
energy<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.530> two<00:01:37.740> different<00:01:37.950> ways<00:01:38.369> first<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
energy in two different ways first of

energy in two different ways first of
all<00:01:39.210> yes<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.750> were<00:01:39.869> paying<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.290> lot<00:01:40.500> more<00:01:40.670> for

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
all yes we were paying a lot more for

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.310 
all yes we were paying a lot more for
gasoline<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.420> were<00:01:42.509> paying<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.810> lot<00:01:42.990> more<00:01:43.020> at

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
gasoline we were paying a lot more at

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.130 
gasoline we were paying a lot more at
the<00:01:43.439> pump<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.640> cost<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.420> energy<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.020> our

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the pump but the cost of energy and our

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.100 
the pump but the cost of energy and our
homes<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:47.369> really<00:01:47.850> down<00:01:48.060> dramatically<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
homes was really down dramatically and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.429 
homes was really down dramatically and
that's<00:01:49.860> why<00:01:50.189> why<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.119> saw<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.960> number<00:01:52.110> B

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
that's why why we saw this this number B

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.030 
that's why why we saw this this number B

unlike<00:02:05.310> other<00:02:05.520> places<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.899> kind<00:02:07.140> of

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
unlike other places and so it's kind of

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.350 
unlike other places and so it's kind of
a<00:02:07.350> goofy<00:02:07.710> report<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.179> is

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
a goofy report but that's the way it is
