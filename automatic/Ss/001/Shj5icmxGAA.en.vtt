let's go a player let's just create a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.660 
let's go a player let's just create a
player<00:00:34.969> now<00:00:36.020> I've<00:00:37.020> had<00:00:37.530> experience<00:00:38.160> with

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
player now I've had experience with

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.600 
player now I've had experience with
quarterback<00:00:39.660> before<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.130> wanted<00:00:41.520> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
quarterback before now I wanted to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.340 
quarterback before now I wanted to
change<00:00:41.880> it<00:00:42.030> up<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.840> I'm<00:00:43.140> going<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.740> go<00:00:44.810> to<00:00:45.810> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
change it up so I'm going to go to a

wide<00:00:46.829> receiver<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:49.250> I<00:00:50.250> think<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.920> red<00:00:52.920> zone

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
wide receiver and I think that red zone
