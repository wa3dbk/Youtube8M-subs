00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.190 
suta bowls to store water and nutrients
the<00:00:41.340> thing<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.329> withstand<00:00:42.629> drought

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the thing is they can withstand drought

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.229 
the thing is they can withstand drought
much<00:00:43.530> better<00:00:43.829> because<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> psuedo<00:00:44.820> bulbs

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
much better because of the psuedo bulbs

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.840 
much better because of the psuedo bulbs
but<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> reality<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.100> keep<00:00:47.309> them<00:00:47.489> away

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
but the reality is if you keep them away

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.670 
but the reality is if you keep them away
to<00:00:47.910> dry<00:00:48.360> you're<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.870> Cydia<00:00:49.140> markets<00:00:49.500> will

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
to dry you're in Cydia markets will

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.010 
to dry you're in Cydia markets will

can<00:01:51.869> see<00:01:52.140> here<00:01:52.530> how<00:01:53.189> these<00:01:53.460> leaves<00:01:53.970> look<00:01:54.509> like

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
can see here how these leaves look like

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
can see here how these leaves look like
they<00:01:55.140> should<00:01:55.649> never<00:01:55.890> look<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.549> they

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
they should never look like this they

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
they should never look like this they
should<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.210> perfectly<00:01:57.750> straight<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.409> good

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
should be perfectly straight in good

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.249 
should be perfectly straight in good
conditions<00:01:59.549> not<00:02:00.119> watering<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.780> time<00:02:00.990> can

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
conditions not watering in time can

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
conditions not watering in time can
definitely<00:02:01.649> cause<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.250> low<00:02:02.700> humidity<00:02:03.329> can

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
definitely cause this low humidity can

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.359 
definitely cause this low humidity can
cause<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.960> as<00:02:04.110> well<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.560> mainly<00:02:04.829> not

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
cause this as well but mainly not

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.700 
cause this as well but mainly not
watering<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.000> time<00:02:06.270> now<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> leaves

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
watering in time now because the leaves

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.639 
watering in time now because the leaves
are<00:02:07.890> crinkly<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:09.060> flower<00:02:09.390> spike<00:02:09.929> might<00:02:10.410> not

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
are crinkly the flower spike might not

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.380 
are crinkly the flower spike might not
have<00:02:10.890> room

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
have room

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.240 
have room
to<00:02:11.480> grow<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.110> might<00:02:12.380> actually<00:02:12.590> kill<00:02:13.040> a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
to grow so you might actually kill a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.340 
to grow so you might actually kill a
flower<00:02:13.640> spike<00:02:14.030> because<00:02:14.240> you<00:02:14.660> do<00:02:14.810> not<00:02:14.930> see<00:02:14.990> it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
flower spike because you do not see it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.949 
flower spike because you do not see it
in<00:02:15.470> time<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:16.130> cannot<00:02:16.700> free<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.209> from<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.600> very

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
in time you cannot free it from the very

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.350 
in time you cannot free it from the very
accordion<00:02:18.560> shaped<00:02:18.860> leaves<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:19.850> these<00:02:20.030> are<00:02:20.240> the

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
accordion shaped leaves so these are the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.240 
accordion shaped leaves so these are the
few<00:02:20.600> problems<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.080> may<00:02:21.380> arise<00:02:21.530> if<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.040> don't

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
few problems that may arise if you don't

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.280 
few problems that may arise if you don't
water<00:02:22.459> oncidium<00:02:23.209> orchid<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.750> thyme

water oncidium orchid and thyme

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.110 
water oncidium orchid and thyme
not<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.830> mention<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.370> orchid<00:02:25.640> will<00:02:25.760> probably

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
not to mention the orchid will probably

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.360 
not to mention the orchid will probably
not<00:02:26.330> be<00:02:26.360> very<00:02:26.660> happy<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.530> new<00:02:27.680> growths<00:02:28.040> might

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
not be very happy the new growths might

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.610 
not be very happy the new growths might
be<00:02:28.550> smaller<00:02:28.820> than<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.240> previous<00:02:29.720> ones<00:02:30.020> and<00:02:30.320> so

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
be smaller than the previous ones and so

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.220 
be smaller than the previous ones and so
on<00:02:30.860> now<00:02:31.580> because<00:02:31.910> oncidium<00:02:32.330> orchids<00:02:32.750> like<00:02:32.840> to

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
on now because oncidium orchids like to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.260 
on now because oncidium orchids like to
stay<00:02:33.470> evenly<00:02:33.980> moist<00:02:34.340> we<00:02:34.700> call<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.090> like<00:02:35.240> that

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
stay evenly moist we call it like that

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.949 
stay evenly moist we call it like that
we<00:02:36.110> usually<00:02:36.500> use<00:02:36.740> a<00:02:36.980> mixture<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:38.060> sphagnum

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
we usually use a mixture of sphagnum

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.949 
we usually use a mixture of sphagnum
moss<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.620> bark<00:02:39.680> chips<00:02:40.190> now<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.239> will<00:02:41.450> really

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
moss and bark chips now this will really

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.810 
moss and bark chips now this will really
depend<00:02:42.380> on<00:02:42.470> your<00:02:42.530> environment<00:02:43.280> if<00:02:43.430> your

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
depend on your environment if your

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.360 
depend on your environment if your
environment<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.540> very<00:02:44.690> humid<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.709> water<00:02:46.070> does

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
environment is very humid and water does

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.790 
environment is very humid and water does
not<00:02:46.400> evaporate<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.390> fast<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:48.320> can<00:02:48.530> grow

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
not evaporate so fast you can grow

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.710 
not evaporate so fast you can grow
non-city<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.370> orchid<00:02:49.790> in<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:50.000> coarse<00:02:50.300> media

non-city of orchid in a coarse media

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.440 
non-city of orchid in a coarse media
like<00:02:51.019> bark<00:02:51.650> chips<00:02:51.980> but<00:02:52.550> if<00:02:52.640> your<00:02:52.790> environment

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
like bark chips but if your environment

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.570 
like bark chips but if your environment
is<00:02:53.600> rather<00:02:53.870> dry<00:02:54.320> or<00:02:54.620> rather<00:02:54.860> warm<00:02:55.310> and

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
is rather dry or rather warm and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.699 
is rather dry or rather warm and
actually<00:02:55.940> water<00:02:56.150> evaporates<00:02:56.780> very<00:02:56.870> fast<00:02:57.410> it

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
actually water evaporates very fast it

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.860 
actually water evaporates very fast it
is<00:02:57.739> a<00:02:57.860> good<00:02:58.100> idea<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.550> use<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.730> combination<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.600> a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
is a good idea to use a combination of a

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.870 
is a good idea to use a combination of a
water<00:03:00.170> retentive<00:03:00.620> media<00:03:01.040> like<00:03:01.310> sphagnum<00:03:01.550> moss

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
water retentive media like sphagnum moss

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.259 
water retentive media like sphagnum moss
and<00:03:02.090> some<00:03:02.930> bark<00:03:03.410> chips<00:03:03.500> for<00:03:04.010> aeration<00:03:04.489> because

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
and some bark chips for aeration because

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.360 
and some bark chips for aeration because
in<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.540> end<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.870> circuit<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.410> an<00:03:06.920> epiphyte

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
in the end the circuit is an epiphyte

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.970 
in the end the circuit is an epiphyte
and<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:08.060> needs<00:03:08.300> moisture<00:03:08.570> but<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.230> also<00:03:09.530> needs

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
and it needs moisture but it also needs

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.220 
and it needs moisture but it also needs
a<00:03:10.220> lot<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.489> ventilation<00:03:11.300> for<00:03:11.570> this<00:03:11.750> reason<00:03:12.080> I

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
a lot of ventilation for this reason I

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.500 
a lot of ventilation for this reason I
like<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.470> use<00:03:12.650> extra<00:03:13.519> ventilation<00:03:13.670> holes<00:03:14.300> in

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
like to use extra ventilation holes in

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.600 
like to use extra ventilation holes in
my<00:03:14.750> pots<00:03:15.050> if<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.470> know<00:03:15.590> my<00:03:15.739> videos<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:16.430> know

my pots if you know my videos you know

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.430 
my pots if you know my videos you know
that<00:03:16.640> most<00:03:17.060> of<00:03:17.209> my<00:03:17.360> work<00:03:17.570> is<00:03:17.690> have<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.170> and

that most of my work is have this and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.160 
that most of my work is have this and
for<00:03:19.070> me<00:03:19.100> it<00:03:19.549> works<00:03:20.299> really<00:03:20.630> great<00:03:20.900> with<00:03:21.019> our

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
for me it works really great with our

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.319 
for me it works really great with our
CDMS<00:03:21.620> they're<00:03:21.829> pretty<00:03:22.160> easy<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.730> handle<00:03:23.120> I

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.199 
CDMS they're pretty easy to handle I
don't<00:03:23.959> have<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.230> water<00:03:24.410> way<00:03:24.920> too<00:03:24.980> often<00:03:25.640> but

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
don't have to water way too often but

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.110 
don't have to water way too often but
the<00:03:26.600> pot<00:03:26.870> still<00:03:27.290> dries<00:03:27.590> out<00:03:27.799> in<00:03:28.010> about<00:03:28.250> five<00:03:28.760> to

the pot still dries out in about five to
ten<00:03:29.360> days<00:03:29.600> depends<00:03:30.200> on<00:03:30.290> my<00:03:30.440> environment<00:03:30.739> and

orchids<00:04:23.510> above<00:04:24.140> the<00:04:24.350> media<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:24.950> then<00:04:25.370> I<00:04:25.400> like

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
orchids above the media and then I like

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.310 
orchids above the media and then I like
to<00:04:25.790> leave<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.120> surrogate<00:04:26.480> sit<00:04:26.720> in<00:04:26.840> water<00:04:27.050> for

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
to leave the surrogate sit in water for

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.440 
to leave the surrogate sit in water for
about<00:04:27.350> 10<00:04:28.040> minutes<00:04:28.310> so<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.120> roots<00:04:29.300> get

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
about 10 minutes so the roots get

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.990 
about 10 minutes so the roots get
properly<00:04:30.020> soaked<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.710> media<00:04:31.130> soaks<00:04:31.520> in<00:04:31.790> some

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
properly soaked the media soaks in some

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.030 
properly soaked the media soaks in some
water<00:04:32.210> as<00:04:32.390> well<00:04:32.630> as<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:33.050> know<00:04:33.200> bark<00:04:33.530> does<00:04:33.770> not

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
water as well as you know bark does not

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.460 
water as well as you know bark does not
retain<00:04:34.220> that<00:04:34.790> much<00:04:35.030> water<00:04:35.330> so<00:04:35.600> in<00:04:36.020> about<00:04:36.140> 10

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
retain that much water so in about 10

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.410 
retain that much water so in about 10
minutes<00:04:36.650> or<00:04:36.890> 15<00:04:37.250> minutes<00:04:37.280> depends<00:04:38.120> how<00:04:38.240> I

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
minutes or 15 minutes depends how I

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.150 
minutes or 15 minutes depends how I
remember<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.020> come<00:04:39.170> back<00:04:39.350> I<00:04:39.560> will<00:04:39.650> remove<00:04:39.980> the

orchid<00:04:40.430> from<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.730> water<00:04:40.940> after<00:04:41.630> about<00:04:41.840> 10

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
don't need to soak the orchids because

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.409 
don't need to soak the orchids because
if<00:05:18.530> I<00:05:18.620> would<00:05:18.830> soak<00:05:19.100> them<00:05:19.400> they<00:05:19.970> would<00:05:20.180> stay

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
if I would soak them they would stay

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.720 
if I would soak them they would stay
moist<00:05:20.690> for<00:05:21.080> way<00:05:21.380> too<00:05:21.440> long<00:05:21.680> so<00:05:22.400> for<00:05:22.580> this

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
moist for way too long so for this

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.610 
moist for way too long so for this
reason<00:05:22.970> I<00:05:23.270> would<00:05:23.360> just<00:05:23.750> bring<00:05:23.990> them<00:05:24.230> to<00:05:24.470> the

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
reason I would just bring them to the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.860 
reason I would just bring them to the
sink<00:05:24.890> or<00:05:25.130> use<00:05:25.340> my<00:05:25.550> watering<00:05:25.940> can<00:05:26.000> but<00:05:26.840> just

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
sink or use my watering can but just

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.280 
sink or use my watering can but just
pour<00:05:27.380> water<00:05:27.410> on<00:05:28.040> top<00:05:28.790> of<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.120> media<00:05:29.480> just<00:05:30.200> like

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
pour water on top of the media just like

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.820 
pour water on top of the media just like
this

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
this

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.670 
this
so<00:05:31.010> no<00:05:31.490> soak<00:05:31.850> you<00:05:32.030> need<00:05:32.300> it<00:05:32.480> again<00:05:32.690> I<00:05:33.440> would

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
so no soak you need it again I would

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.710 
so no soak you need it again I would
leave<00:05:33.890> the<00:05:34.070> orchid<00:05:34.400> to<00:05:34.520> drink<00:05:34.790> very<00:05:35.030> well<00:05:35.300> in<00:05:35.570> a

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
leave the orchid to drink very well in a

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.380 
leave the orchid to drink very well in a
separate<00:05:36.260> dish<00:05:36.740> and<00:05:37.130> when<00:05:37.640> all<00:05:37.850> the<00:05:38.000> excessive

water<00:05:38.600> is<00:05:38.780> drained<00:05:39.110> I<00:05:39.290> would<00:05:39.560> just<00:05:39.770> place<00:05:40.130> back

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
water is drained I would just place back

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.460 
water is drained I would just place back
my<00:05:40.610> orchid<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.300> that's<00:05:41.930> about<00:05:42.140> it<00:05:42.350> on

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
my orchid and that's about it on

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.290 
my orchid and that's about it on
