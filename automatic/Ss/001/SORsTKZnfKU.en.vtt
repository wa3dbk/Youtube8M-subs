00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello everyone, so I came from the post office and 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.600
 immediately decided to sit down and take off in the form 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.849
 to show that it's my new 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.710
 parcel principle is the smallest 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.530
 parcel of those that I have at all 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.480
 were all for all the time of my orders 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.510
 INT nevertheless here is the book 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.869
 which I very much wanted for a long time I 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.000
 I probably hunted them for half a year and now 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.800
 I finally wash off order now 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.890
 let's open this with you 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.550
 the package is something that I myself can not wait 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.280
 get to know already cut the scotch in order 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.820
 especially not to waste time on it now 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.340
 I'll try to get these books out of there 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.879
 I have three books 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:49.410
 here they can these clinics 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.890
 that they finally have me so 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.079
 saw them on the video screens of others 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.329
 bloggers that now they have it 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.670
 that I can finally read them and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.760
 I will admire exactly my shelves 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.909
 I did not think that finally it will happen 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.820
 in general, many have probably guessed 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:13.040
 here I have seen three books of Alan 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.680
 bradley create and print them 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.140
 shook up the result of good 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 and because so here is to wind because 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.320
 that nothing is damaged use 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:32.120
 scissors for this very much already want 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:40.230
 feel look through open them long ago 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:43.320
 finally do open up god and 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.570
 is it really not me in order 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.840
 still so put it right first second 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.080
 and the third part 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.390
 Now a closer look will show that not yet seen 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.480
 knows maybe even those who are not 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.090
 know about this series so 1 book with us 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.850
 man's eyecup so beautiful 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.330
 bright colorful just east what 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.440
 finally hold her 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.810
 then the first part is sweetness on 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.030
 pie crust dial 2 first part 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.140
 This is a series which is only 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.459
 how much for five books is further wrap 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.950
 press on the second part as well 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:27.420
 ordered this weed beat bag 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.900
 to the executioners on such a little book and a third 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:35.840
 part i can pink so cute fabulous 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:40.320
 this is smoked herring without mustard in general 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.220
 of course there was no choice to take in soft 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.570
 the cover of them, well, I didnâ€™t want these 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.120
 beautiful books I had in solid 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.970
 the cover served me for a very, very long time 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.980
 so I wanted to still buy them in 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.260
 hard cover despite the fact that of course 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.840
 their cost is simply transcendental and I 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.730
 I found all three parts to be well though 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.030
 the first three parts only on one of 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.709
 all sites where I usually 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.930
 ordering books for many and just not for 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.450
 some and only there is soft 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.600
 cover another thread on some there 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.640
 transcendental price in general, I found one on 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.070
 which in principle is also not worth it 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.769
 expensive pretty expensive came for 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.640
 These 3 books I do not lay out the amount of Maliku 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.640
 but I wanted from therefore I did not regret that 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.569
 spent that money and finally did i 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.340
 received 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.889
 to the fact that I really hunted them but 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.469
 a very very long time and now 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:39.359
 wildest delight that I can now read 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:41.879
 these three books are only natural 5 6 4 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.370
 the part is called Ali is cut off and the patient 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.500
 and 5 am broadcasting from the tomb 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.659
 title of course gorgeous true i 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.939
 but such original names are not 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.310
 met anywhere 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:55.200
 but unfortunately those two books they were in 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.650
 available on this site but they are so 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.930
 even more expensive than these three parts and 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.219
 the first three parts so I already decided 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.129
 what is possible as if later I will order them 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:09.900
 how is it possible they will fall in price though 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.669
 this is unlikely to be a real cat 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.889
 cheaper but still decided 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.489
 fork out just inside the part i 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.840
 East now I put on the shelf and 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.759
 be sure to start reading soon because 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.539
 what is possible stalin does it not know 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:27.210
 can I wait until summer until that time 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.430
 which end the session is already practice 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.830
 in general, all this will pass I can so 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.889
 sit quietly enjoy your holidays 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.479
 read these books in general yes here is such a 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.690

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.630
