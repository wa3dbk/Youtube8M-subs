game is just going to give you a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.080 
game is just going to give you a
touchdown<00:00:26.010> there's<00:00:26.189> nothing<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.730> was<00:00:26.910> going<00:00:27.029> to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
touchdown there's nothing I was going to

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.509 
touchdown there's nothing I was going to
do<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:28.050> prevent<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.590> from<00:00:28.650> being<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.130> score

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
do to prevent this from being a score

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.669 
do to prevent this from being a score
and<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.119> way<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.449> game<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:31.019> kind<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.380> nerfs

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and the way the game it kind of nerfs

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.799 
and the way the game it kind of nerfs
itself<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:32.730> lack<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.149> better<00:00:33.180> term<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
itself for lack of a better term is a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.290 
itself for lack of a better term is a
little<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.440> crazy<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.550> almost<00:00:35.700> makes<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
little bit crazy and it almost makes you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.910 
little bit crazy and it almost makes you
feel<00:00:36.450> bad<00:00:36.750> as<00:00:37.050> things<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.620> occur

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
feel bad as things like this occur

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.200 
feel bad as things like this occur
generally<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.520> frustrating<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.059> because

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
generally it's frustrating you because

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.970 
generally it's frustrating you because
it's<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> computer<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.989> does<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
it's the computer that does it but the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.310 
it's the computer that does it but the
way<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.370> game<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.910> hands<00:00:42.239> things<00:00:42.570> out<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
way the game just hands things out is a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.049 
way the game just hands things out is a
little<00:00:43.739> bit<00:00:43.890> insane<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.489> watch<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.940> from

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
little bit insane to watch this from

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.000 
little bit insane to watch this from
balanced<00:00:45.480> perspective<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.170> some

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
balanced perspective you know some

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.709 
balanced perspective you know some
people<00:00:47.039> some<00:00:47.550> commentators<00:00:48.000> might<00:00:48.360> take<00:00:48.570> this

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
people some commentators might take this

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.750 
people some commentators might take this
as<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> great<00:00:49.230> play<00:00:49.530> or<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.280> know<00:00:50.399> look<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
as a great play or you know look at the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.549 
as a great play or you know look at the
stick<00:00:51.059> skills<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.840> me<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> look<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
stick skills I have to me I look at the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.310 
stick skills I have to me I look at the
complete<00:00:52.829> opposite<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.430> mean<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.090> all

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
complete opposite I mean this is all

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.569 
complete opposite I mean this is all
defensive<00:00:55.320> manipulation<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.160> give<00:00:56.370> me<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
defensive manipulation to give me a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.610 
defensive manipulation to give me a
touchdown<00:00:57.090> nothing<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.590> was

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
touchdown nothing I was going to do was

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
touchdown nothing I was going to do was
going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> impede<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.370> short<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.910> running

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
going to impede that short of running

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.090 
going to impede that short of running
backwards<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.899> mean<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> first<00:01:01.680> thing<00:01:01.920> you'll

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
backwards I mean the first thing you'll

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.219 
backwards I mean the first thing you'll
notice<00:01:02.219> ballard<00:01:02.820> hits<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> gap<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.080> can

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
notice ballard hits the gap and you can

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.590 
notice ballard hits the gap and you can
see<00:01:04.379> right<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> defensive<00:01:05.369> tackle<00:01:05.790> very

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
see right here the defensive tackle very

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.899 
see right here the defensive tackle very
little<00:01:07.110> understanding<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:08.010> gap<00:01:08.369> control<00:01:08.880> I

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
little understanding of gap control I

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.820 
little understanding of gap control I
mean<00:01:09.240> certainly<00:01:09.479> he's<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.080> situation<00:01:10.260> right

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
mean certainly he's in a situation right

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.380 
mean certainly he's in a situation right
now<00:01:10.890> where<00:01:11.040> he<00:01:11.340> could<00:01:11.520> square<00:01:11.850> me<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.180> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
now where he could square me up and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.060 
now where he could square me up and
instead<00:01:12.720> he<00:01:12.900> decides<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.439> run<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
instead he decides to run right in the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.179 
instead he decides to run right in the
back<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.750> nose<00:01:15.960> tackle<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:17.040> they

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
back of the nose tackle and then they

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.760 
back of the nose tackle and then they
kind<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.670> run<00:01:18.119> around<00:01:18.240> each<00:01:18.630> other<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.110> pursuit

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
kind of run around each other in pursuit

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.499 
kind of run around each other in pursuit
of<00:01:19.860> me<00:01:20.040> which<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.580> know<00:01:20.670> again<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> little

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
of me which you know again is a little

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.660 
of me which you know again is a little
bit<00:01:21.630> crazy<00:01:21.840> I've<00:01:22.409> got<00:01:22.619> Richie<00:01:22.830> incognito<00:01:23.009> here

who's apparently still into bullying

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.010 
who's apparently still into bullying
because<00:01:25.409> he<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:26.009> destroys<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.479> corner<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
because he just destroys this corner I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080 
because he just destroys this corner I
mean<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.229> lays<00:01:28.770> him<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> ground<00:01:29.579> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
mean just lays him on the ground and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
that's okay I don't mind that but the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160 
that's okay I don't mind that but the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
is going to be and for some reason maybe

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.200 
is going to be and for some reason maybe
the<00:01:43.890> avoidance<00:01:44.280> detection<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:44.970> play

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
worked but I was able to kind of scoot

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.940 
worked but I was able to kind of scoot
around<00:01:47.579> incognito<00:01:48.479> pretty<00:01:48.869> much<00:01:49.049> unaffected

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
around incognito pretty much unaffected

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.590 
around incognito pretty much unaffected
and<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.250> actually<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.790> taken<00:01:51.180> away<00:01:51.360> by<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and I was actually so taken away by the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.200 
and I was actually so taken away by the
block<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.259> also<00:01:52.710> noticed<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.340> number<00:01:53.610> 34<00:01:54.060> was

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
block I also noticed that number 34 was

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.670 
block I also noticed that number 34 was
coming<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.780> said<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> myself<00:01:55.140> ok<00:01:55.560> this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
coming in and I said to myself ok this

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.170 
coming in and I said to myself ok this
is<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> end<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.640> because

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
is going to be the end of it because

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.760 
is going to be the end of it because
he's<00:01:57.360> gonna<00:01:57.509> tackle<00:01:57.810> me<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.320> had<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.439> slow

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
he's gonna tackle me I just had to slow

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.050 
he's gonna tackle me I just had to slow
down<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.250> gonna<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.520> able<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.700> accelerate

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
down I'm not gonna be able to accelerate

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
down I'm not gonna be able to accelerate
fast<00:02:00.509> enough<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.049> instead<00:02:01.770> he<00:02:01.950> kind<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
fast enough and instead he kind of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.420 
fast enough and instead he kind of
shifts<00:02:02.790> into<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.600> weird<00:02:04.079> dragging<00:02:04.979> tackle

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
shifts into this weird dragging tackle

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.520 
shifts into this weird dragging tackle
that<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.579> can<00:02:05.820> run<00:02:06.000> through<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:06.990> McBride

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
that I can run through and then McBride

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.440 
that I can run through and then McBride
he's<00:02:07.979> actually<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> trip<00:02:08.879> over<00:02:09.030> number

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
he's actually going to trip over number

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.600 
he's actually going to trip over number
30<00:02:09.660> 40<00:02:10.080> can't<00:02:10.349> really<00:02:10.530> tell<00:02:10.739> too<00:02:10.950> well<00:02:11.129> but<00:02:11.520> he

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
30 40 can't really tell too well but he

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.230 
30 40 can't really tell too well but he
actually<00:02:11.790> trips<00:02:12.270> over<00:02:12.599> him<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.900> then

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
actually trips over him and then

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.300 
actually trips over him and then
he<00:02:13.330> actually<00:02:13.540> gets<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:14.020> better<00:02:14.260> tackle<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:14.980> I'm

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
he actually gets a better tackle and I'm

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.890 
he actually gets a better tackle and I'm
thinking<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.640> myself<00:02:15.700> okay<00:02:16.150> I'm<00:02:16.420> leaning

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
thinking to myself okay I'm leaning

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.720 
thinking to myself okay I'm leaning
forward<00:02:17.350> now<00:02:17.500> there's<00:02:17.740> no<00:02:17.950> way<00:02:18.130> he's<00:02:18.340> not<00:02:18.370> just

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
forward now there's no way he's not just

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.190 
forward now there's no way he's not just
going<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.940> drag<00:02:19.300> me<00:02:19.540> into<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.870> ground<00:02:19.900> with

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
going to drag me into the ground with

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.470 
going to drag me into the ground with
his<00:02:20.290> weight<00:02:20.620> but<00:02:21.190> instead<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.580> blow<00:02:22.240> through

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
his weight but instead I blow through

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.270 
his weight but instead I blow through
that<00:02:22.630> tackle<00:02:23.020> as<00:02:23.140> well<00:02:23.350> now<00:02:23.950> i'm<00:02:24.130> watching

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
that tackle as well now i'm watching

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.190 
that tackle as well now i'm watching
Kiwanuka<00:02:25.150> come<00:02:25.360> up<00:02:25.480> behind<00:02:25.630> me<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:25.990> I<00:02:26.140> know

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
that he's faster than me because he's

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.370

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
is going to be the end but then all of a

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.110 
is going to be the end but then all of a
sudden<00:02:35.770> he<00:02:36.040> must<00:02:36.250> have<00:02:36.340> seen<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.550> cheerleader

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
now it's the best time to get down on a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.780 
now it's the best time to get down on a
knee<00:02:41.020> in<00:02:41.500> proposed<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:42.190> mean<00:02:42.490> he<00:02:42.610> basically

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
knee in proposed I mean he basically

just<00:02:43.150> crumbles<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.440> pile<00:02:44.680> behind<00:02:44.890> me<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:45.370> at

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
just crumbles in a pile behind me so at

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.520 
just crumbles in a pile behind me so at
this<00:02:45.610> point<00:02:45.910> I'm<00:02:46.150> pretty<00:02:46.660> amazed<00:02:47.140> by<00:02:47.500> what

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
this point I'm pretty amazed by what

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.020 
this point I'm pretty amazed by what
I've<00:02:47.860> seen<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.160> I'm<00:02:48.430> not<00:02:48.550> really<00:02:48.730> paying

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
I've seen so I'm not really paying

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.060 
I've seen so I'm not really paying
attention<00:02:49.240> all<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.410> much<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.650> what<00:02:50.980> I'm

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
attention all that much to what I'm

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.340 
attention all that much to what I'm
doing<00:02:51.460> and<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:52.030> start<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.690> get<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.900> little<00:02:52.990> bit

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
doing and I start to get a little bit

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.220 
doing and I start to get a little bit
out<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.500> bounds<00:02:53.920> as<00:02:54.070> I<00:02:54.760> do<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.120> bromley<00:02:55.960> just

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
out of bounds as I do that bromley just

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.740 
out of bounds as I do that bromley just
surges<00:02:56.710> out<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:57.070> nowhere<00:02:57.310> into<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.480> ground

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
surges out of nowhere into the ground

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.290 
surges out of nowhere into the ground
trips<00:02:59.260> up<00:02:59.470> McClain<00:03:00.040> who<00:03:00.640> really<00:03:01.000> isn't
