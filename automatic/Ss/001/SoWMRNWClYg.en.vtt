things where you know what when you see
it<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.650> isn't<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> smoking<00:01:23.460> gun<00:01:23.490> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it there isn't a smoking gun it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.999 
it there isn't a smoking gun it's
possible<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.930> smoking<00:01:25.320> gun<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.619> somewhere<00:01:25.950> on

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
possible the smoking gun is somewhere on

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.340

Tom Brady self only refused to surrender
for<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.950> investigation<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.960> think<00:01:31.619> that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
for the investigation but I I think that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.460 
for the investigation but I I think that
when<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.009> look<00:01:32.310> at<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:34.140> come<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
when you look at all of it you come to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.050 
when you look at all of it you come to
the<00:01:34.560> conclusion<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:35.130> something<00:01:35.610> happened

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the conclusion that something happened

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.560 
the conclusion that something happened
what<00:01:36.479> surprised<00:01:36.990> me<00:01:37.170> though<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:39.000> PSI

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
what surprised me though is that the PSI

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.350 
what surprised me though is that the PSI
measurements<00:01:40.229> from<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> footballs<00:01:41.700> weren't

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
measurements from the footballs weren't

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.030 
measurements from the footballs weren't
nearly<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.750> glaring<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.439> we've<00:01:43.619> been<00:01:43.649> led<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
nearly as glaring as we've been led to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.679 
nearly as glaring as we've been led to
believe<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.579> were<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.149> that's<00:01:45.450> where

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
believe they were and that that's where

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
can the Commissioner be the one who

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.090 
can the Commissioner be the one who
makes<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.600> final<00:03:59.810> decision<00:03:59.990> here<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:00.800> then

figure out how to balance the integrity
game
