a few of the differences in these two
and<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.110> set<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> camera<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> stand

and I set the camera back on the stand
for<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.850> part<00:01:19.729> bear<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:20.970> me<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.299> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
for that part bear with me for just a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.820 
for that part bear with me for just a
second

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.260 

now<00:01:25.830> from<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.240> level<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.799> see<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
now from this level you can see that the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
now from this level you can see that the
newer<00:01:30.450> winda<00:01:30.869> did<00:01:31.500> come<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> stand

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
newer winda did come with a stand

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.080 
newer winda did come with a stand
whereas<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> old<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.930> did<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.790> what<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> old

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
whereas the old one did not what the old

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.950 
whereas the old one did not what the old
one<00:01:36.299> came<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.950> was<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.850> few<00:01:39.060> blocks<00:01:39.479> on

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
one came with was just a few blocks on

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.649 
one came with was just a few blocks on
the<00:01:40.049> bottom<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.590> build<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:42.509> get

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the bottom to build it up and you get

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.060 
the bottom to build it up and you get
the<00:01:42.869> pretend<00:01:43.770> flick<00:01:44.070> fire<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.180> blue

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
the pretend flick fire there that blue

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.109 
the pretend flick fire there that blue
that's<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.520> flick<00:01:47.729> fire<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.090> just

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that's not really flick fire it just

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.160 
that's not really flick fire it just
looks<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.200> would<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:50.780> now<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.020> new

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
looks like it would be now on the new

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.520 
looks like it would be now on the new
one<00:01:52.430> underneath<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.729> there<00:01:54.119> are<00:01:54.329> two<00:01:54.720> actual

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
one underneath it there are two actual

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.819 
one underneath it there are two actual
flip<00:01:55.740> fire<00:01:55.950> they're<00:01:56.790> hidden<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.770> turn

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
flip fire they're hidden but if I turn

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.539 
flip fire they're hidden but if I turn
it<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.460> think<00:02:00.390> you'll<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.659> able<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.899> see<00:02:01.549> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
it I think you'll be able to see the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.160 
it I think you'll be able to see the
blue<00:02:02.820> underneath<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:05.450> those<00:02:06.450> are<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
blue underneath there those are the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.670 
blue underneath there those are the
flick<00:02:07.409> fire<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.069> set

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.520 

and<00:02:13.680> like<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.099> said<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.970> totally<00:02:15.480> extra<00:02:15.900> on

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
and like I said this is totally extra on

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.190 
and like I said this is totally extra on
the<00:02:16.709> new<00:02:16.860> set<00:02:17.540> kind<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.630> hard<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.810> get<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.050> new

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
the new set kind of hard to get the new

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.330 
the new set kind of hard to get the new
set<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.830> stay<00:02:20.069> still<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.739> also<00:02:22.739> this<00:02:23.069> figure

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
set to stay still and also this figure

bit show you it's better this is the old
one<00:02:59.910> and<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> new<00:03:01.140> one<00:03:01.849> now<00:03:02.849> overall

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
one and this is the new one now overall

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.809 
one and this is the new one now overall
I<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.410> new<00:03:04.590> set<00:03:04.860> better<00:03:05.069> but<00:03:05.430> when

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
I like the the new set better but when

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.180 
I like the the new set better but when
it<00:03:05.910> comes<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.209> r2d2<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.989> actually<00:03:07.590> kind<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.010> like

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
it comes to r2d2 I actually kind of like

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.820 
it comes to r2d2 I actually kind of like
the<00:03:08.670> older<00:03:09.030> one<00:03:09.180> because<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.440> silver

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
the older one because of the the silver

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.520 
the older one because of the the silver
I<00:03:11.010> like<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.730> way<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:12.480> covers<00:03:12.870> all<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.410> on

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
I like the way it covers all of it on

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.550 
I like the way it covers all of it on
the<00:03:13.799> new<00:03:13.950> headpiece<00:03:14.780> but<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:16.049> using<00:03:16.350> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
the new headpiece but I like using the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.270 
the new headpiece but I like using the
silver<00:03:16.950> instead<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.519> grey<00:03:19.070> but<00:03:20.070> maybe

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
silver instead of the grey but maybe

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.220 
silver instead of the grey but maybe
that's<00:03:20.459> just<00:03:20.609> me

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
that's just me

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.099 
that's just me
there's<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.350> back<00:03:26.000> then<00:03:27.000> we<00:03:27.150> have<00:03:27.359> Anakin

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
there's the back then we have Anakin

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.920 
there's the back then we have Anakin
here<00:03:28.350> who<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.310> new<00:03:29.459> set<00:03:29.790> actually<00:03:30.720> just

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
here who in the new set actually just

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.949 
here who in the new set actually just
does<00:03:31.380> get<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.829> hairpiece<00:03:32.329> whereas<00:03:33.329> he<00:03:33.540> does<00:03:33.780> not

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
does get a hairpiece whereas he does not

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.180 
does get a hairpiece whereas he does not
in<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.410> old<00:03:34.590> one<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.569> make<00:03:36.750> them<00:03:36.900> even<00:03:37.190> put

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
in the old one so to make them even put

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.360 
in the old one so to make them even put
that<00:03:38.340> on<00:03:38.400> there<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:39.859> obviously<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:41.069> new<00:03:41.220> one

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
that on there and obviously the new one

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.430 
that on there and obviously the new one
is<00:03:41.549> skin<00:03:42.209> color<00:03:42.480> where<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.870> old<00:03:43.109> one<00:03:43.319> was

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
is skin color where the old one was

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.270 
is skin color where the old one was
yellow<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:46.200> see<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.470> differences<00:03:46.950> in<00:03:47.010> the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
yellow and see the differences in the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.879 
yellow and see the differences in the
printing<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.819> all<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.239> lot<00:03:49.170> more<00:03:49.350> detailed<00:03:49.739> on

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
printing and all a lot more detailed on

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.069 
printing and all a lot more detailed on
the<00:03:49.920> newer<00:03:50.130> one<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:51.389> old<00:03:51.510> one<00:03:51.660> only<00:03:51.930> has

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
the newer one and the old one only has

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.220 
the newer one and the old one only has
one<00:03:52.350> face<00:03:52.620> whereas<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.700> new<00:03:53.910> one<00:03:54.120> also<00:03:54.900> has

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
one face whereas the new one also has

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.129 
one face whereas the new one also has
this<00:03:55.889> second<00:03:56.340> face<00:03:56.489> on<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.760> back<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.389> some

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
this second face on the back and some

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.420 
this second face on the back and some
back<00:03:58.319> printing<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.870> those<00:04:01.530> are<00:04:01.769> most<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.340> the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
back printing so those are most of the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.729 
back printing so those are most of the
differences<00:04:02.850> in<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.150> set<00:04:03.389> no<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.470> course

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
differences in the set no of course

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.430 
differences in the set no of course
there<00:04:04.889> are<00:04:04.980> some<00:04:05.130> other<00:04:05.310> little<00:04:05.609> things<00:04:06.440> I

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
there are some other little things I

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.030 
there are some other little things I
couldn't<00:04:08.340> move<00:04:08.489> this<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.290> in<00:04:10.290> addition<00:04:10.920> to

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
couldn't move this and in addition to

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.729 
couldn't move this and in addition to
the<00:04:11.130> ship<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.579> new<00:04:12.299> one<00:04:12.510> came<00:04:12.959> with<00:04:13.200> this<00:04:13.410> and

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
the ship the new one came with this and

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.659 
the ship the new one came with this and
this<00:04:14.579> is<00:04:14.730> what<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:14.970> old<00:04:15.150> one<00:04:15.329> came<00:04:15.510> with<00:04:15.569> I

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
this is what the old one came with I

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.740 
this is what the old one came with I
wish<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.849> new<00:04:17.970> one<00:04:18.090> would<00:04:18.239> stop<00:04:18.450> moving

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
wish the new one would stop moving

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.550 
wish the new one would stop moving

consideration<00:04:28.560> like<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:29.340> said<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.639> old<00:04:29.849> one

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
consideration like I said the old one

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.200 
consideration like I said the old one
only<00:04:30.270> costs<00:04:30.660> $20<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.319> new<00:04:31.440> one<00:04:31.560> cost<00:04:31.770> 50<00:04:32.210> but

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
only costs $20 the new one cost 50 but

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.300 
only costs $20 the new one cost 50 but
of<00:04:33.300> course<00:04:33.449> that's<00:04:33.690> when<00:04:34.319> they<00:04:34.770> were<00:04:34.830> released

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
of course that's when they were released

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.850 
of course that's when they were released
the<00:04:36.090> old<00:04:36.270> one<00:04:36.449> I<00:04:36.599> don't<00:04:36.780> know<00:04:36.900> what<00:04:37.139> it's<00:04:37.440> worth

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
the old one I don't know what it's worth

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.159 
the old one I don't know what it's worth
