really<00:00:37.559> easy<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> do<00:00:38.070> i<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.399> believe<00:00:38.820> that

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
really easy to do i do believe that

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.150 
really easy to do i do believe that
rockstar<00:00:40.200> did<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.620> purpose<00:00:40.649> because

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
rockstar did this on purpose because

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.850 
rockstar did this on purpose because
there<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.730> five<00:00:42.059> per<00:00:42.480> day<00:00:42.750> cap<00:00:43.230> limit<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.829> you

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
there is a five per day cap limit so you

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.650 
there is a five per day cap limit so you
can<00:00:44.070> only<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.489> five<00:00:44.730> times<00:00:44.760> per<00:00:45.270> day<00:00:45.450> i

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
can only do this five times per day i

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
can only do this five times per day i
suggest<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.320> take<00:00:46.500> advantage<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.520> I

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that I don't see how this could possibly

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.490 
that I don't see how this could possibly
get<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.210> trouble<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.230> simply

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
get you in trouble this is simply

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.990 
get you in trouble this is simply
something<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.949> rockstar<00:01:02.430> has<00:01:02.460> put<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
something that rockstar has put in the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
something that rockstar has put in the
game<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> minimum<00:01:04.979> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
