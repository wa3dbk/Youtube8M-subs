00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.570
 guys who were just as thirsty and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.760
 we have worked I am in the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.340
 bodytech gym in the city of Lima 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.960
 Peru today I want to talk about something 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.840
 that very often comes to me 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.150
 asking every day either via 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.619
 messages in the comments and that is 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.590
 many people when they perform the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.180
 exercises do not really feel that the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.280
 muscle that is supposedly fine 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.470
 working is doing 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.660
 account that although its strength is 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.239
 increasing week to week they raise 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.579
 much more weight than what they raised 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.289
 weeks ago months ago or years ago 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.170
 they see progress in themselves visual physics not 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.890
 has changed a lot who owes guys to 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.980
 that people when they go to train 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.129
 with weights mainly focus on 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.850
 lift as much weight as possible as 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.130
 of place in each repetition 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.479
 and if you realize the bodybuilding 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.520
 itself is not based on that although the 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.460
 bodybuilding supports that one should 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.380
 look to lift a good weight go 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.140
 progressing week by week on the weight 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.750
 in what as much as possible you can 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.750
 because the priority here in the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.259
 bodybuilding is that you seek to give 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.909
 the greatest possible tension to the muscle that 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.409
 are you looking to work in the first 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.170
 place you have to know how to differentiate the 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.050
 bodybuilding of other sports by 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.390
 example the facelift favor that your 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.909
 main objective is to lift the maximum 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.100
 excellent possible weight that is the 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.869
 goal that they have do everything 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.119
 possible apply the techniques in 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.729
 exercises that allow them to lift the 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.270
 maximum possible weight explosively 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.450
 ok now that fisicoculturismo 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.970
 try to see how how you can 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.920
 look good how they can have muscle 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.229
 where you want to burn the excess fat 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.420
 body that you have or that is to look like you 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.560
 You want to look your body's body 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.050
 your dreams 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.470
 For this you must focus on giving the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.959
 more tension to the muscle that you are 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.500
 looking for work so your priority 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.050
 it must be that every time you train in 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.260
 complete first in this to find the 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.140
 muscle and then just think about the weight 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.660
 what are you raising that should be your 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.099
 mentality at the time of training like this 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.170
 that when you're doing exercises 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.150
 such as the flat bench press 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.250
 I do not extract these strange movements 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.100
 to be able to take the bar towards 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.569
 up you if you can not use that weight 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.400
 okay 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.510
 it takes away your attention and the muscle that 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.120
 you want to work in this case the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.680
 pectorals then lowers the weight ok is 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.080
 very important that you always have 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.440
 present that your body is going to look for the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.410
 way to send attention to all 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.110
 possible muscles to move the weight 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.480
 but that goes that means that the 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.099
 Attention to where you supposedly want 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.390
 that goes only in this case the 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.630
 pectorals 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.640
 miss so I have always present 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.440
