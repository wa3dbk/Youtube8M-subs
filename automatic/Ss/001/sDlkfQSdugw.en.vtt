this one of the many ones with Bob the
computers<00:02:44.470> are<00:02:44.709> great<00:02:45.489> in<00:02:46.120> here<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:47.170> many

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
computers are great in here the so many

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.990 
computers are great in here the so many
come<00:02:47.620> here<00:02:47.859> is<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.310> can<00:02:48.459> always<00:02:48.730> find

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
come here is that you can always find

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.030 
come here is that you can always find
somewhere<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.840> sit<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.200> sort<00:02:50.829> of<00:02:50.859> work

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
somewhere to sit and sort of work

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.009 
somewhere to sit and sort of work
independently<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:52.000> think<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.480> lot<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.630> students

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
independently I think a lot of students

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.599 
independently I think a lot of students
get<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.200> lot<00:02:53.350> out<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.680> as<00:02:53.889> well<00:02:54.069> because

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
get a lot out of that as well because

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.640 
get a lot out of that as well because
obviously<00:02:55.329> all<00:02:55.660> these<00:02:55.810> independent<00:02:56.470> learning

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
obviously all these independent learning

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.800 
obviously all these independent learning
areas<00:02:57.100> you're<00:02:57.280> kind<00:02:57.489> of<00:02:57.639> encouraged<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.660> take

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
areas you're kind of encouraged to take

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.270 
areas you're kind of encouraged to take
things<00:02:59.109> in<00:02:59.260> your<00:02:59.440> own<00:02:59.590> hands<00:02:59.829> a<00:03:00.010> lot<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
things in your own hands a lot of the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.250 
things in your own hands a lot of the
time<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.730> when<00:03:01.299> with<00:03:01.480> your<00:03:01.630> course<00:03:01.840> work<00:03:02.079> with
