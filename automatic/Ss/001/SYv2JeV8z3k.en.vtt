00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.090
 we are on the road on this sunny day 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.330
 continued 2 Arie Teeuwisse engines 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.739
 the softtail family here the softtail 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.770
 breakout 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.660
 and so or very clever he can tell you 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.280
 what your experience with these engines 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.080
 the two is yes then I can certainly 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.670
 tell as you said they both come 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.350
 from the software family 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.480
 the would you think we are going a bit 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.460
 compare or even apples with pears 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.870
 comparing my apples 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.260
 yet they are very different 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.390
 engines you sit on this one 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.710
 it is cheeks so you are the other way around 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.540
 then again 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.729
 who is shorter and crowded and bases 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.890
 footboard has here and 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.600
 for being paddles as they say there is 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.479
 you lose your 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.690
 I'm so supportive of 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.320
 breathing movement 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.490
 from the power figures family and there with 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.960
 I like those footboards because 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.340
 you then 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.540
 percent and chaff for sitting in one 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.390
 strange when can do 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.100
 and that all finds bed and over the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.990
 styling because they are two what you just got 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.480
 said two very different software 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.280
 models are also there for details 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.230
 to say about it 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.330
 well they are all two singed on 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.030
 the classic style that harry yes 110 years 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.800
 or even more than to perform the decade 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.500
 so yes she said to recognize from afar 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.600
 of course but every time they already know there 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.030
 to do something else again by 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.210
 on the breakout for example the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.060
 speedometer on the steering wheel 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.920
 with the smart he is driving on the tank 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.380
 differ from each other 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.899
 Saddles are different here is another one 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.209
 I think something comfortable saddle on 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.980
 a small room that you put on the 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.020
 for the duo passenger i would not be there 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.750
 like a duo passenger or sit down 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.340
 because then I would rather have something 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.840
 want a bigger saddle because that 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.790
 keep it not really long on full 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.440
 but it is not really intended 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.780
 people behind 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.320
 yes it has also blended very nice ones 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.700
 sprayed tank with large wheels that he 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.000
 wire wheels 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.590
 which they all already a bit 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.150
 personalized as it is called well as 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.160
 you buy such a motorcycle 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.170
 anyone who fought a handicap 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.620
 something and occasionally here to even more 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.340
 his own taste from sample eh yes there 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.989
 fog 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.160
 they all look like those harry's 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.160
 with is a cell in everyone 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.640
 we were just talking about the styling of the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.070
 engines to these engines are special 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.650
 for style built in to the classic 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.489
 Harley style 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.480
 and to give it a personal touch too 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.220
 to give 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.250
 what have they done well you see it 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.760
 here they have the air filter in grams 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.799
 left the exhaust pipe blackened 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.260
 cast wheels and then that wide tire 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.269
 what I was just talking about 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.970
 there they have the air filter on the 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.930
 smart black and have taken 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.500
 exhaust pipes 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.200
 with that narrow band I advise everyone 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.040
 and want to buy a diesel engine about that 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.250
 think go first try a good rider 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.900
 piece up and then feel how it goes 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.630
 I cannot warn this enough 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.030
 very beautiful but too expensive 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.730
 as I just said more mileage 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.290
 makes that tape stick and goes 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.870
 increasingly difficult the bomb 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.889
 that will eventually become a disadvantage and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.690
 then you have to go earlier 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.880
 replace your tire well you can 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.940
 imagine that such a broadband is not 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.919
 that hangs between the cheap bands 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.120
 a lot cheaper but also goes 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.889
 last longer 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.470
 the things to keep in mind 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.840
 well and harley riders as is there 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.120
 don't worry too much because if 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.829
 one per season or two seasons 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.870
 bank burned 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.950
 so that's not so bad anymore there 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.320
 we're always talking about harley 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.850
 Davidson that has owned more than 10 years 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.919
 exists and then 110 years 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.110
 well the same in quotation marks 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.480
 engines can create a chic look 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.150
 that is of course true 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.160
 but Harry is very busy 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.650
 with technical improvements 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.370
 they are becoming more and more the engine blocks 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.340
 adjusted and also the red, the brakes 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.230
 nowadays that change is twink and 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.970
 models so the models that equipped 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.770
 be with a trick and motored one 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.199
 moreover a 20 campsite that is 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.970
 that there is a balance axis in which the 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.940
 engine quiet running in the vibrations 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.100
 be less and all of these twink and models 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.320
 Also, the touring and so forth that have been 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.630
 nowadays equipped with abs 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.040
 the special abs by harry tapes and 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.660
 developed 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.500
 and that works great and they have 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.560
 of course you can also see that 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.840
 behind is a disk in front is a 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.430
 so drive all to pieces and 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.410
 much better than it used to be 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.030
 was and I can say that 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.700
 because there is then sometimes a little 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.500
 laughed at but that time is long and gone 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.500
 far behind us 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.570
 what I just said despite the classic 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.320
 styling of her idea person writes 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.900
 technology goes on and on and so there is 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.240
 a few years ago also and one 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.550
 6 speed gearbox 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.770
 conceived and made and we see it here 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.690
 and that also sits on the other one 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.570
 to the tin twins this is the big twin 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.480
 so the dogs 3 public in 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.810
 blocks of 1690 cc which are all 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.870
 equipped with a six-pack gearbox 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.820
 nowadays which is also special 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.850
 that it has not always been that way 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.180
 but now you can count on it here and there 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.520
 is a small display you can see 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.040
 in which gear 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.750
 the engine is on and how many rpm is new 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.190
 runs 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.470
 for some people it is possible 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.640
 be easy because sometimes you don't 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.350
 feels completely good 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.350
 now what gear it is and then 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.960
 You can drive it fine I think 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.640
 generally a harley draws 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.710
 Davidson is in other gears 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.410
 you will feel yourself there when it is not 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.000
 nice more wood that's what I come for 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.150
 back to the name again 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.890
 softtail that has that have this 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.160
 engines because they like the software 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:40.460
 we said the thank you in the beginning 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.150
 the soft back so the soft state 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:47.210
 and that is obtained by that below 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:49.370
 a shock absorber with a spring that sits 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.110
 takes care of the suspension 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.610
 that is completely eliminated also with that 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.050
 it is completely eliminated all 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.940
 Below 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.220
 You don't see that, but I did 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.220
 very nice it brings the globe control
