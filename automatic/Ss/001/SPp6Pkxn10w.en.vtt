but<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.630> think<00:00:15.719> pretty<00:00:16.320> amazing<00:00:16.770> little<00:00:16.920> design

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
but I think pretty amazing little design

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.029 
but I think pretty amazing little design
firm<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:18.119> remember<00:00:19.020> back<00:00:19.289> at<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> beginning<00:00:19.859> of

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
firm I remember back at the beginning of

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.820 
firm I remember back at the beginning of
2008<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.910> all<00:00:21.090> got<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.510> our<00:00:21.660> bikes<00:00:21.900> because<00:00:22.529> gas

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
2008 we all got on our bikes because gas

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.009 
2008 we all got on our bikes because gas
prices<00:00:23.310> still<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.519> started<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.970> approach<00:00:24.240> $5

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
prices still I started to approach $5

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.790 
prices still I started to approach $5
when<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.949> happened<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:27.320> seemed<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.529> all<00:00:28.710> of

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
when that happened it seemed like all of

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950 
when that happened it seemed like all of
a<00:00:28.830> sudden<00:00:29.220> there<00:00:29.550> were<00:00:29.670> more<00:00:29.910> bike<00:00:30.210> accidents

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
a sudden there were more bike accidents

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.900 
a sudden there were more bike accidents
and<00:00:31.140> there<00:00:31.260> were<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> couple<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:32.040> them<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.640> that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and there were a couple of them and that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.780 
and there were a couple of them and that
were<00:00:33.210> especially<00:00:33.960> horrific<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.489> really

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
were especially horrific and the really

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.720 
were especially horrific and the really
the<00:00:35.910> problem<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.680> bikes<00:00:38.219> are<00:00:38.430> kind<00:00:38.670> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the problem is is that bikes are kind of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.260 
the problem is is that bikes are kind of
invisible<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.079> drivers<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.340> high<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
invisible the drivers just up high and

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.380 
invisible the drivers just up high and
the<00:00:42.960> bicyclist<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> right<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the bicyclist is on the right and the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
the bicyclist is on the right and the
bicyclist<00:00:45.960> generally<00:00:46.289> wants<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> go<00:00:46.800> straight

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
bicyclist generally wants to go straight

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.770 
bicyclist generally wants to go straight
and<00:00:48.230> truck<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.410> turning<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.629> where<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and truck is turning right and where the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.080 
and truck is turning right and where the
bike<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.289> he<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.250> she<00:00:53.430> doesn't<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.910> where

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
bike is he or she doesn't know where

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.139 
bike is he or she doesn't know where
that<00:00:54.270> truck<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.350> they<00:00:56.010> both<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
that truck is going and they both go and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.970 
that truck is going and they both go and
the<00:00:57.660> truck<00:00:58.079> wins<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.739> just<00:01:01.739> thought

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the truck wins and so I just thought

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.619 
the truck wins and so I just thought
there's<00:01:02.309> got<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.699> way<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:02.969> make<00:01:03.180> bikes

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
there's got to be a way to make bikes

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.500 
there's got to be a way to make bikes
more<00:01:03.960> visible<00:01:04.470> or<00:01:05.189> maybe<00:01:05.460> more<00:01:05.729> hero<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
more visible or maybe more hero as a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.090 
more visible or maybe more hero as a
designer<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.650> we're<00:01:07.799> constantly

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
designer you know we're constantly

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.420 
designer you know we're constantly
looking<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:09.659> new<00:01:09.869> problems<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.439> solve<00:01:10.860> or

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
looking for for new problems to solve or

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.580 
looking for for new problems to solve or
go<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> would<00:01:12.630> call<00:01:12.930> undiscovered

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
go to what I would call undiscovered

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.429 
go to what I would call undiscovered
countries<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.280> sound<00:01:14.900> kind<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.930> felt<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.229> an

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
countries and sound kind of felt like an

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.920 
countries and sound kind of felt like an
undiscovered<00:01:16.920> country<00:01:17.220> because<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.030> little

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
undiscovered country because like little

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.679 
undiscovered country because like little
bike<00:01:19.140> bells<00:01:19.470> man<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.400> you're<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:21.000> amongst

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
bike bells man if you're in amongst

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.679 
bike bells man if you're in amongst
traffic<00:01:22.680> they're<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.729> loud<00:01:24.000> enough<00:01:24.030> so

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
traffic they're just not loud enough so

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.620 
traffic they're just not loud enough so
I<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.500> thought<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.610> maybe<00:01:26.820> make<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
I just thought can we maybe make like a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.679 
I just thought can we maybe make like a
louder<00:01:28.200> sounding<00:01:29.159> alert<00:01:29.670> device<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.509> should

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
louder sounding alert device it should

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.560 
louder sounding alert device it should
just<00:01:31.110> maybe<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.500> be

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
just maybe just be

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.500 
just maybe just be
this<00:01:32.840> super<00:01:33.320> loud<00:01:33.560> bike<00:01:33.890> line<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:34.850> started

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
this super loud bike line so I started

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.200 
this super loud bike line so I started
working<00:01:35.659> with<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:36.229> couple<00:01:36.740> sound<00:01:37.130> engineers<00:01:37.700> to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
working with a couple sound engineers to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.570 
working with a couple sound engineers to
try<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.450> get<00:01:38.659> a<00:01:38.690> sound<00:01:39.159> electrical<00:01:40.159> engineer

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
try to get a sound electrical engineer

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.600 
try to get a sound electrical engineer
to<00:01:41.240> work<00:01:41.390> on<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.660> circuitry<00:01:42.250> we<00:01:43.250> started

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
to work on the circuitry we started

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.359 
to work on the circuitry we started
going<00:01:43.790> down<00:01:43.940> this<00:01:44.120> path<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.830> know<00:01:45.830> it<00:01:46.100> seemed

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
going down this path you know it seemed

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.170 
going down this path you know it seemed
to<00:01:46.490> us<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:47.420> ability<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:48.400> treat<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.610> actuator

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
to us this ability to treat the actuator

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.280 
to us this ability to treat the actuator
on<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.570> horn<00:01:50.890> almost<00:01:51.890> like<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.100> gas<00:01:52.729> pedal<00:01:53.290> it

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
on the horn almost like a gas pedal it

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.590 
on the horn almost like a gas pedal it
would<00:01:54.530> be<00:01:54.680> great<00:01:55.160> if<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.580> know<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.420> need

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
would be great if you know you just need

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.719 
would be great if you know you just need
a<00:01:56.630> light<00:01:56.930> sound<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.979> give<00:01:58.100> me<00:01:58.220> this<00:01:58.400> sort<00:01:58.640> of

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
a light sound and give me this sort of

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.180 
a light sound and give me this sort of
pleasant<00:01:59.479> sound<00:01:59.750> we<00:02:00.350> knew<00:02:00.560> we<00:02:00.710> needed<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:01.100> get

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
pleasant sound we knew we needed to get

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.460 
pleasant sound we knew we needed to get
louder<00:02:01.580> really<00:02:02.090> loud<00:02:02.270> because<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.720> traffic

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
louder really loud because of traffic

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.400 
louder really loud because of traffic
and<00:02:03.890> really<00:02:04.280> our<00:02:04.400> goal<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.330> be<00:02:05.869> alert<00:02:06.170> and

and really our goal is to be alert and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.139 
and really our goal is to be alert and
it's<00:02:06.530> not<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:06.979> pleasant<00:02:07.190> so<00:02:07.580> we're<00:02:07.910> really

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
it's not so pleasant so we're really

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.510 
it's not so pleasant so we're really
hooked<00:02:08.479> on<00:02:08.660> this<00:02:08.810> bike<00:02:09.020> line<00:02:09.289> thing<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.399> it's

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
hooked on this bike line thing and it's

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.300 
hooked on this bike line thing and it's
like<00:02:10.610> oh<00:02:10.900> why<00:02:11.900> don't<00:02:11.959> we<00:02:12.110> put<00:02:12.350> some<00:02:12.380> LEDs<00:02:12.980> on<00:02:13.280> it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
like oh why don't we put some LEDs on it

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.460 
like oh why don't we put some LEDs on it
like<00:02:13.640> it's<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:14.030> obvious<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.870> then<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.290> seemed

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
like it's so obvious and then it seemed

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.170 
like it's so obvious and then it seemed
like<00:02:15.650> oh<00:02:15.890> that's<00:02:16.310> kind<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.760> nice<00:02:16.970> idea

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
like oh that's kind of a nice idea

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.780 
like oh that's kind of a nice idea
because<00:02:17.870> everybody<00:02:18.830> knows<00:02:19.070> that<00:02:19.100> they<00:02:19.489> know

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
because everybody knows that they know

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.570 
because everybody knows that they know
they<00:02:20.060> need<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.300> light<00:02:20.570> we<00:02:21.200> are<00:02:21.280> competitive<00:02:22.280> we

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
they need a light we are competitive we

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.030 
they need a light we are competitive we
are<00:02:22.700> at<00:02:22.820> 87<00:02:23.450> lumens<00:02:23.840> we're<00:02:24.470> powering<00:02:24.920> this

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
are at 87 lumens we're powering this

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.340 
are at 87 lumens we're powering this
thing<00:02:25.280> with<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.489> rechargeable<00:02:26.350> lithium-ion

then<00:02:35.930> with<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.170> strobe<00:02:36.470> were<00:02:36.799> like<00:02:37.480> eleven

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
then with the strobe were like eleven

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.760 
then with the strobe were like eleven
and<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.690> half

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
and a half

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.220 
and a half
once<00:02:40.370> we<00:02:40.520> had<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> pretty<00:02:41.270> good<00:02:41.510> idea<00:02:41.690> what<00:02:42.200> the
