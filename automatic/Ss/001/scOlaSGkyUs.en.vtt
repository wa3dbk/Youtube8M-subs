00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello everyone and welcome back to a matrix 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.500
 history takes care of the victory but the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.360
 preparation of today's video we'll see 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.240
 how to play the best with spain 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.150
 before starting, however, as always 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.060
 I would like to thank some of you today 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.970
 greeting gabriel nicodemo simone fog 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.490
 manuel marra russian angel and raffaele of 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.560
 removed I remind you that if you also want 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.570

 you can leave a comment here 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.410

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.870
 which you find linked in the description 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.550
 always on a facebook page I remind you 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.010
 you can find many other contents 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.710
 as video of some in the other goals 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.540
 information and so on 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.260
 now let's start by looking at the training 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.739
 owner of the spain imports we find 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.500
 the defending epic ramos are i 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.280
 central while juanfran and the fullback 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.289
 left and right the left-back the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.379
 midfield of this particular module 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.420
 which we will see shortly see busquests in the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.110
 role of defensive midfielder cdc 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.840
 central then fabregas who plays instead 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.360
 as CC of central midfielder of 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.560
 right and iniesta instead as the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.420
 central left midfielder ccs 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.820
 then cazorla and the co of the team 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.190
 while it falls with the right wing 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.740
 finally we have the highly paid diego 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.190
 costs that even if only in quotes 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.850
 an 85 really makes a lot much better 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.180
 of ancient 87 88 ea plays in the role of 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.880
 attacking workers this way in 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.030
 bench we have casillas as privacy 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.700
 the maarten nicoletta goalkeeper like 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.440
 spare defenders then we have 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.380
 which can go to replace 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.030
 disk busquets which is okay a little bit 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.670
 all midfield roles 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.170
 also wanting the right even if in that 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.630
 role is better pedro than put there 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.780
 on purpose and finally as reserves 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.210
 of the attacker is alcÃ¡cer now 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.050
 let's look at the form to create 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.800
 this form 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.860
 I started with a 4 2 3 1 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.280
 however, I then added many 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.840
 changes is much more similar in fact to 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.350
 a 4 4 2 if we can say so where 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.510
 however we have an asymmetric module with 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.780
 players moved with respect to the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.549
 graphic initial position anyway 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.739
 see how the players are positioned 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.350
 we saw the roles before then 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.050
 you can recreate it we look now instead 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.240
 instructions to be given to individual players 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.390
 the two central defenders naturally 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.280
 they remain behind an attack on fran fran 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.160
 he remains behind an attack since 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.020
 forward there is already quarries with while I was 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.300
 of sunrise always overlaps to go 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.400
 to exploit with the left wing that 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.870
 as you notice quite free if not 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.320
 were it iniesta that sometimes like 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.960
 we will see can also expand busquets 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.720
 make a man so very closely and 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.820
 tightened his opponent and stays behind 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.190
 an attack this way will be a little 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.860
 fifth defender with the added who goes to 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.530
 cover when maybe jordi alba goes up 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.450
 ie vertices cultured factory are 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.490
 balanced attack therefore sometimes deep 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.140
 the maneuver requires it 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.050
 become an attacker or midfielder 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.520
 further advanced to a placement for i 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.110
 big balanced in this way can 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.990
 also exploit his physical strength la 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.880
 its height does not have a free placement 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.740
 but stay in position as it is needed 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.830
 as a reference point for the team 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.630
 it's a bit backward if we want to 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.930
 nesta instead to a placement of blow 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.780
 therefore it can be varied and in any case remains the 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.580
 advanced team director not 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.520
 enter for the cross but the limit remains 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.960
 given that physically it is not the maximum e 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.690
 also of a balanced attack therefore 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.250
 when needed it goes forward when 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.530
 instead the defense needs a 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.740
 extra player I go back and give 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.780
 a hand then cazorla a support in 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.970
 basic defense is always as iniesta itself 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.800
 reasoning not insertion for i 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.640
 classic hovered then when needed 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.770
 when needed it goes into the air and helps 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.019
 the attacker and not a placement 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.709
 free but stay in position where too 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.050
 he still can't go too far 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.700
 since around the other players e 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.580
 risk of leaving empty area of 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.820
 of field and on the contrary put two 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.410
 players in an already full field area 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.250
 then we have in the right that is such ball 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.500
 that remains forward remains wide and yes 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.130
 inserts behind 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.020
 and in area c very rarely enters this 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.720
 because in this way he is a player who 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.670
 it will always remain wide that we can serve 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.500
 when perhaps the maneuver requires a 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.230
 long pass maybe deep 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.900
 filter that can exploit his 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:59.140
 speed has in fact issued insertion 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.060
 city support behind 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.240
 finally we have to cost that impressed 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.000
 defenders remains central and to an attack 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.450
 balanced as defender the world 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.919
 central is almost as good but not 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.680
 I put the destruction phase on him 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.110
 team because sometimes it will be agreement that 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.840
 what backs to the door by stopping the 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.370
 ball or exploiting his physique and serving 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.140
 the other players 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.450
 other times it is essential that 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.000
 we also use its speed for 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.340
 being able to fit in and pierce the defense 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.810
 opposing 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.390
 I like this player 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.860
 a lot because both fast and strong 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.630
 physically 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.930
 two features that in fifa 15 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.180
 combined are really devastating 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.820
 so she was a player like that 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.479
 I said before is a 85 so surely 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:53.710
 strong but in reality on the field plays 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.660
 like a 89 a 90 even home has me 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.720
 given the instructions, let's look at the tactics 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:03.130
 custom in maneuver construction 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.110
 we have speed 46 and passages 38 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.229
 this means that the maneuver does not 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.300
 it will be too fast and the steps 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.560
 generally they are fairly short given 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.840
 that in midfield the players are 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.690
 neighbors and we can use some 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.180
 their ability to dribble to make half 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.800
 who takano if you will the 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.690
 organized position because some 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.700
 players we have seen before must 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.409
 stay in position to be gods 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.289
 reference points 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.569
 and therefore better to do so in creation 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.039
 occasions instead we have passages 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:36.339
 normal so not too risky 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.679
 even if the parameter set 60 i 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:39.489
 crosses are quite frequent but 

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:42.909
 not too much 

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:45.069
 here too the parameter set to 60 i 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:48.639
 throws are instead put at 40 a bit for 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:50.289
 compensate the value of the cross 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.699
 position in this case instead free 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:54.939
 because we have players who must 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.739
 be more free to use one's own 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:59.439
 fantasy and move freely for the 

00:06:56.739 --> 00:07:03.729
 camp to go and occupy empty areas e 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:05.860
 stand out defense we stamped from 40 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.239
 therefore rather low also 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.059
 aggression is not very high 

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:12.879
 set to 42 while team width 

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:16.779
 quite high at 67 this way 

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:18.519
 we can make our ours play 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:20.769
 wider team to exploit well 

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:24.399
 the breadth of the field especially in 

00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:26.319
 prediction of a passage cameron note 

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:28.509
 with an array of the kind in 

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:30.369
 theory the team should get tired of a 

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:31.899
 little less 

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:33.999
 the defensive line naturally 

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:37.479
 coverage because pressing is set 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:39.269
 at 40 which is definitely low to do 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:41.589
 an offside trap 

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:42.849
 that's all for that matter 

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:44.320
 thank you for this video 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:45.970
 attention as always 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.730
 I remind you to leave a like the 

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:50.320
 video will come in handy is also a 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.880
 comment to leave me yours 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.040
 feedback after trying this 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.640
 see you at the next video 

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.640
 Hi everyone
