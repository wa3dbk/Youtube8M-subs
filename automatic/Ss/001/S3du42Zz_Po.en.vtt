a different area for setting now if you

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
notice it seems that the five point four

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.550 
notice it seems that the five point four
point<00:01:53.700> two<00:01:53.850> update<00:01:54.329> does<00:01:54.570> change<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.320> little

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
point two update does change it a little

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.219 
point two update does change it a little
faster<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.280> I've<00:01:56.700> noticed<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.659> boots<00:01:57.990> up

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
faster and I've noticed that it boots up

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.980 
faster and I've noticed that it boots up
PDF<00:01:58.799> files<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.430> little<00:01:59.610> bit<00:01:59.909> faster<00:02:00.360> as<00:02:00.540> well

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
PDF files a little bit faster as well

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.280 
PDF files a little bit faster as well
however<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.369> big<00:02:02.759> plus<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.630> new<00:02:03.810> update

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
however the big plus of the new update

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.370 
however the big plus of the new update
is<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.520> handles<00:02:05.810> things<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.930> lot<00:02:07.110> quicker

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
is that it handles things a lot quicker

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.359 
is that it handles things a lot quicker
and<00:02:07.740> smoother<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.879> terms<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.300> zoom

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
and smoother this is in terms of zoom

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.750 
and smoother this is in terms of zoom
and<00:02:10.750> panning<00:02:11.750> right<00:02:12.500> now<00:02:12.680> I've<00:02:13.010> booted<00:02:13.549> this

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
and panning right now I've booted this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.350 
and panning right now I've booted this
so<00:02:13.970> that's<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.360> full<00:02:14.629> page<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:15.290> each<00:02:15.560> side<00:02:15.890> now

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
so that's a full page on each side now

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.899 
so that's a full page on each side now

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
unresponsive you know if you're trying

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.410 
unresponsive you know if you're trying
to<00:02:54.950> see<00:02:55.489> one<00:02:55.909> diagram<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:58.090> might<00:02:59.090> probably

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
to see one diagram that might probably

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.380 
to see one diagram that might probably
work<00:02:59.989> but<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.739> only<00:03:00.769> real<00:03:01.310> solution<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:02.120> had

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
work but the only real solution I had

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.259 
work but the only real solution I had
was<00:03:02.720> really<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.260> tip<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.680> on<00:03:03.769> its<00:03:04.010> side<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:05.150> if

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
was really to tip it on its side so if

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.990 
was really to tip it on its side so if
we<00:03:05.450> go<00:03:05.659> into<00:03:05.810> landscape<00:03:06.500> mode<00:03:09.579> that's<00:03:10.579> a

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
we go into landscape mode that's a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.559 
we go into landscape mode that's a
little<00:03:11.480> bit<00:03:11.750> closer<00:03:12.109> to<00:03:13.060> what<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.209> would<00:03:14.359> be

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
little bit closer to what you would be

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.099 
little bit closer to what you would be
reading<00:03:14.840> however<00:03:15.230> it's<00:03:15.769> still<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.400> bit<00:03:16.609> small

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109

nothing<00:03:24.769> you'd<00:03:24.950> expect<00:03:25.840> from<00:03:26.840> say<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.290> tablet

this<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.000> in<00:03:29.299> part<00:03:29.599> because<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.290> e-ink

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
this is in part because of the e-ink

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.240 
this is in part because of the e-ink
screen<00:03:30.799> which<00:03:31.310> is<00:03:31.489> slow<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.819> refresh<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.980> also

screen which is slow to refresh but also

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.280 
screen which is slow to refresh but also
because<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:35.209> how<00:03:35.480> it's<00:03:35.690> being<00:03:35.930> handled<00:03:36.410> so

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
because of how it's being handled so

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.599 
because of how it's being handled so
let's<00:03:39.290> just<00:03:39.680> change<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.310> back<00:03:40.699> to<00:03:41.389> the<00:03:41.690> right

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.379 

size<00:03:46.609> and<00:03:47.530> now<00:03:48.530> if<00:03:48.799> we<00:03:48.980> take<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.280> look<00:03:49.549> at<00:03:49.819> the

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
size and now if we take a look at the

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.900 
size and now if we take a look at the
new<00:03:51.230> update<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.930> can<00:03:53.959> see<00:03:54.410> that<00:03:54.620> zooming<00:03:55.160> is<00:03:55.340> a

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
new update you can see that zooming is a

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.390 
new update you can see that zooming is a
lot<00:03:56.419> quicker<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.199> that's<00:03:57.620> because<00:03:57.980> it's<00:03:58.190> not

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
lot quicker and that's because it's not

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.349 
lot quicker and that's because it's not
trying<00:03:58.849> to<00:03:59.230> gather<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.579> text<00:04:01.579> immediately

trying to gather the text immediately

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.339 
trying to gather the text immediately
it's<00:04:02.540> giving<00:04:03.379> you<00:04:03.949> some<00:04:04.370> chance<00:04:04.849> to<00:04:05.239> zoom<00:04:06.079> in

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
it's giving you some chance to zoom in

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.650 
it's giving you some chance to zoom in
and<00:04:06.560> out<00:04:06.709> before<00:04:07.250> trying<00:04:07.940> to<00:04:08.060> redraw<00:04:08.629> the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
image again panning is not going to be

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.110 
image again panning is not going to be
ideal<00:04:17.419> that's<00:04:17.959> not<00:04:18.349> as<00:04:18.620> if<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.640> tablet

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
ideal that's not as if it's a tablet

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.600 
ideal that's not as if it's a tablet
however<00:04:20.659> you<00:04:21.049> can<00:04:21.229> see<00:04:21.469> it's<00:04:21.620> significantly

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
however you can see it's significantly

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.490 
however you can see it's significantly
faster<00:04:22.969> than

before

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.230 

you<00:04:34.030> can<00:04:34.210> see<00:04:34.450> very<00:04:34.900> hard<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:36.220> maneuver<00:04:36.700> on<00:04:37.180> the

you can see very hard to maneuver on the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.810 
you can see very hard to maneuver on the
old<00:04:37.570> firmware<00:04:37.900> much<00:04:38.890> faster<00:04:39.430> on<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:40.210> left<00:04:41.820> it

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
old firmware much faster on the left it

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.950 
old firmware much faster on the left it
the<00:04:43.780> increment<00:04:44.500> whether<00:04:45.430> it's<00:04:45.820> because<00:04:46.810> of

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
the increment whether it's because of

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.090 
the increment whether it's because of
its<00:04:47.140> smoothness<00:04:47.680> or<00:04:48.340> by<00:04:49.210> design<00:04:49.680> you're<00:04:50.680> able

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
its smoothness or by design you're able

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.090 
its smoothness or by design you're able
to<00:04:51.930> control<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.230> little<00:04:53.470> more<00:04:53.650> accurately

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
to control it a little more accurately

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.340 
to control it a little more accurately
so<00:04:54.400> if<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.610> want<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:54.940> anchor<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.510> 17<00:04:56.020> at<00:04:56.230> the

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
so if I want to anchor the 17 at the

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.380 
so if I want to anchor the 17 at the
bottom<00:04:56.710> that's<00:04:57.580> fairly<00:04:57.910> doable<00:04:58.210> but<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:01.270> know

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
bottom that's fairly doable but you know

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.240 
bottom that's fairly doable but you know
it's<00:05:01.600> very<00:05:01.720> tough<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:02.500> try<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:03.540> get<00:05:04.540> the<00:05:04.750> 20<00:05:05.250> on

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
it's very tough to try and get the 20 on

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.090 
it's very tough to try and get the 20 on
this<00:05:06.610> side<00:05:08.310> anchored<00:05:09.310> on<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.580> right<00:05:10.980> so<00:05:11.980> it's

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
this side anchored on the right so it's

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.090 
this side anchored on the right so it's
very<00:05:12.220> tough<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:12.790> you<00:05:13.750> can<00:05:13.930> see<00:05:14.170> that<00:05:14.380> we<00:05:14.650> ran

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
very tough and you can see that we ran

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.280 
very tough and you can see that we ran
on<00:05:15.340> memory<00:05:15.730> whereas<00:05:16.180> this<00:05:16.450> one<00:05:16.690> I<00:05:16.900> haven't

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
on memory whereas this one I haven't

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.000 
on memory whereas this one I haven't
encountered<00:05:17.560> that<00:05:17.920> problem<00:05:18.370> as<00:05:18.520> much<00:05:18.790> now<00:05:20.010> in

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
encountered that problem as much now in

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.460 
encountered that problem as much now in
terms<00:05:21.340> of<00:05:21.520> handling<00:05:21.760> PDFs<00:05:22.360> I<00:05:22.660> still<00:05:23.080> recommend

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
terms of handling PDFs I still recommend

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.520 
terms of handling PDFs I still recommend
tipping<00:05:24.040> it<00:05:24.160> on<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.430> side<00:05:24.670> this<00:05:25.600> is<00:05:25.870> really<00:05:26.500> a

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
tipping it on the side this is really a

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.070 
tipping it on the side this is really a
hardware<00:05:27.310> issue<00:05:29.880> you<00:05:30.880> know<00:05:31.030> it's<00:05:31.300> it's<00:05:31.630> a<00:05:31.840> six

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
hardware issue you know it's it's a six

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.130 
hardware issue you know it's it's a six
inch<00:05:32.290> screen<00:05:32.740> so<00:05:33.010> I<00:05:33.040> still<00:05:33.610> prefer<00:05:33.910> to<00:05:34.390> read

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
inch screen so I still prefer to read

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:43.230 
inch screen so I still prefer to read
PDFs<00:05:35.920> on<00:05:36.330> landscape<00:05:39.810> but<00:05:40.810> nevertheless<00:05:42.240> this

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
PDFs on landscape but nevertheless this

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.290 
PDFs on landscape but nevertheless this
update<00:05:43.870> has<00:05:44.110> been<00:05:44.460> significant<00:05:45.460> in<00:05:45.730> terms<00:05:45.790> of

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
update has been significant in terms of

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.980 
update has been significant in terms of
how<00:05:46.870> I<00:05:46.900> can<00:05:47.410> read<00:05:47.650> PDFs<00:05:48.160> so<00:05:48.850> that's<00:05:49.360> really<00:05:49.690> all

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
how I can read PDFs so that's really all

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.480
