 milanese eating pastel pastel changes 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.760
 for nothing nice and paper, right? 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.980
 But it's a little bit expensive to show us 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.469
 You with little money, you go 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.379

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.870

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.700
 You can make ham cheese. 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.920
 pizza chicken coffee you name it 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.890
 So what are we going to need to do? 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.170
 this receptive island radio 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.070
 see that in this ground meat that we 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.170
 we have the olive egg and onion that 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.600
 you are not seeing as you're going 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.060
 make a bonfire on the onion plays meat 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.540
 combine everything and let it cool 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.360
 little zuzinha the two eggs and already a 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.549
 little olives and half a kilo 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.590
 of meat that we have a pound of 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.040
 meat will give a lot of cake 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.740
 Here we have the pastel mass since she 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.950
 It's a question of what to show 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:31.049
 You already like pelé but here I have 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.950
 I counted Sunday 42 masses or is it 42 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.280
 pastels is very pastel I paid 3 50 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.369
 water track the video game to which was the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.070
 fingertips and vinaigrette and vinaigrette 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.990
 or is a follow-up of the cake is like 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.540
 I made this vinaigrette here. 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.180
 big fight is a small onion 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.890
 cut finely chopped start 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.540
 I mixed the two I put a little bit 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.549
 salt is certainly also whiting 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.909
 spend a little bit of black pepper 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.650
 and little thing to take away and vinegar 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.920
 when did you go to do 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.590
 the portion where that portion comes in the neighborhood 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.080
 You will enjoy vinaigrette in those 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.170
 on the big barbecue that has enough 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.910
 liquid enough olive oil enough scenario 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.920
 it is not less liquid and it is more is more 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.250
 environment in this less liquid will be 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.840
 this is a good first step in revenue 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.270
 after showing the ingredients that are 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.300
 close the pastry I'm going to build our 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.600
 pastels like cool get close here oh 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:38.580
 You're going to get a woman full and 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.250
 will put in the middle of the brand as the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.630
 half of the mass this mass here is 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.880
 show you 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.440
 when you take off with plastic 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.310
 underneath also sang woman of the other 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.200
 side force because here you have a plastic 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.270
 and only together and I think the cake face 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.459
 and will carry one of us already with this mass 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.810
 who only bought this pasta that came 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:03.480
 Plastic bottom together right here, okay? 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.950
 Who do you live beer in the water and in? 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.370
 the edge of the dough is going through the water 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:17.580
 because this will help you stick together 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:19.320
 then the pasta stuck it turns here it fills 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.170
 So much so that you have trouble staying 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.580
 Because I left outside now it's next to the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:30.959
 mass tightens well and is with cat 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:35.040
 you close the dough because that 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.100
 water will help that fat mass one 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.810
 in the other and the plastic that has out goes 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.200
 help to make sure you have not been to 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.580
 mass gave a little face that it is not 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.410
 because we are doing what you like 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.200
 to do well well stuffed right? 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.670
 Cassel was good because those 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.090
 wind also posted has problem 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.209
 fill glare and water along with dough 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.040
 here's a call and you'll do what? 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.099
 feel good 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.480
 the same will be a battle wind and there the 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.290
 closed 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.909
 You take out the plastic. There's one more. 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.310
 step with this incredible with two is 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.759
 Toast how to take the classic that only for 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.799
 helping and disrupting the video took 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:24.880
 plastic you throw on a baking sheet 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.009
 cloth to dry out mass is you will 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.690

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.610
 I'll do it here with all the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.160
 masses the other to show you 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.910
 How to facilitate this here? 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.120
 the frying pan fires a finger 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.979
 oil the oil well warm up without smoking only 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.630
 play take care this here it goes 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.060
 screw over 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.740
 This is very fast here too. 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.750
 has begun 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.500
 worship on top of that means that in 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.910
 low gold can come by rejecting 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:04.060
 Look who's almost in charge. 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:05.740

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.229

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.729
 pastels is usually that the bars ae

 serve with vinaigrette in the middle is this here 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.260
 It's wonderful and you're going to enjoy it now. 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.330
 it is necessary to invent you move the 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.190
 As you want and whatever you want 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.440
 and if it's meaty you can make 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.490
 Ham cheese and catupiry tomás either 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.490
 say what you want 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.900
 noticing energy 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:49.589
 you pick up places on the neighboring grid of 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.589
 so up the knot 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:08.110
 It's very good on the ball at zero. 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:12.339

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:19.240
 has 42 masses plus 15 reais in 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:21.699
 pound of onion tomato meat and does a lot 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.849

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:39.809
 chilled with good snack 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.809
