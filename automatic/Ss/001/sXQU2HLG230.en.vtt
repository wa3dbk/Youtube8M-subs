thought it would be fun Sarah actually

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.270 
thought it would be fun Sarah actually
came<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.590> really<00:00:46.920> cool<00:00:47.100> idea

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
came up with this really cool idea

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.010 
came up with this really cool idea
because<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.090> both<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.450> different<00:00:48.629> hair

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
because we both have different hair

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.560 
because we both have different hair
color<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.559> little<00:00:49.980> bit<00:00:50.190> different<00:00:50.670> um<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.449> know

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
color a little bit different um you know

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.510 
color a little bit different um you know
different<00:00:51.780> eye<00:00:51.989> color<00:00:52.260> different<00:00:52.739> look<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.250> us

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
different eye color different look to us

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.900 
different eye color different look to us
that'll<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> fun<00:00:54.239> idea<00:00:54.300> if<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:55.079> both<00:00:55.289> used

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
that'll be a fun idea if we both used

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.510 
that'll be a fun idea if we both used
similar<00:00:56.910> or<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> same<00:00:57.420> products<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.530> created

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
similar or the same products and created

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.490 
similar or the same products and created
a<00:00:59.609> look<00:00:59.850> now<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.090> didn't<00:01:00.359> use<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> same

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
a look now we didn't use all of the same

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.549 
a look now we didn't use all of the same
products<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.219> did<00:01:02.460> use<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.059> same<00:01:03.559> palette

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
products but we did use the same palette

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
products but we did use the same palette
to<00:01:04.739> create<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.159> look<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.610> same<00:01:05.790> lip

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
to create the look the same lip

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.780 
to create the look the same lip
combination<00:01:06.900> same<00:01:07.229> blush<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.610> same

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
combination same blush and the same

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.820 
combination same blush and the same

purple base it probably would have

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.110
