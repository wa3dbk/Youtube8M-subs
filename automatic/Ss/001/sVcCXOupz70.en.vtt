scratching<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.970> phone<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> definitely

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
scratching your phone but you definitely

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.649 
scratching your phone but you definitely
want<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.860> take<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:35.189> time<00:01:35.400> putting<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
want to take your time putting it in it

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.170 
want to take your time putting it in it
is<00:01:36.930> something<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:38.159> gonna<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.880> bit

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
is something that's gonna be a bit

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.010 
is something that's gonna be a bit
difficult<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:40.079> remove<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.549> impossible

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
difficult to remove it's not impossible

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.330 
difficult to remove it's not impossible
but<00:01:43.020> certainly<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.619> something<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
but certainly it's something that is a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.130 
but certainly it's something that is a
little<00:01:44.579> bit<00:01:44.729> more<00:01:44.880> difficult<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.540> remove<00:01:45.720> now

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
little bit more difficult to remove now

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.289 
little bit more difficult to remove now
I<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.799> put<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.579> scale<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.180> you're

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
I just put it on the scale and you're

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.160 
I just put it on the scale and you're
gonna<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.950> 0.8<00:01:49.950> ounces<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.030> we're<00:01:51.960> talking

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
gonna see 0.8 ounces so we're talking

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.569 
gonna see 0.8 ounces so we're talking
about<00:01:52.380> something<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.100> pretty

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
about something that is pretty

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.639 
about something that is pretty
lightweight<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.930> let<00:01:55.320> me<00:01:55.350> go<00:01:55.500> ahead<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
lightweight here let me go ahead and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.160 
lightweight here let me go ahead and
show<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.520> close<00:01:56.780> you'll<00:01:57.780> notice

show this to you up close you'll notice

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.440 
show this to you up close you'll notice
right<00:01:58.590> around<00:01:58.799> where<00:01:59.009> my<00:01:59.130> thumb<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.850> this

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
right around where my thumb is in this

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.749 
right around where my thumb is in this
area<00:02:00.810> here<00:02:01.140> all<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.590> way<00:02:01.680> around<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.460> up

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
area here all the way around here and up

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.760 
area here all the way around here and up
here<00:02:03.149> even<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> screen<00:02:04.229> shield<00:02:04.590> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
here even with the screen shield that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.590 
here even with the screen shield that
I've<00:02:04.890> got<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.250> right<00:02:05.460> now<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:06.090> giving<00:02:06.450> me<00:02:06.570> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
I've got on right now it's giving me a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.199 
I've got on right now it's giving me a
little<00:02:07.259> bit<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.469> lay<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> table<00:02:08.129> design<00:02:08.520> so

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
little bit of lay on the table design so

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.979 
little bit of lay on the table design so
my<00:02:09.420> screen<00:02:09.720> shield<00:02:09.959> comes<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.500> at<00:02:10.760> 0.12

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
my screen shield comes in at 0.12

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.670 
my screen shield comes in at 0.12
millimeters

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
millimeters

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.170 
millimeters
so<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:13.980> gives<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> good<00:02:14.310> idea<00:02:14.370> there<00:02:15.090> of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so that gives you a good idea there of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.470 
so that gives you a good idea there of
what<00:02:15.360> we're<00:02:15.510> talking<00:02:15.720> about<00:02:16.170> down<00:02:17.010> below

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
what we're talking about down below

what we're talking about down below
headphone<00:02:18.480> jack<00:02:18.840> now<00:02:19.409> unless<00:02:19.799> you've<00:02:20.010> got<00:02:20.129> an

headphone jack now unless you've got an

headphone jack now unless you've got an
oversized<00:02:20.700> connector<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.540> will<00:02:22.019> probably

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
oversized connector you will probably

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.809 
oversized connector you will probably
not<00:02:22.470> run<00:02:22.680> into<00:02:22.830> issues<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.459> oversized

not run into issues but oversized
connectors<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.480> probably<00:02:25.049> well<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.680> far<00:02:26.010> as

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
connectors you probably well as far as

your cutouts for your mic and your
speaker<00:02:28.500> that's<00:02:28.650> what<00:02:28.830> they<00:02:28.950> look<00:02:29.159> like

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
speaker that's what they look like

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.890 
speaker that's what they look like
there's<00:02:29.640> no<00:02:29.790> problem<00:02:30.180> there<00:02:30.360> with<00:02:30.569> sound

there's no problem there with sound

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.380 
there's no problem there with sound
coming<00:02:31.140> out<00:02:31.290> or<00:02:31.590> mic<00:02:32.040> pick<00:02:32.310> up<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:33.180> there

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
coming out or mic pick up and then there

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.509 
coming out or mic pick up and then there
is<00:02:33.540> your<00:02:33.780> lightning<00:02:34.140> connector<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:35.340> not

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
is your lightning connector it's not

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.280 
is your lightning connector it's not
gonna<00:02:35.670> go<00:02:35.790> docking<00:02:36.269> with<00:02:36.420> many<00:02:36.659> things<00:02:36.989> but

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
gonna go docking with many things but

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.280 
gonna go docking with many things but
you<00:02:38.099> should<00:02:38.340> be<00:02:38.430> able<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.640> use<00:02:38.970> many<00:02:39.900> plugs

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
you should be able to use many plugs

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.839 
you should be able to use many plugs
with<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.709> one<00:02:40.890> except<00:02:41.220> for<00:02:41.250> ones<00:02:41.549> that<00:02:41.700> might

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
with this one except for ones that might

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.030 
with this one except for ones that might
have<00:02:42.090> an<00:02:42.209> oversized<00:02:42.750> connector<00:02:43.319> at<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.560> end

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
have an oversized connector at the end

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.430 
have an oversized connector at the end
this<00:02:44.909> is<00:02:45.090> an<00:02:45.209> interesting<00:02:45.540> design<00:02:46.079> for<00:02:46.319> this

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
this is an interesting design for this

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.039 
this is an interesting design for this
case<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:46.950> all<00:02:47.099> open<00:02:47.459> on<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.700> side<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.450> that

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
case it's all open on the side so that

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.619 
case it's all open on the side so that
does<00:02:49.680> leave<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.250> exposed<00:02:50.430> for<00:02:51.060> dust<00:02:51.359> and

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
does leave it exposed for dust and

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.900 
does leave it exposed for dust and
debris<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.019> if<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.739> don't<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.220> some<00:02:53.579> kind<00:02:53.819> of

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
debris so if you don't have some kind of

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.059 
debris so if you don't have some kind of
a<00:02:54.180> shield<00:02:54.629> on<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.079> side<00:02:55.319> of<00:02:55.349> your<00:02:55.590> phone<00:02:55.859> I

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
a shield on the side of your phone I

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.130 
a shield on the side of your phone I
don't<00:02:56.459> you're<00:02:57.390> definitely<00:02:57.599> gonna<00:02:57.810> want<00:02:58.079> to

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
get in there and clean this out from

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.640 
get in there and clean this out from
time<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.670> time<00:02:59.700> up<00:03:00.480> along<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.019> top<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.470> can

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
time to time up along the top you can

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.680 
time to time up along the top you can
see<00:03:01.829> it<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.040> completely<00:03:02.519> exposed<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.359> you<00:03:03.390> can

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
see it is completely exposed so you can

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.899 
see it is completely exposed so you can
access<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.140> button<00:03:04.560> very<00:03:04.769> easy<00:03:05.010> same<00:03:05.670> thing

goes along the side along the backside
it<00:03:08.879> is<00:03:08.970> going<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.209> show<00:03:09.239> some<00:03:09.599> finger<00:03:09.930> printing

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
it is going to show some finger printing

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.680 
it is going to show some finger printing
