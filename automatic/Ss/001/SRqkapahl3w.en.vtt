tremendous<00:03:41.590> fascination<00:03:42.590> now<00:03:42.830> with<00:03:43.600> the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
tremendous fascination now with the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.020 
tremendous fascination now with the

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
the nineteenth early 1900 well I think

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.949 
the nineteenth early 1900 well I think
it<00:03:49.940> really<00:03:50.090> got<00:03:50.269> off<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.570> ground<00:03:50.780> when<00:03:50.900> the

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
it really got off the ground when the

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.620 
it really got off the ground when the
Bicentennial<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.340> know<00:03:52.459> in<00:03:53.030> 76

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
Bicentennial the you know in 76

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.140 
Bicentennial the you know in 76
everybody<00:03:54.230> started<00:03:54.650> kind<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:55.670> looking<00:03:55.820> back

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
everybody started kind of looking back

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.890 
everybody started kind of looking back
at<00:03:56.360> America<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:58.340> think<00:03:58.580> it's<00:03:58.700> these<00:03:59.450> are

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
at America and I think it's these are

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.509 
at America and I think it's these are
very<00:04:00.080> changing<00:04:00.560> times<00:04:00.799> never<00:04:01.070> ate<00:04:01.190> several

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
very changing times never ate several

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.250 
very changing times never ate several
times<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.360> I<00:04:02.540> think<00:04:02.720> it's<00:04:02.840> kind<00:04:03.049> of

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
times and I think it's kind of

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.500 
times and I think it's kind of
reassuring<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:04.430> go<00:04:04.580> back<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.000> see<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.150> times

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
reassuring to go back and see that times

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.660 
reassuring to go back and see that times
have<00:04:06.170> always<00:04:06.380> been<00:04:06.620> troubled<00:04:07.010> in<00:04:07.160> one<00:04:07.340> way<00:04:07.519> or

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
have always been troubled in one way or

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.210 
have always been troubled in one way or
another<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.959> realize<00:04:09.320> that<00:04:09.350> we<00:04:09.680> do<00:04:10.010> get

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
another and to realize that we do get

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.650 
another and to realize that we do get
over<00:04:10.519> them<00:04:10.670> we<00:04:10.790> do<00:04:10.910> get<00:04:11.060> over<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.330> Civil<00:04:11.630> War

I wanted to portray the kind of people

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.520 
I wanted to portray the kind of people
not<00:04:41.280> just<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:42.360> women's<00:04:42.690> half<00:04:42.900> but<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.290> kind

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
not just the women's half but the kind

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.500 
not just the women's half but the kind
of<00:04:43.650> people<00:04:44.070> who<00:04:44.340> existed<00:04:44.970> during<00:04:45.180> that

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
of people who existed during that

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.830 
of people who existed during that
particular<00:04:45.720> period<00:04:46.140> and<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.390> I<00:04:48.420> wanted<00:04:48.780> to

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
particular period and and so I wanted to

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.350 
particular period and and so I wanted to
have<00:04:49.560> three-dimensional<00:04:50.280> characters<00:04:50.790> so<00:04:51.240> it

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
have three-dimensional characters so it

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.970 
have three-dimensional characters so it
is<00:04:51.480> hard<00:04:51.750> but<00:04:51.900> it's<00:04:52.020> very<00:04:52.200> rewarding<00:04:52.470> as<00:04:52.950> a

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
is hard but it's very rewarding as a

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.010 
is hard but it's very rewarding as a
genre<00:04:53.430> though<00:04:53.790> do<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:54.210> think<00:04:54.540> a<00:04:54.630> book<00:04:54.810> like

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
genre though do you think a book like

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.360 
genre though do you think a book like
this<00:04:55.260> not<00:04:55.500> see<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:55.770> we've<00:04:55.860> gotten<00:04:56.130> into<00:04:56.280> them

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
this not see that we've gotten into them

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.400 
this not see that we've gotten into them
again<00:04:56.820> this<00:04:57.150> kind<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.480> goes<00:04:57.750> back<00:04:58.050> to<00:04:58.110> our

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
again this kind of goes back to our

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.900 
again this kind of goes back to our
conversation<00:04:58.950> a<00:04:58.980> little<00:04:59.160> earlier<00:04:59.520> about<00:04:59.610> what
