00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.950
 Hi there is a guitar and myself . 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.580
 Today we have a parsing for a group song 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.580
 bi-2 silver remember later choose 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:35.670
 I didn't finish when 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:37.570
 and Adam's mist from the word and turned them 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.510
 water on 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:47.519
 but 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:54.649
 I 'll leave everything for continuing the path 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:54.649
 behind your careless freedom he 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.860
 but 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.300
 would not lose everything 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.140
 Well 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.479
 Fox 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:28.800
 not at ease from this quiet stranger 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.979
 with which she are you on down endure friend 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.979
 friend 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.720
 before the war 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.540
 and i have no samples ever my mad 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.650
 star 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.650
 he is me 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.619
 you are all 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.110
 at 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.539
 but 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.500
 here so the end is sad and test 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.600
 let's make it out we play it like this 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.980
 brute force 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.590
 abbreviated brute force when 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.590
 if the boys are here in the afternoon 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.569
 let's get acquainted with 4 roundabout 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.750
 who here in this song have 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.250
 and then we will choose our brute 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.430
 a m e minor and up 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.000
 but now the verse in C minor is 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.890
 first open again 2 on 1 3 4 on 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.090
 second fret guys open 5 he 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.470
 played at 5 ambassador 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.470
 play such a thing 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.400
 bust is played on court bust 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.430
 you 3123 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.430
 but 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.210
 that is, once again the base 5 means 531 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.040
 plus place the chips two fingers together 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.040
 I put food on it 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.040

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.130
 53 that is, bass 3123 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.330
 about 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:32.080
 the game is such a thing I will not come back 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.080
 not immediately transferred to the court 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.110
 that is, and this is our sheep madonna meme 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.910

 4 5 strings on 3 and 6 on the first floor 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.030
 bust so the feelings are justified on 6 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:56.380
 also plays posts on the topic 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:01.320
 that is, 63 wanted evil 3 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.890

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.260
 3123 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.260
 and the third chord d em 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.640

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.940
 and then 4 chord in e major 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.760

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.150

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.120
 that is, you are 3123 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.860
 in the chorus the same chords on 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.010
 the sequence changes there first 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:09.740
 We play, that is, we have our carefree 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:13.840
 freedom fan am 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.260
 fandom I am in the afternoon 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.620
 and not 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.720
 these 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.500
 here plays the chorus twice 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.500
 chords first 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.510
 to come in 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.540
 even though we play my self twice 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:36.590

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:37.860
 you twice also treasured dmm twice 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.349

 that is, 2 1 are played with 1 chord 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:51.810
 place a ma d d e 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:54.030
 chord becomes dn d m and necessarily 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.889
 text will be inserted into this song therefore 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.810
 Iâ€™m sure you will figure it out quickly because 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.580
 that brute force neutral chords 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.680
