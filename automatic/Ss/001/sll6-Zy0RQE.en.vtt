00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
may be the cause of your play getting

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.890 
may be the cause of your play getting
all<00:01:21.390> dirty<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:23.070> having<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.939> lot<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.180> dust

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
all dirty and just having a lot of dust

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.469 
all dirty and just having a lot of dust
in<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.060> surface

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
in it is because it's on the surface

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.030 
in it is because it's on the surface
you're<00:01:27.630> working<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.110> where<00:01:28.710> you're<00:01:28.860> working

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
you're working on where you're working

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
you're working on where you're working
on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.090> clay<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> sticking<00:01:31.380> through<00:01:32.159> sticking

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
on the clay is sticking through sticking

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.670 
on the clay is sticking through sticking
to<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> surface<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.990> collecting<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
to the surface and collecting all the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.590 
to the surface and collecting all the
dust<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.729> better<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.180> work<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
dust there so it's better to work with a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.420 
dust there so it's better to work with a
white<00:01:36.840> surface<00:01:37.140> where<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.950> clearly<00:01:38.250> see

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
white surface where you can clearly see

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.429 
white surface where you can clearly see
the<00:01:38.670> dust<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.689> detect<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the dust and you can detect it and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.370 
the dust and you can detect it and
remove<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> um<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:42.030> soon<00:01:42.840> as<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
remove it um as soon as you see it

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.200 
remove it um as soon as you see it
before<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> work<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.399> clay<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.790> I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
before you work with clay and I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.280
