00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.620
 and how about friends of android master like 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.330
 I hope you are very well and 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.760
 with this I come to teach you how to 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.920
 put more ram to your device or which 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.830
 be any android does not matter brands 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.460
 it does not matter the processing does not matter 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.250
 if it's mid-low range it 's either 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.869
 android for this you need root and les 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.390
 I will give an explanation of what is that 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.310
 ram memory that we're going to add to 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.199
 our device good because this 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.510
 RAM memory is a predetermined size 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.000
 that we take away from mass storage 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.390
 or internal that in this case the sd card 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.800
 or the internal memory that the 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.379
 device 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.300
 to cheat the device that is a 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.920
 ram memory assimilates that it is a memory 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.360
 RAM 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.270
 now yes that internal 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.270
 and it only helps performance 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.650
 to make the system more fluid and 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.030
 to start the tutorial as you already 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.310
 said we need root access if not 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.470
 you have access to your this 4 web I'm going to 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.150
 leave in the description of the video a 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.490
 link so you can see how 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.840
 install the superuser on 13 4 the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.640
 application that we are going to use for this 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.320
 tutorial is called in its web of expander 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.020
 I 'll leave it in the description of 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.430
 video on mega and mediafire server for 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.710
 those that have preference of these the 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.170
 servers because this application does not 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.900
 is in the google play we open it and it 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.930
 grant superuser permissions ok 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.980
 these boxes the marks if it is that 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.290
 are enabled 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.130
 they make you enough choices where it says it is 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.890
 indicate direction and here we go to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.980
 select the storage part 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.030
 from where we want to take out and now yes that 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.760
 the default size 512 1024 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.530
 we are talking about megabytes if we see 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.360
 in the three points we realize that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.830
 is the external memory card that 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.870
 is ext sd card 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.150
 and the storage memory that it brings 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.210
 by default the device that is 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.710
 explain but hey it's already depending on 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.750
 where they want to take that 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.990
 I will remove it from my storage 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.869
 sd 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.440
 we select it once and we give it in 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.239
 ok and now here where swap size says 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.970
 you can modify the default size 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.739
 is in 512 you can put that you can 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.020
 put what you want but well 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.190
 let's leave it in 512 now only 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.830
 das in auto room and active swap we are going to 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.590
 wait a moment to me I get this 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.560
 Error is not no no no no must 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.510
 worry because because I already did 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.760
 well, they're going to wait for a moment 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.840
 finish the process once done that 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.459
 They give in close they will appear a 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.049
 window where it says close the process 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.180
 after becoming active network 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.459
 when you check this box it does not take longer 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.130
 five minutes also depends on everything 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.170
 the size that you have to add too 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.540
 It is recommended that you do not add much 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.870
 because because everything is size it is not going to 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.780
 occupy so 512 is the most recommended 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.000
 restart the device and with that already 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.950
 you have more ram memory on your device 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.960
 after restarting the device 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.090
 let's see what 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.970
 You will go the noise the launcher 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.290
 applications all at all for 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.320
 realize that if we did the 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.320
 procedure well there where swap says 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:28.420
 it says 700 megabytes and there are 275 left 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.360
 megabytes and free to use the 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.060
 RAM memory swap that means what 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.800
 we just added ram between 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.590
 quotes as I explained to you is not 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.150
 real ram memory and I can a friends this 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.820
 was all I hope you liked dale 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.860
 like if it served you let's make a deal 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.630
 Share this video if your device goes 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.790
 more fluid comments on the bottom 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.160
 If you have a problem I doubt it 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.990
 because this application is stable 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.040
 so far good friends then we 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.040
 we see in the next video
