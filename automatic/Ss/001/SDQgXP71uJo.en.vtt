00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.199
 Please come back with Asada player chest 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.620
 ni 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.299
 I very much I 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.580
 Sochi Olympic Figure Skating Japan Representative Asada players 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.140
 In the free, he scored a high score of 142.71, who gave up self-best but was short 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 Mistakes in the program sounded 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.070
 Even though I did not earn medals, I have the possibility of medals after the short program 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.510
 As low as possible 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.590
 But he showed me the best performance 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:43.160
 I would like to applaud Mr. Asada's inherent mental power 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.380
 Japanese people say such things as Mizuna or No Miss are also visible to the players and also to the surrounding people 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.030
 I will 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:53.780
 It also stopped working recently, but I used to say it a little while ago 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.699
 Unconsciousness can not recognize negative words. 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.920
 What happens when the racer is about to grab the handle for a moment and hit an obstacle ? 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.019
 There is a story that you can avoid the obstacle 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.659
 How do you think it can be divided 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:12.950
 I it I do a thing called see no obstacle route 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.940
 But most people see the obstacles they try to avoid 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.130
 It will try to go to the unconscious and obstacle 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:24.100
 If the same principle works as this and think or speak without concentration or mistake 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:29.470
 Nishiki I work in the direction that misses 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:33.950
 Slipping like a polite or plunging mind I have a sense of speaking 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:37.130
 Remove this thing called mistakes thoroughly from your unconscious in 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.030
 Such things can reduce the possibility of water 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.150
 It is understood whether Asada player made the font road of Mentor with such awareness 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.160
 not 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.020
 But in any situation where it is not surprising that the tension thread has been completely broken anyway 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.400
 I was moved by us 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:58.110
 Japanese tend to love more memorable players than records 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.590
 I because there is emphasis culture in things which are not seen originally exerts its Japanese-ness 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.140
 Honor the free acting better than the bezel could not be taken 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.350
 warm 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.740
 It is sure to fall, such as the Notamau prime minister when Japan to want to You're Even so important welcomed 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.090
 It was 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.090
 Such Nero' 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:22.290
 Sorry I was upset
