00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
nothing else needed but we need to pop

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.300 
nothing else needed but we need to pop
the<00:01:33.570> brackets<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.049> there<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.710> close<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.250> off

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the brackets in there and close it off

the brackets in there and close it off
that's<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> first<00:01:35.850> thing<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.060> need<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.180> do

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that's the first thing we need to do

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.210 
that's the first thing we need to do
that<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.810> tells<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.380> carry<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.040> doing

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that just tells it to carry on doing

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.770 
that just tells it to carry on doing
what<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:38.729> doing<00:01:38.850> before<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
what it was doing before we have the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.020 
what it was doing before we have the
draw<00:01:39.960> feature<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.560> there<00:01:40.680> basically<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.909> then

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
draw feature in there basically and then

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.249 
draw feature in there basically and then
like<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> say<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> health<00:01:42.810> bar<00:01:42.960> we're<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
like I say the health bar we're going to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.630 
like I say the health bar we're going to
use<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.439> actually<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> built<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.520> we're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
use is actually a built in one so we're

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.340 
use is actually a built in one so we're
going<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:44.909> draw<00:01:45.409> health<00:01:46.409> bar<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:48.290> now<00:01:49.290> we

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
going to use draw health bar and now we

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.370 
going to use draw health bar and now we
need<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:50.009> variables<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.320> we<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.350> x1<00:01:53.009> y1<00:01:53.820> x2

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
need some variables and we have x1 y1 x2

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.520 
need some variables and we have x1 y1 x2
y2<00:01:55.729> which<00:01:56.729> are<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.350> two

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
y2 which are going to be the the two

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.620 
y2 which are going to be the the two
corners<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.969> top-left<00:02:00.329> corner<00:02:00.450> in

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
corners of the the top-left corner in

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.410 
corners of the the top-left corner in
the<00:02:00.719> bottom<00:02:00.960> right<00:02:01.200> corner<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
the bottom right corner of the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.060 
the bottom right corner of the
rectangular<00:02:03.420> bar<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:04.680> we're<00:02:04.920> just

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
rectangular bar so for now we're just

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.279 
rectangular bar so for now we're just
going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.219> pop<00:02:05.369> x<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:07.039> y<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.780> then<00:02:09.780> we'll<00:02:09.989> say

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
going to pop x and y and then we'll say

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.040 
going to pop x and y and then we'll say
that<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.190> be<00:02:11.340> 50<00:02:12.000> pixels<00:02:12.390> long<00:02:12.660> so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
that it's going to be 50 pixels long so

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.950 
that it's going to be 50 pixels long so
the<00:02:13.200> X

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
the X

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.040 
the X
-<00:02:14.190> there<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.370> 50<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:15.970> we'll<00:02:16.210> say<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.900> it's

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
- there is 50 and we'll say that it's

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.200 
- there is 50 and we'll say that it's
going<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.290> be<00:02:18.420> six<00:02:19.420> pixels<00:02:20.050> deep<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:22.000> needs

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
going to be six pixels deep that needs

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.090 
going to be six pixels deep that needs
to<00:02:22.360> be<00:02:22.950> these<00:02:23.950> needs<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.280> be<00:02:24.340> X<00:02:24.640> sorry<00:02:24.910> X<00:02:25.060> plus

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
to be these needs to be X sorry X plus

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.030 
to be these needs to be X sorry X plus
50<00:02:27.100> +<00:02:27.390> y<00:02:28.830> plus<00:02:29.830> six<00:02:30.130> will<00:02:30.490> do<00:02:30.670> okay<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.920> then

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
50 + y plus six will do okay and then

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.540 
50 + y plus six will do okay and then
the<00:02:33.130> next<00:02:33.160> thing<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.550> wants<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.880> know<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
the next thing you wants to know is the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.100 
the next thing you wants to know is the
amount<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:37.240> this<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.510> going<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.720> be<00:02:37.870> the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
amount so this is going to be the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.640 
amount so this is going to be the
variable<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.770> uses<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.910> fill<00:02:40.180> or<00:02:40.720> drain<00:02:41.440> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
variable it uses to to fill or drain the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.950 
variable it uses to to fill or drain the
bar<00:02:41.830> so<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.730> variable<00:02:43.120> we've<00:02:43.270> got<00:02:43.510> here<00:02:43.750> built

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
bar so the variable we've got here built

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.370 
bar so the variable we've got here built
into<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.320> enemy's<00:02:44.620> HP<00:02:46.110> background<00:02:47.110> color

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
into the enemy's HP background color

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.930 
into the enemy's HP background color
will<00:02:48.250> use<00:02:48.640> black<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:50.140> that's<00:02:50.260> C<00:02:50.620> black<00:02:51.070> you<00:02:51.790> can

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
will use black so that's C black you can

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.370 
will use black so that's C black you can
use<00:02:52.060> hex<00:02:52.270> codes<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.720> things<00:02:52.810> like<00:02:52.990> that<00:02:53.050> here

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
use hex codes and things like that here

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.840 
use hex codes and things like that here
which<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.620> might<00:02:53.770> do<00:02:53.890> eventually<00:02:54.130> however

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
which you might do eventually however

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.120 
which you might do eventually however
for<00:02:55.120> now<00:02:55.150> there's<00:02:55.480> about<00:02:55.590> 16<00:02:56.590> colors<00:02:56.920> built

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
for now there's about 16 colors built

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.210 
for now there's about 16 colors built
into<00:02:57.460> game<00:02:57.640> maker<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.240> see<00:02:58.570> black<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.130> then<00:03:00.130> it

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
into game maker so see black and then it

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.830 
into game maker so see black and then it
goes<00:03:00.370> minimum<00:03:00.790> color<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.150> maximum<00:03:01.510> color<00:03:01.660> and

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
goes minimum color and maximum color and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.360 
goes minimum color and maximum color and
what<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.080> is<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.920> bar<00:03:03.130> that

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
what that is is that the the bar that

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.950 
what that is is that the the bar that
actually<00:03:03.670> moves<00:03:03.940> sort<00:03:04.330> of<00:03:04.420> goes<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:04.870> out

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
actually moves sort of goes in and out

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.870 
actually moves sort of goes in and out
will<00:03:05.710> change<00:03:06.070> from<00:03:06.250> one<00:03:06.460> color<00:03:06.490> to<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.850> other

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
will change from one color to the other

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.760 
will change from one color to the other
as<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.330> gets<00:03:07.510> emptied<00:03:07.840> if<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.050> wanted<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.530> so

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
as it gets emptied if you wanted to so

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.950 
as it gets emptied if you wanted to so
if<00:03:08.890> when<00:03:09.070> it's<00:03:09.190> full<00:03:09.460> it'll<00:03:09.700> be<00:03:09.840> sort<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.870> a

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
if when it's full it'll be sort of a

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.660 
if when it's full it'll be sort of a
yellow<00:03:11.200> color<00:03:11.230> or<00:03:11.620> green<00:03:11.830> color<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.310> as<00:03:12.550> it

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
yellow color or green color and as it

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.700 
yellow color or green color and as it
goes<00:03:12.790> down<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:13.180> can<00:03:13.330> turn<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.810> red<00:03:14.140> maybe<00:03:14.380> so

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
goes down it can turn to red maybe so

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.500 
goes down it can turn to red maybe so
what<00:03:14.860> we'll<00:03:15.190> use<00:03:15.370> those<00:03:15.520> green<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.420> red

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
what we'll use those green and red

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.990 
what we'll use those green and red
they're<00:03:16.750> kind<00:03:16.990> of<00:03:17.110> them<00:03:17.320> so<00:03:18.100> industry

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
they're kind of them so industry

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.610 
they're kind of them so industry
standards<00:03:19.480> are<00:03:19.570> get<00:03:19.690> really<00:03:19.990> on<00:03:20.110> there<00:03:20.260> red<00:03:20.440> is

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
standards are get really on there red is

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.350 
standards are get really on there red is
bad<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:20.980> green<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.340> good<00:03:21.490> so<00:03:21.760> red<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.240> the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
bad and green is good so red is the

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.630 
bad and green is good so red is the
minimum<00:03:22.690> color<00:03:22.960> so<00:03:23.470> as<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.740> goes<00:03:23.920> as<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.340> life

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
minimum color so as it goes as the life

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.290 
minimum color so as it goes as the life
gets<00:03:25.090> drained<00:03:25.360> it'll<00:03:25.720> go<00:03:25.840> red<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:27.210> next<00:03:28.210> is

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
gets drained it'll go red and next is

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
maker is always to the right and we use

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.490 
maker is always to the right and we use
zero<00:03:42.160> for<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.870> next<00:03:43.870> thing<00:03:44.020> it<00:03:44.140> wants<00:03:44.230> is

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
zero for that next thing it wants is

zero for that next thing it wants is
show<00:03:44.950> background<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:45.910> for<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.270> we're<00:03:46.450> going

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
show background and for that we're going

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.410 
show background and for that we're going
to<00:03:46.600> say<00:03:46.750> true<00:03:47.140> so<00:03:47.440> there'll<00:03:47.590> be<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.710> black<00:03:47.950> bar

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
to say true so there'll be a black bar

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.840 
to say true so there'll be a black bar
always<00:03:49.420> there<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.960> then<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.530> green<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.520> red

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
always there and then a green and red

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.580 
always there and then a green and red
bar<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.090> goes<00:03:52.270> up<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.690> down<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.410> last

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
bar that goes up and down and the last

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.560 
bar that goes up and down and the last
thing<00:03:53.740> it<00:03:53.830> wants<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.130> show<00:03:54.340> border<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.030> that's

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
thing it wants is show border and that's

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.290 
thing it wants is show border and that's
a<00:03:55.960> it's<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.650> 1:1<00:03:57.280> pixel<00:03:57.430> border<00:03:57.760> they<00:03:58.000> usually

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
a it's a 1:1 pixel border they usually

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.060 
a it's a 1:1 pixel border they usually
the<00:03:58.360> color<00:03:58.570> of<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.530> background<00:03:59.680> I

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
the color of the the background I

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.880 
the color of the the background I
believe<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:01.150> prefer<00:04:01.600> it<00:04:01.780> off<00:04:01.900> but<00:04:02.290> it's<00:04:02.530> Sam

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
believe and I prefer it off but it's Sam

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.580 
believe and I prefer it off but it's Sam
it's<00:04:03.580> so<00:04:03.790> false<00:04:04.090> that's<00:04:04.960> personal<00:04:05.380> preference

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
it's so false that's personal preference

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.060 
it's so false that's personal preference
there<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.820> then<00:04:07.000> we<00:04:07.090> close<00:04:07.240> that<00:04:07.450> off<00:04:08.070> so

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
there and then we close that off so

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.500 
there and then we close that off so
that's<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:09.340> one<00:04:09.490> line<00:04:09.610> of<00:04:09.730> code<00:04:09.760> now<00:04:10.150> that's

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
that's it one line of code now that's

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.970 
that's it one line of code now that's
not<00:04:10.720> going<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:10.930> place<00:04:11.110> it<00:04:11.290> exactly<00:04:11.440> where<00:04:11.740> we

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
not going to place it exactly where we

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.010 
not going to place it exactly where we
want<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.400> because<00:04:12.550> we<00:04:12.730> haven't<00:04:12.880> perfectly<00:04:13.780> set

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
want it because we haven't perfectly set

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.780 
want it because we haven't perfectly set
the<00:04:14.170> x<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.500> y<00:04:14.590> coordinates<00:04:14.830> here<00:04:15.220> but<00:04:15.670> it'll

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
the x and y coordinates here but it'll

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.220 
the x and y coordinates here but it'll
be<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:15.940> right<00:04:16.150> size<00:04:16.420> it<00:04:16.690> will<00:04:16.750> sit<00:04:16.960> somewhere

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
be the right size it will sit somewhere

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.870 
be the right size it will sit somewhere
down<00:04:17.410> by<00:04:17.530> their<00:04:17.739> feet<00:04:17.980> there<00:04:18.310> we<00:04:18.370> go<00:04:18.520> and<00:04:18.820> you

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
down by their feet there we go and you

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.970 
down by their feet there we go and you
see<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.390> green<00:04:19.570> color<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.049> as<00:04:20.710> they<00:04:20.859> get

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
see it's a green color and as they get

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.130 
see it's a green color and as they get
shot<00:04:21.280> it's<00:04:21.970> actually<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.300> matte<00:04:22.630> one<00:04:22.780> properly

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
shot it's actually a matte one properly

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.560 
shot it's actually a matte one properly
and<00:04:23.550> I'm<00:04:24.550> trying<00:04:24.730> to<00:04:24.790> slow<00:04:25.060> so<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.270> can<00:04:25.330> see

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
and I'm trying to slow so you can see

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.090 
and I'm trying to slow so you can see
there<00:04:25.750> you<00:04:25.780> go<00:04:25.840> so<00:04:26.169> at<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.470> moment<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.980> have

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
there you go so at the moment I have

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.810 
there you go so at the moment I have
bullets<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.520> take

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
bullets to take

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.460 
bullets to take
50%<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.540> their<00:04:28.660> health<00:04:29.040> so<00:04:30.040> it's<00:04:30.610> taking<00:04:31.470> two

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
50% of their health so it's taking two

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.990 
50% of their health so it's taking two
hits<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.860> kill<00:04:33.040> them<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.610> can<00:04:33.730> see<00:04:33.880> the

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
hits to kill them and you can see the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.070 
hits to kill them and you can see the
color<00:04:34.210> there<00:04:34.390> changes

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
color there changes

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.820 
color there changes
red<00:04:35.320> as<00:04:35.530> it<00:04:35.740> goes<00:04:35.890> down<00:04:36.930> so<00:04:37.930> last<00:04:38.560> thing<00:04:38.650> we

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
red as it goes down so last thing we

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.820 
red as it goes down so last thing we
want<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.040> do<00:04:39.250> is<00:04:39.880> make<00:04:40.570> it<00:04:40.600> so<00:04:40.750> they're<00:04:41.110> in<00:04:41.410> the

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
want to do is make it so they're in the

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.760 
want to do is make it so they're in the
right<00:04:42.010> place<00:04:42.310> so<00:04:43.410> here<00:04:44.410> we're<00:04:44.500> going<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.650> go

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
right place so here we're going to go

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.170 
right place so here we're going to go
back<00:04:44.890> to<00:04:45.040> our<00:04:45.160> original<00:04:45.250> sprite<00:04:45.850> of<00:04:45.880> the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
back to our original sprite of the

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.840 
back to our original sprite of the
object<00:04:46.540> the<00:04:46.930> character<00:04:47.410> sorry<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.920> we're

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
object the character sorry and we're

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.000 
object the character sorry and we're
basing<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.360> move<00:04:49.840> where<00:04:50.590> they've<00:04:50.800> been

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
basing a move where they've been

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.310 
basing a move where they've been
replaced<00:04:51.160> off<00:04:51.670> this<00:04:51.940> here<00:04:52.240> being<00:04:52.450> zero<00:04:52.870> zero

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
replaced off this here being zero zero

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.500 
replaced off this here being zero zero
so<00:04:53.620> we<00:04:54.130> want<00:04:54.310> it<00:04:54.460> sitting<00:04:54.700> in<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.150> middle

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
so we want it sitting in the middle

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.720 
so we want it sitting in the middle
along<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:55.990> x-axis<00:04:56.350> and<00:04:56.740> it's<00:04:56.830> 50<00:04:57.130> pixels<00:04:57.520> wide

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
along the x-axis and it's 50 pixels wide

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.940 
along the x-axis and it's 50 pixels wide
so<00:04:58.000> we<00:04:58.120> want<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.360> go<00:04:58.450> 25<00:04:59.200> as<00:04:59.530> this<00:04:59.620> is<00:04:59.770> in<00:04:59.860> the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
so we want to go 25 as this is in the

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.620 
so we want to go 25 as this is in the
middle<00:05:00.190> here<00:05:00.340> you<00:05:00.370> want<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.550> go<00:05:00.670> 25<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.420> way

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
middle here you want to go 25 that way

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.930 
middle here you want to go 25 that way
to<00:05:02.440> start<00:05:02.710> it<00:05:02.950> and<00:05:03.070> then<00:05:03.160> 25<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.760> way<00:05:03.880> to

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
to start it and then 25 that way to

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.480 
to start it and then 25 that way to
finish<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.330> that'll<00:05:04.630> put<00:05:04.780> 50<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.950> at<00:05:06.220> the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
finish it that'll put 50 the at the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.430 
finish it that'll put 50 the at the
y-coordinates<00:05:07.390> we<00:05:07.510> want<00:05:07.660> it<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.930> sit<00:05:08.140> at<00:05:08.290> the

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
y-coordinates we want it to sit at the

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.880 
y-coordinates we want it to sit at the
top<00:05:08.740> here<00:05:09.010> so<00:05:09.280> at<00:05:09.850> the<00:05:09.940> moment<00:05:10.120> it's<00:05:10.720> Y<00:05:10.990> 75<00:05:11.710> as

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
top here so at the moment it's Y 75 as

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:12.930 
top here so at the moment it's Y 75 as
opposed<00:05:12.130> to<00:05:12.190> right<00:05:12.280> normally<00:05:12.580> so<00:05:12.730> we're<00:05:12.850> going

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
opposed to right normally so we're going

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.740 
opposed to right normally so we're going
to<00:05:13.000> come<00:05:13.150> 75<00:05:13.930> up<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:14.500> then<00:05:15.190> six<00:05:16.180> pixels<00:05:16.480> down

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
to come 75 up and then six pixels down

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.080 
to come 75 up and then six pixels down
from<00:05:17.110> that<00:05:17.320> okay<00:05:17.860> that<00:05:18.730> sounds<00:05:18.970> complicated

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
from that okay that sounds complicated

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.280 
from that okay that sounds complicated
but<00:05:19.540> don't<00:05:19.660> worry<00:05:19.840> I've<00:05:19.990> got<00:05:20.020> it<00:05:20.140> all<00:05:20.260> written

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
but don't worry I've got it all written

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.110 
but don't worry I've got it all written
down<00:05:20.530> already<00:05:20.830> or<00:05:21.010> it's<00:05:21.250> all<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.430> again<00:05:22.030> this

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
down already or it's all the again this

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.220 
down already or it's all the again this
is<00:05:22.210> another<00:05:22.360> one<00:05:22.540> of<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.690> things<00:05:22.870> we<00:05:22.990> have<00:05:23.110> to

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
is another one of the things we have to

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.600 
is another one of the things we have to
just<00:05:23.350> keep<00:05:23.530> going<00:05:23.770> back<00:05:23.890> and<00:05:24.100> forth<00:05:24.280> until<00:05:24.460> it

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
just keep going back and forth until it

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.830 
just keep going back and forth until it
looked<00:05:24.820> right<00:05:25.000> but<00:05:25.270> I've<00:05:25.390> done<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.600> hard<00:05:25.780> work

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
looked right but I've done the hard work

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.230 
looked right but I've done the hard work
for<00:05:26.200> you<00:05:26.290> guys<00:05:26.470> here<00:05:26.770> so<00:05:26.920> the<00:05:27.460> X<00:05:27.640> is<00:05:27.910> now<00:05:28.060> going

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
for you guys here so the X is now going

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.160 
for you guys here so the X is now going
to<00:05:28.330> be<00:05:28.450> X<00:05:28.960> minus<00:05:29.170> 25<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.340> then<00:05:31.000> X<00:05:31.240> plus<00:05:31.600> 25<00:05:32.110> so

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
to be X minus 25 and then X plus 25 so

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.080 
to be X minus 25 and then X plus 25 so
the<00:05:32.470> distance<00:05:32.830> is<00:05:32.950> still<00:05:33.160> 15<00:05:33.670> still<00:05:33.880> going<00:05:34.030> to

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
the distance is still 15 still going to

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.720 
the distance is still 15 still going to
be<00:05:34.150> 50<00:05:34.420> pixels<00:05:34.810> across<00:05:34.930> and<00:05:35.470> then<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.160> Y<00:05:36.370> here

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
be 50 pixels across and then the Y here

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.300 
be 50 pixels across and then the Y here
is<00:05:36.790> going<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.150> be<00:05:37.330> minus<00:05:37.900> 75<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.980> then<00:05:39.880> minus

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
is going to be minus 75 and then minus

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.490 
is going to be minus 75 and then minus
69<00:05:42.310> so<00:05:43.210> again<00:05:43.450> the<00:05:43.570> difference<00:05:43.690> here<00:05:44.140> is<00:05:44.170> still

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
69 so again the difference here is still

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.020 
69 so again the difference here is still
six<00:05:44.740> pixels<00:05:45.100> it's<00:05:45.280> going<00:05:45.400> to<00:05:45.460> be<00:05:45.520> six<00:05:45.700> pixels

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
six pixels it's going to be six pixels

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.790 
six pixels it's going to be six pixels
deep<00:05:46.300> but<00:05:46.870> it's<00:05:46.960> just<00:05:47.110> going<00:05:47.230> to<00:05:47.320> be<00:05:47.410> moved<00:05:47.650> so

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
deep but it's just going to be moved so

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.970 
deep but it's just going to be moved so
it's<00:05:47.950> placed<00:05:48.160> above<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.580> heads<00:05:48.790> of<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.980> of

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
it's placed above the heads of the of

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.650 
it's placed above the heads of the of
the<00:05:51.250> enemies<00:05:51.760> there<00:05:51.970> we<00:05:52.060> go<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.390> there<00:05:52.570> it

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
the enemies there we go and there it

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.020 
the enemies there we go and there it
looks<00:05:52.810> great<00:05:52.960> cut<00:05:53.590> out<00:05:53.790> there<00:05:54.790> you<00:05:54.850> go<00:05:54.940> so

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
looks great cut out there you go so

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.550 
looks great cut out there you go so
that's<00:05:55.090> it<00:05:55.300> easy<00:05:55.540> peasy<00:05:56.170> we're<00:05:56.290> going<00:05:56.410> to<00:05:56.470> use

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
that's it easy peasy we're going to use

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.260 
that's it easy peasy we're going to use
the<00:05:56.650> built-in<00:05:56.980> health<00:05:57.310> bars<00:05:57.580> there<00:05:57.790> to<00:05:58.000> create

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
the built-in health bars there to create

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.230 
the built-in health bars there to create
them<00:05:58.450> like<00:05:58.600> I<00:05:58.630> say<00:05:58.840> I<00:05:58.870> wouldn't<00:05:59.200> use<00:05:59.470> those<00:05:59.710> for

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
them like I say I wouldn't use those for

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.730 
them like I say I wouldn't use those for
sort<00:06:01.240> of<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.330> UI<00:06:01.570> based<00:06:01.870> ones<00:06:02.230> for<00:06:02.500> main

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
sort of the UI based ones for main

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.860 
sort of the UI based ones for main
characters<00:06:03.340> or<00:06:03.640> maybe<00:06:04.030> bosses<00:06:04.510> I<00:06:04.540> would<00:06:04.780> have

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
characters or maybe bosses I would have

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.030 
characters or maybe bosses I would have
their<00:06:05.020> own<00:06:05.140> one<00:06:05.320> as<00:06:05.440> well<00:06:05.590> but<00:06:05.740> for<00:06:05.920> these

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
their own one as well but for these

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.970 
their own one as well but for these
little<00:06:06.400> fodder<00:06:07.080> characters<00:06:08.080> I<00:06:08.260> think<00:06:08.890> it

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
little fodder characters I think it

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.860 
little fodder characters I think it
