00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.520
 my 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.320
 hi music lovers welcome to this 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.320
 new appointment concerning the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.400
 technique in the previous version 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.140
 we talked about the e breathe packing 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.620
 I consider it appropriate to speak also delegate 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.840
 because tied is a technique and they are founded 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.680
 in that of and but with yes 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.770
 compensate 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.059
 ok you have to do a lot of use of a 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.949
 merone prof 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.989
 in the aibe picking and then of 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.760
 consequently we must study very well 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.739
 is bound now I give you some exercises for 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.280
 develop the head that develop the 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.500
 delegated technique and are also those who 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.860
 for me they are not just exercises but they are 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.149
 also some ideas for developing 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.149
 phrases during improvisation 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.190
 let's see this example 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.190
 always in the scale of major kings 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:53.930
 then what is there to say 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.250
 regarding this example the scale 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:04.010
 used is that of D major 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:12.490
 starting with the king then the trolley down 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:12.490
 true be one I will love the pulo 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:24.040
 then two I will not love then 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.950
 this is the technique used for 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.260
 this sentence can obviously be done 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.200
 use the same pattern on the various 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.760
 set as I did for how I did it 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.180
 see in the exercise of the version 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.180
 previous one 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.960
 this is the same pattern developed 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.210
 for fourth and then coming first 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.900
 two adjacent strings developed into 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.350
 horizontal 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.210
 now let's try to put together a 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.990
 put together to put together 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.670
 these ideas to put together more than 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.090
 another pattern I explained to you today 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.820
 with that of the previous edition for 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.570
 create an example more directly 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.570
 musical 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.510
 I hope this example is there for you 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.940
 liked it was a simple application 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.410
 of these ideas of these inputs which 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.190
 private in this election 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.190
 see you soon. Bye
