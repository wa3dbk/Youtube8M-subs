00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
problem that you can find so it's like

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:31.580 
problem that you can find so it's like
an<00:00:24.840> empty<00:00:25.050> slate<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:27.390> if<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.630> go<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:30.300> if<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.590> look

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
an empty slate so if I go so if you look

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.229 
an empty slate so if I go so if you look
into<00:00:31.769> your<00:00:31.980> apps<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.460> would<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.850> basically

into your apps you would see basically

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.330 
into your apps you would see basically
just<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.690> page<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.290> apps<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.220> it's<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:35.610> small

notice<00:02:01.760> about<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:02.150> rom<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:03.050> terms<00:02:03.320> of

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
notice about this rom in terms of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.169 
notice about this rom in terms of
battery<00:02:03.680> life<00:02:04.150> when<00:02:05.150> i<00:02:05.180> have<00:02:05.360> Wi-Fi<00:02:05.390> on

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
battery life when i have Wi-Fi on

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.450 
battery life when i have Wi-Fi on
sometimes<00:02:08.179> i<00:02:08.600> guess<00:02:09.530> it's<00:02:09.770> not<00:02:09.950> going<00:02:10.220> to

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
sometimes i guess it's not going to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.880 
sometimes i guess it's not going to
sleep<00:02:10.760> mode<00:02:10.970> or<00:02:11.420> maybe<00:02:11.930> it's<00:02:12.140> just<00:02:12.200> me<00:02:12.530> but<00:02:12.560> the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
sleep mode or maybe it's just me but the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.940 
sleep mode or maybe it's just me but the
battery<00:02:13.040> life<00:02:13.400> didn't<00:02:13.820> seem<00:02:14.030> as<00:02:14.980> good<00:02:15.980> as<00:02:17.950> when

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
battery life didn't seem as good as when

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.610 
battery life didn't seem as good as when
i<00:02:19.040> was<00:02:19.130> running<00:02:19.580> cm10<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:21.230> then<00:02:21.380> some<00:02:21.590> people

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
i was running cm10 but then some people

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.270 
i was running cm10 but then some people
are<00:02:22.130> saying<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.520> cm10<00:02:23.000> doesn't<00:02:24.040> have<00:02:25.040> that

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
are saying that cm10 doesn't have that

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.810 
are saying that cm10 doesn't have that
great<00:02:25.489> battery<00:02:25.970> life<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:28.100> i<00:02:28.130> guess<00:02:28.340> by<00:02:28.760> our

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
great battery life and so i guess by our

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.080 
great battery life and so i guess by our
life<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.330> average<00:02:29.780> i<00:02:30.380> must<00:02:30.590> have<00:02:30.820> changed<00:02:31.820> some

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
life is average i must have changed some

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.130 
life is average i must have changed some
setting<00:02:32.450> or<00:02:32.570> something<00:02:34.510> otherwise<00:02:35.510> if<00:02:36.110> you

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
setting or something otherwise if you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.920 
setting or something otherwise if you
want<00:02:36.530> just<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.160> simple<00:02:37.190> rom<00:02:38.120> where<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.720> can

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
want just a simple rom where you can

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.170 
want just a simple rom where you can
customize<00:02:39.530> yourself<00:02:39.709> from<00:02:40.250> very<00:02:41.060> beginning
