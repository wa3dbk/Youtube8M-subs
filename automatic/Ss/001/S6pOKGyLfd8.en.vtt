00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.750
 at 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:34.429
 the first verse I play so much but 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.620
 First , I just spend on the cord 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:42.250
 top to bottom right thumb 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.380
 all or starting chord bulkhead c 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.780
 you in this case 5 string 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.310
 then 3 and 2 lower strings at the same time 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.200
 you with your thumb 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.670
 hands of the third 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.380
 index finger and bottom 2 mean 2 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.009
 middle finger a 1 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.790
 untitled at the same time after two 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:13.340
 lower third again and again 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:17.090
 jorgen bass string you mean played 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:22.140
 like this then the chord changes there i'm im 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:26.510
 goes the same thing give them fa 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.510
 than c 1 d 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.600
 fourth here we have open bass 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.860
 the string is farthest as usual and then 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.790
 middle finger goes to the fifth string 3 fret 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.790
 games fifth string 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:50.690
 after which we play a chord we play 6 ambassador 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:54.230
 and the rest is all the same and go 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.470
 on the court as possible so I can so 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.470
 put 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.070
 and on again 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:21.519
 before moving to the first chord 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:26.190
 chorus make two blows i do on 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:30.790
 nails of index and middle fingers 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.510
 at the same time I clamp my fingers like this 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:38.650
 as if holding a mediator for example 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.340
 two strikes go to the battle play the first 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.489
 chord when singing do also means here 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:50.139
 fingers and beat two blows from top to bottom 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.720
 so short and moderately strong 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.840
 top strings mainly and further 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.639
 make four quick down moves 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.129
 up down up they go 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.210
 approximately all strings but not 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:09.190
 bass 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:09.190
 here so let's repeat the very beginning 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.300
 here and immediately begin the very beginning 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:34.550
 so in pripyt two times a chord here 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:44.450
 begins it means the refrain itself means 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:47.740
 forth on cardiff four times already 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.740
 play this fight 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:07.860
 smoke on the cord once on the same 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.860
 once and c 2 times more often 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:29.630
 it means it is necessary and Madina sleep and once and 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:33.470
 they are two times the country pho 1 1 1 1 and d by 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.350
 once tyzh further on the second verse 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.750
 played by the same fight it turns out there by 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.050
 once on the court 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.400
 I hope all this has helped you well 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.400
 parsing and success
