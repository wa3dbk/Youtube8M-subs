to bits it's awesome it's beautiful it's

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.309 
to bits it's awesome it's beautiful it's
fast<00:03:52.419> agile<00:03:52.810> but<00:03:54.389> after<00:03:55.389> test<00:03:55.629> riding<00:03:56.019> it

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
fast agile but after test riding it

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.699 
fast agile but after test riding it
I<00:03:57.120> don't<00:03:58.120> know<00:03:58.239> followed<00:03:58.569> by<00:03:58.750> one<00:03:59.079> for<00:03:59.409> my

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
I don't know followed by one for my

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.479 
I don't know followed by one for my
purposes<00:04:01.169> if<00:04:02.169> I<00:04:02.319> was<00:04:02.469> a<00:04:02.500> weekend<00:04:02.859> ride<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.069> think

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
purposes if I was a weekend ride I think

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.490 
purposes if I was a weekend ride I think
I'd<00:04:03.579> probably<00:04:03.760> buy<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.139> I'd<00:04:05.139> highly<00:04:05.469> recommend

I'd probably buy it I'd highly recommend

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.479 
I'd probably buy it I'd highly recommend

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
my purposes going around town and

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.649 
my purposes going around town and
filtering<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.609> don't<00:04:12.819> know<00:04:12.909> if<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.150> would<00:04:13.329> filter

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
filtering I don't know if I would filter

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.249 
filtering I don't know if I would filter
on<00:04:13.870> this<00:04:13.989> thing<00:04:15.359> unless<00:04:16.359> maybe<00:04:16.570> i<00:04:16.720> justed<00:04:17.169> the

idol maybe maybe it'd probably just be a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.789 
idol maybe maybe it'd probably just be a
simple<00:04:19.359> fix<00:04:19.690> if<00:04:19.959> you're<00:04:20.169> cuda<00:04:20.380> but<00:04:20.530> if<00:04:20.680> that

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
simple fix if you're cuda but if that

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.379 
simple fix if you're cuda but if that
could<00:04:20.919> be<00:04:21.039> easily<00:04:21.190> fixed<00:04:21.549> what<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.240> hell's

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
could be easily fixed what the hell's

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:33.190 
could be easily fixed what the hell's
going<00:04:22.690> on

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:44.830

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
leaned back for a second anyway

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.550 
leaned back for a second anyway
it's<00:05:11.610> strange<00:05:12.000> strange<00:05:12.480> throttle<00:05:12.930> I<00:05:13.140> don't

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
it's strange strange throttle I don't

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.880 
it's strange strange throttle I don't
like<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.860> throttle<00:05:14.250> I<00:05:15.590> hope<00:05:16.590> through<00:05:16.740> that<00:05:16.860> I

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
like the throttle I hope through that I

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.710 
like the throttle I hope through that I
hope<00:05:17.190> look<00:05:17.460> I<00:05:17.640> hope<00:05:17.850> that<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.180> throttle<00:05:18.600> is

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
hope look I hope that that throttle is

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.650 
hope look I hope that that throttle is
just<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.020> simple<00:05:19.290> idle<00:05:19.590> adjustment<00:05:20.660> that's

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
just a simple idle adjustment that's

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.940 
just a simple idle adjustment that's
pissing<00:05:22.290> me<00:05:22.410> off<00:05:24.200> if<00:05:25.200> that's<00:05:25.350> not<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.650> simple

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
pissing me off if that's not a simple

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.990 
pissing me off if that's not a simple
idle<00:05:26.190> adjustment<00:05:26.490> then<00:05:26.700> that<00:05:26.790> would<00:05:26.880> be

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
idle adjustment then that would be

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.190 
idle adjustment then that would be
enough<00:05:27.210> for<00:05:27.330> me<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:27.570> not<00:05:27.690> buy<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:27.900> bike<00:05:28.140> Oh

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
enough for me to not buy the bike Oh

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.560 
enough for me to not buy the bike Oh
so<00:05:31.200> overall<00:05:31.620> very<00:05:32.660> nice<00:05:33.660> bike<00:05:34.160> if<00:05:35.160> that

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
so overall very nice bike if that

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.790 
so overall very nice bike if that
throttle<00:05:36.570> is<00:05:37.350> an<00:05:37.530> easy<00:05:37.680> fix<00:05:38.090> then<00:05:39.090> yeah<00:05:39.990> get

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
throttle is an easy fix then yeah get

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.590 
throttle is an easy fix then yeah get
this<00:05:40.920> boy

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
this boy
