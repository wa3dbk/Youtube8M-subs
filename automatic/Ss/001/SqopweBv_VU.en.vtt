 and of course in the next point 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.609
 for years 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.759
 and the pharmaceutical industry will take care of the rest 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.759

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.520
 also researchers and family 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.630
 form the multidisciplinary team that one affected by a brain tumor needs 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.630
 time to face the diagnosis and treatment of this pathology 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.220
 part of them have given appointment at the clinical hospital san carlos de madrid 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.010
 to celebrate the first day of the association of affected by tumors 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.800
 Brain in Spain 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.190
 based on the therapeutic approach of this pathology from all points 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.170
 of view and that has had the endorsement of the Spanish research group in 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.170
 neurooncología and the collaboration of roche farma 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.850
 brain tumors have a relatively low incidence and the city 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.920
 with 5 per 100 thousand inhabitants, which is 2 percent of all 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.890
 cancers 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.000
 It is estimated that around three thousand new people are diagnosed each year in Spain 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.440
 cases 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.380
 a corner kick disappointment that is necessary to cover well needs 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.320
 that patients require 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.250
 during the intervention and that after his intervention 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.590
 the improvement of the quality of education that is the advice to the Zambians 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.240
 is 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.479
 Brain tumors in Spain do not have the same degree of 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.690
 incidence than other types of tumors 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.460
 approximately three thousand a year 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.820
 but a single life back side worthwhile to create a 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.680
 association 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.620
 Some of the most important objectives is to encourage breastfeeding 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.660
 life of patients 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.150
 advise them 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.300
 encourage research 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.990
 of the administration and private entities and to increase the investment that 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.280
 is done in hospitals and from the association we consider p 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:12.279
 more hospitals can be created or created 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:13.409
 reference 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.579
 i 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.659
 we believe it necessary that 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.680
 regardless of where of residual patient has the best treatment 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.360
 oncological as well as assistance throughout the period of the 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.119
 disease 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.449
 they do not tell you the news that you have a brain tumor 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.449
 know that there is an association dedicated to this 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.129
 because in my case it was not like that 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.729
 what what is good 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.429
 there are people behind 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.359
 time in supporting old 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.870
 in these moments many nothing is missing because you really do not know that you can 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.169
 get there is an association like this because 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.669
 at that time there was no 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.749
 praised the perspective that I have 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.879
 if you see 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.279
 that may be missing because I do not know what 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.909
 to any doubt passed by the same thing that I 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.099
 will go through room hello that such 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.109
 hilario goes through the same emirates team and not 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.840
 the attention must begin since the brain injury was diagnosed 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.300
 and that it is very important that all professionals involved in 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.360
 the handling that injury stein coordinator sky the case before making a decision 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.129
 a committee is presented where a cheekbone to say they are all professionals from 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.549
 January Surgeons Oncologists Radiologists Pathologists Rehabilitation 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.769
 would psychologists and the guru make the decisions agreed on that 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:34.439
 environment 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.029
 in the last five or seven years there has been a very fast forward 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:38.999
 important 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:42.009
 both from the molecular point of view of the knowledge of why they occur 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:46.239
 these diseases that what types of tumors there up to even technique 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.309
 advances in surgical techniques or radiotherapy iñigo of course the subject 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:53.669
 the drugs the main challenge is to get the patent to be cured that is 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.609
 very clear of being in desires can be cured that his life power is the most 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.079
 as long as possible and that also the boyfriend of wounded conatel 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:03.589
 the best 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:08.029
 we can despite the fact that they eat the production of new technologies in 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:08.999
 new 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.609
 percent and the performance has greatly improved survival is not 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.809
 our war is we are still 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.400
 very far from the ideal situation that is 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.340
 cure most of the tumors that is why it is necessary 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.860
 Introduce 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.860
 new tools in the treatment 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.960
 most effective methods to remove tumors 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.789
 and more effective methods to improve it 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.889
 ok to preserve it well 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.360
 rehabilitate the functions that can be lost during treatment 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:46.699
 the neurosurgeon is the first front of action before a brain tumor we are 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.210
 the first ones that we act 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.720
 and what we intend is to remove eating the whole tumor played well the greatest 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.550
 part 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.980
 possible polite tumor has shown that the more smoke they removed 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:01.020
 the forecast is much better 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.190
 every time is greater because there were patients in which the talent portrays with 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.469
 It needs to be used 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:13.199
 almost always percent and is used as the club before the quiroz treatment 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.339
 ico meaning when the surgery has not been able 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.719
 resect the brain tumor completely 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.639
 or when having dried it 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.330
 percent is supposed to be a very aggressive tumor that could have 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.900
 remain tumor residual trails in which it is necessary to list as there 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.919
 true complementary way to have now technically available 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.170
 radiotherapy 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.400
 per cent very conformed what is to be called the network future intensive therapy 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.659
 that offers a huge advantage what is it? 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.669
 make more and more precise treatments where the high dose 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.559
 it conforms very well to the shape of the tumor 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:54.899
 and we managed to give very low doses in the healthy tissues that are surrounding 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:59.879
 these tumors another more striking technological advance that goes hand in hand with 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:00.460
 East of 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.379
 therapies conformed is to be able to do 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:06.779
 a radiotherapy that we call day by picture 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:11.019
 the diagnosis of a brain tumor giron emotional impact very important 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:16.389
 generates feelings of vulnerability fear or fear of sadness 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.270
 besides that in which in brain tumor 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.350
 generates a year at the cerebral level, the resignation 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.219
 that can affect memory areas attention and language 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:30.769
 to be able to cover the needs of patients and be able to provide a better 

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:31.860
 Attention 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.509
 It is necessary that the psychologist is specialized in processes 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:36.520
 ecological 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.439
 know at the level of psychological processes that may be affected 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:44.629
 and that reduce the quality of life so much if they were not of the patient 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.520
 yes attention with colon these patients goes from the first moments 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:52.439
 in him to try to diminish of the blind man to alleviate the emotional impact 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:57.169
 in patients present moment of diagnosis as well as help 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.249
 face the different phases of the disease 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:01.159
 percent 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.879
 both the patient and the family and on the other hand the psychologist 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.659
 have to try 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:10.039
 you do not have to try to establish cognitive rehabilitation programs 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.099
 to be able to work the deficits that the patients could 

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:15.279
 present 

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:18.580
 a scene finished the psychological treatments 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.360
 there are few specialists who are trained in a specific way 

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:25.729
 in it in the following cities 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:28.029
 the shortcomings that this type of patients have
