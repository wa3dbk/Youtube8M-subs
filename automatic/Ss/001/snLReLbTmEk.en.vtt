you<00:01:59.329> have<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.600> same<00:01:59.869> thing<00:02:00.110> in<00:02:00.229> your<00:02:00.319> tricky

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
you have the same thing in your tricky

those cartilages ribs that hold it open

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.880 
those cartilages ribs that hold it open
it<00:02:05.270> just<00:02:05.450> collapses<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.409> that's<00:02:06.590> what<00:02:06.770> was

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
it just collapses and that's what was

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.279 
it just collapses and that's what was
happening<00:02:07.310> with<00:02:07.429> Kaiba<00:02:07.700> he<00:02:08.360> essentially<00:02:08.929> just

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
happening with Kaiba he essentially just

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.869 
happening with Kaiba he essentially just
would<00:02:09.590> go<00:02:09.709> through<00:02:09.890> episodes<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.459> with<00:02:10.700> not

being able to breathe and it was

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.050 
being able to breathe and it was
life-threatening<00:02:12.709> before<00:02:13.370> this<00:02:13.640> 3d

nose throat surgeon would have to go in

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.930 
nose throat surgeon would have to go in
there<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.530> just<00:02:18.590> kind<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.400> figure<00:02:19.760> out<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.720 
exactly how that sleeve was going to fit
etc<00:02:31.489> so<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.180> being<00:02:32.720> able<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.019> reproduce<00:02:33.730> the

this child's Anatomy outside of his body

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.280 
this child's Anatomy outside of his body
with<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.150> technology<00:02:38.510> they<00:02:38.900> were<00:02:39.019> able<00:02:39.260> to

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
with this technology they were able to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.000 
with this technology they were able to
make<00:02:39.950> models<00:02:40.579> of<00:02:40.730> his<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.599> a<00:02:41.660> trachea<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:42.410> then

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
make models of his is a trachea and then

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.879 
make models of his is a trachea and then
they<00:02:43.760> were<00:02:43.819> able<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.510> design<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:45.109> slip<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.799> be

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
they were able to design this slip to be

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.340 
they were able to design this slip to be
the<00:02:46.010> perfect<00:02:46.459> size<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.720> perfect<00:02:47.900> shape

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
the perfect size and the perfect shape

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.930 
the perfect size and the perfect shape
and<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.620> perfect<00:02:48.889> strength<00:02:49.519> this<00:02:49.760> is

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
and the perfect strength this is

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.160 
and the perfect strength this is
actually<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.269> biopolymer

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
actually a biopolymer

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.870 
actually a biopolymer
in<00:02:51.319> about<00:02:51.590> two<00:02:51.829> to<00:02:51.859> three<00:02:52.160> years<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:52.609> going

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
in about two to three years it's going

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.259 
in about two to three years it's going
to<00:02:53.000> dissolve<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:54.139> be<00:02:55.130> gone<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.639> by<00:02:55.790> then<00:02:56.030> his

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
to dissolve and be gone and by then his

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.240 
to dissolve and be gone and by then his
trachea<00:02:56.810> would<00:02:57.079> have<00:02:57.290> dried<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:57.980> he<00:02:58.100> will

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
trachea would have dried and he will

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.870 
trachea would have dried and he will
have<00:02:58.310> been<00:02:58.489> with<00:02:58.639> domino<00:02:59.920> awesome<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.069> you

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
have been with domino awesome and you

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.180 
have been with domino awesome and you
know<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.000> just<00:03:02.180> got<00:03:02.329> word<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.720> Kaiba<00:03:03.190> his

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
know I just got word that Kaiba his

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.090 
know I just got word that Kaiba his
mother<00:03:04.430> heard<00:03:04.639> him<00:03:04.790> cry<00:03:05.030> for<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.299> first<00:03:05.569> time

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
mother heard him cry for the first time

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.830 
mother heard him cry for the first time
I've<00:03:07.100> heard<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:07.639> he's<00:03:07.819> growing<00:03:08.269> finally<00:03:08.720> and

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
I've heard so he's growing finally and

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.609 
I've heard so he's growing finally and
he's<00:03:08.930> doing<00:03:09.109> really<00:03:09.200> really<00:03:09.739> watch<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.130> cutie
