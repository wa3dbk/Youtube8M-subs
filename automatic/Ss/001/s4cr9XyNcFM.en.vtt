skin<00:01:24.030> liked<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.280> there's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
skin liked it so I do like that there's

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.539 
skin liked it so I do like that there's
you<00:01:27.509> know<00:01:27.540> more<00:01:28.049> than<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.530> time<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.369> try

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
