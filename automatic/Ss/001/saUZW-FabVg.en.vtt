because it's so simplistic there's only

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.030

two<00:00:33.930> pieces<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.059> then<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.800> that<00:00:37.800> piece

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
two pieces and then you have that piece

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.670 
two pieces and then you have that piece
right<00:00:38.190> there<00:00:38.420> now<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.480> downside<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
straw sippy cup is you have to pull so

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.840 
straw sippy cup is you have to pull so
hard<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.940> get<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.329> piece<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:47.460> hard<00:00:47.730> I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
hard to get this piece in see how hard I

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.750 
hard to get this piece in see how hard I
had<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> pull<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.480> out<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.219> plastic

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
had to pull and out that the plastic

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
had to pull and out that the plastic
starts<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.329> splinter<00:00:51.930> right<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
starts to splinter right here and you

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.569 
starts to splinter right here and you
have<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.860> watch<00:00:53.070> it

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
have to watch it

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.209 
have to watch it
so<00:00:53.910> they're<00:00:54.329> not<00:00:54.510> good<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.469> long<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.100> you'd

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
so they're not good as long as you'd

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.900 
so they're not good as long as you'd
like<00:00:56.250> them<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.710> I<00:00:58.710> stopped<00:00:59.340> taking<00:00:59.579> this

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
like them to be so I stopped taking this

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.180 
like them to be so I stopped taking this
piece<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.480> every<00:01:00.870> time<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.079> washed<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.710> there's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190

piece out every time I washed it there's
really<00:01:02.280> no<00:01:02.670> reason<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.629> take<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.960> out<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.830> can

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
really no reason to take it out you can

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.850 
really no reason to take it out you can
wash<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.280> while<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.680> get

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
wash it while it's in there you can get

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.429 
wash it while it's in there you can get
to<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.310> parts<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> and
