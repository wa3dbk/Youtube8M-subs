00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
amount of time fairly long but this was

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.490 
amount of time fairly long but this was
very<00:01:10.010> fast<00:01:10.430> very<00:01:10.820> efficient<00:01:11.570> they<00:01:12.170> got<00:01:12.350> my

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500

assume if you could turn back the hands

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.420 
assume if you could turn back the hands
of<00:01:20.900> time<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.409> have<00:01:21.530> all<00:01:21.680> your<00:01:21.830> money<00:01:22.040> back<00:01:22.220> and
