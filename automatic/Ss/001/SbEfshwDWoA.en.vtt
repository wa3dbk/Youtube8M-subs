my space and newest thing right now
which<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.990> sort<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.680> battle<00:01:53.189> front<00:01:53.460> desk

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
which is a sort of battle front desk

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.080 
which is a sort of battle front desk
level<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.560> I've<00:01:55.710> been<00:01:55.829> working<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.310> which<00:01:57.060> is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
level that I've been working on which is

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.569 
level that I've been working on which is
a<00:01:57.299> ship<00:01:57.899> we're<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:58.680> Lisa's<00:01:59.009> ship<00:01:59.250> about<00:01:59.520> two

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
a ship we're at Lisa's ship about two

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.770 
a ship we're at Lisa's ship about two
large<00:02:00.090> ships<00:02:01.040> side<00:02:02.040> by<00:02:02.250> side<00:02:02.549> whereas<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
large ships side by side whereas the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.959 
large ships side by side whereas the
people<00:02:04.110> pilot<00:02:04.710> Lee<00:02:04.829> smaller<00:02:05.130> ships<00:02:05.399> fighting

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
people pilot Lee smaller ships fighting

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.740 
people pilot Lee smaller ships fighting
over<00:02:06.780> basic<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.340> basic<00:02:08.819> sorry<00:02:09.090> my<00:02:09.300> mind<00:02:09.509> so

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
over basic so the basic sorry my mind so

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.100 
over basic so the basic sorry my mind so
it<00:02:10.110> plays<00:02:10.440> arm

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
it plays arm

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.470 
it plays arm
basically<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.260> way<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.500> works<00:02:13.740> is<00:02:14.010> that

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
basically the way it works is that

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.790 
basically the way it works is that
there's<00:02:15.480> going<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.660> be<00:02:15.720> space<00:02:15.990> combat<00:02:16.290> using

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
there's going to be space combat using

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.100 
there's going to be space combat using
smaller<00:02:17.070> ships<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.240> objective<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.870> to

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
smaller ships and the objective is to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.440 
smaller ships and the objective is to
infiltrate<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.890> enemy's<00:02:20.340> ship<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.880> blow<00:02:21.300> up

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
infiltrate the enemy's ship and blow up

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.810 
infiltrate the enemy's ship and blow up
their<00:02:21.720> core<00:02:22.320> or<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.830> Power<00:02:23.010> Core<00:02:23.280> or<00:02:23.490> whatever

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
their core or the Power Core or whatever

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.640 
their core or the Power Core or whatever
you<00:02:24.480> really<00:02:24.840> want<00:02:24.990> to<00:02:25.020> call<00:02:25.200> that's<00:02:25.380> probably

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
you really want to call that's probably

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.900 
you really want to call that's probably
going<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.100> back<00:02:26.250> part<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.640> ship

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
going to be in the back part of the ship

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.320 
going to be in the back part of the ship
over<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:29.010> ship<00:02:29.220> over<00:02:29.430> there<00:02:29.580> isn't

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
over here so that ship over there isn't

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.970 
over here so that ship over there isn't
actually<00:02:30.390> finished<00:02:30.930> because<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.530> was<00:02:31.800> going<00:02:31.920> to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
actually finished because I was going to

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.620 
actually finished because I was going to
end<00:02:32.130> up<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.370> copying<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.850> pasting<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.360> one

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
end up just copying and pasting this one

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.750 
end up just copying and pasting this one
and<00:02:33.840> putting<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.680> over<00:02:34.770> there<00:02:35.100> as<00:02:35.250> well<00:02:35.490> by

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and putting it over there as well by

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.950 
and putting it over there as well by
editing<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.240> little<00:02:36.270> bit<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.750> looks<00:02:36.900> a

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
editing a little bit so it looks a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.910 
editing a little bit so it looks a
little<00:02:37.050> bit<00:02:37.230> different<00:02:39.050> so<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.470> probably

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
little bit different so this is probably

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.590 
little bit different so this is probably
the<00:02:41.040> ship<00:02:41.700> here<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.060> about<00:02:42.300> eighty<00:02:42.480> percent

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
the ship here is about eighty percent

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.540 
the ship here is about eighty percent
done<00:02:43.050> like<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.650> said<00:02:43.740> I've<00:02:43.860> got<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.070> bags<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.460> do

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
done like I said I've got the bags to do

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.160 
done like I said I've got the bags to do
and<00:02:44.790> that's<00:02:44.940> about<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.840> bags<00:02:46.020> going

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
and that's about it and the bags going

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.480 
and that's about it and the bags going
to<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.500> core<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:46.830> it's<00:02:47.130> going<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> have

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
to have the core and it's going to have

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.140 
to have the core and it's going to have
more<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.140> on<00:02:49.140> ground<00:02:49.740> fighting<00:02:50.280> sort<00:02:51.060> of

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
more of a on ground fighting sort of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.360 
more of a on ground fighting sort of
level<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.050> so<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:52.980> i<00:02:53.100> look<00:02:53.130> at<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
level to it and so if i look at the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.180 
level to it and so if i look at the
front<00:02:53.610> here<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:54.390> it's<00:02:54.570> pretty<00:02:55.040> it's<00:02:56.040> not

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
front here like it's pretty it's not

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.680 
front here like it's pretty it's not
right<00:02:56.310> looking<00:02:56.550> ship<00:02:56.820> actually<00:02:57.060> too<00:02:57.390> bad<00:02:57.540> it's

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
right looking ship actually too bad it's

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.440 
right looking ship actually too bad it's
the<00:02:57.780> station<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> won't<00:02:58.530> actually<00:02:58.650> fly<00:02:59.450> which

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
the station it won't actually fly which

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.030 
the station it won't actually fly which
sucks<00:03:00.810> i<00:03:00.959> mean<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.200> would<00:03:01.290> be<00:03:01.410> nice<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.890> have

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
sucks i mean it would be nice to have

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.640 
sucks i mean it would be nice to have
these<00:03:02.280> large<00:03:02.550> ships<00:03:02.970> flying<00:03:03.330> around<00:03:03.650> we'll

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
these large ships flying around we'll

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.080 
these large ships flying around we'll
see<00:03:04.800> your<00:03:04.890> friends<00:03:05.220> pilot<00:03:05.550> but<00:03:05.760> i<00:03:05.790> think<00:03:06.000> that

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
see your friends pilot but i think that

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.940 
see your friends pilot but i think that
would<00:03:06.330> be<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> bit<00:03:06.690> too<00:03:06.840> laggy<00:03:07.080> for<00:03:07.260> some<00:03:07.590> people

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
would be a bit too laggy for some people

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.710 
would be a bit too laggy for some people
so<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.220> kind<00:03:08.520> of<00:03:08.550> just<00:03:08.730> left<00:03:08.940> at<00:03:09.090> how<00:03:09.240> it<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.480> as<00:03:09.690> a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
so I kind of just left at how it is as a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.530 
so I kind of just left at how it is as a
station<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.580> enemies<00:03:11.850> will<00:03:12.060> have<00:03:12.240> sorry

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
station so the enemies will have sorry

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.960 
station so the enemies will have sorry
so<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.930> each<00:03:13.020> team<00:03:13.380> will<00:03:13.650> have<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:14.160> series<00:03:14.820> of

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
so that each team will have a series of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.910 
so that each team will have a series of
ships<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.690> will<00:03:15.930> basically<00:03:16.170> be<00:03:16.560> their

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
ships that will basically be their

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.949 
ships that will basically be their
tickets<00:03:17.340> once<00:03:18.090> all<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.300> ships<00:03:18.540> have<00:03:18.720> gone

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
tickets once all the ships have gone

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.790 
tickets once all the ships have gone
it's<00:03:19.769> like<00:03:20.250> that's<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.720> kind<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.200> lose<00:03:22.470> or

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
it's like that's in you kind of lose or

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.440 
it's like that's in you kind of lose or
if<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.010> core<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.400> destroyed<00:03:23.580> then<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.239> also

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
if you core is destroyed then you also

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.900 
if you core is destroyed then you also
lose<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.680> win<00:03:25.890> if<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.070> destroy<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.459> enemy's

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
lose you win if you destroy the enemy's

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.390 
lose you win if you destroy the enemy's
core<00:03:27.150> if<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.570> destroy<00:03:27.930> all<00:03:28.230> their<00:03:28.380> ships<00:03:28.709> so

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
core if you destroy all their ships so

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.550 
core if you destroy all their ships so
right<00:03:29.610> now<00:03:29.640> this<00:03:30.510> little<00:03:30.840> here<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.320> pretty

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
right now this little here is pretty

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.410 
right now this little here is pretty
empty<00:03:31.800> you've<00:03:32.100> got<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.370> front<00:03:32.580> door<00:03:33.090> over

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
empty you've got the front door over

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.210 
empty you've got the front door over
there<00:03:33.450> you've<00:03:33.989> got<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.230> large<00:03:34.620> hangar<00:03:35.040> door

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
there you've got this large hangar door

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.610 
there you've got this large hangar door
here<00:03:35.600> now<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.660> ship's<00:03:36.959> going<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.200> leave<00:03:37.350> and

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
here now the ship's going to leave and

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.250 
here now the ship's going to leave and
enter<00:03:38.340> through<00:03:38.880> both<00:03:39.030> these<00:03:39.150> doors<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.780> added

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
enter through both these doors I added

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.560 
enter through both these doors I added
the<00:03:40.350> front<00:03:40.590> door<00:03:40.739> they're<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.150> wasn't

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
the front door they're just so it wasn't

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.020 
the front door they're just so it wasn't
bottleneck<00:03:43.080> that<00:03:43.110> these<00:03:43.519> large<00:03:44.519> hangar<00:03:44.850> doors

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
bottleneck that these large hangar doors

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.759 
bottleneck that these large hangar doors
for<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.870> enemy<00:03:46.170> can't<00:03:46.380> just<00:03:46.590> sit

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
for that and the enemy can't just sit

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.979 
for that and the enemy can't just sit
outside<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.760> constantly<00:03:48.180> bomb<00:03:48.510> people<00:03:48.870> who

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
outside and constantly bomb people who

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.259 
outside and constantly bomb people who
come<00:03:49.260> out<00:03:49.470> through<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.220> one<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.790> only<00:03:50.880> door

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
come out through the one and only door

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.180 
come out through the one and only door
so<00:03:51.750> I've<00:03:51.840> added<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.170> second<00:03:52.560> or<00:03:52.680> two<00:03:52.860> kind<00:03:53.130> of

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
so I've added a second or two kind of

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.520 
so I've added a second or two kind of
filter<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.820> little<00:03:54.150> bit<00:03:54.269> i<00:03:54.600> might<00:03:55.350> add

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
filter that a little bit i might add

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.229 
filter that a little bit i might add
another<00:03:55.800> door<00:03:56.040> as<00:03:56.190> well<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.850> other<00:03:57.000> side

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
another door as well to the other side

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.110 
another door as well to the other side
just<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.110> make<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.410> little<00:03:58.500> bit<00:03:58.709> easier<00:03:59.120> but

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
just to make it a little bit easier but

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.020 
just to make it a little bit easier but
we've<00:04:00.570> got<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.140> then<00:04:01.170> we<00:04:01.350> have<00:04:01.590> or<00:04:02.400> we

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
we've got that and then we have or we

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.320 
we've got that and then we have or we
will<00:04:03.269> have<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:04.320> back<00:04:04.950> level<00:04:05.459> here<00:04:05.880> with<00:04:06.180> like

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
will have a back level here with like

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.810 
will have a back level here with like
the<00:04:06.510> core<00:04:06.810> i<00:04:07.110> will<00:04:07.920> make<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.640> these

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
the core i will make it so that these

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.420 
the core i will make it so that these
ships<00:04:09.090> can't<00:04:09.390> get<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.019> cause<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:11.010> has<00:04:11.250> to

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
ships can't get to the cause it has to

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.280 
ships can't get to the cause it has to
be<00:04:11.459> done<00:04:11.700> on<00:04:11.880> foot<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:12.510> if<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:12.870> fly<00:04:13.080> your<00:04:13.230> ship

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
be done on foot so if you fly your ship

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.590 
be done on foot so if you fly your ship
in<00:04:13.560> here<00:04:13.799> you'll<00:04:13.980> have<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.250> jump<00:04:14.519> out<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:14.970> then

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
in here you'll have to jump out and then

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.830 
in here you'll have to jump out and then
go<00:04:15.870> over<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.410> try<00:04:16.769> and

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
go over to try and

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.310 
go over to try and
it<00:04:18.519> we<00:04:19.519> do<00:04:19.669> have<00:04:19.850> an<00:04:20.000> upstairs<00:04:20.269> as<00:04:20.660> well<00:04:20.690> using

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
it we do have an upstairs as well using

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.010 
it we do have an upstairs as well using
this<00:04:21.590> gravity<00:04:22.010> lift<00:04:22.130> here<00:04:22.370> now<00:04:22.910> gravity<00:04:23.240> works

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
this gravity lift here now gravity works

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.810 
this gravity lift here now gravity works
a<00:04:24.139> little<00:04:24.230> bit<00:04:24.410> differently<00:04:24.800> now<00:04:25.010> in<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.669> fact

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
a little bit differently now in the fact

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.430 
a little bit differently now in the fact
that<00:04:25.880> it<00:04:26.030> turns<00:04:26.270> you<00:04:26.389> around<00:04:26.600> before<00:04:26.930> it<00:04:27.229> pulls

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
that it turns you around before it pulls

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.200 
that it turns you around before it pulls
you<00:04:27.560> up<00:04:27.710> which<00:04:28.310> is<00:04:28.490> something<00:04:28.729> that<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:29.000> thought

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
you up which is something that I thought

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.550 
you up which is something that I thought
was<00:04:29.270> really<00:04:29.600> weird<00:04:29.900> that<00:04:30.080> they've<00:04:30.229> added

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
was really weird that they've added

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.100 
was really weird that they've added
hopefully<00:04:31.310> that<00:04:31.460> gets<00:04:31.580> fixed<00:04:32.000> later<00:04:32.180> on<00:04:32.419> but

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
hopefully that gets fixed later on but

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.110 
hopefully that gets fixed later on but
up<00:04:33.290> here<00:04:33.320> is<00:04:33.740> basically<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.490> top<00:04:34.669> of<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:34.850> ship

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
up here is basically the top of the ship

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.379 
up here is basically the top of the ship
and<00:04:35.270> up<00:04:35.750> here<00:04:36.050> will<00:04:36.320> be<00:04:36.550> turrets<00:04:37.550> or<00:04:37.760> small

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
and up here will be turrets or small

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:39.879 
and up here will be turrets or small
turrets<00:04:38.720> like<00:04:38.840> you<00:04:38.960> saw<00:04:39.139> in<00:04:39.169> my<00:04:39.530> previous

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
turrets like you saw in my previous

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.700 
turrets like you saw in my previous
video<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.570> think<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:41.660> might<00:04:41.870> have<00:04:41.900> two<00:04:42.380> or<00:04:42.410> three

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
video I think I might have two or three

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.830 
video I think I might have two or three
per<00:04:43.160> ship<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.550> think<00:04:43.580> two<00:04:43.940> would<00:04:44.150> be<00:04:44.210> in<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.810> right

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
per ship I think two would be in a right

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.770 
per ship I think two would be in a right
number<00:04:45.350> this<00:04:46.310> is<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.729> just<00:04:46.970> if<00:04:47.210> anyone<00:04:47.540> wants

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
number this is the just if anyone wants

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.980 
number this is the just if anyone wants
to<00:04:47.870> stay<00:04:48.080> back<00:04:48.699> and<00:04:49.699> hold<00:04:50.000> off<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.389> enemies<00:04:50.750> as

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
to stay back and hold off the enemies as

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.080 
to stay back and hold off the enemies as
best<00:04:51.229> they<00:04:51.320> can<00:04:51.440> they<00:04:52.370> can<00:04:52.550> do<00:04:52.700> that<00:04:52.850> up<00:04:53.060> here

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
best they can they can do that up here

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.260 
best they can they can do that up here
using<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.750> turrets<00:04:54.550> I've<00:04:55.550> also<00:04:55.850> got<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.180> so

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
using the turrets I've also got it so

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.450 
using the turrets I've also got it so
that<00:04:56.419> you<00:04:56.540> can<00:04:56.840> go<00:04:57.290> down<00:04:57.650> using<00:04:57.979> these<00:04:58.190> two

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
that you can go down using these two

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.980 
that you can go down using these two
holes<00:04:58.700> here<00:04:58.820> as<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.389> guys<00:04:59.540> can<00:04:59.720> probably

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
holes here as you guys can probably

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.170 
holes here as you guys can probably
imagine<00:05:00.370> falling<00:05:01.370> down<00:05:01.610> here<00:05:01.820> is<00:05:01.910> impossible

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
imagine falling down here is impossible

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.210 
imagine falling down here is impossible
because<00:05:02.570> of<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.870> gravity<00:05:03.290> so<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:03.889> just<00:05:04.070> come

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
because of the gravity so you just come

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.670 
because of the gravity so you just come
over<00:05:04.250> here<00:05:04.669> and<00:05:04.729> you<00:05:04.820> can<00:05:04.910> fall<00:05:05.180> down<00:05:05.680> but

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
over here and you can fall down but

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.260 
over here and you can fall down but
that's<00:05:06.860> basically<00:05:07.040> it<00:05:07.430> for<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.820> ship<00:05:08.060> thus

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
that's basically it for the ship thus

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.360 
that's basically it for the ship thus
far<00:05:08.600> i<00:05:08.900> might<00:05:09.229> i<00:05:09.500> don't<00:05:10.010> think<00:05:10.190> i'll<00:05:10.250> do

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
far i might i don't think i'll do

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.159 
far i might i don't think i'll do
another<00:05:10.400> video<00:05:10.729> of<00:05:10.940> me<00:05:11.030> updating<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:11.600> I<00:05:11.780> think

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
another video of me updating it I think

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.600 
another video of me updating it I think
I'll<00:05:12.229> just<00:05:12.350> finish<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:13.100> then<00:05:13.190> release<00:05:13.280> it

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
I'll just finish it and then release it

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.659 
I'll just finish it and then release it
might<00:05:13.970> be<00:05:14.150> it<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:15.260> will<00:05:15.860> have<00:05:16.130> i<00:05:16.310> will<00:05:16.460> be<00:05:16.580> using

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
might be it I will have i will be using

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.760 
might be it I will have i will be using
the<00:05:17.030> ship's<00:05:17.180> for<00:05:17.539> the<00:05:17.660> most<00:05:17.840> part<00:05:18.080> it's

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
the ship's for the most part it's

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.550 
the ship's for the most part it's
because<00:05:18.860> i<00:05:19.070> like<00:05:19.520> them<00:05:19.760> oh<00:05:20.229> you<00:05:21.229> guys<00:05:21.320> can

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
because i like them oh you guys can

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.930 
because i like them oh you guys can
obviously<00:05:21.740> use<00:05:21.889> whatever<00:05:22.190> ships<00:05:22.520> you<00:05:22.700> want

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
obviously use whatever ships you want

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.779 
obviously use whatever ships you want
though<00:05:23.570> i<00:05:23.600> wanted<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:24.560> use<00:05:24.800> these<00:05:25.070> just<00:05:25.610> like<00:05:25.729> a

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
though i wanted to use these just like a

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.450 
though i wanted to use these just like a
keep<00:05:26.090> it<00:05:26.240> balanced<00:05:26.600> for<00:05:26.780> both<00:05:26.930> teams<00:05:27.200> I<00:05:27.560> mean

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
keep it balanced for both teams I mean

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.010 
keep it balanced for both teams I mean
these<00:05:28.669> ships<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:29.000> good<00:05:29.180> these<00:05:29.360> ships<00:05:29.570> handle

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
these ships a good these ships handle

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.200 
these ships a good these ships handle
really<00:05:30.650> really<00:05:30.950> well<00:05:31.130> I<00:05:31.160> like<00:05:31.910> how<00:05:32.060> they

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
really really well I like how they

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.570 
really really well I like how they
perform<00:05:32.630> but<00:05:33.380> actually<00:05:33.650> really<00:05:34.070> really<00:05:34.190> small

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
perform but actually really really small

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.360 
perform but actually really really small
as<00:05:34.789> well<00:05:34.970> if<00:05:35.120> I<00:05:35.240> can<00:05:35.389> find<00:05:35.720> a<00:05:36.080> small<00:05:36.860> gap<00:05:37.160> I'll

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
as well if I can find a small gap I'll

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.700 
as well if I can find a small gap I'll
actually<00:05:37.490> show<00:05:37.639> you<00:05:37.840> how<00:05:38.840> small<00:05:39.169> of<00:05:39.229> a<00:05:39.440> gap

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
actually show you how small of a gap

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.370 
actually show you how small of a gap
these<00:05:39.919> things<00:05:40.130> can<00:05:40.310> actually<00:05:40.400> fit<00:05:40.729> in<00:05:41.229> so<00:05:42.229> that

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
these things can actually fit in so that

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.409 
these things can actually fit in so that
there<00:05:42.590> oh<00:05:42.800> no<00:05:43.340> that's<00:05:43.580> not<00:05:43.700> good<00:05:43.789> enough<00:05:43.970> that

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
there oh no that's not good enough that

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.330 
there oh no that's not good enough that
isn't<00:05:44.889> actually<00:05:45.889> will<00:05:46.220> that<00:05:46.669> work<00:05:46.849> I<00:05:48.340> don't

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
isn't actually will that work I don't

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.180 
isn't actually will that work I don't
think<00:05:49.520> so<00:05:49.990> basically<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.200> ship<00:05:51.410> can<00:05:51.560> fit<00:05:51.800> in<00:05:52.010> a

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
think so basically the ship can fit in a

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.279 
think so basically the ship can fit in a
2<00:05:52.669> x<00:05:53.180> 1<00:05:53.450> gap<00:05:54.260> so<00:05:54.530> two<00:05:55.810> horizontal<00:05:56.810> and<00:05:57.050> one

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
2 x 1 gap so two horizontal and one

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.550 
2 x 1 gap so two horizontal and one
block<00:05:57.620> a<00:05:57.860> vertical<00:05:58.460> I<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:59.810> don't<00:06:00.080> have<00:06:00.229> any<00:06:00.380> more

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
block a vertical I I don't have any more

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.350 
block a vertical I I don't have any more
camps<00:06:00.979> to<00:06:01.160> go<00:06:01.310> through<00:06:01.610> I<00:06:01.760> guess<00:06:01.970> I<00:06:02.090> could<00:06:02.240> just

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
camps to go through I guess I could just

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.170 
camps to go through I guess I could just
make<00:06:02.630> one<00:06:02.900> but<00:06:03.770> are<00:06:03.950> actually<00:06:04.520> anti<00:06:04.970> where<00:06:05.150> I

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
make one but are actually anti where I

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.170 
make one but are actually anti where I
can<00:06:05.360> make<00:06:05.510> one<00:06:05.740> so<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:07.039> ship<00:06:07.370> is<00:06:07.580> pretty<00:06:07.849> are

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
can make one so the ship is pretty are

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.990 
can make one so the ship is pretty are
pretty<00:06:09.169> tough<00:06:09.380> structurally<00:06:10.039> I'm<00:06:10.250> talking

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
pretty tough structurally I'm talking

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.180 
pretty tough structurally I'm talking
about<00:06:11.060> the<00:06:11.240> large<00:06:11.479> ship<00:06:11.720> here<00:06:11.960> I'm<00:06:12.950> going<00:06:13.130> to

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
about the large ship here I'm going to

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.650 
about the large ship here I'm going to
try<00:06:13.340> and<00:06:13.430> make<00:06:13.610> it<00:06:13.639> so<00:06:13.910> that<00:06:14.000> you<00:06:14.090> can't<00:06:14.330> just

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
try and make it so that you can't just

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.469 
try and make it so that you can't just
sit<00:06:15.110> outside<00:06:15.260> and<00:06:15.800> rain<00:06:16.130> rockets<00:06:16.729> down<00:06:16.970> to<00:06:17.240> try

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
sit outside and rain rockets down to try

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.110 
sit outside and rain rockets down to try
and<00:06:17.750> get<00:06:17.900> to<00:06:18.410> the<00:06:18.440> core<00:06:18.800> obviously<00:06:19.760> the<00:06:19.910> front

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
and get to the core obviously the front

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.330 
and get to the core obviously the front
part<00:06:20.330> is<00:06:20.510> it<00:06:20.690> as<00:06:20.840> protected<00:06:21.680> as<00:06:21.800> it's<00:06:22.010> only<00:06:22.220> got

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
part is it as protected as it's only got

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.879 
part is it as protected as it's only got
one<00:06:22.610> layer<00:06:22.880> but<00:06:23.690> I<00:06:23.720> imagine<00:06:24.440> the<00:06:24.560> back<00:06:24.710> would

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
one layer but I imagine the back would

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.589 
one layer but I imagine the back would
have<00:06:25.039> quite<00:06:25.310> a<00:06:25.340> few<00:06:25.460> layers<00:06:25.760> protecting<00:06:26.479> it

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
have quite a few layers protecting it

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.230 
have quite a few layers protecting it
the<00:06:27.229> weakest<00:06:27.680> spot<00:06:27.950> of<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:28.219> ship<00:06:28.430> I<00:06:28.580> I<00:06:28.880> feel

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
the weakest spot of the ship I I feel

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.360 
the weakest spot of the ship I I feel
would<00:06:29.870> be<00:06:30.020> these<00:06:30.169> stairs<00:06:30.500> here<00:06:30.800> as<00:06:30.979> they<00:06:31.190> can

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
would be these stairs here as they can

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.870 
would be these stairs here as they can
beat<00:06:31.669> us

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
beat us

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.470 
beat us
Royd<00:06:32.120> with<00:06:32.360> one<00:06:32.630> or<00:06:32.780> two<00:06:32.810> rockets<00:06:34.330> and<00:06:35.330> that's

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.480 
Royd with one or two rockets and that's

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.550 
Royd with one or two rockets and that's
actually<00:06:35.660> where<00:06:35.990> i<00:06:36.020> was<00:06:36.140> going<00:06:36.200> to<00:06:36.350> get<00:06:36.440> the

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
actually where i was going to get the

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.160 
actually where i was going to get the
whole<00:06:36.770> if<00:06:37.280> i<00:06:37.430> get<00:06:37.610> look<00:06:37.790> yeah<00:06:38.120> here<00:06:38.330> we<00:06:38.420> go<00:06:38.450> so

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.170 
whole if i get look yeah here we go so

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.190 
whole if i get look yeah here we go so
this<00:06:39.350> is<00:06:39.500> a<00:06:39.530> 2<00:06:39.710> by<00:06:40.310> one<00:06:40.640> hole<00:06:41.090> and<00:06:41.420> i<00:06:41.990> didn't

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.200 
this is a 2 by one hole and i didn't

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.510 
this is a 2 by one hole and i didn't
actually<00:06:42.260> think<00:06:42.560> this<00:06:42.680> was<00:06:42.890> actually<00:06:43.070> a<00:06:43.250> thing

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
actually think this was actually a thing

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.310 
actually think this was actually a thing
at<00:06:43.640> first<00:06:43.850> but<00:06:44.060> apparently<00:06:44.690> this<00:06:44.750> thing<00:06:45.020> can

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
at first but apparently this thing can

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.740 
at first but apparently this thing can
whiten<00:06:45.670> can<00:06:46.670> fit<00:06:46.970> quite<00:06:47.180> well<00:06:47.240> as<00:06:47.480> you<00:06:47.600> guys

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
whiten can fit quite well as you guys
