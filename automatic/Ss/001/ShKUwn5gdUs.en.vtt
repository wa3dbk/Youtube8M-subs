00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.410
 today we are going to prepare a very 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.870
 simple a different way of 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.429
 prepare the boy the boy is the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.120
 lean muscle that the animal has 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.219
 therefore we must put a little bit of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.369
 fat internally so that during 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.430
 cooking melts or melts 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.410
 impregnate and give me better flavor and a little 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.590
 better texture the ingredients of the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.160
 Sauces are what onion mushrooms 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.609
 cream cheese or cream and a little 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.609
 of broth 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.519
 we have our meat 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.070
 we have put a little fat 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.630
 internally and now let's put a 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.350
 bit 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.100
 of coarse salt or salt barbecue 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.100
 little oil 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.350
 and we take the meat to a low heat for 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.980
 that she is melting the fat a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.980
 little onion 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.570
 we incorporated a bit of background 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.390
 and we incorporated a little mushrooms 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.390
 Pepper 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.150
 for the sauce it 's time to 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.600
 incorporate another bit more than add a 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.600
 little more background and at this moment it's 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.210
 when we are going to add 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.890
 add our milk cream or 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.690
 our cream cheese 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.700
 so that the butter we're going 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.870
 to brown the potato do not burn 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.830
 we add a little bit of oil 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.830
 the butter 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.450
 and thus we are not going down more 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.450
 to add the potato so that they are brown 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.980
 and ready our serving plate 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.930
 and we put our meat 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.590
 on the plate 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.190
 here 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.210
 a little parsley 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.930
 our protagonist of today 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.750
 boy with an onion sauce 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.750
 mushrooms and cream cheese
