00:00:00.327 --> 00:00:02.327
 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.740
 and if YOU are a person who hesitates 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.180
 whether to start a driving license course now, i.e. in 2015 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.520
 Do you have a dilemma and you can do it a bit later 

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:15.251
 in 2016 

00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:16.794
 This movie is just for you 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.220
 And if you're not from the moon, you certainly know 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.042
 that in 2016 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.480
 there are a few very restrictive regulations 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.620
 which, unfortunately, will make life difficult for new drivers 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.239
 just like you 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.060
 First of all, you will have to undergo refresher courses 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.220
 They are supposed to be between the fourth and eight months after you get a lawyer 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.875
 And do not get me wrong 

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:42.809
 The driver learns all his life 

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:45.445
 You may be surprised by a traffic situation all the time 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.300
 And under the very idea of ​​training I sign with these "two hands" 

00:00:51.137 --> 00:00:53.137
 However, I hate one 

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:55.876
 This is the so-called training fiction 

00:00:55.876 --> 00:00:57.721
 So everything is fine on paper 

00:00:57.721 --> 00:00:59.669
 you are trained, of course 

00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:02.896
 you need to jump out of a few pennies. 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.449
 And what will you get for yours 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 hard earned 3 hundred [truth]? 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.136
 Driver on the achievements 

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:12.796
 and you have to jump out of PLN 300 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.640
 It will probably be two hours of chilling during the theory 

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:18.655
 Such a talking head like mine 

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:20.597
 Only I am at least trying 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.980
 However, I do not think that your lecturer 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.140
 you do not know what he told you during this theory 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.300
 Of course, for the scallowing, there will be a practical part 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.760
 where in theory you will have to deal with driving on slippery surfaces 

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.311
 or ABS braking 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.600
 To make it funny, deal with it 

00:01:43.983 --> 00:01:45.983
 it will be you, when at all 

00:01:45.983 --> 00:01:47.898
 you did not drive in that time by car, that is 

00:01:47.898 --> 00:01:49.823
 this 4 months passes 

00:01:50.362 --> 00:01:52.362
 Your car, Dad or Mama did not give 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.100
 and you will have to prove 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.060
 show on this track 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.603
 for driving lessons, to 

00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:02.206
 training ride 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.860
 I suppose it's enough that you just get in the car and brake 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 It will also pass 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.380
 the same is because you apply for this course 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.120
 However, I put 100 to one, that these training who will organize? 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.680
 Well, of course, only WORDs, provincial traffic centers 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.820
 And this is an additional way to fund their budget 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.700
 Normally they should be [co-financed] from the state budget 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.840
 and from driving tests, 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.300
 It is known, it is demographic, fewer people like YOU are trained 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.580
 So there is no money 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.640
 And here the odds for 3 hundred, three hours ... do not die 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.980
 Also, I suppose that this hour of practice will also be 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.971
 She looked just fine on paper 

00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:51.821
 The funniest thing, at least for the moment 

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:53.872
 is that in a large part of the provinces 

00:02:54.098 --> 00:02:56.098
 there are not even such training tracks 

00:02:56.737 --> 00:02:58.737
 And even believe me, how soon they will rise 

00:02:59.258 --> 00:03:01.258
 then you will have to go a long way to this 

00:03:01.407 --> 00:03:03.407
 the only one designated by WORD 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.160
 It is not difficult to guess that such tracks are unlikely to be in the center of provincial cities 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.020
 if they are not there yet. 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.260
 They will only be in the suburbs. Maybe it's in a town 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.800
 15-20, 30 kilometers from this city. Well, where 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:24.539
 they will build this circuit at a cheap cost 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.739
 A short comment on a few other things 

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.773
 Trial period and re-education courses 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.240
 It's a bit cheaper here 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.820
 If you commit 2 offenses against communication security 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.889
 then you will have to take this extra course 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.460
 It costs 5 tips, it lasts 28 hours, i.e. 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.500
 live do not die, not even the whole 20 zlotys / h 

00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:45.641
 per hour 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.880
 You must divide 500 by 28, Well, maybe a little more expensive 

00:03:49.617 --> 00:03:51.617
 Upps: Even two dychy in an hour does not go out !! 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.640
 But what: silent funding again 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.067
 WORD Facilities 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.600
 Green leaf: I remember from the 70's there was something like that 

00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:03.811
 this limitation caused 

00:04:04.218 --> 00:04:06.218
 that you will not be able to exceed 50's 

00:04:06.276 --> 00:04:08.276
 in built-up areas 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.120
 Outside built-up area [maximum speed] 80 km / h 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.620
 On the highway and expressway, the first rate 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.800
 I'm betting, let me say, nut dollars that 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.140
 that the police are already preparing some radar for you 

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:25.208
 Pogawędziłem..poględziłem 

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:26.916
 but what's the conclusion for you 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.880
 What do you have to do now and on vacation in 2015? 

00:04:31.524 --> 00:04:33.524
 not in the fall of 2015 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.200
 Go to some of the best driving school in your area 

00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:41.693
 and sign up as soon as possible and finish the course as soon as possible 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.380
 Later, of course, you sign up for the state exam 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.380
 and it's best that you do it somewhere until November 

00:04:48.397 --> 00:04:50.397
 I will not say that until the first of November, but 

00:04:50.397 --> 00:04:52.132
 let's say: to the second, to the 3rd 

00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:54.175
 And why? 

00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:56.817
 I've already had this story 

00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:58.664
 Later there will be a crowd of volunteers [students] 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.860
 and of course WORDs will be inefficient 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.606
 and dates of state examinations 

00:05:03.026 --> 00:05:05.026
 in WORD [drag] will be extended to this 2016 

00:05:05.026 --> 00:05:06.668
 for January 2016 

00:05:07.305 --> 00:05:09.305
 What basically does not decorate you 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.680
 Well, unless you want to raise your qualifications 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.660
 during these training courses and spend 3 tips more [PLN 300] 

00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:19.007
 Also, the sooner the better 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.060
 Well, count [also] that you can not pass the exam the first time 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.000
 As I mentioned [before], I have already experienced a few such changes to the rules 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.973
 DIY at exams 

00:05:28.973 --> 00:05:30.621
 And every time it was 

00:05:30.655 --> 00:05:32.655
 was [total] Armageddon 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.100
 So much confusion before state examinations and extended deadlines, 

00:05:36.246 --> 00:05:38.246
 In ... curved people 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.640
 that just, it's hard for me to describe it right now 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.240
 However, if you intend to become the driver 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:48.809
 it is necessary to describe it in the commentary 

00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:51.851
 what is the state training and exams like now? 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.940
 whereas if you watch the movie already in 2016 [year] 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.220
 2017, whether 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.640
 I hope he will be there as it is 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.760
 will be [also] a bit later 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.200
 Then just write me what these training courses look like 

00:06:05.435 --> 00:06:07.435
 thanks to which, yes 

00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:09.275
 this is how it is to drive safely in Poland 

00:06:09.443 --> 00:06:11.443
 Young drivers will be so fantastic to ride, 

00:06:11.443 --> 00:06:13.020
 They will not cause accidents that 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.648
 Ho..ho..ho.prawda 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.270
 Darek Kraśnicki from Wrocław also spoke 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.109
 Medical specialist in transport medicine 

00:06:20.754 --> 00:06:22.754
 And see you in my next video.
