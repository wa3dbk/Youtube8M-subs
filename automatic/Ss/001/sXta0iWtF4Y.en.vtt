00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.199
 Haug responded pleased 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.199
 or 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.040
 then one speaks of Leipzig as incredibly creative 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.700
 Leipzig is once Rheine 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.450
 Citizens take the ride before the First World War one of the largest and up 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.630
 one of the richer ones 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.010
 German cities 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.070
 it was little destroyed in the war 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.320
 there is no room for the at the economic area 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.940
 But that is exactly the chance that is so many niches and open spaces and 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.580
 in this constellation if you still have the required openness to it 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.060
 Then maybe what happened in the city just happened to that too many 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.060
 Loyalty three rooms are there that can be occupied 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.620
 the neighborhood help north brings is played 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.560
 that many people that you were this area at that time were very 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.330
 neglected the area is actually still 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.409
 the neighborly help and rebuffed given the opportunity 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.070
 to prevent this area between asphalt 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.630
 and 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.850
 to see it all at once when I am here 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.580
 deal with these things 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.940
 I'm on a wall households take 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.770
 Minden MT 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.770
 against the Danes the biker 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.579
 I mean such a big garden in the middle of the city 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.200
 I am of course an insane luxury and that is now 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.359
 even so it has developed 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:23.319
 around today the people react personal life concept which we in 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.319
 want to realize that this block, of course, especially that the 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.220
 suddenly what is happening here is sparking and developing 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.540
 Now we want to blow up with Traub and here is a niche 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.399
 but this great structure has largely gone down so that they even 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.589
 recognize none in the potential 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:43.019
 become a topic 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.219
 to experience their conceptually or say long-established owners 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.480
 and now something happens 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.659
 we change with we also jump Ines Bode 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.680
 that is such an increase i did not develop one hundred 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.599
 Percent we can manage that has something in common with this creativity 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.549
 Opportunities for development would have suddenly all but Qiagen know 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.489
 No network is increasingly managing it suddenly networked with it 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.019
 with the local people 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.879
 you know personally my lucky fairy is and it always pulls 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.510
 more circles thats just great on being a building block with that trend and that 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.649
 witness 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:19.989
 and I think 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.209
 so that also loyalty Daphne city administration what is concerned and density 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.339
 Smoke on it and the bistro 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.379
 held in their hands 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.679
 there is scope for design 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:38.799
 there are vacant houses there are on the other side in Leipzig very scared 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.379
 many creative people just now also those in the west of Leipzig 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.539
 settled down 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.539
 and percentages of this combination 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:49.839
 really arise 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:53.489
 quite transparent so ordinary things too much to offer by the 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.619
 City administration together to redesign the street 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.619
 we did it and club 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.930
 who would like to implement a kindergarten concept 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.650
 There are a lot of life-hungry people here 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.799
 Free spaces are there to take advantage of these opportunities 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.540
 and her husband once managed to activate certain dimensions 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:18.539
 then 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.689
 It is also easier for outsiders barely with it

 when the officials arrived
