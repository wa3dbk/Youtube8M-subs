00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.730 
we want to add painted abilities to our
load<00:04:27.880> out<00:04:28.090> for<00:04:28.389> being<00:04:28.630> able<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:29.139> adapt<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.560> give

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
load out for being able to adapt to give

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.189 
load out for being able to adapt to give
them<00:04:29.949> test<00:04:30.190> scenarios<00:04:30.699> then<00:04:31.389> we<00:04:31.599> can<00:04:31.810> do<00:04:31.960> some

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
them test scenarios then we can do some

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.439 
them test scenarios then we can do some
exploitation<00:04:33.130> with<00:04:33.370> Mellie<00:04:33.669> unbranded<00:04:34.060> moves

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
exploitation with Mellie unbranded moves

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.230 
exploitation with Mellie unbranded moves
but<00:04:35.199> if<00:04:35.620> we<00:04:35.740> are<00:04:35.889> playing<00:04:36.160> top<00:04:36.460> tier<00:04:36.699> front<00:04:37.030> and

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
but if we are playing top tier front and

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.029 
but if we are playing top tier front and
then<00:04:37.509> we<00:04:37.690> won't<00:04:37.960> be<00:04:38.110> able<00:04:38.199> to<00:04:38.470> get<00:04:38.620> close<00:04:38.800> to

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
then we won't be able to get close to

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.430 
then we won't be able to get close to
the<00:04:39.130> process<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:39.699> I<00:04:40.419> suggest<00:04:40.870> going<00:04:41.139> for<00:04:41.410> a

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
the process and I suggest going for a

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.469 
the process and I suggest going for a
full<00:04:41.680> range<00:04:42.009> rotation<00:04:42.699> trying<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.300> make

full range rotation trying to make
