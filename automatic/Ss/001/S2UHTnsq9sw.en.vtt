00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
oh oh the wood itself I had is such a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.720 
oh oh the wood itself I had is such a
strange<00:00:12.480> place<00:00:16.820> so<00:00:17.820> yeah<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> am<00:00:19.740> incident<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
strange place so yeah I am incident the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.650 
strange place so yeah I am incident the
other<00:00:20.760> day<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.359> needed<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.380> get<00:00:23.160> my<00:00:23.369> oil<00:00:24.269> changed

other day I needed to get my oil changed
I<00:00:25.170> figured<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.800> needed<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.189> changed

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.290 
I figured that it needed to be changed

because I hadn't done it in a while I

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.209

Dexter by his use of the word stop it's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.970 
Dexter by his use of the word stop it's
probably<00:02:34.670> actually<00:02:34.940> incorrect<00:02:35.330> me<00:02:35.540> for<00:02:35.980> my

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
probably actually incorrect me for my

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.930 
probably actually incorrect me for my
Gossage<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.400> worth<00:02:37.580> engine<00:02:37.970> block<00:02:38.150> anyway

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
Gossage is worth engine block anyway

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.500 
Gossage is worth engine block anyway
so<00:02:40.540> yeah<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.610> mean<00:02:42.610> there<00:02:43.150> must<00:02:43.300> have<00:02:43.420> been

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
so yeah I mean there must have been

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.300 
so yeah I mean there must have been
someone<00:02:43.870> well<00:02:44.080> in<00:02:44.260> there<00:02:44.500> because<00:02:44.680> otherwise

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
someone well in there because otherwise

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.950 
someone well in there because otherwise
I<00:02:45.580> would<00:02:45.790> have<00:02:45.820> guessed<00:02:46.090> again<00:02:46.570> lack<00:02:46.810> of

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
I would have guessed again lack of

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
I would have guessed again lack of
knowledge<00:02:47.110> i<00:02:47.350> woulda<00:02:47.500> guessed<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.800> would<00:02:47.860> have

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
knowledge i woulda guessed it would have

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.940 
knowledge i woulda guessed it would have
seized<00:02:48.190> up<00:02:48.370> by<00:02:48.520> then<00:02:48.700> but<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.690> was<00:02:49.870> okay<00:02:50.170> i<00:02:50.200> just

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
seized up by then but it was okay i just

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.830 
seized up by then but it was okay i just
decided<00:02:51.490> that<00:02:51.670> all<00:02:52.330> right<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.690> know<00:02:52.720> what

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
decided that all right you know what

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.490 
decided that all right you know what
I've<00:02:53.140> made<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.410> boo-boo<00:02:53.970> probably<00:02:54.970> best<00:02:55.120> if<00:02:55.300> I

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
I've made a boo-boo probably best if I

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.800 
I've made a boo-boo probably best if I
rectify<00:02:56.500> this<00:02:56.560> issue<00:02:56.860> sharpish<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:58.480> I<00:03:00.810> undid

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
rectify this issue sharpish so I undid

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.960 
rectify this issue sharpish so I undid
the<00:03:01.930> bottle<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.230> oil<00:03:02.320> after<00:03:03.280> giving<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.760> year

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
the bottle of oil after giving it a year

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.860 
the bottle of oil after giving it a year
ago<00:03:04.210> shake<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:06.120> then<00:03:07.120> realize<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.570> had<00:03:07.720> no

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
ago shake and then realize that had no

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.270 
ago shake and then realize that had no
funnel<00:03:08.170> because<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.620> course<00:03:08.860> there's<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.130> very

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
funnel because of course there's a very

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.820 
funnel because of course there's a very
tiny<00:03:09.640> hole<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.210> fill<00:03:10.360> up<00:03:10.480> from<00:03:12.300> most<00:03:13.300> bike<00:03:13.570> so<00:03:13.990> I

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
tiny hole to fill up from most bike so I

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.920 
tiny hole to fill up from most bike so I
didn't<00:03:15.610> have<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.790> funnel<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.240> no<00:03:16.420> i<00:03:16.450> didn't<00:03:16.840> use

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
didn't have a funnel and no i didn't use

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.480 
didn't have a funnel and no i didn't use
common<00:03:17.290> sense<00:03:17.320> before<00:03:17.650> anyone<00:03:18.010> mentions<00:03:18.400> i

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
common sense before anyone mentions i

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.490 
common sense before anyone mentions i
could<00:03:18.700> have<00:03:18.790> used<00:03:18.940> up<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.240> cloned<00:03:19.540> rolled<00:03:20.320> up

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
could have used up a cloned rolled up

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.890 
could have used up a cloned rolled up
piece<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.920> a4<00:03:21.360> but<00:03:22.360> i<00:03:22.390> don't<00:03:22.600> think<00:03:22.630> those

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
piece of a4 but i don't think those

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.250 
piece of a4 but i don't think those
kinds<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.290> things<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:24.510> yeah<00:03:25.510> i<00:03:25.540> proceeded<00:03:26.050> to

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
kinds of things and yeah i proceeded to

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.020 
kinds of things and yeah i proceeded to
try<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.710> pour<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.100> through<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.400> tiny<00:03:27.610> nozzle

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
try and pour it through the tiny nozzle

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.120 
try and pour it through the tiny nozzle
from<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.330> big<00:03:28.510> nozzle<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.740> inevitable

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
from a big nozzle the inevitable

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.800 
from a big nozzle the inevitable
happened<00:03:30.610> it<00:03:30.880> went<00:03:31.030> all<00:03:31.240> down<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.570> side<00:03:31.600> of

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
happened it went all down the side of

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.290 
happened it went all down the side of
the<00:03:31.990> bike<00:03:32.290> onto<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:33.250> bit<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.820> exhaust<00:03:34.180> pipe

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
the bike onto a bit of the exhaust pipe

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.260 
the bike onto a bit of the exhaust pipe
all<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.020> concrete<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:36.940> thought<00:03:37.120> well

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
all of the concrete and I thought well

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.420 
all of the concrete and I thought well
hey<00:03:37.540> I've<00:03:37.750> chucked<00:03:38.200> I've<00:03:38.530> literally<00:03:38.980> chucked

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
hey I've chucked I've literally chucked

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.850 
hey I've chucked I've literally chucked
quite<00:03:39.730> lot<00:03:39.940> of<00:03:40.030> oil<00:03:40.240> at<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:40.540> bike<00:03:40.750> now<00:03:40.990> so

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
quite lot of oil at this bike now so

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.410 
quite lot of oil at this bike now so
let's<00:03:42.190> let's<00:03:42.490> have<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.730> look<00:03:42.940> look<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.240> dip

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
let's let's have a look look to dip

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.080 
let's let's have a look look to dip
stick<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:43.780> only<00:03:43.989> just<00:03:44.260> breached<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.820> load

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
stick and I only just breached the load

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.990 
stick and I only just breached the load
the<00:03:46.420> low<00:03:46.570> marks<00:03:46.959> so<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.440> thought<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.100> gonna<00:03:48.880> have

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
the low marks so I thought I gonna have

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.580 
the low marks so I thought I gonna have
to<00:03:49.060> do<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.239> again<00:03:49.390> add<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.840> bit<00:03:49.989> more<00:03:50.020> oil<00:03:50.200> in

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
to do it again add a bit more oil in

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.800 
to do it again add a bit more oil in
here<00:03:50.800> we<00:03:50.950> go<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:51.970> I<00:03:52.030> kind<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.239> held<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.570> little

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
here we go so I kind of held it a little

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.600 
here we go so I kind of held it a little
bit<00:03:52.989> higher<00:03:53.140> this<00:03:53.350> time<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.920> got<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.190> stream

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
bit higher this time and got a stream

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.070 
bit higher this time and got a stream
still<00:03:55.239> ended<00:03:55.480> up<00:03:55.510> forgetting<00:03:55.630> some<00:03:55.959> on<00:03:56.020> the

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
still ended up forgetting some on the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.960 
still ended up forgetting some on the
floor<00:03:56.140> but<00:03:56.410> once<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.709> kind<00:03:57.070> of<00:03:57.160> wave<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.700> stream

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
floor but once I kind of wave the stream

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.130 
floor but once I kind of wave the stream
needs<00:03:58.270> weren't<00:03:58.510> needed<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.870> go<00:03:58.989> it<00:03:59.110> was

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
needs weren't needed to go it was

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.120 
needs weren't needed to go it was
absolutely<00:03:59.560> fine<00:03:59.709> i<00:03:59.800> managed<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.040> get

absolutely fine i managed to get

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.920 
absolutely fine i managed to get
something<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.520> then<00:04:01.300> checked<00:04:01.600> it<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:01.810> it

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
something that then checked it and it

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.330 
something that then checked it and it
was<00:04:02.050> it<00:04:02.530> was<00:04:02.590> on<00:04:02.770> full

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
was it was on full

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.620 
was it was on full
so<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:05.370> don't<00:04:05.640> think<00:04:05.820> there's<00:04:05.940> any<00:04:06.060> lasting

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
so I don't think there's any lasting

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.600 
so I don't think there's any lasting
effects<00:04:06.990> so<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.530> bike<00:04:07.680> seems<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.100> definitely

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
effects so the bike seems to definitely

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.080 
effects so the bike seems to definitely
sound<00:04:08.940> exactly<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.540> same<00:04:09.630> as<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:09.930> did<00:04:10.140> before

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
sound exactly the same as it did before

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.760 
sound exactly the same as it did before
so<00:04:12.090> there's<00:04:12.330> not<00:04:12.420> any<00:04:12.570> rattles<00:04:13.140> or<00:04:13.380> anything

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
so there's not any rattles or anything

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.250 
so there's not any rattles or anything
Rindy<00:04:14.490> you<00:04:14.760> know<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:15.330> what<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.690> would<00:04:15.930> seem<00:04:16.140> to

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
Rindy you know that what I would seem to

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.979 
Rindy you know that what I would seem to
be<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.350> typical<00:04:16.830> signs<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:18.000> few<00:04:18.840> issues

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
be the typical signs of a few issues

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.930 
be the typical signs of a few issues
with<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.440> biker<00:04:19.860> so<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.280> seems<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.580> be<00:04:20.670> okay

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
with the biker so that seems to be okay

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.100 
with the biker so that seems to be okay
I'm<00:04:21.390> so<00:04:21.660> hopefully<00:04:23.420> I've<00:04:24.420> got<00:04:24.480> away<00:04:24.840> with<00:04:25.020> it

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
I'm so hopefully I've got away with it

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.460 
I'm so hopefully I've got away with it
but<00:04:26.100> we<00:04:26.220> will<00:04:26.370> see<00:04:26.580> we<00:04:27.000> will<00:04:27.030> see<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:27.960> in<00:04:28.230> light

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
but we will see we will see and in light

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.830 
but we will see we will see and in light
of<00:04:28.500> this<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:29.220> figured<00:04:29.580> that<00:04:29.790> with<00:04:30.780> the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
of this I figured that with the

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.330 
of this I figured that with the
potential<00:04:31.170> one<00:04:33.560> morning<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.830> death<00:04:35.040> of<00:04:35.160> my

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
potential one morning of the death of my

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.810 
potential one morning of the death of my
bike<00:04:35.700> had<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:37.050> got<00:04:37.290> that<00:04:37.440> far<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:38.040> I<00:04:38.460> have<00:04:38.790> a

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
bike had it got that far and I have a

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.210 
bike had it got that far and I have a
name<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.360> my<00:04:39.510> bike<00:04:39.720> he<00:04:40.080> seems<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.860> lot<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.070> bikers

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
name to my bike he seems a lot of bikers

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.990 
name to my bike he seems a lot of bikers
give<00:04:41.580> their<00:04:41.790> bikes<00:04:42.450> a<00:04:42.600> female's<00:04:43.020> name<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:44.000> again
