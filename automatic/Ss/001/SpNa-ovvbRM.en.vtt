and<00:04:00.829> loop<00:04:01.099> back<00:04:01.310> around<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:01.849> know<00:04:01.970> that's

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
and loop back around you know that's

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.270 
and loop back around you know that's
that's<00:04:02.359> how<00:04:02.540> I<00:04:02.569> felt<00:04:03.019> about<00:04:03.169> it<00:04:03.290> I'm<00:04:03.500> sure<00:04:03.739> some

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
that's how I felt about it I'm sure some

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.500 
that's how I felt about it I'm sure some
of<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.459> guys<00:04:04.489> disagree<00:04:05.060> about<00:04:05.150> that<00:04:05.389> and

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
of you guys disagree about that and

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.420 
of you guys disagree about that and
that's<00:04:05.630> cool<00:04:05.900> but<00:04:06.049> in<00:04:06.530> my<00:04:06.650> opinion<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.250> just

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
that's cool but in my opinion it just

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.099 
that's cool but in my opinion it just
didn't<00:04:07.669> really<00:04:07.880> seem<00:04:08.060> like<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:08.329> connected<00:04:08.930> a

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
didn't really seem like it connected a

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.530 
didn't really seem like it connected a
lot<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.190> main<00:04:10.340> story<00:04:10.639> now<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.090> think<00:04:11.419> they

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
lot to the main story now I think they

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.210 
lot to the main story now I think they
also<00:04:11.720> kind<00:04:12.019> of<00:04:12.169> abused<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.739> way<00:04:12.859> that<00:04:13.099> they

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
also kind of abused the way that they

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.800 
also kind of abused the way that they
use<00:04:13.370> what<00:04:13.609> buddy<00:04:13.819> as<00:04:14.090> well<00:04:14.329> in<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.660> series

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
behind it but it was kind of I don't

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.050 
behind it but it was kind of I don't
know<00:04:47.169> like<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.500> way<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.889> they<00:04:48.099> kind<00:04:48.340> of<00:04:48.520> used

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
know like the way that they kind of used

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.839 
know like the way that they kind of used
what<00:04:49.389> they<00:04:49.509> need<00:04:49.689> to<00:04:49.900> create<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:50.919> plot<00:04:51.280> was<00:04:51.580> a

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
what they need to create a plot was a

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.749 
what they need to create a plot was a
little<00:04:52.330> bit<00:04:52.419> it<00:04:52.900> was<00:04:53.229> a<00:04:53.289> little<00:04:53.530> bit<00:04:53.650> like<00:04:53.919> it

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
little bit it was a little bit like it

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.300 
little bit it was a little bit like it
was<00:04:54.939> a<00:04:54.969> little<00:04:55.300> bit<00:04:55.449> unstable<00:04:56.409> in<00:04:56.800> my<00:04:56.979> opinion

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
was a little bit unstable in my opinion

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.279 
was a little bit unstable in my opinion
but<00:04:57.520> I<00:04:57.550> do<00:04:57.639> admire<00:04:57.969> the<00:04:58.330> fact<00:04:58.539> that<00:04:58.690> they<00:04:58.930> kind

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
but I do admire the fact that they kind

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.589 
but I do admire the fact that they kind
of<00:04:59.469> you<00:04:59.710> know<00:04:59.830> brought<00:05:00.159> it<00:05:00.639> back<00:05:01.000> right<00:05:01.419> back

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
of you know brought it back right back

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:02.879 
of you know brought it back right back
to<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.870> beginning<00:05:02.289> and<00:05:02.379> you<00:05:02.469> know<00:05:02.680> actually

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
to the beginning and you know actually

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.939 
to the beginning and you know actually
gave<00:05:03.460> reason<00:05:04.090> as<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.330> why<00:05:04.629> what<00:05:05.349> that<00:05:05.530> he<00:05:05.620> was

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
gave reason as to why what that he was

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.129 
gave reason as to why what that he was
you<00:05:06.490> know<00:05:06.520> essential<00:05:07.389> to<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:07.629> plot<00:05:07.840> in<00:05:08.020> the

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
you know essential to the plot in the

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.749 
you know essential to the plot in the
first<00:05:08.349> place<00:05:08.620> but<00:05:08.889> throughout<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.520> entire

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
first place but throughout the entire

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.779 
first place but throughout the entire
series<00:05:10.000> like<00:05:10.330> you<00:05:10.949> kind<00:05:11.949> of<00:05:12.009> really<00:05:12.310> don't<00:05:12.580> see

really good but I do believe there were
some<00:05:58.210> floor<00:05:58.419> points<00:05:58.750> like<00:05:58.930> I<00:05:59.050> just<00:05:59.110> mentioned

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
some floor points like I just mentioned

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:00.839 
some floor points like I just mentioned
before<00:05:59.800> that<00:06:00.279> they<00:06:00.400> could<00:06:00.550> have<00:06:00.639> really

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
before that they could have really

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.519 
before that they could have really
worked<00:06:01.029> on<00:06:01.210> and<00:06:01.449> if<00:06:01.659> they<00:06:01.839> had<00:06:02.050> kind<00:06:02.349> of<00:06:02.409> maybe

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:02.529 
worked on and if they had kind of maybe

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.469 
worked on and if they had kind of maybe
like<00:06:02.800> you<00:06:03.460> know<00:06:03.490> tighten<00:06:03.969> that<00:06:04.060> up<00:06:04.120> a<00:06:04.330> little

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
like you know tighten that up a little

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:05.519 
like you know tighten that up a little
bit<00:06:04.599> especially<00:06:04.779> with<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.110> secondary

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
bit especially with the secondary

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:07.079 
bit especially with the secondary
characters<00:06:05.919> then<00:06:06.129> this<00:06:06.639> series<00:06:06.940> would<00:06:07.029> have

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
characters then this series would have

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:09.779 
characters then this series would have
been<00:06:07.300> really<00:06:08.199> close<00:06:08.409> to<00:06:08.770> a<00:06:08.949> 9<00:06:09.219> out<00:06:09.430> of<00:06:09.460> 10<00:06:09.699> or
