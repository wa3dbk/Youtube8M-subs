supposed<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.650> go<00:04:58.830> down<00:04:58.860> here<00:04:59.280> but<00:04:59.699> in<00:05:00.000> other

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
supposed to go down here but in other

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.710 
supposed to go down here but in other
pictures<00:05:00.720> it's<00:05:01.139> been<00:05:01.710> up<00:05:01.919> here<00:05:02.190> at<00:05:03.060> their<00:05:03.300> son
