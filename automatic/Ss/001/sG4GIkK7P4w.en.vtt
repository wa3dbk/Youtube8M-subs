edition of growing wisdom and winter can

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.350 
edition of growing wisdom and winter can
be<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.410> problem<00:00:13.769> for<00:00:14.130> houseplants<00:00:14.820> because<00:00:15.150> in

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
be a problem for houseplants because in

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.990 
be a problem for houseplants because in
the<00:00:15.480> winter<00:00:15.900> your<00:00:16.560> home<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.010> dry<00:00:17.400> you're

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
the winter your home is dry you're

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.769 
the winter your home is dry you're
inside<00:00:18.859> plants<00:00:19.859> tend<00:00:20.160> not<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.400> thrive<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.480> so

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
inside plants tend not to thrive and so

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.660 
inside plants tend not to thrive and so
they<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:22.050> susceptible<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.859> disease<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
they are susceptible to disease and

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.310 
they are susceptible to disease and
insects<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> things<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.230> can

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
insects and one of the things that can

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.470 
insects and one of the things that can
happen<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.920> they<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.400> get<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> certain<00:00:27.029> insect

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
happen is they can get a certain insect

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.509 
happen is they can get a certain insect
and<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.080> can<00:00:28.320> lead<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.769> secondary

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
and that can lead to a secondary

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.730 
and that can lead to a secondary
infection<00:00:30.019> today<00:00:31.019> we're<00:00:31.349> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.529> talk

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
infection today we're going to talk

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.530 
infection today we're going to talk
about<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.980> secondary<00:00:32.520> infection<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:33.210> happens

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
about a secondary infection that happens

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.549 
about a secondary infection that happens
on<00:00:33.660> plants<00:00:34.079> called<00:00:34.469> black<00:00:34.890> sooty<00:00:35.700> mold<00:00:36.559> okay

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
on plants called black sooty mold okay

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.709 
on plants called black sooty mold okay
so<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> shift<00:00:38.489> lehre<00:00:38.820> plant<00:00:39.270> here<00:00:39.540> it's

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so this is a shift lehre plant here it's

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.260 
so this is a shift lehre plant here it's
a<00:00:39.780> beautiful<00:00:40.020> shift<00:00:40.590> lehre<00:00:40.940> variegated<00:00:41.940> leaf

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
a beautiful shift lehre variegated leaf

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.389 
a beautiful shift lehre variegated leaf
so<00:00:42.570> rather<00:00:43.110> unusual<00:00:43.800> some<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.190> shift

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
so rather unusual some of the shift

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.670 
so rather unusual some of the shift
Larra<00:00:44.640> tend<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.120> all<00:00:45.329> green<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.440> has

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
Larra tend to be all green this one has

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.459 
Larra tend to be all green this one has
the<00:00:47.250> almost<00:00:47.760> white<00:00:48.059> against<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> green<00:00:49.020> but

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the almost white against the green but

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.529 
the almost white against the green but
if<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.590> look<00:00:49.860> closely<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.360> that

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
if you look closely you can see that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.810 
if you look closely you can see that
there's<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.930> black<00:00:52.260> stuff<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.399> leaves

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
there's this black stuff on the leaves

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.720 
there's this black stuff on the leaves
that's<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.510> black<00:00:54.719> sooty<00:00:55.140> mold<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:56.219> happens

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that's the black sooty mold what happens

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.750 
that's the black sooty mold what happens
is<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.539> plant<00:00:57.870> had<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.260> fits<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.309> aphids

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
is that this plant had a fits so aphids

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.189 
is that this plant had a fits so aphids
are<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> tiny<00:01:00.210> little<00:01:00.480> green<00:01:00.690> sucking

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
are the tiny little green sucking

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.200 
are the tiny little green sucking
insects<00:01:01.649> they<00:01:02.219> release<00:01:02.670> what's<00:01:02.940> called

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
insects they release what's called

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.750 
insects they release what's called
honeydew<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.260> nice<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.280> sticky

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
honeydew and that's nice and it's sticky

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.630 
honeydew and that's nice and it's sticky
and<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.150> sweet<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.750> what<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:08.070> will<00:01:08.250> happen

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and it's sweet and what then will happen

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.399 
and it's sweet and what then will happen
is<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.240> black<00:01:09.479> sooty<00:01:09.810> mold<00:01:10.049> will

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
is that the black sooty mold will

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.880 
is that the black sooty mold will
colonize<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.180> sticky<00:01:12.600> honeydew<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.619> it's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
colonize on the sticky honeydew so it's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.249 
colonize on the sticky honeydew so it's
a<00:01:14.010> secondary<00:01:14.610> infection<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.840> may<00:01:16.020> say

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
a secondary infection and you may say

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.800 
a secondary infection and you may say
well<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:17.009> problem<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
well is that a problem and it can be a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.899 
well is that a problem and it can be a
problem<00:01:19.110> especially<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> spreads<00:01:20.520> over

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
problem especially if it spreads over

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.460 
problem especially if it spreads over
the<00:01:21.150> leaves<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> stop

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the leaves because it's going to stop

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.660 
the leaves because it's going to stop
the<00:01:22.500> leaves<00:01:22.830> from<00:01:22.979> doing<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.490> need<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the leaves from doing what they need to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.460 
the leaves from doing what they need to
do<00:01:23.880> which<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.090> bring<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.540> light<00:01:24.780> bring<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.140> co2

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
do which is bring in light bring in co2

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.399 
do which is bring in light bring in co2
and<00:01:25.979> take<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.640> nutrients<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.170> leaves

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and take in nutrients so if the leaves

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.999 
and take in nutrients so if the leaves
become<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.100> black<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:30.119> way<00:01:30.360> down<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:31.200> down

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
become all black like way down here down

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.560 
become all black like way down here down
here<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.670> how<00:01:32.790> black<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.360> leaves

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
here you can see how black the leaves

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.469 
here you can see how black the leaves
are<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.650> problem<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.759> stop<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
are that's a problem if you stop the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.510 
are that's a problem if you stop the
primary<00:01:36.990> infection<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> aphids

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
primary infection which is the aphids

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.580 
primary infection which is the aphids
eventually<00:01:39.420> you'll<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.049> rid<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> black

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
eventually you'll get rid of the black

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
eventually you'll get rid of the black
sooty<00:01:40.890> mold<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:41.520> how<00:01:41.729> do<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> do<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.329> well

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
sooty mold now how do you do that well

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.170 
sooty mold now how do you do that well
you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.439> wash<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.860> plant<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.280> soapy<00:01:45.149> water

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you can wash the plant with soapy water

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.660 
you can wash the plant with soapy water
I'll<00:01:45.840> use<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.470> tablespoon<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.460> dish<00:01:47.640> soap

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
I'll use like a tablespoon of dish soap

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.429 
I'll use like a tablespoon of dish soap
to<00:01:47.939> about<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> gallon<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.840> water<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.290> really

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
to about a gallon of water and really

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.889 
to about a gallon of water and really
wash<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.399> good<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.820> if<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.600> enough

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
wash this good and if you do that enough

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.200 
wash this good and if you do that enough
eventually<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.649> will<00:01:53.009> work<00:01:53.250> off<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.000> other

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
eventually it will work off the other
