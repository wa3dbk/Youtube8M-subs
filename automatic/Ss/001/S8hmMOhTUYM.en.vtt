bit now I guess there when the when the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.660 
bit now I guess there when the when the
Dani<00:01:01.440> California<00:01:01.680> song<00:01:02.220> by<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.400> Chili

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
Dani California song by the Chili

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.970 
Dani California song by the Chili
Peppers<00:01:02.730> came<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.600> they<00:01:04.170> said<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.530> sounded<00:01:04.800> so

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
Peppers came out they said it sounded so

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.890 
Peppers came out they said it sounded so
much<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.160> this<00:01:05.460> tune<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.000> granted<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:06.840> do

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
much like this tune and granted they do

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.510 
much like this tune and granted they do
sound<00:01:07.200> very<00:01:07.560> much<00:01:07.710> alike<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.070> guess<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.370> one

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
sound very much alike I guess the one

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.570 
sound very much alike I guess the one
difference<00:01:08.910> is<00:01:09.710> Tom<00:01:10.710> Petty<00:01:10.980> tune<00:01:11.190> it's<00:01:11.370> a<00:01:11.430> D

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
difference is Tom Petty tune it's a D

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.670 
difference is Tom Petty tune it's a D
major<00:01:11.790> chord<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.479> Dani<00:01:12.810> California<00:01:13.050> it's<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.530> D

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
major chord and Dani California it's a D

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.760 
major chord and Dani California it's a D
minor<00:01:13.920> chord<00:01:14.780> but<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.410> mean<00:01:16.710> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
minor chord but really you know I mean I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.930 
minor chord but really you know I mean I
think<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.160> coincidental<00:01:17.760> there's

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
think it's just coincidental there's

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.370 
think it's just coincidental there's
only<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.330> many<00:01:18.450> chords<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.050> sound<00:01:19.229> good

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
only so many chords that sound good

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.930 
only so many chords that sound good
together<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.800> you<00:01:20.190> know<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.820> is

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
together and you know I think this is

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.940 
together and you know I think this is
just<00:01:20.970> one<00:01:21.300> of<00:01:21.450> them<00:01:21.570> okay<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.500> here's<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:22.860> we

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
just one of them okay so here's what we

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.719 
just one of them okay so here's what we
do<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.250> go<00:01:26.330> I'm<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.540> minor

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
do we go I'm a minor

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:37.060 
do we go I'm a minor
so<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.590> it's<00:01:31.590> kind<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.979> bump<00:01:32.430> down

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:55.109 

listen<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.160> that<00:01:38.250> again

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.639 

okay<00:01:55.750> now<00:01:55.960> when<00:01:56.109> I<00:01:56.200> go<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.560> D<00:01:56.799> chord<00:01:58.649> I'm

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
okay now when I go to the D chord I'm

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.139 
okay now when I go to the D chord I'm
going<00:01:59.890> to<00:01:59.950> this<00:02:00.250> can<00:02:00.520> be<00:02:00.609> tricky<00:02:00.759> you<00:02:01.000> just

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
going to this can be tricky you just

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.359 
going to this can be tricky you just
play<00:02:01.270> straight<00:02:01.329> D<00:02:01.750> chord<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.280> the

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
play straight D chord and this is the

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.859 
play straight D chord and this is the
same<00:02:03.549> rather<00:02:03.789> it's<00:02:03.969> the<00:02:04.000> same<00:02:04.210> rhythm<00:02:04.420> but

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
same rather it's the same rhythm but

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.319 
same rather it's the same rhythm but
what<00:02:05.350> he<00:02:05.500> does<00:02:05.679> is<00:02:05.829> he<00:02:05.859> plays<00:02:06.189> a<00:02:06.219> DD<00:02:07.119> major

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
what he does is he plays a DD major

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.630 
what he does is he plays a DD major
chord<00:02:07.659> with<00:02:08.379> no<00:02:08.560> middle<00:02:08.860> finger<00:02:09.160> on<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:09.519> the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
chord with no middle finger on so the

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.630 
chord with no middle finger on so the
high<00:02:09.789> E<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.869> open<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.500> he<00:02:11.590> hammers<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.099> on<00:02:12.340> so

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
high E is open and he hammers it on so

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.880 
high E is open and he hammers it on so
that's<00:02:12.849> kind<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.120> one<00:02:13.269> of<00:02:13.390> his<00:02:13.569> little<00:02:13.810> spices

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:32.900 

your<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:29.549> did<00:02:30.549> it

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:41.820 

here<00:02:33.910> we<00:02:34.000> go

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.160 

okay<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.490> ends<00:02:42.760> on<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.000> minor<00:02:43.360> but<00:02:44.050> it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
okay it ends on that a minor but it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.020 
okay it ends on that a minor but it
starts<00:02:44.470> over<00:02:44.710> again<00:02:45.040> on<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.340> minor<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:45.940> think

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
starts over again on a minor so I think

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.630 
starts over again on a minor so I think
what<00:02:46.330> he<00:02:46.480> did<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.780> break<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.260> up<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:48.580> it

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
what he did to break that up so it

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.700 
what he did to break that up so it
didn't<00:02:48.880> sound<00:02:48.970> exactly<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.510> same<00:02:49.570> as<00:02:49.960> he<00:02:50.500> adds

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
didn't sound exactly the same as he adds

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.130 
didn't sound exactly the same as he adds
his<00:02:50.890> pinkie<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.240> third<00:02:52.450> fret<00:02:52.750> there<00:02:52.990> and

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
his pinkie to the third fret there and

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.320 
his pinkie to the third fret there and
that<00:02:53.260> would<00:02:53.380> just<00:02:53.410> be<00:02:53.680> called<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:54.070> minor<00:02:54.310> seven

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.430 

but<00:02:58.330> it's<00:02:58.450> kind<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.660> cool<00:02:58.840> because<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.170> stays

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
but it's kind of cool because it stays
