it<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> counter<00:00:17.609> trap<00:00:17.789> which<00:00:17.970> definitely

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
it is a counter trap which definitely

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.670 
it is a counter trap which definitely
makes<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.539> nice<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:19.050> let's<00:00:19.439> go<00:00:19.529> ahead<00:00:19.560> and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
makes it nice but let's go ahead and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.870 
makes it nice but let's go ahead and
check<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.920> out<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.340> not<00:00:20.460> just<00:00:20.609> from<00:00:20.760> one

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880

card<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> field<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.239> also<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.329> you're

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
card on the field and also if you're

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.760

playing<00:00:39.540> anything<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:39.960> macro<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.469> probably

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
playing anything with macro you probably

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.170 
playing anything with macro you probably
won't<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.160> any<00:00:41.309> monsters<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.059> graveyard

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.090 
won't have any monsters in the graveyard
hopefully<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.200> draw<00:00:43.440> back<00:00:43.649> row<00:00:43.800> early

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
hopefully if you draw back row early

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.590 
hopefully if you draw back row early
enough<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.520> will<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> worry<00:00:45.210> about<00:00:45.300> that

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
enough you will have to worry about that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.540 
enough you will have to worry about that
