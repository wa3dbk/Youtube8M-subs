00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.100
 welcome to the channel and welcome a 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.080
 pokemon video pseudo boy serious 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.550
 we are in a fight against kevin hello 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.900
 and a subscriber exposed on twitter I go 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.730
 to throw with mate random against you 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.380
 and well you have come a few 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.969
 you really have come as 30 40 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.100
 people like that so nothing about xavi 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.529
 I imagine that a combat like this is a 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.330
 little do not look physical in studies 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.310
 I want to explain something that really is 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.779
 something a little strange to explain 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.730
 above all I say because normally this 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.019
 is something that is usually done already bayern is 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.080
 say day 1 but good guys me 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.640
 would like to tell you about the purposes for 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.620
 2015 that I have for the year for this year 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 that is about to come and apart from 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.559
 that also guys I would like to comment 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.840
 a couple of things but only at the beginning 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.370
 of the video and it's good to tell you guys 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.340
 mainly that as you know today 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.200
 I imagine that one of 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.110
 olympic craft of minecraft the one that had 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.910
 out there prepared because it's that good at 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.170
 definitively guys like they said I 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.699
 but they go to my mother and good at the end 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.530
 everything went well and such but I did not have 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.059
 I would hardly have touched if such and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.500
 those guys I have to prepare it there 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.239
 outs and things for all the series that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.289
 I'm going to do during 2015 because 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.640
 you really have to leave everything and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.000
 prepared to then have no 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.790
 problem or nothing 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.900
 so 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.000
 excuse me in that aspect it 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.650
 we started in earnest so simply 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.850
 I hope you like what I'm going to bring 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.310
 but good guys anyway 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.610
 tell you that nothing will start in 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.870
 first place with the goals that I have 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.670
 we could decide personal is not to say 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.440
 I have both goals at youtube level 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.690
 as objectives with personal objectives 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.460
 well the first objective that I have is 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.280
 learning another language is currently not valid 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.200
 It's only Spanish and English and a little but 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.390
 but not much but good Galician good 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.190
 that after all Galician is only 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.750
 there will be in Galicia so in the end the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.430
 true people understand understand others 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.259
 languages ​​for example the Italian I understand 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.030
 I understand the Portuguese but what is 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.710
 I do not know how to speak but we are talking languages 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.630
 that no such then guys I want a 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.150
 heap learning another language and that language 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.920
 is between Japanese and German I do not know which one 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.810
 that's called like and learn in 2015 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.670
 but in German Japanese the truth is 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.140
 German because it's supposed that nowadays 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.729
 It is very important to find a job 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.950
 and in a future really just like this 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.780
 Spanish then for the people of Latin America 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.220
 that does not know it the truth that very many 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.960
 of the Spaniards are having to go to 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.790
 work to germany and because here there is no 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.140
 work is good and well then there is 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.820
 enough work is pretty industrial 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.180
 and to the German I think it's a language up 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.040
 time 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.420
 and on the other hand guys I would love 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.430
 learn Japanese because good at the end and 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.989
 in the end I love practically everything 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.489
 Japanese or everything all everything all 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.170
 everything I love done I would love it 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.549
 travel japan what happens that is a bit 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.260
 expensive but good is something that we say that 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:29.510
 does not rule out doing valley maybe in some 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.510
 Japanese travel moment but good guys 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.280
 shit 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.300
 come others themselves are ropes that 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.070
 as they charge it physical I would love 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.200
 to learn Japanese or German I do not know what 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.330
 language learn because when you Spanish 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.280
 and English so I would like to learn 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.680
 more languages, I'd also like to 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.290
 let say 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.540
 and find the point of being happy with 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.159
 everything I do is worth forgetting 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.170
 of problems and practically everything 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.909
 that makes me happy and never give up what 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.530
 what I do many times I have good ideas 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.480
 I have good purposes but as 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.579
 you can watch on the channel with all 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.310
 the series that I started and do not end up say 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.000
 I know I never will because as you 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.400
 I dont exist 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.680
 I do not know how I get bored and I do not finish it 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.780
 like he changed his mind or seemed and 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.819
 neither determined then guys is a 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.709
 of the little things that I would love 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.480
 but by all means get 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.859
 these thousand quintals be happy and be a 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.629
 I like everything I do and never 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.310
 you never change your mind and I do not know 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.989
 guys, we're going to leave that for a 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.159
 side first of all not this in the first 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.780
 place and secondly guys 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.970
 would like to talk as soon as something arrived 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.069
 to the channel in terms of good my goals 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.629
 within youtube and in terms of goal 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.639
 well I want to put of mind to get to 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.260
 100,000 subscribers in this 2015 vale 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.579
 so it's kind of complicated 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.530
 done because we have a year and a half and 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.019
 we took 50 thousands they would do the other 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.150
 year and a half to get the 100,000 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.680
 subscribers but despite knowing that 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.049
 it's complicated I think it's not impossible and 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.479
 I think it's good with him, let's say with the 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.810
 I'm going to load then really what 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.849
 I see 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.069
 it is possible in fact so yes that is 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.660
 true that I could or do not know I think that 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.400
 could the truth for you to stay 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.870
 cuadril to associate it because you have to 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.470
 make a herb the faculty and next do not 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.300
 because he values ​​that in addition the good host 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.980
 that I have an advantage for four despite 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.319
 have tap but good is worth killing me 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.340
 putada were ends then we will throw another 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.050
 combat if they kill each other so they do not 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.299
 Worry that I have a bad streak 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.450
 or medium return will make me x 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.510
 let's make a dragon claw is already 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.860
 it's worth barbarian that perfect and good 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.180
 those kids logically being born their 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.190
 criteria 7 of the things that I would like 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.210
 propose it is worth to me to finish absolutely 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.710
 everything that starts everything that starts 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.270
 on youtube the whole series any 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.650
 little thing that starts guys finishing it is 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.110
 say that is why not because no 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.180
 finishing it really is something that should 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.000
 do it because fuck if you stop to 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.710
 to think about it is like surreal not to start 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.240
 something will have a first series finish it 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.910
 but let me say that it starts with 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.570
 I'm really looking forward and then I'm missing 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.639
 that same 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.250
 want to continue the let's say not 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.870
 support whatever it is and I say is that if not the 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.639
 he just said that the ruler cares 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.840
 but really guys, things are not 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.370
 so I see that there are many amounts 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.230
 really in this 2015 one of the things 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.810
 what I like 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.280
 to do in this youtube is to finish and 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.680
 really all few purposes for 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.730
 this 2015 but good me with that and have 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.110
 health really that would be more 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.090
 conflictive not also guys of you 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.680
 2015 to improve a lot in terms of 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.690
 academic because yes it is true that a 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.590
 Although they do not say I 'm pretty 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.990
 intelligent or that I do not completely 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.520
 I believe we will leave that as is 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.290
 little for the trip that nothing with 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.060
 although I do not believe it at all yes 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.180
 pretty bad students is who I have 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.680
 the level of concentration under night 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.360
 shows in order for you to understand me 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.740
 I have very very bad concentration level 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.910
 was to study I'm just watching with 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.770
 anything and it is impossible for me 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.960
 study really that is guys I os 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.850
 I will say one thing and they are not recommended 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.890
 there but right now I'm repeating 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.290
 first of bachelor by this same and is 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.640
 that guys in my life in we go in all 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.110
 all the time I was in the one that 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.000
 I was at school in my life 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.680
 studied has been continued testing has been 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.300
 so I did not make a chop 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.040
 ie nothing has been testing has 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.450
 been for what has ended me so I 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.180
 I remembered when what they have 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.830
 explained in class or by mere logic 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.330
 example in history basically by 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.000
 logic and things of these but good 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.710
 guys anyway I want to put 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.840
 a little better a day in terms of 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.920
 academic take those classes much more 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.410
 because I really believe that 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.030
 it is important to learn a language more and 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.920
 good guys get to the second me its 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.720
 interest and basically be happy with everything 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.370
 what you do but with everything that 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.950
 basically propose those would be my 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.240
 objectives for 2015 that I think are 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.920
 more than good you can put our 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.350
 goals our goals for 2015
