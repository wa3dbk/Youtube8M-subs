do it this way without having all of
these<00:01:20.009> loaded<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.610> click<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.790> the

little checkbox that will check a box

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.170

there<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.590> load<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> instant<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.909> change

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
there and load it the instant you change

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.770 
there and load it the instant you change
bump<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> change<00:01:24.960> space<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.560> will<00:01:25.799> crash<00:01:26.130> Maya

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
bump to change space it will crash Maya

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.960 
bump to change space it will crash Maya
so<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.350> done<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:29.040> why

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
so now that we have that done with why

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.730 
so now that we have that done with why
would<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> put<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.290> shader<00:01:31.530> into

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
would you want to put this shader into

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.280 
would you want to put this shader into
the<00:01:31.799> m-i-a<00:01:32.040> m-i-a<00:01:32.790> material<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.900> reason<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the m-i-a m-i-a material the reason is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.960 
the m-i-a m-i-a material the reason is
because<00:01:34.380> right<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.310> using<00:01:35.490> specularity

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
because right now is using specularity

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.480 
because right now is using specularity
the<00:01:36.689> specularity<00:01:37.110> quite<00:01:37.680> frankly<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.280> mi

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the specularity quite frankly in the mi

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.270 
the specularity quite frankly in the mi
material<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.329> best<00:01:40.280> technically

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
material is not the best technically

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.460 
material is not the best technically
speaking<00:01:41.549> when<00:01:42.540> you're<00:01:42.659> dealing<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:42.990> real

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
speaking when you're dealing with real

speaking when you're dealing with real
world<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.670> reflection<00:01:45.240> not<00:01:46.079> really

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
world it's all reflection not really

world it's all reflection not really
spec<00:01:46.560> specs<00:01:46.890> almost<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.220> cheat<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.640> kind

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
spec specs almost like a cheat and kind

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.039 
spec specs almost like a cheat and kind
of<00:01:47.880> fake<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.479> don't<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.810> control

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
of fake and you don't really control

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.490 
of fake and you don't really control
everything<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> perfect<00:01:50.189> drop<00:01:50.490> off<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
everything like the perfect drop off and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.539 
everything like the perfect drop off and
everything<00:01:52.500> else<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.430> I'm

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
everything else in there so what I'm

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.270 
everything else in there so what I'm
going<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.880> now<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.409> connect<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.560> mi<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
go to other scroll down go to out value

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.289 
go to other scroll down go to out value
let's<00:03:29.889> go<00:03:30.040> down<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.430> side<00:03:30.639> click<00:03:31.120> on

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
let's go down this side click on

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.280 
let's go down this side click on
additional<00:03:31.750> color<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:34.720> notice<00:03:34.930> this<00:03:35.049> color

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
additional color you notice this color

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.990 
additional color you notice this color
is<00:03:35.349> really<00:03:35.500> bright<00:03:35.889> the<00:03:36.310> reason<00:03:36.579> for<00:03:36.699> that<00:03:36.760> is

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
is really bright the reason for that is

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.640 
is really bright the reason for that is
because<00:03:37.120> it's<00:03:37.389> adding<00:03:37.660> an<00:03:37.750> extra<00:03:38.019> point<00:03:38.230> 5

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
because it's adding an extra point 5

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.300 
because it's adding an extra point 5
value<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:40.299> color<00:03:40.510> in<00:03:40.870> here<00:03:41.319> so<00:03:42.129> what<00:03:42.250> you

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
value to the color in here so what you

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.280 
value to the color in here so what you
want<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.549> do<00:03:42.639> is<00:03:42.760> take<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.540> bring<00:03:44.199> it

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
want to do is take this and bring it

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.319 
want to do is take this and bring it
back<00:03:44.319> to<00:03:44.620> black<00:03:44.769> this<00:03:45.579> will<00:03:45.760> just<00:03:45.879> give<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.209> as

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
back to black this will just give it as

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.000 
back to black this will just give it as
reflection<00:03:46.870> now<00:03:47.109> this<00:03:47.319> material<00:03:47.500> basically

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
reflection now this material basically

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.500 
reflection now this material basically
has<00:03:48.310> all<00:03:48.639> the<00:03:48.910> aspects<00:03:49.389> of<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.690> previous<00:03:51.510> but

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
has all the aspects of the previous but

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.089 
has all the aspects of the previous but
if<00:03:52.569> you<00:03:52.660> do<00:03:52.810> have<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:52.989> neural<00:03:53.199> map<00:03:53.349> like<00:03:53.769> so<00:03:53.980> we

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
if you do have a neural map like so we

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.710 
if you do have a neural map like so we
have<00:03:54.190> an<00:03:54.250> old<00:03:54.370> map<00:03:54.519> plugged<00:03:54.790> into<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.150> fast

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
have an old map plugged into the fast

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.189 
have an old map plugged into the fast
skin

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
skin

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.659 
skin
you<00:03:56.349> also<00:03:56.470> want<00:03:56.739> this<00:03:56.859> to<00:03:57.040> be<00:03:57.159> plugged<00:03:57.519> into

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
you also want this to be plugged into

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.970 
you also want this to be plugged into
the<00:03:58.060> reflect<00:03:58.449> in<00:03:59.169> this<00:03:59.409> material<00:03:59.739> so<00:03:59.859> the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
the reflect in this material so the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.309 
the reflect in this material so the
reflection<00:04:00.310> takes<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.180> bump<00:04:01.359> or<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:02.139> neural

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
reflection takes the bump or the neural

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.520 
reflection takes the bump or the neural
map<00:04:02.440> into<00:04:02.769> account<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:05.109> problem<00:04:05.409> right<00:04:05.470> now

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
map into account the problem right now

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.869 
map into account the problem right now
is<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.829> because<00:04:05.889> the<00:04:06.129> MIAA<00:04:06.370> materials

now<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.729> shader<00:04:46.030> should<00:04:46.240> have<00:04:46.360> everything<00:04:46.870> it

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
now the shader should have everything it

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.629 
now the shader should have everything it
needs<00:04:47.169> connected<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.889> it<00:04:48.039> so<00:04:48.280> I'm<00:04:48.370> gonna<00:04:48.460> put

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639

needs connected to it so I'm gonna put
both<00:04:48.819> of<00:04:48.849> these<00:04:49.740> about<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.860> connection<00:04:51.250> so

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
both of these about the connection so

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.490 
both of these about the connection so
now<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:51.520> have<00:04:51.759> the<00:04:52.090> bump<00:04:52.300> node<00:04:52.539> I<00:04:52.750> need<00:04:53.259> both<00:04:53.470> of
