this<00:00:22.789> year<00:00:23.090> it's<00:00:23.690> 30<00:00:23.990> years<00:00:24.110> ago<00:00:24.560> that<00:00:24.980> BMW

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
this year it's 30 years ago that BMW

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.850 
this year it's 30 years ago that BMW
launched<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:26.000> m1<00:00:26.360> and<00:00:26.570> with<00:00:27.170> this<00:00:27.320> concept<00:00:27.770> we

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
launched the m1 and with this concept we

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.620 
launched the m1 and with this concept we
also<00:00:28.040> want<00:00:28.400> to<00:00:28.460> celebrate<00:00:28.970> that<00:00:29.150> occasion

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
also want to celebrate that occasion

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.350 
also want to celebrate that occasion
this<00:00:30.290> car<00:00:30.529> is<00:00:30.650> not<00:00:30.860> scheduled<00:00:31.700> to<00:00:31.849> go<00:00:32.029> in

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
this car is not scheduled to go in

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.479 
this car is not scheduled to go in
series<00:00:32.720> production<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.890> goal<00:00:34.100> of<00:00:34.309> this

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
series production the goal of this

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.330 
series production the goal of this
concept<00:00:34.940> study<00:00:35.239> is<00:00:35.420> really<00:00:36.160> celebrating<00:00:37.160> our

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
concept study is really celebrating our

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.180 
concept study is really celebrating our
rich<00:00:37.550> heritage<00:00:37.879> and<00:00:38.449> showing<00:00:39.230> also<00:00:39.410> how<00:00:39.800> the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
rich heritage and showing also how the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.299 
rich heritage and showing also how the
BMW<00:00:40.879> design<00:00:40.970> wants<00:00:41.809> to<00:00:41.989> work<00:00:42.949> with<00:00:42.980> that

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
BMW design wants to work with that

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.580 
BMW design wants to work with that
tradition<00:00:43.940> we<00:00:44.809> love<00:00:45.019> it<00:00:45.170> we<00:00:45.320> want<00:00:45.410> to

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
tradition we love it we want to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.770 
tradition we love it we want to
celebrate<00:00:45.830> it<00:00:46.280> but<00:00:46.760> I<00:00:46.879> think<00:00:46.940> in<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.360> concept

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
celebrate it but I think in the concept

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.140 
celebrate it but I think in the concept
study<00:00:48.050> you<00:00:48.199> also<00:00:48.379> see<00:00:48.769> many<00:00:49.460> elements<00:00:49.850> that

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
study you also see many elements that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.840 
study you also see many elements that
are<00:00:50.330> modern<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:51.199> that<00:00:51.230> can<00:00:51.559> take<00:00:51.739> us<00:00:51.949> into<00:00:52.129> the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
are modern and that can take us into the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.590 
are modern and that can take us into the
design<00:00:53.210> future<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:54.159> so<00:00:55.159> this<00:00:55.370> concept<00:00:56.239> serves

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
design future and so this concept serves

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.899 
design future and so this concept serves
also<00:00:56.900> as<00:00:57.049> an<00:00:57.290> inspiration<00:00:57.979> for<00:00:58.010> every<00:00:58.790> other

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
also as an inspiration for every other

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.910 
also as an inspiration for every other
project<00:00:59.479> that<00:00:59.629> we<00:00:59.780> do<00:00:59.930> of<00:01:00.140> course<00:01:00.830> the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
project that we do of course the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.829 
project that we do of course the
proportions<00:01:01.519> are<00:01:01.670> very<00:01:01.699> typical<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.690> m1

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
proportions are very typical to the m1

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.490 
proportions are very typical to the m1
very<00:01:03.530> wide<00:01:03.799> very<00:01:04.190> low<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:05.420> then<00:01:05.659> when<00:01:06.350> you

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
very wide very low and then when you

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.830 
very wide very low and then when you
look<00:01:06.680> at<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:06.920> front<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.340> graphic<00:01:07.880> with<00:01:08.690> this

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
look at the front and graphic with this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.840 
look at the front and graphic with this
very<00:01:09.140> narrow<00:01:09.409> slot<00:01:09.770> here<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.310> is<00:01:10.460> also

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
very narrow slot here that is also

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.580 
very narrow slot here that is also
something<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.330> comes<00:01:11.720> from<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.049> original

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
something that comes from the original

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.399 
something that comes from the original
m1<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.850> original<00:01:14.180> m1<00:01:14.540> had<00:01:14.810> pop-up

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
m1 and the original m1 had pop-up

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.590 
m1 and the original m1 had pop-up
headlamps<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.670> we<00:01:16.850> would<00:01:17.000> not<00:01:17.150> do<00:01:17.360> in

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
headlamps and that we would not do in

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.130 
headlamps and that we would not do in
the<00:01:17.720> future

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
the future

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.620 
the future
for<00:01:18.530> safety<00:01:18.950> reasons<00:01:18.979> but<00:01:19.430> what<00:01:19.729> we<00:01:19.880> can<00:01:20.180> do<00:01:20.420> in

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
for safety reasons but what we can do in

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.719 
for safety reasons but what we can do in
the<00:01:20.750> future<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.439> actually<00:01:22.369> make<00:01:22.549> the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
the future is actually make the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.640 
the future is actually make the
headlamps<00:01:23.210> come<00:01:23.450> out<00:01:23.659> of<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.080> very<00:01:24.380> narrow

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
headlamps come out of this very narrow

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.310 
headlamps come out of this very narrow
slot<00:01:25.040> because<00:01:25.520> with<00:01:25.700> LED<00:01:26.120> technology<00:01:26.360> that

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
slot because with LED technology that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.860 
slot because with LED technology that
would<00:01:27.500> be<00:01:27.620> possible<00:01:28.270> another<00:01:29.270> element<00:01:29.750> that

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
would be possible another element that

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.500 
would be possible another element that
comes<00:01:30.320> actually<00:01:30.620> from<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.220> future<00:01:31.610> are<00:01:32.150> these

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
comes actually from the future are these

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.260 
comes actually from the future are these
blades<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.400> function<00:01:34.820> would<00:01:35.000> be<00:01:35.150> an

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
blades and the function would be an

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.660 
blades and the function would be an
aerodynamic<00:01:35.960> function<00:01:36.410> this<00:01:37.190> is<00:01:37.340> something

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
aerodynamic function this is something

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.160 
aerodynamic function this is something
that<00:01:37.700> we<00:01:38.000> have<00:01:38.120> learned<00:01:38.300> actually<00:01:38.870> from<00:01:39.050> our

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
that we have learned actually from our

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.710 
that we have learned actually from our
engagement<00:01:39.350> in<00:01:39.980> Formula<00:01:40.430> 1<00:01:40.580> we<00:01:41.270> now<00:01:41.450> know<00:01:41.690> a

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
engagement in Formula 1 we now know a

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.990 
engagement in Formula 1 we now know a
lot<00:01:42.080> more<00:01:42.260> about<00:01:42.320> aerodynamics<00:01:42.920> than<00:01:43.610> thirty

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
lot more about aerodynamics than thirty

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.400 
lot more about aerodynamics than thirty
years<00:01:44.120> ago<00:01:44.570> when<00:01:45.200> BMW<00:01:45.380> first<00:01:46.040> built<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.820> m1

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
years ago when BMW first built the m1

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.950 
years ago when BMW first built the m1
inside<00:01:48.410> view<00:01:48.650> of<00:01:48.740> course<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.310> proportions

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
inside view of course the proportions

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.940 
inside view of course the proportions
talked<00:01:50.960> about<00:01:51.230> speed

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
talked about speed

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.640 
talked about speed
you<00:01:52.190> see<00:01:52.400> also<00:01:52.580> sharp<00:01:53.090> lines<00:01:53.480> sharp<00:01:54.380> lines

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
you see also sharp lines sharp lines

belong<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.340> BMW<00:01:55.610> design<00:01:56.390> because<00:01:56.870> they<00:01:57.050> are<00:01:57.140> an

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
belong to BMW design because they are an

are reference to the original m1 the m1
was<00:02:04.670> really<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.510> first<00:02:05.860> sports<00:02:06.860> car<00:02:07.040> with

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
was really the first sports car with

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.089 
was really the first sports car with
mainly<00:02:08.720> closed<00:02:09.080> wheel<00:02:09.470> designs

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
mainly closed wheel designs

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.309 
mainly closed wheel designs
of<00:02:10.849> course<00:02:11.150> we<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.450> added<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.959> little<00:02:12.110> bit

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
of course we have added a little bit

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.380 
of course we have added a little bit
more<00:02:12.379> sculpture<00:02:13.129> and<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.849> same<00:02:14.060> goes<00:02:14.360> for

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
more sculpture and the same goes for

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.559 
more sculpture and the same goes for
this<00:02:14.900> whole<00:02:15.140> area<00:02:15.830> here<00:02:16.159> this<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.239> where<00:02:17.420> the

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
this whole area here this is where the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.479 
this whole area here this is where the
engine<00:02:17.959> would<00:02:18.170> sit<00:02:18.409> in<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.680> mid<00:02:18.920> engine<00:02:19.250> car

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
engine would sit in the mid engine car

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.910 
engine would sit in the mid engine car
and<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.180> see<00:02:20.360> all<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.810> lines<00:02:20.989> pick<00:02:21.409> up<00:02:21.590> speed

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
and you see all the lines pick up speed

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.729 
and you see all the lines pick up speed
towards<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.489> rear<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.510> then<00:02:23.750> when<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.530> look

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
towards the rear and then when we look

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.940 
towards the rear and then when we look
at<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.580> rear<00:02:25.790> view<00:02:25.909> and<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.230> mid-engine<00:02:27.739> car

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
at the rear view and of a mid-engine car

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.130 
at the rear view and of a mid-engine car
of<00:02:28.069> course<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.459> rear<00:02:28.640> view<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:29.030> important<00:02:29.660> it

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
of course the rear view is important it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.380 
of course the rear view is important it
is<00:02:30.200> what<00:02:30.500> people<00:02:30.530> would<00:02:31.100> see<00:02:31.310> most<00:02:31.550> when<00:02:32.209> they

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
is what people would see most when they

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.750 
is what people would see most when they
are<00:02:32.870> being<00:02:33.110> overtaken<00:02:33.590> by<00:02:33.830> this<00:02:34.010> car

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
are being overtaken by this car

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.630 
are being overtaken by this car
we<00:02:35.240> end<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.959> this<00:02:36.140> car<00:02:36.440> should<00:02:36.770> exude<00:02:37.280> power

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
we end of this car should exude power

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.300 
we end of this car should exude power
and<00:02:38.000> strength<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.870> believe<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:39.800> it<00:02:40.099> does

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
and strength and I believe that it does

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.870 
and strength and I believe that it does
so<00:02:40.550> by<00:02:41.209> this<00:02:41.270> very<00:02:41.630> strong<00:02:42.020> shoulder<00:02:42.880> and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
so by this very strong shoulder and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.270 
so by this very strong shoulder and
actually<00:02:44.870> here<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.470> rear<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.830> see<00:02:46.069> also

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
actually here in the rear you see also

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.040 
actually here in the rear you see also
one<00:02:46.640> element<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.239> we<00:02:47.360> took<00:02:47.540> from<00:02:47.810> the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
one element that we took from the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.910 
one element that we took from the
original<00:02:48.440> amount

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
original amount

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.729 
original amount
the<00:02:49.459> original<00:02:49.819> m1<00:02:50.150> was<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.510> only<00:02:50.870> car<00:02:51.110> in<00:02:51.350> the

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
the original m1 was the only car in the

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.059 
the original m1 was the only car in the
BMW<00:02:52.400> lineup<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:53.030> has<00:02:53.060> two<00:02:53.810> logos<00:02:54.110> instead<00:02:54.920> of

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
BMW lineup that has two logos instead of

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.280 
BMW lineup that has two logos instead of
one<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.819> center<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.810> course<00:02:56.840> we

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
one in the center and of course we

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.380 
one in the center and of course we
wanted<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.950> do<00:02:58.069> that<00:02:58.250> on<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:58.580> study<00:02:58.940> as<00:02:59.150> well

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
wanted to do that on this study as well

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.020 
wanted to do that on this study as well
and<00:02:59.690> then<00:03:00.380> when<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.620> look<00:03:00.739> at<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.100> tail<00:03:01.640> lamps

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
and then when you look at the tail lamps

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.460 
and then when you look at the tail lamps
you'll<00:03:02.239> see<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.750> they<00:03:02.900> are<00:03:02.930> very<00:03:03.260> very

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
you'll see that they are very very

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.460 
you'll see that they are very very
narrow<00:03:03.769> very<00:03:04.069> very<00:03:04.400> flat<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:05.540> too<00:03:05.780> can

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
narrow very very flat and that too can

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.170 
narrow very very flat and that too can
be<00:03:06.530> made<00:03:06.800> possible<00:03:06.830> in<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.580> future<00:03:07.940> through

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
be made possible in the future through

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.810 
be made possible in the future through
LED<00:03:08.569> technology
