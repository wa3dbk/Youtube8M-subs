the<00:00:36.570> PS<00:00:36.780> Vita<00:00:37.140> ones<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.649> let's<00:00:37.680> start<00:00:38.100> with

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the PS Vita ones so let's start with

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.220 
the PS Vita ones so let's start with
samurai<00:00:38.610> chronicles<00:00:39.360> which<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> Japanese

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
hack and slash style game so you can see

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.450 
hack and slash style game so you can see
the<00:00:42.510> PSP<00:00:42.930> version<00:00:43.320> has<00:00:43.469> very<00:00:43.800> very<00:00:43.920> muddy

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the PSP version has very very muddy

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.880 
the PSP version has very very muddy
textures<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.570> models<00:00:45.899> are<00:00:46.079> slightly<00:00:46.289> blocky

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
textures the models are slightly blocky

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.170 
textures the models are slightly blocky
but<00:00:47.039> actually<00:00:47.340> look<00:00:47.460> quite<00:00:47.700> good<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
but actually look quite good for the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.690 
but actually look quite good for the
time<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.660> PSP<00:00:49.110> had<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> resolution<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.950> 480<00:00:50.219> by

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
time the PSP had a resolution of 480 by

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.880 
time the PSP had a resolution of 480 by
272<00:00:51.510> which<00:00:51.780> sounds<00:00:52.140> almost<00:00:52.350> vomit-inducing

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
272 which sounds almost vomit-inducing

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.790 
272 which sounds almost vomit-inducing
by<00:00:53.520> today's<00:00:53.820> standards<00:00:54.329> however<00:00:54.989> due<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
by today's standards however due to the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.110 
by today's standards however due to the
fact<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.010> most<00:00:56.250> games<00:00:56.399> run<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:56.789> native

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
fact that most games run at native

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.880 
fact that most games run at native
resolution<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.260> screen<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.620> fairly

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
resolution and the screen was fairly

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.770 
resolution and the screen was fairly
small<00:00:59.129> they<00:00:59.370> actually<00:00:59.699> look<00:00:59.850> quite<00:01:00.120> sharp

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
small they actually look quite sharp

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.260 
small they actually look quite sharp
moving<00:01:01.530> over<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.770> samurai<00:01:02.340> Chronicles<00:01:02.820> 3<00:01:03.090> the

moving over to samurai Chronicles 3 the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.670 
moving over to samurai Chronicles 3 the
latest<00:01:03.660> version<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> PlayStation<00:01:04.559> Vita

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
latest version on the PlayStation Vita

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.130 
latest version on the PlayStation Vita
yes<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.700> looks<00:01:05.880> better<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.450> models<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> lot

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
yes it looks better the models are a lot

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.719 
yes it looks better the models are a lot
more<00:01:07.170> complex<00:01:07.740> however<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> textures<00:01:08.670> have

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
more complex however the textures have

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.910 
more complex however the textures have
had<00:01:08.909> very<00:01:09.210> little<00:01:09.330> upgrade<00:01:09.570> whatsoever<00:01:10.260> on

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
had very little upgrade whatsoever on

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.380 
had very little upgrade whatsoever on
top<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> resolution<00:01:11.760> bump<00:01:12.210> isn't

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
top of that the resolution bump isn't

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.300 
top of that the resolution bump isn't
noticeable<00:01:12.900> at<00:01:13.020> all<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.189> is

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
noticeable at all because this one is

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.950 
noticeable at all because this one is
running<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> much<00:01:15.000> lower<00:01:15.270> resolution<00:01:15.930> than

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
running at a much lower resolution than

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
running at a much lower resolution than
native<00:01:16.530> Reds<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:17.520> ends<00:01:17.909> up

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
native Reds and so actually ends up

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.490 
native Reds and so actually ends up
being<00:01:18.150> very<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.659> more<00:01:18.780> than<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> PSP

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
being very little more than the PSP

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.899 
being very little more than the PSP
number<00:01:19.950> count<00:01:20.189> are<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> number<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
number count are you the number of

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.370 
number count are you the number of
people<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.299> screen<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.840> time<00:01:22.080> hasn't

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
people on screen at one time hasn't

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.499 
people on screen at one time hasn't
increased<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:23.040> all<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> only

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
increased at all really and so the only

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.700 
increased at all really and so the only
real<00:01:24.659> improvement<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
real improvement here is with the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710 
real improvement here is with the
animations<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.790> addition<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.150> very<00:01:27.450> very

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
animations and the addition of very very

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
animations and the addition of very very
light<00:01:27.930> shadows<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.130> moving<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> resistance

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
light shadows so moving on to resistance

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.270 
light shadows so moving on to resistance
retribution<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> PSP<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.250> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
retribution on the PSP this is one of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.370 
retribution on the PSP this is one of
the<00:01:32.369> top<00:01:32.610> rated<00:01:32.820> shooters<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.840> system<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the top rated shooters of the system and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.899 
the top rated shooters of the system and
to<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:34.950> honest<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.250> actually<00:01:35.369> got<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> lot<00:01:35.880> of

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
to be honest it's actually got a lot of

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.580 
to be honest it's actually got a lot of
the<00:01:36.030> elements<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.450> its<00:01:36.570> console<00:01:36.930> counterparts

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the elements of its console counterparts

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.350 
the elements of its console counterparts
you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.280> see<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.729> got<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:38.939> muddy

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
you can see that it's got a very muddy

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.359 
you can see that it's got a very muddy
look<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.900> which<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.170> partly<00:01:40.470> stylistic<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369

unimpressive it's bare and textures have
not<00:03:26.079> really<00:03:26.349> improved<00:03:26.709> very<00:03:26.889> much<00:03:26.949> at<00:03:27.220> all<00:03:27.400> but

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
not really improved very much at all but

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.099 
not really improved very much at all but
then<00:03:28.150> again<00:03:28.239> there<00:03:28.449> is<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.569> little<00:03:28.780> bit<00:03:28.900> more

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
then again there is a little bit more

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.780 
then again there is a little bit more
going<00:03:29.290> on<00:03:29.409> screen<00:03:29.859> but<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.370> frame<00:03:30.579> rate<00:03:30.760> has

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
going on screen but the frame rate has

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.580 
going on screen but the frame rate has
been<00:03:30.940> lowered<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:31.659> overall<00:03:31.930> it's<00:03:32.169> not<00:03:32.319> really

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
been lowered so overall it's not really

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.020 
been lowered so overall it's not really
that<00:03:32.769> much<00:03:32.889> of<00:03:32.949> a<00:03:33.099> leap<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:33.699> although<00:03:33.819> the

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
that much of a leap so although the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.000 
that much of a leap so although the
PlayStation<00:03:34.480> Vita<00:03:34.599> is<00:03:34.870> hugely<00:03:35.349> more<00:03:35.620> powerful

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
PlayStation Vita is hugely more powerful

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.069 
PlayStation Vita is hugely more powerful

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
than PlayStation Portable its advantages

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.809 
than PlayStation Portable its advantages
are<00:03:38.230> only<00:03:38.379> really<00:03:38.560> exploited<00:03:39.159> in<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.310> very<00:03:39.519> few

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
are only really exploited in a very few

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.309 
are only really exploited in a very few
number<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.239> games<00:03:40.449> such<00:03:40.780> as<00:03:40.810> Killzone

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
number of games such as Killzone

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.960 
number of games such as Killzone
mercenary<00:03:41.349> but<00:03:41.949> when<00:03:42.099> they<00:03:42.250> are<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.609> results

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
mercenary but when they are the results

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.580 
mercenary but when they are the results
are<00:03:43.090> stunning<00:03:43.299> if<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:44.109> take<00:03:44.290> into<00:03:44.560> account

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
are stunning if you take into account

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.500 
are stunning if you take into account
that<00:03:44.979> the<00:03:45.099> PS<00:03:45.340> Vita<00:03:45.579> has<00:03:45.699> better<00:03:45.940> speakers<00:03:46.479> a

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
that the PS Vita has better speakers a

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.390 
that the PS Vita has better speakers a
better<00:03:46.750> display<00:03:47.290> better<00:03:47.560> controls<00:03:48.129> and<00:03:48.370> a

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
better overall feel in the hand it

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.449 
better overall feel in the hand it
becomes<00:03:50.169> clear<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:50.949> offers<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.220> superior

experience and we start to realize how
great<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.310> machine<00:03:54.699> it<00:03:54.879> is<00:03:54.909> thanks<00:03:55.840> for
