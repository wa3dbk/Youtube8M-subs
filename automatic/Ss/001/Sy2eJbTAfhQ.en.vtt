the<00:00:24.050> standardized<00:00:24.619> patient<00:00:25.010> program<00:00:25.310> I<00:00:25.580> call

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
the standardized patient program I call

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.960 
the standardized patient program I call
the<00:00:26.000> SP<00:00:26.390> program<00:00:26.950> is<00:00:27.950> vital<00:00:28.760> to<00:00:28.790> the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
the SP program is vital to the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.790 
the SP program is vital to the
curriculum<00:00:29.150> at<00:00:29.450> Duke<00:00:29.570> NUS<00:00:29.990> for<00:00:30.320> I<00:00:30.350> think<00:00:30.650> two

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
curriculum at Duke NUS for I think two

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.520 
curriculum at Duke NUS for I think two
reasons<00:00:31.189> SPS<00:00:31.850> are<00:00:31.970> great<00:00:32.239> for<00:00:32.629> teaching<00:00:33.320> the

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
reasons SPS are great for teaching the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.140 
reasons SPS are great for teaching the
students<00:00:33.980> but<00:00:34.160> also<00:00:34.220> for<00:00:34.610> testing<00:00:35.059> the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
students but also for testing the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.060 
students but also for testing the
students<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:36.230> when<00:00:36.350> it<00:00:36.470> comes<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:36.830> teaching

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
students and when it comes to teaching

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.549 
students and when it comes to teaching
the<00:00:37.309> students<00:00:37.760> it's<00:00:38.270> a<00:00:38.420> great<00:00:38.629> opportunity<00:00:38.930> to

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
the students it's a great opportunity to

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.680 
the students it's a great opportunity to
bring<00:00:39.739> in<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.250> whole<00:00:40.430> load<00:00:40.760> of<00:00:40.790> faculty<00:00:41.360> to<00:00:41.540> one

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
bring in a whole load of faculty to one

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.330 
bring in a whole load of faculty to one
place<00:00:42.110> like<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.559> clinical<00:00:42.890> Performance

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
place like the clinical Performance

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.250 
place like the clinical Performance
Center<00:00:43.610> where<00:00:43.760> we<00:00:43.910> are<00:00:44.059> we<00:00:44.629> can<00:00:44.660> hire<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:44.960> bunch

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
Center where we are we can hire a bunch

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.049 
Center where we are we can hire a bunch
of<00:00:45.410> SPS<00:00:45.830> and<00:00:46.100> get<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.430> whole<00:00:46.610> class<00:00:46.850> to

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
of SPS and get the whole class to

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.330 
of SPS and get the whole class to
practice<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:47.660> skill<00:00:47.810> all<00:00:48.260> in<00:00:48.680> one<00:00:48.860> class

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
practice a skill all in one class

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.400 
practice a skill all in one class
session<00:00:49.790> that<00:00:50.480> way<00:00:50.570> we<00:00:50.720> have<00:00:50.840> faculty

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
session that way we have faculty

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.740 
session that way we have faculty
directly<00:00:52.250> observing<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.760> students<00:00:53.239> the

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
directly observing the students the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.060 
directly observing the students the
students<00:00:54.110> all<00:00:54.230> get<00:00:54.410> an<00:00:54.470> opportunity<00:00:54.680> to

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
students all get an opportunity to

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.760 
students all get an opportunity to
practice<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.180> there's<00:00:56.360> a<00:00:56.420> great<00:00:56.690> way<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:56.899> sort

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
practice so there's a great way to sort

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.729 
practice so there's a great way to sort
of<00:00:57.860> make<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:59.239> education<00:00:59.750> fair<00:01:00.110> for<00:01:00.469> all<00:01:00.559> the

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
of make the education fair for all the

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.310 
of make the education fair for all the
students<00:01:01.160> when<00:01:01.790> it<00:01:01.820> comes<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.180> exams<00:01:02.540> is<00:01:02.899> where

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
students when it comes to exams is where

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.990 
students when it comes to exams is where
the<00:01:03.500> standardized<00:01:03.829> patient<00:01:04.190> methodology<00:01:04.759> is

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
the standardized patient methodology is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.450 
the standardized patient methodology is
really<00:01:05.600> done<00:01:05.780> very<00:01:05.810> rigorously<00:01:06.619> at<00:01:06.830> Duke<00:01:07.040> NUS

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
really done very rigorously at Duke NUS

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.200 
really done very rigorously at Duke NUS
for<00:01:08.030> exams<00:01:08.330> it's<00:01:08.869> fantastic<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.890> have

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
for exams it's fantastic to have

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.130 
for exams it's fantastic to have
standardized<00:01:11.210> patients<00:01:11.600> because<00:01:11.869> we<00:01:11.899> can

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
standardized patients because we can

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.800 
standardized patients because we can
standardize<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:13.420> criteria<00:01:14.420> against<00:01:14.690> which

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
standardize the criteria against which

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.960 
standardize the criteria against which
were<00:01:15.170> assessing<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.860> students<00:01:16.310> this<00:01:16.789> means

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
were assessing the students this means

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.940 
were assessing the students this means
that<00:01:17.090> we<00:01:17.180> can<00:01:17.330> bring<00:01:17.539> in<00:01:17.690> patients<00:01:18.500> who<00:01:18.890> are

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
that we can bring in patients who are

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.250 
that we can bring in patients who are
standardized<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.909> play<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.210> same<00:01:20.390> role<00:01:20.690> it

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
standardized to play the same role it

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.510 
standardized to play the same role it
allows<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.590> students<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:22.010> feel<00:01:22.220> that<00:01:22.400> they're

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
allows the students to feel that they're

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.950 
allows the students to feel that they're
being<00:01:22.670> fairly<00:01:23.119> assessed<00:01:23.479> because<00:01:23.630> they<00:01:23.810> get

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
being fairly assessed because they get

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.600 
being fairly assessed because they get
the<00:01:24.080> same<00:01:24.229> case<00:01:24.530> as<00:01:24.770> their<00:01:24.950> classmate<00:01:25.430> gets

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
the same case as their classmate gets

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.420 
the same case as their classmate gets
but<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.540> also<00:01:26.690> allows<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.200> faculty<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:28.040> assess

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
but it also allows the faculty to assess

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.580 
but it also allows the faculty to assess
them<00:01:28.700> in<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:29.210> more<00:01:29.390> reliable<00:01:29.990> way<00:01:30.170> because

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
them in a more reliable way because

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.810 
them in a more reliable way because
they're<00:01:30.770> comparing<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.460> students

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
they're comparing the students

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.450 
they're comparing the students
performance<00:01:32.000> with<00:01:32.930> mrs.<00:01:33.350> tan<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:34.010> each<00:01:34.340> and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
performance with mrs. tan and each and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.580 
performance with mrs. tan and each and
every<00:01:34.630> encounter<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:35.930> not<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.170> new<00:01:36.350> patient

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
every encounter it's not a new patient

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.399 
every encounter it's not a new patient
every<00:01:36.979> time<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:37.760> this<00:01:37.909> is<00:01:38.000> where<00:01:38.150> the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
every time so this is where the

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.719 
every time so this is where the
standardization<00:01:39.409> comes<00:01:39.890> in<00:01:40.070> to<00:01:40.460> play

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
standardization comes in to play

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.460 
standardization comes in to play
we<00:01:41.240> really<00:01:41.479> need<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.720> be<00:01:41.810> rigorous<00:01:42.020> in<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.380> way

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
we really need to be rigorous in the way

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.960 
we really need to be rigorous in the way
we<00:01:42.590> train<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.950> patients<00:01:43.369> because<00:01:43.640> if<00:01:43.790> the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
we train the patients because if the

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.030 
we train the patients because if the
goal<00:01:44.119> is<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.390> have<00:01:44.509> them<00:01:44.720> be<00:01:44.780> exactly<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.860> same

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
goal is to have them be exactly the same

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.950 
goal is to have them be exactly the same
in<00:01:46.189> each<00:01:46.280> room<00:01:46.580> then<00:01:47.210> we<00:01:47.240> have<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.570> train<00:01:47.810> them

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
in each room then we have to train them

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.840 
in each room then we have to train them
in<00:01:48.140> such<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.320> way<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.770> they<00:01:48.890> portray<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.640> case

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
in such a way that they portray the case

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.660 
in such a way that they portray the case
exactly<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.750> same<00:01:50.930> time<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:51.439> time<00:01:51.619> again<00:01:51.670> so

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
exactly the same time and time again so

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.070 
exactly the same time and time again so
getting<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.090> patient<00:01:53.420> perspective<00:01:53.540> I<00:01:54.020> think

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
getting the patient perspective I think

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.960 
getting the patient perspective I think
is<00:01:54.320> one<00:01:54.470> of<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.650> key<00:01:55.189> benefits<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.729> using

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
is one of the key benefits to using

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.820 
is one of the key benefits to using
standardized<00:01:56.450> patients<00:01:56.900> in<00:01:57.049> real<00:01:57.590> clinical

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
standardized patients in real clinical

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.469 
standardized patients in real clinical
practice<00:01:58.400> you<00:01:58.520> can't<00:01:58.729> stop<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.210> interview

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
practice you can't stop the interview

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.539 
practice you can't stop the interview
and<00:01:59.810> say<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.049> your<00:02:00.170> patient<00:02:00.590> how's<00:02:01.040> that<00:02:01.220> going

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
and say to your patient how's that going

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.219 
and say to your patient how's that going
for<00:02:01.579> you<00:02:01.820> or<00:02:02.119> can<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.659> give<00:02:02.780> me<00:02:02.869> some<00:02:03.049> feedback

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
for you or can you give me some feedback

for you or can you give me some feedback
on<00:02:03.710> my<00:02:03.890> communication<00:02:04.549> skills<00:02:04.670> because

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
on my communication skills because

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.179 
on my communication skills because
that's<00:02:05.509> not<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:05.869> job<00:02:06.079> with<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.380> patient<00:02:06.770> but

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
that's not the job with the patient but

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.380 
that's not the job with the patient but
with<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.369> standardized<00:02:07.729> patient<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.239> is

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
with the standardized patient that is

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.419 
with the standardized patient that is
part<00:02:08.630> of<00:02:08.690> their<00:02:08.840> job<00:02:09.110> they<00:02:09.440> give<00:02:09.619> feedback<00:02:09.890> to

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
part of their job they give feedback to

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.580 
part of their job they give feedback to
the<00:02:10.880> student<00:02:11.299> or<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.170> learner

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
the student or to the learner

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.380 
the student or to the learner
and<00:02:13.340> they're<00:02:13.459> trained<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.820> do<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.150> in<00:02:14.269> an

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390

and they're trained to do so in an
effective<00:02:14.900> way<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.350> we<00:02:15.769> actually<00:02:15.920> use<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400

a patient to come in with say
anaphylactic<00:03:25.750> shock<00:03:25.930> we<00:03:26.620> can<00:03:26.769> give<00:03:26.890> each

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
anaphylactic shock we can give each

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.090 
anaphylactic shock we can give each

this makes the learning more complete

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.130 
this makes the learning more complete
because<00:03:33.910> we<00:03:33.940> don't<00:03:34.269> have<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.720> wait<00:03:34.900> for<00:03:35.110> a

that's very complex and serious it could

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.750 
that's very complex and serious it could

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
here won't affect a real patient but

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.600 
here won't affect a real patient but
it's<00:03:58.959> realistic<00:03:59.380> enough<00:03:59.920> that<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.310> student

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
it's realistic enough that the student

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.400 
it's realistic enough that the student
feels<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.180> they're<00:04:01.360> really<00:04:01.750> participating

in a real patient scenario we know from
research<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.290> students<00:04:06.130> who<00:04:06.220> are<00:04:06.310> asked<00:04:06.700> to

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
research that students who are asked to

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.610 
research that students who are asked to
commit<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.480> decision<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:08.200> actually<00:04:08.440> follow

through<00:04:09.040> on<00:04:09.070> what<00:04:09.640> they<00:04:09.790> think<00:04:10.030> is<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.269> proper

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
through on what they think is the proper

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.630 
through on what they think is the proper
decision<00:04:11.260> making<00:04:11.500> for<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.680> patient<00:04:11.980> helps<00:04:12.459> them

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
decision making for a patient helps them

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.100 
decision making for a patient helps them
learn<00:04:12.820> more<00:04:13.150> than<00:04:13.330> if<00:04:13.420> they<00:04:13.570> just<00:04:13.750> sit<00:04:13.930> back

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
learn more than if they just sit back

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.870 
learn more than if they just sit back
and<00:04:14.170> watch<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:15.070> being<00:04:15.310> able<00:04:15.549> to<00:04:15.670> do

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
and watch so being able to do

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.170 
and watch so being able to do
experiential<00:04:16.690> hands

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
experiential hands

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.999 
experiential hands
with<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.750> sim<00:04:17.959> man<00:04:18.169> is<00:04:18.350> making<00:04:18.859> the

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:19.009 
with the sim man is making the

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.979 
with the sim man is making the
educational<00:04:19.639> impact<00:04:20.030> much<00:04:20.359> greater<00:04:20.690> for<00:04:20.959> the

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
educational impact much greater for the

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.990 
educational impact much greater for the
student<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.710> we<00:04:24.830> have<00:04:25.039> very<00:04:25.430> much<00:04:25.789> experience

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
student so we have very much experience

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.719 
student so we have very much experience
of<00:04:26.570> learning<00:04:26.690> here<00:04:27.199> it's<00:04:27.380> hands-on<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.100> the

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
of learning here it's hands-on and the

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:29.710 
of learning here it's hands-on and the
students<00:04:29.060> find<00:04:29.210> that<00:04:29.300> much<00:04:29.509> more

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
students find that much more

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.020 
students find that much more
entertaining<00:04:30.650> and<00:04:30.949> with<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.580> entertaining

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
entertaining and with the entertaining

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.080 
entertaining and with the entertaining
or<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.419> it<00:04:32.690> comes<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.560> educational<00:04:34.220> value<00:04:34.250> so

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
or the it comes the educational value so

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.820 
or the it comes the educational value so
the<00:04:35.180> students<00:04:35.479> always<00:04:35.660> give<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.500> sessions

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
the students always give the sessions

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.740 
the students always give the sessions
with<00:04:37.009> sim<00:04:37.190> man<00:04:37.340> very<00:04:37.580> high<00:04:37.789> ratings<00:04:38.270> they've

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
with sim man very high ratings they've

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.170 
with sim man very high ratings they've
very<00:04:39.139> satisfied<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:40.280> think<00:04:40.490> it's<00:04:40.639> because

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
very satisfied and I think it's because

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.240 
very satisfied and I think it's because
it's<00:04:41.389> fun<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.080> novel<00:04:42.470> but<00:04:42.680> more<00:04:42.889> so<00:04:43.100> I<00:04:43.130> think

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
it's fun and novel but more so I think

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.650 
it's fun and novel but more so I think
it's<00:04:43.580> really<00:04:43.820> actually<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.240> great<00:04:44.449> learning

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
it's really actually a great learning

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.300 
it's really actually a great learning
environment<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.710> students<00:04:46.100> get<00:04:46.220> an

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
environment the students get an

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.060 
environment the students get an
opportunity<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:47.150> encounter<00:04:47.710> conditions<00:04:48.710> that

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
opportunity to encounter conditions that

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.430 
opportunity to encounter conditions that
they're<00:04:49.280> learning<00:04:49.759> about<00:04:50.110> theoretically<00:04:51.110> in

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
they're learning about theoretically in

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.310 
they're learning about theoretically in
an<00:04:52.220> actual<00:04:52.820> way<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.300> then<00:04:53.630> they<00:04:53.840> also<00:04:53.990> get<00:04:54.259> a

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
an actual way and then they also get a

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.469 
an actual way and then they also get a
real<00:04:54.560> chance<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:55.130> try<00:04:55.460> out<00:04:55.490> decision<00:04:56.060> making

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
real chance to try out decision making

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.330 
real chance to try out decision making
or<00:04:56.599> try<00:04:56.810> out<00:04:56.840> procedures<00:04:57.349> things<00:04:58.099> that<00:04:58.250> are

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
or try out procedures things that are

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.890 
or try out procedures things that are
really<00:04:58.460> left<00:04:58.699> to<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:59.000> senior<00:04:59.300> doctors<00:04:59.690> in<00:04:59.840> the

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
really left to the senior doctors in the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.020 
really left to the senior doctors in the
hospital<00:05:00.410> so<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.160> think<00:05:01.280> this<00:05:01.520> really<00:05:01.610> helps

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
hospital so I think this really helps

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.969 
hospital so I think this really helps
them<00:05:02.180> move<00:05:02.479> along<00:05:02.630> from<00:05:03.110> being<00:05:03.349> you<00:05:03.710> know<00:05:03.830> the

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
them move along from being you know the

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.920 
them move along from being you know the
junior<00:05:04.190> doctor<00:05:04.699> to<00:05:04.880> a<00:05:04.910> more<00:05:05.180> senior<00:05:05.599> member<00:05:05.900> of

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
junior doctor to a more senior member of

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.300 
junior doctor to a more senior member of
the<00:05:06.050> team<00:05:06.199> because<00:05:06.620> they<00:05:06.860> build<00:05:07.190> more

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
the team because they build more

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.029 
the team because they build more
hands-on<00:05:08.210> experience<00:05:08.930> as<00:05:09.620> far<00:05:09.800> as<00:05:09.889> keeping

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
hands-on experience as far as keeping

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.390 
hands-on experience as far as keeping
some<00:05:10.430> man<00:05:10.639> in<00:05:10.669> tip-top<00:05:11.030> shape<00:05:11.240> we<00:05:12.039> do<00:05:13.039> bring<00:05:13.250> in

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
some man in tip-top shape we do bring in

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.659 
some man in tip-top shape we do bring in
the<00:05:13.699> service<00:05:14.150> provider<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:14.690> come<00:05:14.870> in<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.169> do

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
the service provider to come in and do

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.890 
the service provider to come in and do
routine<00:05:16.669> maintenance<00:05:16.820> on<00:05:17.150> some<00:05:17.570> men<00:05:17.720> as

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
routine maintenance on some men as

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.439 
routine maintenance on some men as
needed<00:05:18.259> or<00:05:18.710> I<00:05:18.770> also<00:05:19.250> have<00:05:19.550> a<00:05:19.580> few<00:05:19.789> rules<00:05:20.030> when

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
needed or I also have a few rules when

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.879 
needed or I also have a few rules when
you're<00:05:20.599> working<00:05:20.870> with<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.080> simulator<00:05:21.590> like

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
you're working with the simulator like

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.070 
you're working with the simulator like
keeping<00:05:22.370> away<00:05:22.610> ballpoint<00:05:23.150> pens<00:05:23.419> ballpoint

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
keeping away ballpoint pens ballpoint

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.230 
keeping away ballpoint pens ballpoint
pens<00:05:24.560> gives<00:05:24.800> him<00:05:25.010> an<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.430> tattoo<00:05:25.849> that<00:05:25.880> will

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
pens gives him an a tattoo that will

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.450 
pens gives him an a tattoo that will
never<00:05:26.389> have<00:05:26.539> come<00:05:26.659> off<00:05:26.870> so<00:05:27.590> there's<00:05:28.340> some

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
never have come off so there's some

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.980 
never have come off so there's some
rules<00:05:28.669> about<00:05:28.940> treating<00:05:29.479> him<00:05:29.659> with<00:05:29.780> respect

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
rules about treating him with respect
