00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello together I just stop here 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.450
 carton from the new wonder box so from 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.250
 the december issue in hand and me 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.900
 thought we look at each other in common 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.210
 and I try something again 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.430
 try out the matter directly from Sun. 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.830
 first impression moderately I'm just getting 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.720
 first get the title where then 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.400
 I probably hope so again 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.449
 theme is on it because I had it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.949
 no idea what the topic is I am 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.760
 again very badly informed 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.560
 okay the topic is shadow games me 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.350
 go therefore of something darker tones 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.059
 right, or I assume okay me 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.680
 is already something against and 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.649
 Although this is a cosmetics cosmo 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:47.030
 nail polish in the color grim reaper the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:51.030
 it's so green I mean something metallic 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.829
 I 'll swatch lanthan we'll look at it 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.180
 what will happen 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.410
 So that's a layer of me now 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.270
 make yourself a second on it again 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.210
 but it already looks like mine 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.219
 taste a bit I have it so in 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.290
 darker taste a dark soul 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.740
 has a dark taste okay yet 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.570
 a nail polish from youtube 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.700
 Although it is such a black anna long 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.930
 in the color black denim and the wearing 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.909
 I also just go up here 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.680
 here is definitely the brush 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.290
 a little thinner this is one 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.790
 layer of the other long good leave 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.579
 I tumble in the history Herberner 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.950
 bÃ¶rner look there is a trailer here 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.259
 inside and I even believe I have 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.090
 a guess so it looks 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.670
 trailer also such a star fits just like that 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.880
 the winter time in the middle is me 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.000
 think this is sexy or klunker 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.430
 yes, just like you can then with you 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.930
 others can come to this change 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.930
 do it on what I think I fit so well 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.490
 what you like you can do it yourself 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.540
 Stop doing a keyless thing is now 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.579
 not quite my taste i have 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.560
 generally not forever on my things 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.780
 because it makes me crazy 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.590
 but maybe you like this one or 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.110
 other okay what is large okay, the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.209
 is an eyeshadow palette of beauty 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.459
 uk 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.630
 And so the colors look so very 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.400
 promising I am curious 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.980
 how these copies are I believe 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.050
 I'm not so out of youtube shadow 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.170
 I mean no, okay, here it is 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.420
 ding an applicator included and the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.769
 the colors i swatch are the same 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.510
 sometimes on my hand back or poor come 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.099
 I once hand on her back and then 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.930
 I'm looking for you from epic times 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.190
 they are growing so densely 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.630
 So there are such a few colors 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.430
 really pretty blatant in and then there 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.440
 which ones where you really a bit 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.810
 but having to lift off in the large and 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.920
 I really do not think so 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.950
 Bad, I do not know what you mean 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.760
 so we will be right at the end 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.760
 yet let's see it 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.980
 two things are still okay okay 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.630
 At kosmetik cosmo there are now too 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.190
 patrice on offer and that's why there are 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.170
 in this edition of a no katri 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.170
 smokey eyes set and that this is the with 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:09.180
 This greenish shades in the color 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.470
 only 50 are harmony and I have the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.910
 honestly never tried it i know 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.730
 not like this one of the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.859
 pigmentation is crass here is 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.970
 even cream with dingsbums doing that 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.810
 I did not know that now 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.900
 Just have a look 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.320
 So you already noticed in any case 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.670
 the difference to the eyeshadows of 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.040
 beauty ok so you are already one 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.269
 pigmented a bit crass and me 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.650
 believe that they too have with them 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.450
 I can do something with the others 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.410
 So fans are all in all 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.290
 I somehow do something with them 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.430
 can start so pink or something like that 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.280
 always have a thing with me 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.700
 So the eyes the han have 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.660
 eyes i think i think this pink 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.100
 pink is always like that 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.069
 hurtling little train we come to the 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.139
 last page here is a spit that 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.940
 is a lip gloss of cosmetics cosmo and 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:59.459
 that's the color florida and it looks 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.660
 very good and i will take him now 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.690
 just clap on my lips 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.340
 or do I do it I do it or something 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.049
 people is orange and I know 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.920
 more with my hair color but somehow 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.829
 I find the ball 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.169
 so I have I do not grow as 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.720
 is and somehow I like that 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.950
 reminds me a bit 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.930
 williams from paramore or i know 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.730
 not me it's me I'm just kinda 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.900
 very good and feels good on the 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.430
 lips so I had previously in the 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.650
 last box glitter this mega 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.170
 I found that very uncomfortable on the 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.070
 I like it 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.600
 probably not every day now 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.460
 wear what is just orange 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.960
 but if you are such a relative 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.610
 simply the eyes make up is me 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.700
 I do not even think so wrong 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.320
 I bet it a bit something 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.250
 maybe try the eyeshadow 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.440
 I get there so what clever 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.700
 somehow 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.690
 excites me actually just a lot 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.510
 more this mobile than palette from the left 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.780
 I just look let you I surprise 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.780
 improvise now 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.550
 so nothing is special now 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:18.259
 I like it a lot I'll go now 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.729
 on the nail, whether the two layers 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:24.379
 We can also apply it again 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:28.219
 look like that really covering 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:29.150
 Looks like they are with the two then 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:32.559
 two layers 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.599
 I would say that of cosmetics cosmo 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:37.069
 I like it even better 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.990
 I actually like that very well 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:40.039
 so are my colors so that 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.289
 I really like it 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.029
 and this black sparkling one is 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.620
 but not completely dark black and 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.749
 dark brown dark brown 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.460
 he is such a dark gray but like that 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:51.650
 I am also very good so are mine 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.479
 colors I'm so much more of a darker 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.589
 I once said I can do it too 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.779
 about eight more you say I am 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:58.339
 rather the darker type yes you can me 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.430
 say how satisfied are you with your box 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:02.469
 So be as said 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.419
 I think patrice palette is great 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:07.099
 I also like nail polishes 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.499
 lipgloss I think something different than 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:12.080
 if it had been like that again 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:14.270
 you already 800 x stroke and then down 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.629
 somewhere the beauty op disappears 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.099
 palette I think so well and that gabs 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:20.659
 nor the trailer is not now 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.159
 so my thing but we can still 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:26.560
 Let's see the prices before I go here 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:31.219
 say goodbye so the card 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:36.229
 costs 590 of cosmetics cosmo lipgloss 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:38.419
 costs five euros 49 okay the beauty uk 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.370
 palette costs 7 euro 99 that of course 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:45.529
 for ten colors again not at all 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:48.050
 So much so that's the cosmetics 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:50.389
 cosmo nail polish costs three euro 99 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.159
 is or probably means 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.620
 it's one of the two usually the 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:59.240
 others of video clips for their 19 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.709
 and exactly the key chain is there 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.909
 there is a joke of by so the 

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:02.689
 is star shape but there are also 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:06.080
 still a heart shape 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:10.360
 it costs nine euro 50 original and is 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.080
 how exactly does that change from luca exactly 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.789
 now you should be with everyone 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.120
 information hopefully equipped 

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:15.740
 his 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.330
 then it was me in any case 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.589
 hope you free yourself with your max and 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.589
 especially next time
