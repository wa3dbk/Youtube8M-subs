00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.310
 as you see we can year in working conditions 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.500

 Internet access 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.450
 if you have no such opportunity then you 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.200

 the image is more likely to be military 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:30.650
 actions 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.229

 Well, finally it loaded on the most 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.289
 hit during another place 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:51.139
 as we have already reported that in this way 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.479
 when we can also 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.029
 we have released such robots 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.249
 often not 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:58.299
 over the monument 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.299
 this is the golden mean for this 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.460
 it would be very strange 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.439
 sneeze 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.479

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.609
 certain 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.109

 our base again 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.210
 before 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.750
 this is a difficult task which has arisen 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.750
 incomprehensible 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.299
