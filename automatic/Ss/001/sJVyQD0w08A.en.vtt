00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:04.579
 not 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:11.480
 this they had one 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.809
 captain percent they make 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.059
 the parquet floors 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.409
 to become happy 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.439
 the police have 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:19.919
 compile benefits 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.489
 or function saved 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:22.869
 they will be 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.210
 do not build the factory yet they have everything in house 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.939
 Composing benefits are floorboards that consist of 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.670
 different layers keeps the advantage of the composition that what 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.020
 less effect after no work has been laid down 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.890
 visible when it is needed to work 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.100
 the quality for the floor of a better hand 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.010
 to be realised 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.530
 maybe it has not been sold the past year 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.440
 we have a lot of automates which also have a lot of time to automate 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.490
 it is possible to perform random checks 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.840
 measuring the forces means the first time we can deliver it is a garden 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.010
 Arrange anyway within ten working days our they carry and the more than 300 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.210
 different products of life more than 300 different products 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.990
 Performances that refuse desired actor may be out of date has the Christmas season 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.100
 these smoke 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.630
 missing the police the belgian market is one 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.600
 is an active immortality has been cited appealingly 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.030
 against belga sam 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.400
 we also see that there is a lot of interest in times the dts the belgian dts 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.290
 to buy a house after his departure to shorten winning did you call there 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.759
 What is striking is that the Belgian customers we have 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.479
 and reliable have entered into cooperation with our company 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.440
 it's a constant 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.270
 looking for new partners to see their already in belgium world he merckx and 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.490
 that there are still too many market funds on profit because we are the new customers 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.910
 seems inevitable 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.230
 in this show 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.590
 That means we are going to look at it 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.580
 our products you have a Shiite breakfast to put your own opinion 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.790
 that again means that we provide tailor-made care between tati and there 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.810
 then they go 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.270
 what is going on and often stated that in between there are still some things about it 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.249
 must fit 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:17.079
 the floor that does run, how they don't run and that is pretty difficult 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.309
 we also support our customers in a marked way 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:25.009
 if you have the technical service turning point and that moment we return it 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:26.429
 also turned out to be 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.739
 measured by the committee 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.339
 often about that 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:32.559
 or are they there with it 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.589
 all shifts are to be loved 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.519
 gates it delivers 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.079
 so also in Almere this case 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.689
 and that was currently well received by our existing one quarter 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.659
 but keep better and like to come in contact again because of that are the retailers and the 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:48.930
 spotlights and then
