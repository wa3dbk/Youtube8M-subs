the numbers this this game is about the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.140 
the numbers this this game is about the
numerous<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.340> bring<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.610> numbers<00:02:46.880> like<00:02:47.060> I

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
said before I hold the key to the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.750 
said before I hold the key to the
biggest<00:02:48.710> gate<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.100> key<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.490> biggest

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
biggest gate the key to the biggest

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.870 
biggest gate the key to the biggest
attendance<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.500> makes<00:02:51.980> sense<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.580> put<00:02:52.760> me

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
attendance so it makes sense to put me

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.820 
attendance so it makes sense to put me
in<00:02:53.030> there<00:02:53.210> so<00:02:53.630> unfortunately<00:02:54.380> they<00:02:54.500> will<00:02:54.650> just
