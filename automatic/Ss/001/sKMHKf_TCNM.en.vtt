00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
right off the bat you notice at Apple

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.299 
right off the bat you notice at Apple
they<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> gradient<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.890> their<00:00:55.890> background

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
they have a gradient as their background

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.810 
they have a gradient as their background
goes<00:00:56.670> from<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.120> light<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.989> white<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> soft<00:00:59.430> grey

goes from a light a white to a soft grey

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.510 
goes from a light a white to a soft grey
and<00:01:00.649> one<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.770> things<00:01:01.800> about<00:01:01.949> gradients

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
and one of the things about gradients

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.310 
and one of the things about gradients
I've<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.030> done<00:01:03.210> well<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.989> very

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
I've if it's done well it's it's very

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.289 
I've if it's done well it's it's very
subtle<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.519> won't<00:01:05.729> even<00:01:05.820> notice<00:01:06.060> it

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
subtle and you won't even notice it

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.460 
subtle and you won't even notice it
you'll<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.450> notice<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> page<00:01:07.350> you

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you'll just notice that the page you

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.789 
you'll just notice that the page you
look<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:07.770> polished<00:01:08.400> but<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:10.619> won't

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
look really polished but you won't

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.440 
look really polished but you won't
actually<00:01:10.950> notice<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> gradient<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.210> that's

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
actually notice the gradient and that's

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.240 
actually notice the gradient and that's
that's<00:01:12.720> done<00:01:13.200> that's<00:01:13.470> when<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.220> know

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
that's done that's when you you know

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.380 
that's done that's when you you know
you've<00:01:14.549> done<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> good<00:01:14.880> job<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.270> use

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you've done a good job and use

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.570 
you've done a good job and use
ingredients<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.020> they<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.250> they're<00:01:17.490> on

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
ingredients so they do that they're on

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.249 
ingredients so they do that they're on
the<00:01:17.670> background<00:01:18.090> look<00:01:18.630> at<00:01:18.750> these<00:01:18.840> containers

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the background look at these containers

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.420 
the background look at these containers
that<00:01:19.409> they<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.070> these<00:01:20.189> four

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that they have that these four

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.140 
that they have that these four
containers<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:21.030> Apple<00:01:21.990> uses<00:01:22.549> this<00:01:23.549> instead<00:01:24.090> of

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
containers at Apple uses this instead of

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.999 
containers at Apple uses this instead of
just<00:01:24.360> being<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.689> white<00:01:25.049> container<00:01:25.530> white

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
just being a white container white

just being a white container white
background<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> soft<00:01:27.689> gray

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
background they have a soft gray

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.960

blending<00:01:28.799> into<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> white<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.700> take<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> look<00:01:32.880> at

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
blending into a white so take a look at

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.499 
blending into a white so take a look at
Apple<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.950> just<00:01:34.950> kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.369> study<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.390> I'm

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
Apple and just kind of study what I'm

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.910 
Apple and just kind of study what I'm
what<00:01:36.659> I'm<00:01:36.689> talking<00:01:37.020> about<00:01:37.079> use<00:01:37.380> notice<00:01:37.740> their

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
what I'm talking about use notice their

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.030 
what I'm talking about use notice their
navigation<00:01:38.610> bar<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.509> gray<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.650> blends

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
navigation bar it's a gray that blends

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.330 
navigation bar it's a gray that blends
into<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.369> darker<00:01:41.850> gray<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.189> little

subtle gradients gradient treatments on
a<00:01:48.000> website<00:01:48.360> actually<00:01:48.780> brings<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.560> and

your website and bring it out let's go

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.360 
your website and bring it out let's go
over<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:37.440> fireworks<00:04:38.040> that<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.220> want<00:04:38.340> to

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
over to to fireworks that you want to

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.850 
over to to fireworks that you want to
show<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.870> how<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.990> easily<00:04:40.140> create<00:04:40.500> something

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
show you how to easily create something

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.260 
show you how to easily create something
like<00:04:41.070> this<00:04:42.620> so<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:44.310> container<00:04:44.670> let's<00:04:45.090> say

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
like this so the container let's say

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.970 
like this so the container let's say
whatever<00:04:45.660> your<00:04:45.930> you're<00:04:46.230> designing<00:04:46.680> whether

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
whatever your you're designing whether

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.950 
whatever your you're designing whether
it's<00:04:47.160> a<00:04:47.220> button<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.760> container<00:04:48.390> of<00:04:48.480> background

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
it's a button a container of background

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.980 
it's a button a container of background
container<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.440> house<00:04:50.390> some<00:04:51.390> some

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
container of the house some some

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.770 
container of the house some some
information<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:53.790> when<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.150> first<00:04:54.270> design<00:04:54.630> it

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
information you when you first design it

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.990 
information you when you first design it
you'll<00:04:54.900> start<00:04:55.110> off<00:04:55.170> with<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.350> box<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.890> you<00:04:56.820> add

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
you'll start off with a box and you add

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.040 
you'll start off with a box and you add
a<00:04:57.030> nice<00:04:57.300> gradient<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.960> it<00:04:59.240> okay<00:05:00.240> now<00:05:00.720> this<00:05:00.990> is

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
a nice gradient to it okay now this is

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.200 
a nice gradient to it okay now this is
what<00:05:01.320> I<00:05:01.350> would<00:05:01.590> consider<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:02.160> hard<00:05:02.790> gradient

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
what I would consider a hard gradient

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.500 
what I would consider a hard gradient
where<00:05:03.390> you<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:04.440> have<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.800> dark<00:05:05.220> color<00:05:05.510> that

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
where you you have a dark color that

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.280 
where you you have a dark color that
blends<00:05:06.810> into<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.790> very<00:05:08.790> high<00:05:09.450> contrast<00:05:10.020> light

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
blends into a very high contrast light

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.070 
blends into a very high contrast light
color<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:11.310> it's<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.520> dark<00:05:11.790> gray<00:05:12.000> so<00:05:12.600> what<00:05:13.050> I

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
color so it's a dark gray so what I

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.690 
color so it's a dark gray so what I
would<00:05:13.170> recommend<00:05:13.410> is<00:05:13.830> going<00:05:14.130> with<00:05:14.280> more<00:05:14.520> of<00:05:14.580> a

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
would recommend is going with more of a

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.200 
would recommend is going with more of a
soft<00:05:15.000> gradient<00:05:15.480> where<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:17.220> dark<00:05:17.550> color<00:05:17.850> is

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
soft gradient where the dark color is

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.880 
soft gradient where the dark color is
actually<00:05:19.170> light<00:05:20.240> something<00:05:21.240> like<00:05:21.360> that<00:05:21.890> so

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
actually light something like that so

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.150 
actually light something like that so
that<00:05:23.100> it's<00:05:23.340> actually<00:05:23.520> a<00:05:23.730> subtle<00:05:24.330> transition

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
that it's actually a subtle transition

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.330 
that it's actually a subtle transition
it's<00:05:26.160> a<00:05:26.250> soft<00:05:26.640> transition<00:05:27.420> so<00:05:28.110> in<00:05:29.010> this<00:05:29.130> case

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
it's a soft transition so in this case

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.940 
it's a soft transition so in this case
i'm<00:05:29.520> using<00:05:29.550> a<00:05:29.850> gray<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.540> know<00:05:30.690> but<00:05:31.020> any<00:05:31.680> color

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
i'm using a gray you know but any color

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.620 
i'm using a gray you know but any color
would<00:05:32.100> do<00:05:32.250> any<00:05:32.570> light<00:05:33.570> color<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:35.180> then<00:05:36.180> the

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
would do any light color and then the

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.190 
would do any light color and then the
border<00:05:37.080> around<00:05:37.320> your<00:05:37.770> container<00:05:38.220> i<00:05:39.200> say

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
border around your container i say

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.460 
border around your container i say
should<00:05:40.680> be<00:05:40.890> a<00:05:41.330> few<00:05:42.330> shades<00:05:42.750> darker<00:05:42.930> than<00:05:43.260> the

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
should be a few shades darker than the

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.840 
should be a few shades darker than the
darkest<00:05:43.800> color<00:05:44.010> of<00:05:44.220> your<00:05:44.730> gradient<00:05:46.700> in<00:05:47.700> this

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
darkest color of your gradient in this

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.150 
darkest color of your gradient in this
case<00:05:48.120> i<00:05:48.300> have<00:05:48.420> a<00:05:49.310> have<00:05:50.310> a<00:05:51.860> light<00:05:52.860> gray<00:05:53.130> color

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
case i have a have a light gray color

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.740 
case i have a have a light gray color
here<00:05:53.850> so<00:05:54.030> i'm<00:05:54.120> going<00:05:54.240> to<00:05:54.300> go<00:05:54.360> with<00:05:54.480> a<00:05:54.570> little

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
here so i'm going to go with a little

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.060 
here so i'm going to go with a little
 darker<00:05:55.530> shade<00:05:55.820> border<00:05:57.050> alright<00:05:58.070> so

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
 darker shade border alright so

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.130 
 darker shade border alright so
that's<00:05:59.160> pretty<00:05:59.370> much<00:05:59.460> it<00:05:59.670> let's<00:05:59.880> just<00:06:00.060> let<00:06:01.020> me

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
that's pretty much it let's just let me

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.900 
that's pretty much it let's just let me
go<00:06:01.320> over<00:06:01.350> to<00:06:01.710> ice-locked<00:06:02.220> photo<00:06:02.520> i'm<00:06:02.700> going<00:06:02.850> to

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
go over to ice-locked photo i'm going to

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
talking about so let's say you're making

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.740 
talking about so let's say you're making
a<00:06:16.380> container<00:06:16.800> for<00:06:19.370> for<00:06:20.370> you<00:06:20.700> know<00:06:20.850> sport

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
a container for for you know sport

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.110 
a container for for you know sport
categories

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:35.640 

you<00:06:28.120> see<00:06:28.389> so<00:06:32.099> so<00:06:33.099> here's<00:06:33.520> a<00:06:33.610> nice<00:06:33.849> soft<00:06:34.650> nice

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
you see so so here's a nice soft nice

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.629 
you see so so here's a nice soft nice
polished<00:06:36.189> box<00:06:36.460> if<00:06:36.999> you<00:06:37.180> if<00:06:37.930> we<00:06:38.439> do<00:06:39.219> the<00:06:39.370> same

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
polished box if you if we do the same

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:44.249 
polished box if you if we do the same
box<00:06:39.939> and<00:06:40.300> not<00:06:40.479> have<00:06:40.779> the<00:06:40.960> gradient<00:06:43.020> let's<00:06:44.020> do

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:44.259 
box and not have the gradient let's do

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:47.989 
box and not have the gradient let's do
is<00:06:44.499> just<00:06:45.129> a<00:06:45.370> gray<00:06:45.729> if<00:06:46.629> you<00:06:47.080> look<00:06:47.199> at<00:06:47.319> these<00:06:47.469> two

00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:47.999 
is just a gray if you look at these two

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:50.249 
is just a gray if you look at these two
you<00:06:48.999> notice<00:06:49.300> the<00:06:49.389> difference<00:06:49.749> this<00:06:49.870> one<00:06:50.050> on

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
you notice the difference this one on

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:53.249 
you notice the difference this one on
the<00:06:50.409> on<00:06:50.560> the<00:06:50.590> left<00:06:50.889> is<00:06:51.099> more<00:06:51.580> polished<00:06:52.060> and<00:06:52.300> all

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259 
the on the left is more polished and all

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:55.290 
the on the left is more polished and all
all<00:06:53.590> we<00:06:53.740> did<00:06:53.889> was<00:06:53.949> add<00:06:54.279> a<00:06:54.310> soft<00:06:54.639> gradient<00:06:55.180> and

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
all we did was add a soft gradient and

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.420 
all we did was add a soft gradient and
the<00:06:55.749> one<00:06:55.870> on<00:06:55.960> the<00:06:56.020> right<00:06:56.080> is<00:06:56.409> a<00:06:56.770> solid<00:06:57.249> color

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
the one on the right is a solid color

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.429 
the one on the right is a solid color
and<00:06:57.729> it<00:06:58.539> doesn't<00:06:58.749> matter<00:06:58.900> which<00:06:59.020> color<00:06:59.319> you

00:06:59.429 --> 00:06:59.439 
and it doesn't matter which color you

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:04.670 
and it doesn't matter which color you
choose<00:06:59.889> is<00:07:00.250> just<00:07:01.289> does<00:07:02.289> it<00:07:02.409> give<00:07:02.560> you<00:07:02.590> the<00:07:02.860> same

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
choose is just does it give you the same

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.189 
choose is just does it give you the same
doesn't<00:07:05.680> give<00:07:05.919> you<00:07:06.009> the<00:07:06.039> same<00:07:06.479> effect<00:07:07.479> that

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 
doesn't give you the same effect that

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.570 
doesn't give you the same effect that
agreement<00:07:10.169> that<00:07:11.169> agreeing<00:07:11.650> gives<00:07:11.889> you<00:07:12.039> you

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
agreement that agreeing gives you you

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.600 
agreement that agreeing gives you you
know<00:07:12.699> so<00:07:13.229> point<00:07:14.229> is<00:07:14.409> go<00:07:14.889> with<00:07:15.039> the<00:07:15.129> gradient

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.610 
know so point is go with the gradient

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.909 
know so point is go with the gradient
use<00:07:16.479> the<00:07:16.599> gradient<00:07:16.779> you<00:07:17.379> know<00:07:17.529> on<00:07:17.770> your

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 
use the gradient you know on your

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.309 
use the gradient you know on your
website<00:07:18.310> in<00:07:18.520> different<00:07:18.909> places<00:07:19.089> and<00:07:19.389> it<00:07:20.139> would

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 
website in different places and it would
