00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
improve profile this season but very

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.300 
improve profile this season but very
similar<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:19.350> saw<00:00:19.529> last<00:00:19.770> season

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
similar to what we saw last season

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.300 
similar to what we saw last season
it's<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.060> extremely<00:00:22.050> full<00:00:22.529> profile<00:00:23.100> back

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it's that extremely full profile back

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.390 
it's that extremely full profile back
there<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:24.269> little<00:00:24.720> bit<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.019> Tim<00:00:25.650> has<00:00:25.800> been<00:00:25.949> taken

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
there a little bit of Tim has been taken

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.290 
there a little bit of Tim has been taken
away<00:00:26.490> up<00:00:27.090> here<00:00:27.449> near<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> edges<00:00:29.300> basically

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
away up here near the edges basically

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.930 
away up here near the edges basically
because<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:31.320> wasted<00:00:31.920> space<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.399> don't<00:00:32.669> need

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
because it's wasted space you don't need

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
because it's wasted space you don't need
it<00:00:33.090> there<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:33.840> put<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.260> right<00:00:34.500> into<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
it there and they put it right into the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.000 
it there and they put it right into the
guts<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> bat<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:35.700> quite<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.420> large

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
guts to the bat so it's quite a large

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.490 
guts to the bat so it's quite a large
bat<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.820> got<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> huge<00:00:39.690> swell<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.379> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
bat here it's got a huge swell as you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.470 
bat here it's got a huge swell as you
can<00:00:40.649> probably<00:00:40.829> see<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.969> does<00:00:42.149> extend

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
can probably see and it does extend

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.229 
can probably see and it does extend
quite<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> fair<00:00:43.379> way<00:00:43.530> down<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.700> standard

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
quite a fair way down so it's a standard

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.920 
quite a fair way down so it's a standard
middle<00:00:45.570> bat<00:00:46.520> if<00:00:47.520> anything<00:00:48.059> slightly<00:00:48.360> lower<00:00:48.690> so

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
middle bat if anything slightly lower so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.260 
middle bat if anything slightly lower so
I<00:00:48.960> guess<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.260> could<00:00:49.410> call<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.710> mid<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.730> middle

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
I guess you could call it mid to middle

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.569 
I guess you could call it mid to middle
low<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> slightly<00:00:52.949> lower<00:00:53.250> side

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
low so it is on the slightly lower side

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.069 
low so it is on the slightly lower side
of<00:00:53.699> things<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> that's<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.570> due<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> that

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
of things and that's just due to that

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.220 
of things and that's just due to that
large<00:00:55.379> swell<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.129> huge<00:00:57.059> peak<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.600> travels<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
large swell and huge peak that travels a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.099 
large swell and huge peak that travels a
long<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:59.100> along<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.489> bat<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.840> brilliant

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
long way along this bat it's a brilliant

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.020 
long way along this bat it's a brilliant
shave<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.739> feels<00:01:01.949> fantastic<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> hand

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
shave it feels fantastic in the hand

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.990 
shave it feels fantastic in the hand

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
bats that we'd ever seen so that's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.880 
bats that we'd ever seen so that's
saying<00:01:36.570> something<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:37.350> will<00:01:37.470> give<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> bit

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
saying something we will give it a bit

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.679 
saying something we will give it a bit
of<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> whack<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.270> hear<00:01:39.479> where<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
of a whack now so you can hear where the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.319 
of a whack now so you can hear where the
center<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.490> said<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:41.939> expect

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
center is and as we said you can expect

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.600 
center is and as we said you can expect
that<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.659> slightly<00:01:43.290> lower<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:44.369> because

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that to be slightly lower just because

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.219 
that to be slightly lower just because
of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> large<00:01:45.030> profile<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> peak<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.140> of

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
of the large profile and the peak out of
