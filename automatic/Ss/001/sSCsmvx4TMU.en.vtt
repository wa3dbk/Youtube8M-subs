cloud nine is going to take this i think

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.310 
cloud nine is going to take this i think
that<00:00:32.399> mythic<00:00:32.759> underperform<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.809> tournament

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that mythic underperform this tournament

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.110 
that mythic underperform this tournament
against<00:00:34.860> torqued<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.110> later

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
against torqued but that is for later

percent<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:51.870> really<00:00:52.079> worth<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
percent is not really worth it if you

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.650

towards<00:01:11.159> performance<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.360> very

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
towards performance in the very

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.350 
towards performance in the very
beginning<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> tournament<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.119> said<00:01:15.119> that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
beginning of the tournament I said that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.710 
beginning of the tournament I said that
that<00:01:16.290> they're<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> lose<00:01:17.009> 22<00:01:17.490> mythic<00:01:18.030> but

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that they're going to lose 22 mythic but

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.899 
that they're going to lose 22 mythic but
no<00:01:19.470> tort<00:01:19.799> turned<00:01:20.189> out<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.580> at<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> top

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909

three<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.689> three<00:01:21.720> nothing<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:23.009> groups<00:01:23.670> ages

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
three with three nothing in groups ages

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.980

so<00:01:24.770> tote<00:01:25.770> has<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.729> shown<00:01:27.390> themselves<00:01:27.600> this

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
so tote has really shown themselves this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.109 
so tote has really shown themselves this
tournament<00:01:28.409> liquid<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.490> also<00:01:29.670> great

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
tournament liquid they are also great

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.569 
tournament liquid they are also great
team<00:01:30.360> they<00:01:30.710> didn't<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.770> beat<00:01:31.920> by<00:01:32.100> cloud<00:01:32.340> nine

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
team they didn't get beat by cloud nine

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.450 
team they didn't get beat by cloud nine
unfortunately<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:34.500> finish<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.189> in

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
unfortunately but they finish to one in

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.240 
unfortunately but they finish to one in
the<00:01:35.579> group<00:01:35.729> stages<00:01:36.470> behind<00:01:37.470> called<00:01:38.009> nine

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the group stages behind called nine

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.480 
the group stages behind called nine
above<00:01:38.750> safaricom<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> 50-50<00:01:41.310> match

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.280 
that liquid is a there a lot more
prepared<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> team<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.149> torqued<00:01:54.570> although

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
prepared as a team then torqued although

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.429 
prepared as a team then torqued although
toe<00:01:55.470> did<00:01:55.710> finish<00:01:56.659> first<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.020> group<00:01:58.259> with

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
toe did finish first in a group with

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.200 
toe did finish first in a group with
three<00:01:58.740> nothing<00:01:59.100> but<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.549> my<00:01:59.790> opinion<00:01:59.880> that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
three nothing but in my opinion that

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.209 
three nothing but in my opinion that
their<00:02:00.689> group<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.229> actually<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.649> little<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:02.040> a

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
their group is actually a little bit a

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.170 
their group is actually a little bit a
little<00:02:02.520> bit<00:02:02.820> um<00:02:03.119> weaker<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.320> liquid<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
little bit um weaker so liquid is the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.639 
little bit um weaker so liquid is the
winner<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.659> match<00:02:06.930> cloud<00:02:07.350> nine<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.619> a
