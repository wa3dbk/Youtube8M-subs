the change is up and down reasonably

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:17.520 
the change is up and down reasonably
well<00:01:11.190> as<00:01:12.190> you<00:01:12.310> expect<00:01:12.760> for<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.930> ass<00:01:14.020> mileage

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.740 

once<00:01:18.160> you<00:01:18.280> get<00:01:18.400> past<00:01:18.640> second<00:01:19.030> gear<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.450> so<00:01:19.630> the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
once you get past second gear it so the

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.300 
once you get past second gear it so the
change<00:01:20.050> course<00:01:20.320> is<00:01:20.470> okay<00:01:20.800> if<00:01:20.860> it's<00:01:21.040> really

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
change course is okay if it's really

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.270 
change course is okay if it's really
just<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.640> first<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.780> second<00:01:23.170> change<00:01:23.440> you<00:01:24.130> have

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
just that first a second change you have

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.540 
just that first a second change you have
also<00:01:24.460> got<00:01:24.850> may<00:01:25.840> be<00:01:25.900> out<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.170> here<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.830> in

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
also got may be out of here it in the in

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.460 
also got may be out of here it in the in
the<00:01:27.640> background<00:01:28.030> just<00:01:28.210> as<00:01:28.900> speed<00:01:29.290> increases

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
the background just as speed increases

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.510 
the background just as speed increases
we've<00:01:30.070> got<00:01:30.220> our<00:01:30.400> sort<00:01:30.610> of<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.990> fairly<00:01:32.920> deep<00:01:33.160> wine

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
we've got our sort of a fairly deep wine

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.100 
we've got our sort of a fairly deep wine
which<00:01:33.820> I<00:01:33.970> think<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.390> wheelbarrow<00:01:34.900> in<00:01:35.020> at

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
which I think is that wheelbarrow in at

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.630 
which I think is that wheelbarrow in at
the<00:01:35.170> back<00:01:35.350> but<00:01:35.800> I<00:01:35.830> can't<00:01:36.100> be<00:01:36.190> hundred<00:01:36.430> percent

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
the back but I can't be hundred percent

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.600 
the back but I can't be hundred percent
sure<00:01:37.530> there's<00:01:38.530> not<00:01:38.710> really<00:01:38.920> anything<00:01:39.190> else<00:01:39.369> at

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
sure there's not really anything else at

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:48.920 
sure there's not really anything else at
the<00:01:39.729> back<00:01:39.940> or<00:01:40.119> Caesar<00:01:40.710> front-wheel<00:01:41.710> drive

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 

so<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.620> hard<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.800> say<00:01:49.980> if<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.370> know

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
so it's hard to say if you can be a know

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.960 
so it's hard to say if you can be a know
something<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> wheel<00:01:51.090> bearing<00:01:51.420> but<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:52.970> say

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
something the wheel bearing but to say

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.200 
something the wheel bearing but to say
slide<00:01:54.360> some<00:01:55.610> bumbling<00:01:56.610> wishing<00:01:56.910> may<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.090> out

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
slide some bumbling wishing may be out

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.930 
slide some bumbling wishing may be out
of<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.740> in<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.830> background<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.550> shut

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
of here in the in the background I shut

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:09.660 
of here in the in the background I shut
up<00:01:59.970> for<00:02:00.180> her
