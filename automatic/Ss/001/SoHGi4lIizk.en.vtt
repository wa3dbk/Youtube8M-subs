00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.319
 in Santa Catarina and Parana in the south of Brazil the serious degradation of 

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:24.599
 soils in the last two decades left farmers unable to 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:25.899
 of lesson 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.899
 jose looking for a solution jose left the field 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.420
 roland risto began testing with the zero tillage system more than 20 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.530
 years 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.870
 is considered a pioneer of conservation agriculture 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.560
 with an investment budget 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.540
 a successor 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.250
 overview of the entity said there was a lot of work then happened in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.890
 big 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.420
 and cultivating the congress can do 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.120
 erosion takes all the capacity has not been easy we have continued with the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.880
 traditional system but and here it would be all dry like a desert the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.879
 structure would have more than northern stones 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.190
 Soil cover is the key 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.050
 also cultivating between harvest harvest protects the soil of the 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.220
 Harmful effects of heavy rain from the sun and wind 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.420
 it provides nutrients and facilitates the infiltration of water by reducing 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 the compaction 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.890
 integrating the livestock of francisca city skiing skiing save money in the 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.900
 feeding their cows and the novelty of stopping the land for the next 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.900
 harvest 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.370
 its integrated management of resources that includes pig farming and fish farming 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.160
 Perez and CÃ­a the quality of the local water supply 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.460
 this farm is a model of ecological recycling 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.530
 i is not silly useful because it is our moment 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.950
 not in vain his property we are calm because now we have water 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.360
 lanterns the farm so the animal waste that carries the hudson river 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.259
 Luis Moor and a lot 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.879
 all of us have on a farm but we do not forget the peace they also assume 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.159
 a disorder 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.079
 the parking authority 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.579
 Regarding traditional agriculture, direct sowing requires less work and 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.169
 it's more economical 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:28.549
 the elimination of tillage reduces machinery and fuel costs and 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.499
 the floor covering also reduces the need for expensive products 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.579
 chemical 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.739
 the harvest or even increases in dry periods since the quality of the 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.739
 soil and water infiltration improves 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.680
 it was time to witness the act 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.399
 and also corn and 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:54.809
 with the direct planting if this trend now occurs more than 2010 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.079
 he also tells you 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.120
 conti world 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.440
 and not in a match I do not have the exact sanitary figure in this production 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.650
 he commented there is a 30 or 40% of colombi 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.359
 world 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.389
 30% of this month 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.389
 Press release 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.739
 the free time gained thanks to conservation agriculture allows 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.430
 diversify production 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.430
 and supplement the income of families 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.029
 Products such as sugar or jam are sold throughout the year 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.849
 allowing financial security for small-scale farmers 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.989
 here sustainable agriculture is a reality 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.719
 the organization of the united nations for agriculture and food 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:49.879
 is already promoting this same approach in Africa and central Asia 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.659
 I believe that this film about conservation 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.859
 Believe can really solve the problem d 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.329
 of food security 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.849
 it is a very valuable tool to fight poverty 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:11.229
 in many families of southern Brazil this battle has been defeated 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.259
 taking full advantage of natural resources and leaving the 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:16.549
 nature continues its course
