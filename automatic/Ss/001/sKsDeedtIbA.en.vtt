quick here um I know yesterday I had
just<00:00:23.340> finished<00:00:23.490> putting<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> motor<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
just finished putting the motor and the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.660 
just finished putting the motor and the
transmission<00:00:25.050> back<00:00:25.410> together<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.340> axial

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
transmission back together on the axial

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.599 
transmission back together on the axial
scx10<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.650> also<00:00:28.949> told<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.460> guys

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
scx10 and I know I also told you guys

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.640 
scx10 and I know I also told you guys
that<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.240> will<00:00:30.359> show<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.720> my<00:00:30.960> little<00:00:31.199> technique

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
that I will show you my little technique

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.350 
that I will show you my little technique
on<00:00:31.890> how<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.130> mesh<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> gears<00:00:32.820> between<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
on how to mesh the gears between the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.350 
on how to mesh the gears between the
pinion<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> spur<00:00:34.200> gear<00:00:34.940> it's<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.090> quick

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
pinion and the spur gear it's a quick

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
pinion and the spur gear it's a quick
simple<00:00:36.690> little<00:00:37.110> trick<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:38.040> always

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219

here we have the spur gear and the
pinion<00:00:51.449> gear<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> motor<00:00:52.230> okay<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
pinion gear on the motor okay so the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.850 
pinion gear on the motor okay so the
first<00:00:54.390> thing<00:00:54.570> I'm<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.680> I'm<00:00:55.770> going

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
line paper okay I'm going to rip a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:13.960 
line paper okay I'm going to rip a
section<00:01:03.960> off<00:01:10.580> just<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.990> nothing<00:01:12.990> big

doesn't really matter but the thickness
of<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> paper<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:19.380> actually<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> perfect

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
of this paper is actually a perfect

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.249 
of this paper is actually a perfect
thickness<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> gears<00:01:21.840> actually

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
thickness for what the gears actually

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.850 
thickness for what the gears actually
need<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.350> gonna<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.560> pretty<00:01:25.710> much

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
in between two gears

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.639 
in between two gears
I<00:01:43.320> must<00:01:44.130> spin<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> spur<00:01:44.670> gear<00:01:45.229> or<00:01:46.229> any<00:01:46.439> motor

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649

let's<00:02:35.990> see<00:02:38.020> yeah<00:02:39.020> that<00:02:39.650> did<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:40.430> fine<00:02:42.790> so

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
let's see yeah that did it just fine so

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.550 
let's see yeah that did it just fine so
any<00:02:43.940> old<00:02:44.120> line<00:02:44.300> paper<00:02:44.600> usually<00:02:45.200> will<00:02:45.530> work<00:02:47.560> if

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
any old line paper usually will work if

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.070 
any old line paper usually will work if
you<00:02:48.740> look<00:02:48.950> at<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.520> it<00:02:50.240> still<00:02:50.600> seems<00:02:50.930> a

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
you look at it and it still seems a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.340 
you look at it and it still seems a
little<00:02:51.320> bit<00:02:51.440> closer<00:02:52.360> loosen<00:02:53.360> up<00:02:53.630> one<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.230> the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
little bit closer loosen up one of the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.940 
little bit closer loosen up one of the
screws<00:02:55.600> turn<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.780> other<00:02:56.930> screw<00:02:57.230> just<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.530> hair

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
screws turn the other screw just a hair

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.870 
screws turn the other screw just a hair
okay<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.970> just<00:02:59.860> slowly<00:03:00.860> move<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.280> motor<00:03:01.610> just

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
okay and just slowly move the motor just

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.840 
okay and just slowly move the motor just
a<00:03:02.600> little<00:03:02.990> bit<00:03:03.110> away<00:03:03.200> okay<00:03:03.800> I<00:03:04.010> mean<00:03:04.370> just<00:03:04.610> just

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
a little bit away okay I mean just just

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.320 
a little bit away okay I mean just just
minor<00:03:05.120> if<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.840> comes<00:03:06.170> down<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:07.240> look<00:03:08.240> at

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
minor if it comes down to it look at

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.900 
minor if it comes down to it look at
that<00:03:08.360> because<00:03:08.600> that's<00:03:08.750> kind<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:08.990> blinding<00:03:09.320> it

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
that because that's kind of blinding it

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.420 
that because that's kind of blinding it
so<00:03:12.730> 90%<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.850> time<00:03:14.000> I'll<00:03:14.150> say<00:03:14.390> this<00:03:14.840> works

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
so 90% of the time I'll say this works

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.610 
so 90% of the time I'll say this works
some<00:03:16.430> papers<00:03:16.820> are<00:03:17.060> thicker<00:03:17.570> than<00:03:17.810> others<00:03:18.110> so

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
some papers are thicker than others so

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.780 
some papers are thicker than others so
you<00:03:18.709> need<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.920> be<00:03:19.010> careful<00:03:19.160> about<00:03:19.550> that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
you need to be careful about that

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.710 
you need to be careful about that
um<00:03:21.700> but<00:03:22.700> for<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:22.940> most<00:03:23.060> part<00:03:23.150> line<00:03:23.480> paper

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
um but for the most part line paper

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.650 
um but for the most part line paper
seems<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.230> work<00:03:24.380> well<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.910> there<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.480> have<00:03:26.510> it
