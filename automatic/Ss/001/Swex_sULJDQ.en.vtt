the metal down taking off the wells the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.230 
the metal down taking off the wells the
spot<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.220> tough

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
spot was tough

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.390 
spot was tough
the<00:01:37.110> primer<00:01:37.350> had<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> go<00:01:37.800> down<00:01:38.090> inside<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.390> old

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
the primer had to go down inside the old

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.899 
the primer had to go down inside the old
channel<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.300> prevents<00:01:42.830> more<00:01:43.830> rust<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.520> when
