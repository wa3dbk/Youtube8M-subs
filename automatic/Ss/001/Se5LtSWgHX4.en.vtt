00:00:01.653 --> 00:00:04.312
 The Volturi are the closest thing to royalty in my world 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.104
 They make the rules in force 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:08.028
 Do vampires have laws? 

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:14.699
 You are a human who knows too much about us 

00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:16.130
 They can kill us all 

00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:20.465
 You do not belong to my world, Bella 

00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:21.700
 I belong to you 

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:24.281
 This is the last time you'll see me 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.584
 Please, promise that you will not do anything reckless 

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:32.002
 His absence is in every place I see 

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:36.973
 It's like a big hole compressed in my chest 

00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:42.522
 I know what he did to you 

00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:45.910
 But Bella, I never, I would never do that to you 

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:50.411
 I only know one way to see it 

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.846
 So now you're addicted to adrenaline? 

00:00:56.753 --> 00:00:59.067
 If I need to rush into danger to see it ... 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:00.784
 ... then that is what I will do 

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:14.191
 What the hell were you thinking? 

00:01:15.644 --> 00:01:17.410
 From the world bestseller 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.894
 Bella, it's Edward! Think you're dead! 

00:01:18.894 --> 00:01:19.660
 What? 

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:21.597
 It was with the Volturi 

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:23.805
 He wants to die too 

00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:27.394
 I leave you Bella, I did not want you anymore 

00:01:28.708 --> 00:01:30.910
 Please, stay here, for me 

00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:32.253
 I have to go 

00:01:35.097 --> 00:01:36.381
 You are going to make a scene 

00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:40.022
 The Volturi will kill him if he shows up in the sunlight 

00:01:40.653 --> 00:01:41.944
 Not Edward! Do not! 

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:44.087
 The girl comes with us 

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:46.106
 You can go to hell 

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:47.896
 Edward, I'm scared 

00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:49.803
 On November 20 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.850
 The next chapter 

00:01:56.943 --> 00:01:57.974
 Starts 

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:16.616
 The Twilight Saga: New Moon 

00:02:18.165 --> 00:02:19.208
 This is going to hurt a bit 

00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:21.079
 Do not! Please! Please! 

00:02:23.228 --> 00:02:25.307
