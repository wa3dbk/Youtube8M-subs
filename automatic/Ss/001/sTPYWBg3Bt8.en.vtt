00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
this one you can actually see the glass

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.310 
this one you can actually see the glass
inside<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.770> one<00:01:34.070> it's<00:01:34.750> totally<00:01:35.750> disappeared

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
inside this one it's totally disappeared

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.200 
inside this one it's totally disappeared
to<00:01:37.190> show<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.400> that<00:01:37.580> it's<00:01:37.700> still<00:01:37.910> there<00:01:38.090> I'm

to show you that it's still there I'm
going<00:01:38.330> to<00:01:38.420> take<00:01:38.600> this<00:01:38.750> screw<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:40.960> place<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:42.140> in

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
going to take this screw and place it in

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.510 
going to take this screw and place it in
there<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:48.050> reason<00:01:48.200> I'm<00:01:48.470> showing<00:01:48.680> you<00:01:48.890> this<00:01:49.070> is

there the reason I'm showing you this is

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.400 
there the reason I'm showing you this is
that<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.270> first<00:01:50.509> one<00:01:50.690> I'm<00:01:50.780> going<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:50.990> do<00:01:51.170> is

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
that the first one I'm going to do is

00:01:51.410 --> 00:02:02.969 
that the first one I'm going to do is
clear<00:01:52.280> water<00:01:52.810> behind<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.960> black<00:01:54.170> surface

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.770 

see<00:02:03.520> we<00:02:03.640> get<00:02:03.789> a<00:02:03.820> little<00:02:04.000> bit<00:02:04.149> of<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.360> focal<00:02:04.750> point

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
see we get a little bit of a focal point

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.740 
see we get a little bit of a focal point
but<00:02:05.110> nothing<00:02:05.439> really<00:02:05.560> seems<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:05.950> happen<00:02:06.750> now

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
but nothing really seems to happen now

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.749 
but nothing really seems to happen now
I'm<00:02:08.019> going<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.229> be<00:02:08.349> taking<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:09.310> one<00:02:09.489> with<00:02:09.670> the

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
I'm going to be taking the one with the

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:27.790 
I'm going to be taking the one with the
mineral<00:02:10.090> oil<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:13.090> putting<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.510> up<00:02:13.629> there

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.040 

it<00:02:28.160> instantly<00:02:28.850> burns<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.540> spot

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.570 

when<00:02:36.050> these<00:02:36.200> two<00:02:36.440> candleholders<00:02:37.160> filled<00:02:37.430> with

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
when these two candleholders filled with

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.510 
when these two candleholders filled with
fluids<00:02:38.030> sit<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.110> their<00:02:39.260> natural<00:02:39.440> position<00:02:39.800> the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
fluids sit in their natural position the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.160 
fluids sit in their natural position the
one<00:02:40.700> with<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.940> mineral<00:02:41.300> oil<00:02:41.480> burns<00:02:41.900> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
one with the mineral oil burns the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.990 
one with the mineral oil burns the
plastic<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.710> lot<00:02:42.890> faster<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.610> one<00:02:43.760> with<00:02:43.880> the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
plastic a lot faster the one with the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.820 
plastic a lot faster the one with the
water<00:02:44.210> eventually<00:02:44.840> does<00:02:45.050> create<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> small

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
water eventually does create a small

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.630 
water eventually does create a small
hole<00:02:46.130> in<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.310> plastic<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:48.830> is<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.040> four<00:02:49.400> foot

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
hole in the plastic this is a four foot

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.160 
hole in the plastic this is a four foot
long<00:02:49.880> piece<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.360> glass<00:02:50.630> pyrex<00:02:50.959> tubing<00:02:51.650> I

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.010 
in sealed with regular tape I allowed
time<00:03:04.280> for<00:03:04.610> all<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.880> bubbles<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.450> rise<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.900> the

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
time for all the bubbles to rise to the

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.089 
time for all the bubbles to rise to the
top<00:03:06.200> then<00:03:06.500> sealed<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.010> other<00:03:07.190> end<00:03:07.520> with<00:03:07.700> tape

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.429 

so<00:03:14.099> this<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.459> relatively<00:03:15.209> sunny<00:03:15.480> area<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.260> I

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
so this is a relatively sunny area and I

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.670

happen<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:16.920> have<00:03:17.189> a<00:03:17.519> hole<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.390> our<00:03:19.170> wall<00:03:19.230> right

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
happen to have a hole in our wall right

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.850 
happen to have a hole in our wall right
there<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.870> goes<00:03:22.079> all<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.439> way<00:03:22.709> through<00:03:24.860> I'm

going to stick the glass tube in this

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.039 
going to stick the glass tube in this
concrete<00:03:32.280> hole<00:03:35.209> you<00:03:36.209> can<00:03:36.359> see<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.689> it<00:03:36.810> lights

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
concrete hole you can see that it lights

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.050 
concrete hole you can see that it lights
