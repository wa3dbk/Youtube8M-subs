00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
to her so Michael let's start with the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.020 
to her so Michael let's start with the
basics<00:01:13.899> what<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.320> torque<00:01:14.619> anyway<00:01:14.950> well<00:01:15.790> Rose

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
basics what is torque anyway well Rose

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.660 
basics what is torque anyway well Rose
torque<00:01:16.540> is<00:01:16.810> just<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.259> twisting<00:01:17.740> force<00:01:18.070> that

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
torque is just the twisting force that

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.120 
torque is just the twisting force that
propels<00:01:18.880> all<00:01:19.570> vehicles<00:01:20.170> it's<00:01:20.590> as<00:01:20.770> simple<00:01:20.800> as

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
propels all vehicles it's as simple as

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.219 
propels all vehicles it's as simple as
that<00:01:21.190> so<00:01:21.970> when<00:01:22.090> you<00:01:22.210> step<00:01:22.420> on<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.600> gas<00:01:22.810> what

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
that so when you step on the gas what

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.609 
that so when you step on the gas what
moves<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:23.860> is<00:01:24.700> toy<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.960> tell<00:01:26.200> me<00:01:26.229> what<00:01:26.440> are<00:01:26.530> the

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
moves you is toy so tell me what are the

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.670 
moves you is toy so tell me what are the
benefits<00:01:26.800> of<00:01:27.190> having<00:01:27.700> torque<00:01:28.119> well<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:29.440> more

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
benefits of having torque well the more

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.490 
benefits of having torque well the more
torque<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.130> have<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:31.060> more<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:31.509> can<00:01:31.660> pull<00:01:32.080> or

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
torque you have the more you can pull or

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.139 
torque you have the more you can pull or
the<00:01:32.560> more<00:01:32.860> you<00:01:32.979> can<00:01:33.100> accelerate<00:01:33.520> or<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.970> more

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
the more you can accelerate or the more

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.660 
the more you can accelerate or the more
you<00:01:34.270> can<00:01:34.420> pass<00:01:34.780> things<00:01:35.170> because<00:01:35.710> torque<00:01:36.100> is

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
you can pass things because torque is

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.670 
you can pass things because torque is
just<00:01:37.119> another<00:01:37.360> word<00:01:37.540> for<00:01:37.600> power<00:01:38.020> so<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.500> more

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
just another word for power so the more

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.330 
just another word for power so the more
power<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:38.979> have<00:01:39.310> in<00:01:39.580> most<00:01:40.090> instances<00:01:40.649> that<00:01:41.649> ok

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
power you have in most instances that ok

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.600 
power you have in most instances that ok
so<00:01:42.850> does<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:44.080> have<00:01:44.410> make<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.740> difference<00:01:45.250> if<00:01:45.520> you

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
so does it have make a difference if you

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.580 
so does it have make a difference if you
have<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.150> car<00:01:46.570> or<00:01:46.750> truck<00:01:46.960> as<00:01:47.140> you<00:01:47.229> mentioned<00:01:47.560> the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
have a car or truck as you mentioned the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.350 
have a car or truck as you mentioned the
word<00:01:47.740> pooling<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.400> when<00:01:48.729> I<00:01:48.820> hear<00:01:49.030> pulling

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
word pooling and I when I hear pulling

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.410 
word pooling and I when I hear pulling
it<00:01:49.479> I'm<00:01:49.690> thinking<00:01:50.049> truck<00:01:50.290> um<00:01:51.180> everything<00:01:52.180> has

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
it I'm thinking truck um everything has

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.899 
it I'm thinking truck um everything has
torque<00:01:52.810> cars<00:01:53.560> have<00:01:53.830> torque<00:01:54.159> trucks<00:01:54.670> have

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
torque cars have torque trucks have

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.350 
torque cars have torque trucks have
torque<00:01:55.270> lawn<00:01:56.229> mowers<00:01:56.590> have<00:01:56.860> torque

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
torque lawn mowers have torque

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.480 
torque lawn mowers have torque
everything<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.540> has<00:01:58.689> a<00:01:58.720> motor<00:01:59.049> has<00:01:59.530> torn<00:01:59.979> so

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
everything that has a motor has torn so

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.490 
everything that has a motor has torn so
it<00:02:00.610> just<00:02:00.790> depends<00:02:01.119> on<00:02:01.330> what<00:02:01.869> your<00:02:02.020> needs<00:02:02.049> are

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
it just depends on what your needs are

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.340 
it just depends on what your needs are
how<00:02:02.920> much<00:02:03.130> torque<00:02:03.540> okay<00:02:04.540> so<00:02:04.600> my<00:02:04.990> next<00:02:05.260> question

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
how much torque okay so my next question

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.620 
how much torque okay so my next question
I<00:02:05.770> guess<00:02:05.979> would<00:02:06.130> be<00:02:06.189> how<00:02:06.939> important<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:07.600> it

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
I guess would be how important is it

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.479 
I guess would be how important is it
when<00:02:07.900> I'm<00:02:08.019> buying<00:02:08.290> a<00:02:08.410> vehicle<00:02:08.530> how<00:02:09.070> important

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
when I'm buying a vehicle how important

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.670 
when I'm buying a vehicle how important
is<00:02:09.670> torque<00:02:10.090> what<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:10.720> have<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.989> decide<00:02:11.350> is

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
is torque what you have to decide is

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.820 
is torque what you have to decide is
what<00:02:12.549> you<00:02:12.790> need<00:02:13.030> as<00:02:13.299> far<00:02:13.360> as<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.470> amount<00:02:14.769> of

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
what you need as far as the amount of

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.920 
what you need as far as the amount of
power<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.400> need<00:02:15.640> for<00:02:15.880> pulling<00:02:16.360> or<00:02:16.630> not

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
power that you need for pulling or not

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.110 
power that you need for pulling or not
pulling<00:02:17.320> if<00:02:17.680> you're<00:02:17.830> towing<00:02:18.070> trailers<00:02:18.700> then

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
pulling if you're towing trailers then

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.430 
pulling if you're towing trailers then
you<00:02:19.239> have<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.600> lot<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.840> torque<00:02:20.200> if

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
you have to have a lot of torque if

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.050 
you have to have a lot of torque if
you're<00:02:20.860> not<00:02:20.980> towing<00:02:21.250> trailers<00:02:21.760> if<00:02:21.910> you're

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
you're not towing trailers if you're

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.930 
you're not towing trailers if you're
just<00:02:22.180> cruising<00:02:22.870> along<00:02:22.959> on<00:02:23.380> level<00:02:24.130> ground<00:02:24.160> with

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
just cruising along on level ground with

a couple of buddies in the car you
really<00:02:26.890> don't<00:02:27.040> need<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.190> lot<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.400> torque<00:02:27.700> at<00:02:27.820> all

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
really don't need a lot of torque at all
