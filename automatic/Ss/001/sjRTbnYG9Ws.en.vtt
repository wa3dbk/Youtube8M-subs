Google just said that they say that the

nexus devices you should show you what's

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.250 
nexus devices you should show you what's
possible<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.270> that's<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.720> sell<00:02:27.930> really<00:02:28.170> well

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
possible and that's a sell really well

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.560 
possible and that's a sell really well
well<00:02:29.070> like<00:02:29.220> other<00:02:29.610> companies<00:02:30.000> like<00:02:30.090> Motorola

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
well like other companies like Motorola

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.020 
well like other companies like Motorola
with<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.870> droid<00:02:31.170> droid<00:02:31.709> razr<00:02:32.100> backs<00:02:32.310> will<00:02:32.580> have

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
with a droid droid razr backs will have

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.300 
with a droid droid razr backs will have
similar<00:02:33.330> features<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:34.050> kind<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.830> do<00:02:35.070> what

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
similar features I kind of do what

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.430 
similar features I kind of do what
Google<00:02:35.850> showed<00:02:36.060> with<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.390> Nexus<00:02:36.780> device<00:02:37.080> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
Google showed with the Nexus device and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.710 
Google showed with the Nexus device and
those<00:02:38.430> funds<00:02:38.730> will<00:02:38.820> become<00:02:39.000> popular<00:02:39.150> not<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
those funds will become popular not the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.090 
those funds will become popular not the
Nexus<00:02:40.110> device<00:02:40.320> which<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.620> kind<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.800> odd<00:02:40.950> i

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
Nexus device which is kind of odd i

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.229 
Nexus device which is kind of odd i
think<00:02:41.280> google<00:02:41.370> could<00:02:41.730> probably<00:02:41.970> do<00:02:42.150> better

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
think google could probably do better

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.370 
think google could probably do better
with<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.480> nexus<00:02:42.780> phones<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.110> get<00:02:43.200> them<00:02:43.319> all

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
with the nexus phones you get them all

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.520 
with the nexus phones you get them all
popular<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.630> think<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.870> nexus<00:02:46.380> with

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
popular and so I think the nexus with

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.110 
popular and so I think the nexus with
the<00:02:46.709> best<00:02:46.920> since<00:02:47.160> you're<00:02:47.280> guaranteed<00:02:47.700> update

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the best since you're guaranteed update

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.490 
the best since you're guaranteed update
for<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.360> next<00:02:48.540> like<00:02:48.660> two<00:02:48.900> years<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.380> that's

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
for the next like two years and that's

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.640 
for the next like two years and that's
really<00:02:49.680> what<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:49.890> like<00:02:50.100> about<00:02:50.160> Android<00:02:50.670> but

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.680 
we don't I say anything specific they're
like<00:05:46.080> yellow<00:05:47.070> jelly<00:05:47.340> beans<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:47.849> yeah<00:05:48.000> jelly

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
like yellow jelly beans and yeah jelly

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.260 
like yellow jelly beans and yeah jelly
beans<00:05:48.900> are<00:05:48.990> cool<00:05:49.229> and<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.880> next<00:05:51.120> version

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
beans are cool and the next version

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.180 
beans are cool and the next version
android<00:05:51.630> may<00:05:51.870> or<00:05:52.020> may<00:05:52.139> not<00:05:52.169> be<00:05:52.349> jelly<00:05:52.949> bean<00:05:53.159> so

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
android may or may not be jelly bean so

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.149 
android may or may not be jelly bean so
i<00:05:53.729> think<00:05:54.060> it<00:05:54.330> is<00:05:54.360> we<00:05:55.349> guess<00:05:55.560> i<00:05:55.710> should<00:05:55.860> sandwich

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
i think it is we guess i should sandwich

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.710 
i think it is we guess i should sandwich
correctly<00:05:56.520> we<00:05:56.639> guessed<00:05:56.820> honeycomb<00:05:57.210> correctly

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
correctly we guessed honeycomb correctly

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.110 
correctly we guessed honeycomb correctly
so<00:05:58.409> probably<00:05:59.099> guess<00:05:59.370> jelly<00:05:59.639> bean<00:05:59.789> correctly

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
so probably guess jelly bean correctly

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.490 
so probably guess jelly bean correctly
yet<00:06:00.360> it<00:06:00.659> might<00:06:00.780> be<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:00.900> little<00:06:00.990> bit<00:06:01.139> different

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
yet it might be a little bit different

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.500 
yet it might be a little bit different
originally<00:06:02.490> I<00:06:02.520> 16<00:06:02.940> which<00:06:03.030> was<00:06:03.120> rumored<00:06:03.389> to<00:06:03.479> be

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
originally I 16 which was rumored to be

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.600 
originally I 16 which was rumored to be
ice<00:06:03.750> cream<00:06:04.139> which<00:06:04.710> we<00:06:04.860> strike<00:06:05.070> from<00:06:05.190> sandwich

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
ice cream which we strike from sandwich

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.149 
ice cream which we strike from sandwich
jelly<00:06:06.090> bean<00:06:06.270> might<00:06:06.419> be<00:06:06.539> like<00:06:06.690> that<00:06:06.870> too<00:06:07.159> maybe

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
jelly bean might be like that too maybe

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.500 
jelly bean might be like that too maybe
it's<00:06:08.340> yellow<00:06:08.550> bean<00:06:08.760> right<00:06:09.000> now<00:06:09.180> but<00:06:09.360> maybe

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
it's yellow bean right now but maybe

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.210 
it's yellow bean right now but maybe
maybe<00:06:09.810> it's<00:06:09.990> jelly<00:06:10.260> bean<00:06:10.470> sandwich<00:06:10.740> we<00:06:11.070> don't

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
maybe it's jelly bean sandwich we don't

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.430 
maybe it's jelly bean sandwich we don't
