interest<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> painting<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.330> why<00:00:18.650> what<00:00:19.650> I

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
interest in the painting so why what I

interest in the painting so why what I
want<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.070> now<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:23.750> is<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> background

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
want to do now is is that a background

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.910 
want to do now is is that a background
basically<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.789> put<00:00:27.480> some<00:00:27.599> darks<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.289> around<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
basically I put some darks in around the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.349 
basically I put some darks in around the
painting<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.460> cutting<00:00:29.760> around<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> flowers

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
painting and cutting around the flowers

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.069 
painting and cutting around the flowers
just<00:00:31.349> play<00:00:31.560> loosely<00:00:32.480> just<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.690> make<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
just play loosely just to make the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.190 
just play loosely just to make the
actual<00:00:34.640> painting<00:00:35.640> stand<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.870> look<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.170> bit

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
actual painting stand out and look a bit

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.580 
actual painting stand out and look a bit
more<00:00:37.350> interesting<00:00:37.850> because<00:00:39.200> he<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.410> looks

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
more interesting because he just looks

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.130 
more interesting because he just looks
lifeless<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.500> not<00:00:43.500> very<00:00:43.649> good<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
lifeless and not very good so that's the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.360 
lifeless and not very good so that's the
idea<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.640> sort<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.879> make<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.149> look<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
idea just to sort of make it look a

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.959 
idea just to sort of make it look a
little<00:00:50.370> bit<00:00:50.640> more<00:00:50.879> professional

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
little bit more professional

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.520

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
