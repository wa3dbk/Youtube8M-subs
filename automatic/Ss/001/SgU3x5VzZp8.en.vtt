think there's a five-minute one so maybe

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.170 
think there's a five-minute one so maybe
if<00:03:39.040> your<00:03:39.220> teeth<00:03:39.400> are<00:03:39.580> really<00:03:39.610> really

if your teeth are really really

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.300 
if your teeth are really really
sensitive<00:03:40.690> get<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.290> 5-minute<00:03:41.769> one<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.130> test

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.750 
sensitive get the 5-minute one and test
out<00:03:42.550> with<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:42.940> but<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:43.989> actually<00:03:44.410> found<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.550> lot

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
to your teeth I have to get the advance
seal<00:05:26.340> because<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.659> advance<00:05:28.020> seal<00:05:28.380> allows<00:05:29.310> it

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
seal because the advance seal allows it

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.580 
seal because the advance seal allows it
to<00:05:29.550> stick<00:05:30.030> on<00:05:30.210> easier<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:30.960> ones<00:05:31.139> that<00:05:31.349> aren't

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590

to stick on easier the ones that aren't
advance<00:05:32.159> seals

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.730 
advance seals
it's<00:05:33.030> like<00:05:33.360> slides<00:05:33.840> everywhere<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:34.590> it's

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
it's like slides everywhere and it's

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.710 
it's like slides everywhere and it's
harder<00:05:35.070> to<00:05:35.220> keep<00:05:35.370> on<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:36.210> make<00:05:36.389> sure<00:05:36.419> you<00:05:36.630> get

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
harder to keep on so make sure you get

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.839
