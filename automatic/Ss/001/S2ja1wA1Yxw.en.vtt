we think there's a better way which is

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.120 
we think there's a better way which is
for<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.900> majority<00:00:42.050> of<00:00:42.410> those<00:00:42.620> claims<00:00:42.920> which

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
for the majority of those claims which

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.580 
for the majority of those claims which
are<00:00:43.250> small<00:00:43.670> minor<00:00:44.540> injuries<00:00:45.110> that<00:00:45.380> it<00:00:45.470> would

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
are small minor injuries that it would

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.500 
are small minor injuries that it would
be<00:00:45.680> better<00:00:45.860> for<00:00:46.040> consumers<00:00:46.640> if<00:00:46.820> they<00:00:47.450> were

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
be better for consumers if they were

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.780 
be better for consumers if they were
treated<00:00:48.050> with<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.470> rehabilitation<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.490> care

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
treated with a rehabilitation and care

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:57.620 
treated with a rehabilitation and care
rather<00:00:50.480> than<00:00:50.720> compensation

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.040 

as<00:00:58.110> long<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.470> I<00:00:58.680> had<00:00:58.860> some<00:00:59.130> control<00:00:59.430> over<00:01:00.050> which

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
as long as I had some control over which

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.740 
as long as I had some control over which
practitioner<00:01:01.830> I<00:01:02.070> was<00:01:02.700> going<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.330> I<00:01:03.510> would

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
practitioner I was going to see I would

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.750 
practitioner I was going to see I would
be<00:01:03.870> happy<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.410> have<00:01:04.770> my<00:01:04.920> physiotherapy<00:01:05.730> or

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
be happy to have my physiotherapy or

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.670 
be happy to have my physiotherapy or
Osteopathy<00:01:06.570> treatment<00:01:06.990> paid<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.470> by<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
Osteopathy treatment paid for by the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.730 
Osteopathy treatment paid for by the
insurance<00:01:08.220> company<00:01:09.140> I've<00:01:10.140> had<00:01:10.320> minor

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
insurance company I've had minor

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.370 
insurance company I've had minor
injuries<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.480> would<00:01:12.870> much<00:01:13.050> rather<00:01:13.080> be

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
injuries and I would much rather be

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.600 
injuries and I would much rather be
healthy<00:01:14.070> than<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.730> extra<00:01:14.940> cash

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.060 

I<00:01:18.670> think<00:01:19.450> replacing<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.350> lump<00:01:20.530> sum<00:01:20.710> payment

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
I think replacing a lump sum payment

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.640 
I think replacing a lump sum payment
with<00:01:21.250> Visio<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:22.120> a<00:01:22.420> very<00:01:22.840> very<00:01:23.140> good<00:01:23.290> idea

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
with Visio is a very very good idea

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.500 
with Visio is a very very good idea
because<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.190> does<00:01:24.370> bypass<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.480> whole

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
because it does bypass the whole

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.630 
because it does bypass the whole
claiming<00:01:26.440> things<00:01:26.680> that<00:01:26.890> aren't<00:01:27.220> actually

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
claiming things that aren't actually

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.700 
claiming things that aren't actually
true<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.210> crossing<00:01:28.570> everyone<00:01:28.930> money<00:01:29.110> and<00:01:29.410> I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
true and crossing everyone money and I

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.380 
true and crossing everyone money and I
also<00:01:29.890> think<00:01:30.190> it's<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.520> good<00:01:30.550> thing<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.120> do<00:01:31.270> if

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
also think it's a good thing to do if

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.790 
also think it's a good thing to do if
you<00:01:31.480> do<00:01:31.630> have<00:01:31.780> whiplash<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.320> is<00:01:32.410> quite<00:01:32.650> painful

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
you do have whiplash it is quite painful

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.170 
you do have whiplash it is quite painful
and<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.400> actually<00:01:33.730> get<00:01:33.820> something<00:01:34.030> done

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
and you actually get something done

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.130 
and you actually get something done
about<00:01:34.510> it<00:01:36.120> rehabilitation<00:01:37.120> for<00:01:37.660> whiplash<00:01:37.810> is

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
about it rehabilitation for whiplash is

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.590 
about it rehabilitation for whiplash is
incredibly<00:01:38.560> important<00:01:39.130> whether<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.240> be<00:01:40.360> minor

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
incredibly important whether it be minor

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
incredibly important whether it be minor
or<00:01:40.840> whether<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.020> be<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.200> little<00:01:41.260> bit<00:01:41.410> more

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
or whether it be a little bit more

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.650 
or whether it be a little bit more
significant<00:01:42.160> than<00:01:42.220> that<00:01:42.400> without<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.450> right

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
significant than that without the right

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.480 
significant than that without the right
intervention<00:01:44.320> from<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.560> practitioner<00:01:45.310> from

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
intervention from the practitioner from

intervention from the practitioner from
the<00:01:45.610> physiotherapist<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:47.170> can<00:01:47.350> look<00:01:47.500> at

the physiotherapist it can look at

so<00:02:14.720> our<00:02:14.780> second<00:02:15.110> recommendation<00:02:15.260> relates<00:02:16.040> to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
so our second recommendation relates to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.010 
so our second recommendation relates to
the<00:02:16.700> level<00:02:16.940> at<00:02:17.030> which<00:02:17.060> lawyers<00:02:17.660> become

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
the level at which lawyers become

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.590 
the level at which lawyers become
