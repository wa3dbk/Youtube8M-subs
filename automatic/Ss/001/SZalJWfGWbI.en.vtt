to teleport out of the reset it's a work

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.419

if<00:01:44.840> they<00:01:44.959> just<00:01:45.140> stand<00:01:45.380> up<00:01:45.530> until<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.979> poor<00:01:46.189> or

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
if they just stand up until the poor or

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.559 
if they just stand up until the poor or
the<00:01:46.939> teleport<00:01:47.450> on<00:01:47.599> wake<00:01:47.840> up<00:01:49.299> continue<00:01:50.299> sighs
