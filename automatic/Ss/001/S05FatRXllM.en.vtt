00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 ah 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.030
 hello what fart youtube friends are 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.739
 they did about 51 tutorials and in this 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.200
 occasion we do not see them with a tutorial 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.960
 but with a demonstration of a new 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:56.050
 feature that has come out with this 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:59.020
 with android 4.0 4.4 applied this is from 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.660
 record your cell phone screen 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.900
 without the need to obtain permits 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.360
 fruits or superuser this seems to me 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.430
 a very useful option especially for me 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.110
 that I like to do tutorials like 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:18.070
 hobby this there are no requirements 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:22.619
 very high this is simply to have this 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.850
 allowed the option of options of 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.260
 developer on your device with 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.010
 android kitkat 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.560
 have the computer the android sdk 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.280
 this one comes here is on the page 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.460
 Android this is at the bottom and 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.120
 just pick your your version of 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.960
 windows and accept the terms and it's 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.540
 Thai create this save files and 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.140
 then they extract it where they want and they 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:59.050
 this will work the compressed file 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.050
 will come with these folders 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.439
 these folders will have I think that too 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.660
 was the eclipse the sdk and the sdk manager 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.020
 crashed to 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.450
 I remember the command 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.310
 this after having this extracted the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.370
 sdk this one can use it 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.760
 the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.099
 We can use this function to 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.739
 record the screen and your cell phone this does not 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.250
 it's something very difficult this simply 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.010
 they have to give first to the have that 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.489
 use a command prompt window or 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.500
 12m of this to instruct the 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.690
 computer that is where you have to 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.220
 go and what are the functions that have 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.360
 to be carried out by means of all 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.190
 this in this case we first have to 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.660
 this indicate the directory where it is 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.569
 our sdk this first in the 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.430
 sdk or the sdk folder here is given 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.069
 mind that if they realize it is so down 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.319
 the extra dt that this folder that is 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.030
 here after that on that cam 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.100
 here is that decade after flash are 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.130
 your 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.270
 and they're going to specify the directory of 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.700
 This application 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.780
 abed that is the one that will help us 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.340
 make this recording 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.980
 well this I have the 4.4 kitkat car and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.560
 right now I'm going to make you one 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.840
 small demonstration of how it works 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.580
 this the intention of this was not you 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.250
 in a tutorial but rather to show you 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.040
 to show them that this is working 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.680
 I took this information from two videos 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.630
 are a bit confusing this so why 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.310
 that I did to the explanation in the 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.380
 description I will leave the links to 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.380
 both videos this problem well that 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.410
 our stealing the ideas or the 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.580
 the merits of imas this once 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.050
 written the command that I will also leave in 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.390
 the description of the video in case 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.470
 they do not want to visit it be that the others 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.819
 videos are 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.480
 let's see whole 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.480
 and we wait 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.689
 and it seems to me that he is already recording 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.100
 this also in case I'm 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:21.079
 recording I'm going to put the lace on that 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.079
 side and here I have 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.169
 I have android a 4.4 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:38.950
 here about device status 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.580
 Android with 3 android 4 points 4.2 this 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.629
 kat kit 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.629
 is the android version 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.090
 The Samsung Galaxy S 5 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.319
 here is the stress 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:59.800
 it's nice this one yes you can this one 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:01.300
 apparently affect anything while 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.710
 connected to the computer and recording 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.469
 this you can this from while you're 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.620
 recording you can be playing games not 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:13.260
 no link has appeared 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.160
 nothing has been worked on in fact 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.780
 right now I'm recording with usb 2.0 this 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.590
 even though the device has 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.040
 3.0 output 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.260
 we are going to launch a game which will 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.310
 like 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.310
 something simple 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.960
 and we're going to put you in classic mode 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:46.530
 and it seems to me that this does not record audio 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.530
 I have not recorded this 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.050
 this method to record the device 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.529
 and I am the one who is the one who was wrong 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.739
 a Peruvian man 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:06.139
 but apparently it does not seem like anything to me 

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:09.610
 which is very good 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.610
 it is very fluid 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:19.110
 well without this 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.880
 very well and I find it very very useful 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.590
 I'm in case you have any questions 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.970
 or some comment 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.010
 please leave it here below in the 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.750
 comments of the video will also be on

 ask questions in as point fm

 stadiums that play a lot ibai
