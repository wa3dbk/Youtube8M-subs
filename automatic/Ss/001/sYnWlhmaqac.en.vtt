00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
about the teddies are basically someone

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.780 
about the teddies are basically someone
stole<00:00:33.360> her<00:00:33.480> who<00:00:33.630> actually<00:00:33.840> made<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.200> game

when<00:00:35.790> their<00:00:35.910> daughters<00:00:36.270> died<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.829> in<00:00:37.829> memory

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
when their daughters died and in memory

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.100 
when their daughters died and in memory
of<00:00:38.280> where<00:00:38.520> they<00:00:38.700> put<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.450> though<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.780> teddies

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
of where they put and though the teddies

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.619
