brought<00:01:44.159> us<00:01:44.280> things<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.610> e<00:01:44.909> equals<00:01:45.180> MC

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
brought us things like e equals MC

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.880 
brought us things like e equals MC
squared<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.079> speed<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.380> light<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
squared the speed of light the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.679 
squared the speed of light the
photoelectric<00:01:47.549> effect<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:48.090> don't<00:01:48.360> even<00:01:48.450> care

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
photoelectric effect I don't even care

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.600 
photoelectric effect I don't even care
that<00:01:48.750> he<00:01:49.049> married<00:01:49.200> his<00:01:49.409> first<00:01:49.590> cousin<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.220> just

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that he married his first cousin I just

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.819 
that he married his first cousin I just
want<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> love<00:01:51.509> his<00:01:51.720> beautiful<00:01:52.140> brain<00:01:52.350> even

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
want to love his beautiful brain even

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.139 
want to love his beautiful brain even
though<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.920> wonder<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.610> earth<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:54.090> going

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
though I wonder what on earth was going

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.420 
though I wonder what on earth was going
on<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:54.960> skull<00:01:55.500> apparently<00:01:56.250> there's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
on in that skull apparently there's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.399 
on in that skull apparently there's
actually<00:01:56.909> an<00:01:56.969> app<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.570> which<00:01:57.810> allows<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
actually an app that which allows you to

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.350 
actually an app that which allows you to
look<00:01:58.590> at<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.920> Stan's<00:01:59.219> brain<00:01:59.520> his<00:01:59.939> app<00:02:00.149> was

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
look at I in Stan's brain his app was

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.300 
look at I in Stan's brain his app was
made<00:02:00.540> possible<00:02:00.990> by<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.200> dude<00:02:01.469> who<00:02:01.680> originally

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
made possible by the dude who originally

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.039 
made possible by the dude who originally
stole<00:02:02.700> Einstein's<00:02:03.270> brain<00:02:03.479> when<00:02:03.840> he<00:02:03.930> was

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
stole Einstein's brain when he was

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.929 
stole Einstein's brain when he was
conducting<00:02:04.619> his<00:02:04.649> autopsy<00:02:05.130> many<00:02:05.610> people<00:02:05.850> were

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
conducting his autopsy many people were

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.760 
conducting his autopsy many people were
outraged<00:02:06.270> when<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.570> happened<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.320> Thomas

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
outraged when this happened but Thomas

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.160 
outraged when this happened but Thomas
Harvey<00:02:08.009> claimed<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.459> he<00:02:08.670> had<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.239> do<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.539> in

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
Harvey claimed that he had to do it in

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.080 
Harvey claimed that he had to do it in
name<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.289> science<00:02:11.160> he<00:02:11.430> sectioned<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.880> brain

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
name of science he sectioned the brain

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.839 
name of science he sectioned the brain
into<00:02:12.330> 240<00:02:13.230> pieces<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.830> preserved<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.370> stored

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
into 240 pieces and preserved it stored

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.729 
into 240 pieces and preserved it stored
it<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.120> Tupperware<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.050> many<00:02:16.319> years<00:02:16.530> later

after a bizarre trip across the country
in<00:02:18.599> his<00:02:18.780> trunk<00:02:19.080> scientists<00:02:19.709> got<00:02:19.800> their<00:02:19.980> hands

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
in his trunk scientists got their hands

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.800 
in his trunk scientists got their hands
on<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.340> what<00:02:20.610> they<00:02:20.730> found<00:02:20.910> was<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.239> Einstein

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
on it what they found was that Einstein

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.390 
on it what they found was that Einstein
had<00:02:21.840> far<00:02:22.260> more<00:02:22.290> glial<00:02:22.830> cells<00:02:23.069> than<00:02:23.220> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
had far more glial cells than the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.250 
had far more glial cells than the
average<00:02:23.700> scientists<00:02:24.270> glial<00:02:24.540> cells<00:02:24.750> are<00:02:24.900> like

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
average scientists glial cells are like

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.930 
average scientists glial cells are like
glue<00:02:25.709> they<00:02:26.160> make<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.610> can<00:02:26.730> synthesize

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
glue they make it so you can synthesize

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.420 
glue they make it so you can synthesize
information<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:27.930> easily<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.560> quickly<00:02:28.800> so

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
information more easily and quickly so

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.850 
information more easily and quickly so
guys<00:02:30.120> after<00:02:30.540> we're<00:02:30.840> done<00:02:30.930> studying<00:02:31.260> mr.<00:02:31.500> Stahr

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
guys after we're done studying mr. Stahr

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.500 
guys after we're done studying mr. Stahr
I'm<00:02:32.069> thinking<00:02:32.550> we<00:02:32.880> should<00:02:32.910> take<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.209> closer

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
I'm thinking we should take a closer

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.420 
I'm thinking we should take a closer
look<00:02:33.660> at<00:02:33.930> those<00:02:34.050> blue<00:02:34.260> cells<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.310> know

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
look at those blue cells just you know

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.979 
look at those blue cells just you know
sort<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.760> check<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.120> out<00:02:36.269> see<00:02:36.540> if<00:02:36.600> we<00:02:36.660> can<00:02:36.780> pump

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
sort of check it out see if we can pump

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.660 
sort of check it out see if we can pump
out<00:02:37.140> any<00:02:37.470> new<00:02:37.620> geniuses<00:02:38.160> know<00:02:38.519> what<00:02:38.610> I'm
