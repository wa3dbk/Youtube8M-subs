00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
question why do you need to back off

right<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:17.120> more<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.450> train<00:02:17.720> is<00:02:18.050> pretty<00:02:18.560> much

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
right the more you train is pretty much

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.420 
right the more you train is pretty much
the<00:02:18.890> engine<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.340> made<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.520> video<00:02:19.670> bottom<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.090> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
the engine I made a video bottom is the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.240 
the engine I made a video bottom is the

kick on right and the more you train

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.410 
kick on right and the more you train
chronic<00:02:26.340> training<00:02:26.670> over<00:02:26.969> and<00:02:27.090> over<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.390> over

chronic training over and over and over
again<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.650> less<00:02:28.890> responsibly<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:30.000> becomes

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
again the less responsibly it becomes

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.640 
again the less responsibly it becomes
the<00:02:30.540> less<00:02:30.629> effective<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.200> becomes

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
the less effective it becomes

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.940 
the less effective it becomes
and<00:02:31.799> when<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.760> take<00:02:32.969> a<00:02:33.000> D<00:02:33.450> training<00:02:33.989> week<00:02:34.200> or<00:02:34.500> D

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
and when you take a D training week or D

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.990 
and when you take a D training week or D
training<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.790> know<00:02:36.829> cycle<00:02:37.829> what<00:02:38.549> happens<00:02:38.849> is

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
training you know cycle what happens is

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.289 
training you know cycle what happens is
when<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:39.629> come<00:02:39.870> back<00:02:40.079> it's<00:02:40.530> not<00:02:40.709> only

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
when you come back it's not only

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.520 
when you come back it's not only
reactivated<00:02:42.299> at<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> better<00:02:42.780> efficiency<00:02:43.019> but

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
reactivated at a better efficiency but

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.619 
reactivated at a better efficiency but
it's<00:02:43.680> stronger<00:02:44.370> than<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.579> was<00:02:44.609> before<00:02:44.700> that's

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
it's stronger than it was before that's

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.179 
it's stronger than it was before that's
why<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> lot<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.079> people<00:02:46.139> I<00:02:46.349> get<00:02:46.500> into<00:02:46.680> accidents

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
why a lot of people I get into accidents

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.069 
why a lot of people I get into accidents
from<00:02:47.340> Sports<00:02:47.670> rugby<00:02:47.849> whatever<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.540> take

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
from Sports rugby whatever and take

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.869 
from Sports rugby whatever and take
unvoluntary<00:02:49.590> time<00:02:50.099> off<00:02:50.280> when<00:02:50.430> they<00:02:50.519> come<00:02:50.549> back

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
unvoluntary time off when they come back

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.129 
unvoluntary time off when they come back
not<00:02:51.060> only<00:02:51.090> they<00:02:51.329> get<00:02:51.480> their<00:02:51.599> muscle<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.019> muscle

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
not only they get their muscle to muscle

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.809 
not only they get their muscle to muscle
back<00:02:52.439> in<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.650> muscle<00:02:52.950> memory<00:02:53.069> but<00:02:53.609> they<00:02:53.700> get

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
back in the muscle memory but they get

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:54.920 
back in the muscle memory but they get
bigger<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.150> stronger<00:02:54.299> than<00:02:54.419> the<00:02:54.540> rest<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.870> the

would<00:03:40.590> say<00:03:40.620> BCAAs<00:03:41.159> no<00:03:41.519> he<00:03:42.359> says<00:03:42.540> have<00:03:42.780> leucine

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
would say BCAAs no he says have leucine

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.330 
would say BCAAs no he says have leucine
and<00:03:45.049> I<00:03:46.049> mean<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.560> know<00:03:46.620> leucine<00:03:47.040> is<00:03:47.159> more

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
and I mean I know leucine is more

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.740 
and I mean I know leucine is more
important<00:03:47.729> it's<00:03:47.909> the<00:03:47.939> most<00:03:48.090> powerful<00:03:48.329> one<00:03:48.569> if

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
important it's the most powerful one if

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.509 
important it's the most powerful one if
you<00:03:48.840> take<00:03:48.989> leucine<00:03:49.349> you<00:03:49.500> was<00:03:50.129> good<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.400> go

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
you take leucine you was good to go

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.399 
you take leucine you was good to go
source<00:03:50.790> protein<00:03:50.970> sentences<00:03:51.389> but<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.079> just<00:03:52.290> take

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
source protein sentences but I just take

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:53.839 
source protein sentences but I just take
the<00:03:52.530> BCA<00:03:52.769> just<00:03:53.069> for<00:03:53.189> you<00:03:53.400> know<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:53.639> for<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
the BCA just for you know this for the

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.550 
the BCA just for you know this for the
fuck<00:03:54.000> away<00:03:54.150> if<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.810> price<00:03:55.049> difference<00:03:55.349> is<00:03:55.470> not

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
fuck away if the price difference is not

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.879 
fuck away if the price difference is not
that<00:03:55.799> much<00:03:56.329> then<00:03:57.329> I<00:03:57.449> think<00:03:57.659> BCAAs<00:03:58.139> does<00:03:58.739> she

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
that much then I think BCAAs does she

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.159 
that much then I think BCAAs does she
get<00:03:59.069> everything<00:03:59.609> else<00:03:59.849> but<00:04:00.780> if<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.989> price

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
get everything else but if the price

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.839 
get everything else but if the price
difference<00:04:01.439> is<00:04:01.709> significant<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.609> got<00:04:02.759> to

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
difference is significant you got to

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.059 
difference is significant you got to
pick<00:04:03.030> one<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.269> leucine<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:06.049> is<00:04:07.069> slightly

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
pick one and leucine is a is slightly

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.969 
pick one and leucine is a is slightly
cheaper<00:04:08.310> I'll<00:04:08.609> go<00:04:08.699> for<00:04:08.849> loosing<00:04:11.930> actually

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:12.979 
cheaper I'll go for loosing actually

good<00:04:46.409> question<00:04:46.889> um<00:04:47.569> Dan<00:04:48.569> that's<00:04:48.689> a<00:04:48.809> really

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:49.019 
good question um Dan that's a really

good question um Dan that's a really
good<00:04:49.110> question<00:04:49.169> I<00:04:49.589> don't<00:04:50.129> know<00:04:50.279> I<00:04:50.639> don't

00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:51.059 
good question I don't know I don't

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:53.389 
good question I don't know I don't
fucking<00:04:51.299> know<00:04:51.739> frequency<00:04:52.739> is<00:04:52.799> very<00:04:53.039> important

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:53.399 
fucking know frequency is very important

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:55.069 
fucking know frequency is very important
for<00:04:53.519> muscle<00:04:53.639> mass<00:04:53.879> obviously<00:04:54.299> I<00:04:54.509> mean<00:04:54.779> it's<00:04:54.929> my

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:55.079 
for muscle mass obviously I mean it's my

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:56.989 
for muscle mass obviously I mean it's my
whole<00:04:55.229> nucleus<00:04:55.589> overload<00:04:55.949> things<00:04:56.159> all<00:04:56.459> around

00:04:56.989 --> 00:04:56.999 
whole nucleus overload things all around

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:59.479 
whole nucleus overload things all around
frequency<00:04:57.599> and<00:04:57.809> volume<00:04:58.379> is<00:04:58.709> also<00:04:59.039> very

00:04:59.479 --> 00:04:59.489 
frequency and volume is also very

00:04:59.489 --> 00:05:04.509 
frequency and volume is also very
important

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:04.519 

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:09.350 

not<00:05:05.519> so<00:05:05.699> so<00:05:07.189> so<00:05:08.189> frequency<00:05:08.699> is<00:05:08.819> very<00:05:08.969> important

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
not so so so frequency is very important

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.959 
not so so so frequency is very important
volume<00:05:09.929> is<00:05:10.079> also<00:05:10.259> very<00:05:10.529> important<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:11.069> so<00:05:11.729> the

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:11.969 
volume is also very important and so the

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.559 
volume is also very important and so the
best<00:05:12.179> is<00:05:12.329> to<00:05:12.360> combine<00:05:12.599> them<00:05:12.929> right<00:05:14.360> so<00:05:15.360> three

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
best is to combine them right so three

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.089 
best is to combine them right so three
says<00:05:15.779> three<00:05:15.869> times<00:05:15.899> a<00:05:16.199> week<00:05:16.229> for<00:05:16.499> arms<00:05:16.829> I<00:05:16.949> don't

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
says three times a week for arms I don't

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.799 
says three times a week for arms I don't
think<00:05:17.279> that's<00:05:17.399> enough<00:05:17.759> right<00:05:17.999> I<00:05:18.269> mean<00:05:18.389> depends

00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:18.809 
think that's enough right I mean depends

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:20.479 
think that's enough right I mean depends
on<00:05:18.929> how<00:05:19.229> intense<00:05:19.649> your<00:05:19.799> training<00:05:20.189> what

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:20.489 
on how intense your training what

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:23.299 
on how intense your training what
exercises<00:05:20.999> you<00:05:21.089> doing<00:05:21.389> I<00:05:21.539> would<00:05:22.199> say<00:05:22.349> 67<00:05:23.039> sets

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:23.309 
exercises you doing I would say 67 sets

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:28.749 
exercises you doing I would say 67 sets
twice<00:05:23.549> a<00:05:23.579> week<00:05:23.909> that<00:05:24.179> one<00:05:24.449> looks<00:05:24.719> fucking<00:05:25.049> good

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.359 

that<00:05:29.759> one<00:05:29.939> looks<00:05:30.119> good<00:05:30.179> so<00:05:30.659> go<00:05:31.110> for<00:05:31.349> the<00:05:31.469> 67

00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:32.369 
that one looks good so go for the 67

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:35.359 
that one looks good so go for the 67
sets<00:05:32.579> twice<00:05:32.819> a<00:05:32.849> week<00:05:33.119> if<00:05:33.929> I'm<00:05:34.829> assuming<00:05:35.279> you've

00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:35.369 
sets twice a week if I'm assuming you've

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:36.589 
sets twice a week if I'm assuming you've
been<00:05:35.459> training<00:05:35.759> for<00:05:35.789> a<00:05:35.939> while<00:05:36.059> now<00:05:36.299> you<00:05:36.360> know

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
been training for a while now you know

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.259 
been training for a while now you know
so<00:05:37.319> your<00:05:37.499> ability<00:05:37.679> card<00:05:38.129> was<00:05:38.249> pretty<00:05:38.429> good<00:05:38.579> but

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:39.269 
so your ability card was pretty good but

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:44.629 
so your ability card was pretty good but
I<00:05:39.329> always<00:05:39.569> go<00:05:39.809> for<00:05:39.989> more<00:05:42.439> hmm<00:05:43.499> three<00:05:44.429> times

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
I always go for more hmm three times

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.449 
I always go for more hmm three times
three<00:05:44.819> is<00:05:44.879> nine<00:05:45.349> six<00:05:46.349> times<00:05:46.589> -<00:05:46.739> yeah<00:05:47.039> so<00:05:47.369> you're

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:47.459 
three is nine six times - yeah so you're

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:48.679 
three is nine six times - yeah so you're
getting<00:05:47.819> more<00:05:47.909> volume<00:05:48.269> for<00:05:48.300> me

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:48.689 
getting more volume for me

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:49.879 
getting more volume for me
I<00:05:48.719> was<00:05:49.019> good<00:05:49.139> for<00:05:49.229> way<00:05:49.349> to<00:05:49.409> get<00:05:49.589> the<00:05:49.679> most

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
I was good for way to get the most

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.759 
I was good for way to get the most
volume<00:05:50.129> at<00:05:50.459> the<00:05:50.550> same<00:05:50.699> time<00:05:51.110> most<00:05:52.110> value<00:05:52.559> most

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:52.769 
volume at the same time most value most

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.679 
volume at the same time most value most
frequency<00:05:53.279> by<00:05:53.429> the<00:05:53.489> same<00:05:53.729> time<00:05:53.939> the<00:05:54.419> recovery

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:54.689 
frequency by the same time the recovery

00:05:54.689 --> 00:06:06.920 
frequency by the same time the recovery
you<00:05:55.139> want<00:05:55.259> to<00:05:55.319> add<00:05:55.409> some

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.520 

and<00:06:07.410> we<00:06:07.530> spent<00:06:07.800> imagine<00:06:08.340> either<00:06:08.790> life

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
and we spent imagine either life

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.530
