here out of 500 pounds looking at it

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.320 
here out of 500 pounds looking at it
back<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.090> forth<00:02:53.620> where<00:02:54.620> we<00:02:54.740> go<00:02:54.860> yeah<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.850> have

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
back and forth where we go yeah I have

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.450 
back and forth where we go yeah I have
to<00:02:56.510> cut<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.750> few<00:02:57.050> about<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.410> lot<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.680> past<00:02:58.070> but

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
to cut a few about a lot of past but

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.790 
to cut a few about a lot of past but
that's<00:02:59.240> something<00:02:59.570> that<00:02:59.810> I<00:02:59.990> were<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.530> draw

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
that's something that I were to draw

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.000 
that's something that I were to draw
because<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:02.780> plays<00:03:03.170> with<00:03:03.380> your<00:03:03.530> mind<00:03:03.560> way<00:03:03.980> too

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
because it plays with your mind way too

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.140 
because it plays with your mind way too
much<00:03:04.430> you'll<00:03:04.700> need<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.060> have<00:03:05.180> off
