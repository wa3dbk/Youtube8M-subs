00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
in a tournament game probably wasn't the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.010 
seem to be working really well right now
yeah<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.469> Elise<00:02:04.860> she<00:02:05.820> was<00:02:06.030> probably<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.990> of

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
yeah so Elise she was probably one of

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.470 
yeah so Elise she was probably one of
the<00:02:07.140> most

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
the most

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.110 
the most
in<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.780> top<00:02:08.050> lane<00:02:08.320> is<00:02:08.530> like<00:02:08.740> a<00:02:09.010> couple<00:02:09.640> patches

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
in the top lane is like a couple patches

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.810 
in the top lane is like a couple patches
ago<00:02:10.540> like<00:02:10.720> but<00:02:11.020> then<00:02:11.140> they<00:02:11.320> nerfed<00:02:11.590> ur<00:02:11.770> q<00:02:12.460> like

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
ago like but then they nerfed ur q like

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.000 
ago like but then they nerfed ur q like
not<00:02:12.970> damage<00:02:13.360> wise<00:02:13.510> but<00:02:13.720> may<00:02:13.870> her<00:02:14.050> mana<00:02:14.680> cost<00:02:14.920> a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
not damage wise but may her mana cost a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.130 
not damage wise but may her mana cost a
lot<00:02:15.100> more<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.000> will<00:02:16.120> take<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.300> lot<00:02:16.480> more<00:02:16.540> to

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
lot more so it will take a lot more to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.170 
lot more so it will take a lot more to
sustain<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:18.190> her<00:02:18.370> damage<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.820> can<00:02:18.940> just<00:02:19.090> buy
