you<00:02:51.829> know<00:02:51.980> it's<00:02:52.159> definitely<00:02:52.280> worked<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.760> couple

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
you know it's definitely worked a couple

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.839

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
of times for me and everything so yeah I

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.390 
of times for me and everything so yeah I
think<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.629> think<00:02:56.989> motorcycles<00:02:57.590> can<00:02:57.829> be<00:02:58.099> a<00:02:58.129> tool

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
think I think motorcycles can be a tool

to help you pick up women but they will

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.949 
to help you pick up women but they will
not<00:03:00.319> do<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.129> by<00:03:01.489> themselves<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:02.329> have<00:03:02.510> got<00:03:02.750> to

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
not do it by themselves you have got to

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.619 
not do it by themselves you have got to
be<00:03:02.989> willing<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.590> put<00:03:03.769> in<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:04.299> little<00:03:05.299> bit<00:03:05.420> more

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
be willing to put in a little bit more

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.080 
be willing to put in a little bit more
