00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.780
 Hello good Morning 

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.020
 [Music] 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.840
 that's all since I 've done how 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.360
 make a route to any phone that 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.390
 you want and well I've done it precisely 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:21.260
 because I had a cell phone if you're not 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.070
 addicted and I can scream what you do not know 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.070
 what a lot of empty 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.500
 for all of you I will facilitate this 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.029
 tutorial so you can do it about 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.220
 everything if you have a Chinese mobile 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.559
 to see the perfect one and if you want it 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.230
 complicate we have and normal brand the 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.550
 known if you do not want to shine or 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.129
 looking for portals in concrete because all 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.980
 a universal cluster that is talked about 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.970
 ruth and a voucher for all 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.970
 if you are watching this video 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:03.530
 well this is the link what 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:07.830
 we will do it will download and download 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.659
 this we give you files here 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.909
 iverson this folder 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.609
 this is the program is worth now what 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.630
 we execute is in Chinese but good not 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:20.920
 nothing happens 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.920
 so fran 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.470
 and here we always give this 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:32.490
 and it is already 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.490
 and so you have to use it 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.590
 OK 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.500
 and that is the very simple program 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.869
 when we have here we connect the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.549
 phone in files and it will be 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.210
 automatically 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.970
 I already have it but it's good that 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.990
 we start we will be asked to update it on 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.990
 program will update dan 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.149
 here directly 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.640
 on the mobile and now we would have what 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.530
 is that everything is updated to a 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.900
 percentage bar and they are the electors 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.360
 the bruc vale is clear that in two the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.489
 root you have to put it back and now 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.910
 pose here and be here on the le 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:41.010
 dais and already the process is done 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:44.520
 here we have it done it will not leave 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.920
 this icon but on the mobile is a 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.800
 application and with that says it has 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.570
 surrounded and when 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.950
 you give me in application software 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.830
 superuser superuser by the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.380
 window grant access while 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:06.950
 there I will have to choose the part of the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.940
 right because once part of the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.090
 right 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.310
 well, this is all super simple 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.800
 the truth 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:23.660
 I hope it has helped you and see you 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.660
 in the next one until then
