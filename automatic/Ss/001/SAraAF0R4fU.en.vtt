00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.980

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.910

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.970

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.640

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.540
 Hello 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.710
 to start 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.630
 I lay this foundation on my face 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.060
 balancing of artists there 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.520
 will allow to absorb the excess of 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.260
 sebum 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.479
 after which he passed a concealer on the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.479
 eyelid and spread it well 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.000
 we must create a natural look a 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.050
 I choose this 2 eyeshadows of the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.540
 beautycycle that being shimmer does not exist 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.870
 will give a look off and to the same 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.600
 time we will maintain a natural appearance 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.330
 I will only use this brown and with a 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.900
 flat brush I carry it over the whole 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.900
 mobile eyelid 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.590
 I also carry it under the whole edge 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.590
 lower ciliary 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.640
 now I take a brown pencil and the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:22.380
 port on the lower ciliary rhyme the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.380
 I also bring it to the corner of the eye 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.570
 going out a little towards the outside and drawing 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.620
 high the upper ciliary bordeaux without 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.620
 get to the bottom 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.010
 now 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.630
 using this mascara I take mine 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.630
 thicker and longer lashes 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.239
 now I can't do without 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.540
 apply my bindi and in this case 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.540
 I choose to apply a soft pink with 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.560
 white glitter that I will then go to 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.560
 match with earrings 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:37.190

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:40.370
