slides into this extremely easy because
legacy<00:04:47.980> here<00:04:48.160> by<00:04:48.970> these<00:04:49.030> pieces<00:04:49.480> return<00:04:49.990> of

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
legacy here by these pieces return of

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.220 
legacy here by these pieces return of
cortical<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.920> other<00:04:51.070> side<00:04:51.310> different<00:04:51.700> too

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
cortical to the other side different too

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.160 
cortical to the other side different too
so<00:04:53.230> you<00:04:53.320> just<00:04:53.470> take<00:04:53.680> this<00:04:53.890> and<00:04:54.130> just<00:04:55.020> slide<00:04:56.020> it

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
so you just take this and just slide it

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.360 
so you just take this and just slide it
in<00:04:56.350> there<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:57.310> is<00:04:57.430> very<00:04:57.640> soft<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:59.250> yet<00:05:00.250> that

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
in there it is very soft and yet that

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.930 
in there it is very soft and yet that
goes<00:05:00.850> off<00:05:01.240> like<00:05:01.740> all<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.890> time<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:03.790> let's

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
goes off like all the time so let's

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.050 
goes off like all the time so let's
close<00:05:04.090> it<00:05:04.120> up<00:05:04.590> which<00:05:05.590> is<00:05:05.710> very<00:05:05.800> cool<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.400> get

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
pieces so I have to write this set in

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.480 
pieces so I have to write this set in
9.5<00:05:36.880> out<00:05:37.720> of<00:05:37.870> 10<00:05:38.140> of<00:05:38.350> course<00:05:39.040> it<00:05:39.160> could<00:05:39.370> be

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
9.5 out of 10 of course it could be

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.469 
9.5 out of 10 of course it could be
better<00:05:39.640> but<00:05:39.940> that's<00:05:40.419> a<00:05:40.510> small<00:05:40.750> you<00:05:41.710> know<00:05:41.830> like

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
better but that's a small you know like

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.630 
better but that's a small you know like
things<00:05:43.479> but<00:05:44.200> they<00:05:44.320> said<00:05:44.470> it's<00:05:44.620> extremely<00:05:45.430> cool

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
things but they said it's extremely cool

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.840 
things but they said it's extremely cool
and<00:05:45.700> it<00:05:46.210> is<00:05:46.450> under<00:05:46.960> ten<00:05:47.229> cents<00:05:47.470> apiece<00:05:47.590> or<00:05:47.950> like

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
and it is under ten cents apiece or like

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.730 
and it is under ten cents apiece or like
a<00:05:49.060> lot<00:05:49.300> of<00:05:49.419> us<00:05:49.600> attendants<00:05:50.110> appears<00:05:50.410> which<00:05:50.620> is

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
a lot of us attendants appears which is

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.370 
a lot of us attendants appears which is
great<00:05:51.100> so<00:05:52.060> not<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.419> like<00:05:52.870> the<00:05:53.020> things<00:05:53.260> that

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
great so not to like the things that

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.420 
great so not to like the things that
could<00:05:53.560> be<00:05:53.680> better<00:05:54.450> it<00:05:55.450> could<00:05:55.750> like<00:05:56.190> Lego<00:05:57.190> could

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
could be better it could like Lego could

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.240 
could be better it could like Lego could
take<00:05:57.850> these<00:05:58.150> holes<00:05:58.540> and<00:05:59.050> you<00:05:59.590> just<00:05:59.740> cover<00:05:59.979> them

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
take these holes and you just cover them

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.480 
take these holes and you just cover them
and<00:06:00.840> so<00:06:01.840> that<00:06:01.990> would<00:06:02.140> be<00:06:02.260> much<00:06:02.410> better<00:06:02.470> and<00:06:03.340> it

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
and so that would be much better and it

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.250 
and so that would be much better and it
could<00:06:03.669> come<00:06:03.910> with<00:06:04.060> two<00:06:04.240> minifigures<00:06:04.690> because

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
could come with two minifigures because

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.080 
could come with two minifigures because
you<00:06:05.350> can<00:06:05.380> source<00:06:05.860> human<00:06:06.220> figures<00:06:06.580> in<00:06:06.700> this<00:06:06.850> set

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
you can source human figures in this set

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.140 
you can source human figures in this set
one<00:06:07.960> in<00:06:08.229> there<00:06:08.650> of<00:06:09.010> course<00:06:09.370> you<00:06:09.490> know<00:06:09.640> that<00:06:09.850> and

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
one in there of course you know that and

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.430 
one in there of course you know that and
one<00:06:10.840> in<00:06:10.870> the<00:06:11.140> cockpit<00:06:12.060> so<00:06:13.060> that's<00:06:13.510> why<00:06:14.080> I<00:06:14.110> read
