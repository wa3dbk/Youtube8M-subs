00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.670
 Snack of pickled mashed potatoes 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.679
 we will need potatoes cost it 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.099
 should not less than 50 rubles per kilo 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.589
 Of course shit comes across and 60 and 70 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.230
 rubles but still 50 is a certain minimum 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:21.740
 the cost of a decent potato i can give 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.320
 at the rate of 1 kilogram of potatoes if 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.779
 you have more or less change weight 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.939
 products, respectively, clean the potatoes 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.130
 what's the best thing to do i already 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.350
 told the peeled potatoes immediately 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.450
 put in a saucepan with water to not 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.579
 turned yellow pot need to pick up 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.860
 minimum size to fit 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.440
 all the potatoes and there is no empty space left 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.760
 and pouring water by closing the potatoes on top 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.190
 on finger thickness 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.899
 the fact is that the less water there is 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.940
 more taste will remain in the potato 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.739
 large tubers can be cut in half 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.870
 to fit better 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.300
 and evenly cooked unfortunately 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.989
 cook potatoes in the microwave without 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.660
 cleanings 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.149
 not work we put on fire closing 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.460
 lid and wait until the water boils 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.269
 further rearranged to the weakest 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.119
 comforter 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.650
 unscrew the handle to the position 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.900
 minimum heat put the pot 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.720
 cover and set the timer 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.909
 for about 40 minutes the readiness of potatoes 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.070
 can be identified by poking and and fork 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.619
 fallen down tuber is soft and easy 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.540
 falling apart now in the water 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.970
 need to merge the simplest option 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.979
 catch all the potatoes and put it on 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.340
 plate then calmly drain 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.770
 pot put the potatoes back 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.189
 proceed to increase pressure 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.750
 we need butter 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.390
 will not necessarily expensive 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.180
 and the cheapest thing you can find if she 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.729
 was from milk they are vegetable margarine 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.149
 or as marketers call it now 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.280
 spread per kilo of potatoes we need 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.369
 about a third of the usual 200 grams 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.890
 packs butter cut it in cubism style 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.500
 for convenience, put on top of another hot 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.659
 potatoes and close the lid as you can see 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.430
 I have two dice left until butter 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.439
 melted by the heat of the potato 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.660
 get milk out of the fridge 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.120
 a kilo of potatoes we need a mug 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.160
 Milk, that is about 300 milliliters 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.870
 put a cup of milk 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.660
 wave fku for a minute or two so she 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.940
 warmed when the milk is heated butter 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.700
 already begin to melt pour in there 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.430
 milk can now be a little salt 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.770
 do not get carried away well and now we take 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.069
 feather pen and carefully all further 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.950
 we mix without leaving lumps 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.139
 ready now we cover and give 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.780
 brew for about 20 minutes for butter and milk 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:42.980
 imbibed in the starch potatoes all you can 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.659
 I don't like hay but special aesthetes 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.659
 can decorate with greens to taste
