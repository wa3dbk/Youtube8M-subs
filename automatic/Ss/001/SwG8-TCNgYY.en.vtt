00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.000 
you've cut them then you make a mixture
of<00:01:45.490> Elmer's<00:01:46.060> glue<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.390> water<00:01:46.840> okay<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.560> you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
of Elmer's glue and water okay and you

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.550 
of Elmer's glue and water okay and you
could<00:01:48.220> make<00:01:48.430> it<00:01:48.610> as<00:01:48.910> as<00:01:49.600> thick<00:01:50.260> as<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.530> want

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
could make it as as thick as you want

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.980 
could make it as as thick as you want
the<00:01:51.160> Elmer's<00:01:51.460> glue<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.940> added<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.630> little<00:01:52.870> bit

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
the Elmer's glue I added a little bit

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.630 
the Elmer's glue I added a little bit
too<00:01:53.170> much<00:01:53.320> so<00:01:53.380> they're<00:01:53.770> really<00:01:53.950> stiff<00:01:54.370> today

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
too much so they're really stiff today

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.040 
too much so they're really stiff today
you<00:01:54.820> know<00:01:54.940> one<00:01:55.090> thing<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.420> really<00:01:55.780> like<00:01:56.020> about

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
you know one thing I really like about

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.770 
you know one thing I really like about
it<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.710> almost<00:01:56.920> gives<00:01:57.400> it<00:01:57.610> like<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:57.790> paper

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
it is it almost gives it like a paper

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.380 
it is it almost gives it like a paper
light<00:01:59.230> sure<00:01:59.890> I<00:01:59.920> mean<00:02:00.160> they<00:02:00.490> kind<00:02:00.670> of<00:02:00.820> been<00:02:01.060> on

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
light sure I mean they kind of been on

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.050 
light sure I mean they kind of been on
the<00:02:01.480> mold<00:02:01.870> just<00:02:02.290> right<00:02:02.770> just<00:02:02.920> like<00:02:03.250> paper<00:02:03.790> wood

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
the mold just right just like paper wood

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.750 
the mold just right just like paper wood
right<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:04.840> so<00:02:05.350> once<00:02:06.160> you've<00:02:06.310> done<00:02:06.400> that<00:02:06.460> you

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
right and so once you've done that you

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.580 
right and so once you've done that you
wring<00:02:07.000> out<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.300> glue<00:02:07.510> and<00:02:07.810> then<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.289> just<00:02:08.470> set

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
wring out the glue and then you just set

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.020 
wring out the glue and then you just set
them<00:02:08.709> out<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.920> dry<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:09.610> does<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.849> take<00:02:10.000> very

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
them out to dry it does it take very

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.150 
them out to dry it does it take very
long<00:02:10.360> for<00:02:10.629> them<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.840> dry<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:11.590> put<00:02:11.950> them<00:02:12.069> in

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
long for them to dry you can put them in

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.370 
long for them to dry you can put them in
the<00:02:12.250> dryer<00:02:12.520> which<00:02:13.030> I've<00:02:13.209> done

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
the dryer which I've done

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.830 
the dryer which I've done
the<00:02:14.470> process<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:16.120> otherwise<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.570> can<00:02:16.690> leave

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
the process but otherwise you can leave

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.090 
the process but otherwise you can leave
them<00:02:16.930> overnight<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.500> they'll<00:02:17.620> pay<00:02:17.770> in<00:02:17.980> the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
them overnight and they'll pay in the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.830 
them overnight and they'll pay in the
morning<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:18.910> once<00:02:19.150> you've<00:02:19.300> done<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.480> then

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
morning so once you've done that then

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.720 
morning so once you've done that then
you<00:02:19.900> just<00:02:20.200> layer<00:02:20.380> your<00:02:20.650> flowers<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.430> I

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
you just layer your flowers and I

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.040 
you just layer your flowers and I
usually<00:02:21.940> do<00:02:22.210> about<00:02:22.330> three<00:02:23.280> per<00:02:24.280> per<00:02:25.030> size<00:02:25.330> and

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
usually do about three per per size and

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.200 
usually do about three per per size and
it<00:02:26.260> seems<00:02:26.470> like<00:02:26.620> with<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.460> mean<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:28.000> don't

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
it seems like with this I mean you don't

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.210 
it seems like with this I mean you don't
have<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.510> be<00:02:28.600> exactly<00:02:29.080> precise<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.890> mean<00:02:30.040> right

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
have to be exactly precise I mean right

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.250 
have to be exactly precise I mean right
it<00:02:30.610> just<00:02:31.090> seems<00:02:31.240> like<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.480> more<00:02:31.660> layers<00:02:31.990> the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
it just seems like the more layers the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.540 
it just seems like the more layers the
better<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.650> notice<00:02:32.920> like<00:02:32.950> over<00:02:33.250> here<00:02:33.460> you

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
better and I notice like over here you

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.100 
better and I notice like over here you
actually<00:02:33.850> added<00:02:34.030> some<00:02:34.180> other<00:02:34.300> things<00:02:34.600> so<00:02:34.810> cool

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
uh-huh you could add some tulle in there

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.090 
uh-huh you could add some tulle in there
okay<00:02:37.270> so<00:02:37.630> anyway<00:02:37.960> so<00:02:38.020> you've<00:02:38.380> got<00:02:38.560> your<00:02:38.710> your

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
layers there and then what is the next

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.440 
layers there and then what is the next
thing<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.400> do<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:42.730> then<00:02:43.090> what<00:02:43.300> you'd

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
a button there's lots of different

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.370 
a button there's lots of different
options<00:02:51.700> for<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.420> center<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:52.990> love<00:02:53.230> it

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
options for the center and I love it

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.160 
options for the center and I love it
this<00:02:53.530> basic<00:02:54.220> um<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.910> know<00:02:55.030> process<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:56.080> know

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
this basic um you know process you know

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.110 
this basic um you know process you know
just<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.740> step<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.070> cutting<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.460> out<00:02:57.580> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
just the step of cutting it out the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.150 
just the step of cutting it out the
Elmer's<00:02:58.480> glue<00:02:58.720> letting<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.350> dry<00:02:59.560> punching<00:03:00.100> a

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
Elmer's glue letting it dry punching a

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.850 
Elmer's glue letting it dry punching a
hole<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.880> those<00:03:01.090> very<00:03:01.360> basic<00:03:01.540> steps<00:03:02.020> you<00:03:02.710> can

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
hole so those very basic steps you can

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.930 
hole so those very basic steps you can
create<00:03:03.100> all<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.460> these<00:03:03.580> different<00:03:03.910> things

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
create all of these different things

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.570 
create all of these different things
