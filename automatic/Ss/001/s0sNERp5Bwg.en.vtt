Hello everyone!

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:34.481
Today we're on Final Fantasy XIV A realm Reborn again

00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:39.520
For the 2nd video i've made on the game, where we'll fight Titan

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:44.809
I said that i'd might make another raid that'd come after the first one

00:01:45.168 --> 00:01:50.144
But i thought, since we just fought Titan this afternoon, and that was a really good fight

00:01:50.534 --> 00:02:02.578
I thought it might be more interesting to do a video on him than on the first raid of the game which are simple

00:02:02.796 --> 00:02:06.170
We're fighting now a Summon from the game

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.987
It's the battle at level 34 or 35, Because there's more than one battle

00:02:11.987 --> 00:02:20.003
There's the storyline one, this one, one at level 50 and third one, Extreme mode

00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:27.120
Which nobody tried yet since it wasn't available even on the first version

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:34.558
He does a lot of AoE, that's a problem when we're Pugilist or Monk

00:02:34.558 --> 00:02:42.326
I was monk since at level 30 we can change our Class to the job

00:02:42.326 --> 00:02:48.817
The big problem with Pugilist or Monk, it's a Melee that fighter near Enemy

00:02:48.817 --> 00:02:55.275
But still keep at small armors, like Ranger,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.593
That's the problem, yes we do lot of damage, but we can get really hurt fighting boss

00:03:02.593 --> 00:03:10.048
We need to be careful now because he wont only do an attack at the center of the area

00:03:10.267 --> 00:03:16.227
But as you could see, there was a red circle at the edge of the area

00:03:16.227 --> 00:03:20.454
It's a part of the area that'll be destroyed, so we shouldn't be there

00:03:20.672 --> 00:03:28.737
That's another of his special attack where he'll get someone in stone

00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:40.515
And then we have to break the stone to get the player free, or we have one less person for the fight

00:03:40.515 --> 00:03:50.509
There he just used a front AoE we really need to avoid because

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:57.879
It'll throw us back, and in this battlefield there's no invisible wall

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:05.804
And we can fall from the edge and die

00:04:05.804 --> 00:04:12.371
So we really need to avoid his attack because we can easily die, and can't get raise

00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:21.500
Because then we're at the bottom of the area, and there's no way a White Mage could target us

00:04:21.732 --> 00:04:26.755
That's why we need to be careful

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:33.325
I think that's all for his attack, once again it's only the storyline battle

00:04:33.557 --> 00:04:37.940
It might not be the most dificult fight of Titan, but it's still a great fight

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:48.145
Here i've made a mistake, one of the person was stuck in a stone

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:56.193
And something happened IRL, i couldn't focus

00:04:56.193 --> 00:05:04.523
And didn't saw the person was stuck, so it took me a little time before i'd see it

00:05:04.523 --> 00:05:09.843
So that was a mistake i've made, but thanksfully it still went fine

00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:31.122
The fight is about to end, i hope you liked this video on Titan

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:45.756
I'll make another video of the game soon, maybe not on a whole raids like i did last time

00:05:45.756 --> 00:05:52.089
But maybe another boss from a Raids, i did one for exemple in some Maya Ruins, which was really interesting

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:56.628
And it's not a raids from the storyline so no spoiler at all!

00:05:56.628 --> 00:06:00.527
I hope you liked this video
