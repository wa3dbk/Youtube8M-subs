this is being used but basically

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.630 
this is being used but basically
normally<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.349> old<00:02:10.590> jail<00:02:10.979> inside

to heat it up and then you pop the way
thing<00:02:14.430> inside<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.300> goes<00:02:16.290> hard<00:02:16.830> like<00:02:17.100> this

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.949 
ended we cover and I think it's such a
cute<00:02:23.010> idea<00:02:23.190> especially<00:02:24.000> for<00:02:24.450> winter<00:02:24.810> where

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
cute idea especially for winter where
