00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.520
 Hello, everyone is Iwata of Nintendo 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.090
 I would like to tell you directly to you today 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.600
 Always published from the room where the president recorded the recording 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:20.669
 Just one month ago at Nintendo Conference 2008 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.119
 A presentation on Nintendo Suites 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.999
 I was allowed to 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:28.550
 At that moment 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.979
 Nintendo has problems with the spread of ds 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.160
 We have to go over new hurdles that have not been found in previous game consoles 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.250
 Not 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.900
 I told you that 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.970
 that is 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.300
 But if stereovision does not actually experience 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.039
 Its utilization 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.450
 Can not realize 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.070
 It was said 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.920
 In fact, I feel myself again 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.890
 We somehow get in touch with the new gaming experience 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.320
 Is it impossible? 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.930
 Registering in a presentation or event configuration 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.640
 Of what I tried 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.210
 If you do not experience it directly, expect it to be used 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.979
 It is said that the result is not 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.770
 God 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.860
 Visit the Nintendo Conference 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.340
 Echoes of everyone who actually experienced it 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.360
 Presentation of everyone you saw through the Internet 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.520
 In the echo 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520
 There seems to be a big difference 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.820
 You can do this on the screen of Nintendo 3ds via the Internet 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.170
 I want to show- 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.510
 Resolution is higher than before 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.670
 I can feel that the picture is beautiful 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.530
 But tell how it looks in stereovision 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.850
 can do 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.210
 I feel myself 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.790
 Even with the exception of stereovision 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.770
 It is photographed on the screen such as novelty through the Internet 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.590
 With the picture of the game screen 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.040
 I care about myself 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.740
 Different attraction to the video of the game screen reflected on the screen of Nintendo 3ds 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.550
 Feeling 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.540
 Between the municipalities feels attractive but it is natural 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.519
 While 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.569
 I do not use it 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.010
 Sorry 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.870
 Nintendo 3des 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.310
 If you do not have the opportunity to actually experience it 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.719
 To convey the value to the customer until the release is 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.459
 I realized again that it was very difficult 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:29.949
 So today 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.189
 To the customer 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.609
 Thinking about how to experience Nintendo 3 technology 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.609
 I want to let you know 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.049
 It is fixed at the time of Nintendo Conference 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.109
 It was not possible to talk at that time because it was not 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.289
 But 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:50.589
 3 days from 10th 9th January 8 next year 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.379
 At the Makuhari Messe Exhibition Hall, etc. 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.989
 Intended for the introduction experience of Nintendo 3des 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.040
 We decided to carry out an experience event for customers 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:07.719
 Details are announced on the Nintendo website 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.999
 I will 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.889
 But what is the new game by 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.249
 Is it 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.249
 How does it change with the conventional Nintendo ds 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:21.349
 Ready for any soft spring release and its near future 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.209
 Is it done? 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.459
 With the opportunity to introduce to game fans 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.649
 I want to do 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.669
 The world's first customer to experience Nintendo ds 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.139
 Was an opportunity to 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.159
 As we are preparing 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.599
 To many of you 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.369
 Please come visit me by all means 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:45.199
 We think that we want you to realize the utilization of Nintendo cds for the first time by yourself 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.989
 I am 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.810
 Nintendo's sole event will be held other 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.329
 I do not do it at the moment 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.540
 Other than those who live in the metropolitan area, you can experience before release 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.659
 Continue to this just-to-do event to 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.529
 We have an opportunity to have you come in touch with Nintendo after the actual release 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:08.419
 To do 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.439
 As we plan some approaches 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.459
 When you can specifically notify 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.459
 We will notify you at any time 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.659
 People who have ever used Nintendo ds 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:22.360
 To 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.510
 I was able to feel the response from the whole 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.639
 We are proud of 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.620
 Our new proposal acknowledges many customers in the world 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.169
 Whether you can 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.169
 I believe that it is what you get your customers 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.699
 We are now in the midst of development 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.659
 When everybody saw in January 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.949
 Main stream of future entertainment 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.960
 I want to make an effort to feel the response firmly 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.349
 I think so 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.370
 It was a specification that can be done here 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.370
 I hope you will come by all means 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.349
 What I want to know about town is a costume 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.959
 Thank you for seeing it today
