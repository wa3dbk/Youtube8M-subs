00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
so I don't have to use my fingers as a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.639 
so I don't have to use my fingers as a
mess<00:00:37.800> by<00:00:37.980> trying<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.340> actually<00:00:38.579> pull<00:00:39.030> an<00:00:39.649> arrow

with<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> slingshot<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:42.090> using<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> grip

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
with the slingshot just using the grip

with the slingshot just using the grip
your<00:00:42.930> hand<00:00:43.610> uses<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.820> much<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.390> forearm

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660

muscles<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> actual<00:00:47.460> arrow<00:00:47.879> would

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
muscles that the actual arrow would

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.000

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.290 
shake as you're trying to shoot it
that's<00:00:50.579> not<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:50.969> accurate

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
that's not very accurate

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.260 
that's not very accurate
this<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.690> extremely<00:00:52.110> accurate<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:54.120> way<00:00:54.239> I

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
this is extremely accurate the way I

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.229 
this is extremely accurate the way I
shoot<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:55.250> is<00:00:56.250> using<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> arrow<00:00:56.910> release

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
shoot this is using the arrow release

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.270 
shoot this is using the arrow release
which<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.809> apposite<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.800> hook<00:00:58.980> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
which is apposite this a little hook I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
which is apposite this a little hook I
clamp<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> D<00:01:00.870> loop<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:03.199> hold<00:01:04.199> the

clamp it on to the D loop I hold the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.660 
clamp it on to the D loop I hold the
sling<00:01:04.890> bow<00:01:05.299> parallel<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> ground<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.549> I'm

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
sling bow parallel to the ground so I'm

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
sling bow parallel to the ground so I'm
literally<00:01:09.060> making<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.600> virtual<00:01:10.080> vertical<00:01:10.530> line

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
literally making a virtual vertical line

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.039 
literally making a virtual vertical line
right<00:01:11.100> between<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.580> posts<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.570> hole<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
right between the posts and the hole the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.440 
right between the posts and the hole the
whisker<00:01:13.380> biscuit<00:01:13.580> this<00:01:14.580> vertical<00:01:15.119> line<00:01:15.270> is

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
whisker biscuit this vertical line is

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.609 
whisker biscuit this vertical line is
actually<00:01:15.600> very<00:01:15.869> important<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.290> aiming

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
actually very important for aiming

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.249 
actually very important for aiming
because<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.670> take<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.000> line<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.420> bisect<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
because I take that line on a bisect the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.499 
because I take that line on a bisect the
target<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.670> pretty<00:01:20.850> much<00:01:20.939> already<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.390> my

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
target and I pretty much already have my

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.179 
target and I pretty much already have my
windage<00:01:21.869> automatically<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
windage automatically I just have to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.010 
windage automatically I just have to
work<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.430> elevation<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.509> very<00:01:24.659> accurate

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
work on elevation and it's very accurate

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.190 
work on elevation and it's very accurate
I<00:01:25.310> place<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.340> thumb<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.630> bottom<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.049> the

I place my thumb on the bottom of the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.859 
I place my thumb on the bottom of the
frame<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.740> sling<00:01:28.979> bo<00:01:29.329> what<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.479> does<00:01:30.659> it

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
frame of the sling bo what that does it

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.350 
frame of the sling bo what that does it
prevents<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:32.040> pulling<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.790> whisker

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
prevents the pulling of the whisker

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.749 
prevents the pulling of the whisker
biscuit<00:01:33.540> back<00:01:34.079> toward<00:01:34.409> me<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.770> I'm<00:01:35.070> pulling

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
biscuit back toward me as I'm pulling

to my target

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.080 
to my target
I<00:01:40.650> don't<00:01:41.189> wanted<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.610> anything

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
I don't wanted to have anything

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.679 
I don't wanted to have anything
interfere<00:01:42.600> with<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> path<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.290> arrow

interfere with the path of the arrow

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.330 
interfere with the path of the arrow
which<00:01:45.170> actually<00:01:45.380> brings<00:01:45.530> me<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:45.979> a<00:01:46.039> point<00:01:46.189> of

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
which actually brings me to a point of

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.859 
which actually brings me to a point of
the<00:01:46.399> reason<00:01:46.700> why<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:46.939> whisker<00:01:47.390> biscuit<00:01:47.509> is

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
the reason why this whisker biscuit is

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.389 
the reason why this whisker biscuit is
actually<00:01:48.170> fixed<00:01:48.499> and<00:01:48.619> sturdy<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:49.100> does<00:01:49.219> not

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
actually fixed and sturdy it does not

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.429 
actually fixed and sturdy it does not
fold<00:01:49.579> down<00:01:49.789> it<00:01:50.390> doesn't<00:01:50.689> move<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:50.899> any<00:01:51.049> way<00:01:51.229> I

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
fold down it doesn't move in any way I

to use my actual archery draw length

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.770 
to use my actual archery draw length
that's<00:02:20.430> dependent<00:02:20.970> upon<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.390> length<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.690> my

arms some people get confused by

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.590 
arms some people get confused by
thinking<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.760> would<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.270> use<00:02:27.390> very

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
thinking that I would have to use very

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.330 
thinking that I would have to use very
small<00:02:27.780> arrows<00:02:28.380> because<00:02:28.710> this<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.160> a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
small arrows because this is just a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.460 
small arrows because this is just a
sling<00:02:29.670> shot<00:02:29.700> that's<00:02:30.690> not<00:02:30.810> correct

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
sling shot that's not correct

00:02:31.470 --> 00:05:42.500 
sling shot that's not correct
this<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.190> an<00:02:32.310> actual<00:02:32.670> archery<00:02:33.270> weapon

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510

so<00:05:43.110> as<00:05:43.260> you<00:05:43.410> can<00:05:43.500> see<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:44.750> shot<00:05:45.750> those<00:05:45.900> arrows

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
so as you can see I shot those arrows

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.860 
so as you can see I shot those arrows
without<00:05:47.040> any<00:05:47.280> camera<00:05:47.700> cutting<00:05:48.030> I<00:05:48.210> wanted<00:05:48.810> to

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.180 
without any camera cutting I wanted to

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
can't see exactly where the arrows

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.560 
can't see exactly where the arrows
landed<00:06:01.520> but<00:06:02.520> I<00:06:02.610> don't<00:06:02.820> want<00:06:02.970> to<00:06:03.000> use<00:06:03.150> any<00:06:03.330> trick
