Belladonna anthrax is the band that I

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.100

think<00:00:45.730> of<00:00:45.880> when<00:00:46.030> I<00:00:46.090> think<00:00:46.210> of<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.690> big<00:00:46.809> four<00:00:47.050> I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
think of when I think of the big four I

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.810 
think of when I think of the big four I
think<00:00:47.469> of<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.739> among<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.010> living<00:00:48.250> record<00:00:48.670> I

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
think of the among the living record I

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.740 
think of the among the living record I
think<00:00:49.059> of<00:00:49.180> 86<00:00:49.660> 87<00:00:50.140> of<00:00:50.410> that<00:00:50.559> time<00:00:50.800> period<00:00:51.070> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
think of 86 87 of that time period and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.360 
think of 86 87 of that time period and
so<00:00:52.750> it<00:00:52.840> just<00:00:52.870> made<00:00:53.200> sense<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.680> we<00:00:53.800> met<00:00:54.160> up<00:00:54.190> with

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
so it just made sense and we met up with

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.700 
so it just made sense and we met up with
Joey<00:00:54.550> in<00:00:54.700> New<00:00:54.850> York<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.210> we<00:00:55.300> had<00:00:55.559> can't<00:00:56.559> even
