else like if you need a button this
needs<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.599> replace<00:03:36.080> no<00:03:36.470> extras<00:03:37.099> it's<00:03:37.459> just

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
needs to replace no extras it's just

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.720 
needs to replace no extras it's just
right<00:03:38.390> here<00:03:38.690> that's<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.190> then<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.489> same

anything customers usually ask about the

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.000 
anything customers usually ask about the
unit<00:03:49.360> like<00:03:50.360> usually<00:03:50.989> with<00:03:51.349> let's<00:03:51.709> say<00:03:51.860> they

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
unit like usually with let's say they

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.580 
unit like usually with let's say they
get<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.519> it<00:03:53.180> still<00:03:53.450> is<00:03:53.569> not<00:03:53.750> working<00:03:54.230> what

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
get it and it still is not working what

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.930 
get it and it still is not working what
are<00:03:54.620> some<00:03:54.950> other<00:03:55.099> options<00:03:55.280> they<00:03:55.700> could<00:03:55.849> do

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
are some other options they could do

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.580 
are some other options they could do
before<00:03:56.090> sending<00:03:56.599> it<00:03:56.720> back<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:56.900> us<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.470> be

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
before sending it back to us to be

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.680 
before sending it back to us to be
checked<00:03:57.890> because<00:03:58.099> we<00:03:58.340> do<00:03:58.519> what<00:03:58.910> stops<00:03:59.239> working

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
checked because we do what stops working

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.589 
checked because we do what stops working
there<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.650> blend<00:04:01.040> or<00:04:01.250> motor<00:04:01.519> if<00:04:01.880> it's<00:04:02.390> not

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
there is a blend or motor if it's not

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.569 
there is a blend or motor if it's not
blowing<00:04:02.810> hot<00:04:02.959> or<00:04:03.290> cold<00:04:03.470> air<00:04:03.709> and<00:04:04.130> where's<00:04:04.370> that

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
blowing hot or cold air and where's that

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.900 
blowing hot or cold air and where's that
up<00:04:04.730> that's<00:04:05.630> behind<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.440> batch<00:04:06.650> that<00:04:07.549> so<00:04:07.760> that

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
up that's behind the batch that so that

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.880 
up that's behind the batch that so that
would<00:04:08.000> be<00:04:08.090> like<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.269> whole<00:04:08.450> other<00:04:08.510> yeah<00:04:09.200> some

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
would be like a whole other yeah some

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.610 
would be like a whole other yeah some
situation<00:04:10.610> so<00:04:11.150> in<00:04:11.360> case<00:04:11.569> it's<00:04:11.810> a<00:04:11.959> customer<00:04:12.470> is

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
situation so in case it's a customer is

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.750 
situation so in case it's a customer is
not<00:04:12.769> sure<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.819> could<00:04:14.030> be<00:04:14.060> this<00:04:14.329> what<00:04:14.660> are<00:04:14.810> other

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
not sure it could be this what are other

not sure it could be this what are other
things<00:04:16.760> they<00:04:16.970> could<00:04:17.030> do<00:04:17.329> if<00:04:17.630> they<00:04:18.380> don't<00:04:18.500> know

things they could do if they don't know

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.199 
things they could do if they don't know
for<00:04:18.889> sure<00:04:18.919> is<00:04:19.250> this<00:04:19.459> like<00:04:19.669> it's<00:04:19.850> blowing<00:04:20.000> out

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
for sure is this like it's blowing out

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.120 
for sure is this like it's blowing out
defrost<00:04:20.690> but<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:21.019> has<00:04:21.169> another<00:04:21.440> problem

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
defrost but it has another problem

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.920 
defrost but it has another problem

um AC resistor AC blower motor they

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.390 
um AC resistor AC blower motor they
should<00:04:27.169> get<00:04:27.320> that<00:04:27.470> checked<00:04:27.800> by<00:04:27.919> mechanic

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
should get that checked by mechanic

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.060 
should get that checked by mechanic
correct<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.510> let's<00:04:29.720> see<00:04:29.930> certified<00:04:30.470> is<00:04:30.800> there

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
correct and let's see certified is there

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.800 
correct and let's see certified is there
anything<00:04:31.310> they<00:04:31.610> could<00:04:31.789> do<00:04:31.970> on<00:04:32.000> their<00:04:32.300> own<00:04:32.360> make

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
anything they could do on their own make

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.390 
anything they could do on their own make
themselves<00:04:33.380> or<00:04:33.590> is<00:04:33.680> better<00:04:33.860> off<00:04:34.039> from<00:04:34.310> the

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
themselves or is better off from the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
Kanak check in the foil they can check

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.610 
Kanak check in the foil they can check
the<00:04:36.500> fuses<00:04:37.039> on<00:04:37.220> their<00:04:37.400> own<00:04:37.550> okay<00:04:38.289> and<00:04:39.289> that

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
the fuses on their own okay and that

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.980 
the fuses on their own okay and that
goes<00:04:39.800> for<00:04:40.010> both<00:04:40.070> AC<00:04:40.550> heaters<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.419> LC<00:04:41.870> and

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
goes for both AC heaters and LC and

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.860 
goes for both AC heaters and LC and
boxes<00:04:42.380> correct<00:04:43.010> now<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.610> LCM<00:04:44.180> boxes<00:04:44.570> you<00:04:44.690> have

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
boxes correct now the LCM boxes you have

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.719 
boxes correct now the LCM boxes you have
this<00:04:45.080> type<00:04:45.440> what<00:04:45.800> about<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.160> other<00:04:46.340> one<00:04:46.580> is

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
this type what about the other one is

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.190 
this type what about the other one is
for<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.389> Lincoln<00:04:47.720> Towncar

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
for the Lincoln Towncar

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.100 
for the Lincoln Towncar
I<00:04:48.350> believe<00:04:48.760> yeah<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.940> main<00:04:50.120> one<00:04:50.300> we<00:04:50.510> focus<00:04:50.720> on

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
I believe yeah the main one we focus on

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.469 
I believe yeah the main one we focus on
it's<00:04:51.320> all<00:04:51.470> three<00:04:51.710> 205<00:04:52.220> okay<00:04:53.030> so<00:04:53.090> it's<00:04:53.300> just

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
it's all three 205 okay so it's just

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.310 
it's all three 205 okay so it's just
this<00:04:53.599> one<00:04:53.780> at<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.050> foot<00:04:54.740> by<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.310> LCM<00:04:56.320> where's

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
this one at the foot by the LCM where's

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.310 
this one at the foot by the LCM where's
the<00:04:57.560> fuse<00:04:57.830> box<00:04:58.419> if<00:04:59.419> they<00:04:59.630> wanted<00:04:59.900> to<00:05:00.050> check<00:05:00.260> to

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
the fuse box if they wanted to check to

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.460 
the fuse box if they wanted to check to
see<00:05:00.530> that<00:05:01.599> because<00:05:02.599> they<00:05:02.840> say<00:05:03.050> there's<00:05:03.229> more

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
see that because they say there's more

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:13.260 
see that because they say there's more
than<00:05:03.650> one<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:06.020> fuses<00:05:06.740> box<00:05:07.490> is<00:05:07.760> located

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.240 

take<00:05:14.270> it<00:05:14.419> off<00:05:14.599> and<00:05:15.169> you<00:05:15.530> have<00:05:15.560> your<00:05:15.710> owner's

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
take it off and you have your owner's
