00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.630 
is this color here again it's shimmery
and<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.440> reason<00:02:45.740> why<00:02:45.830> I'm<00:02:45.890> using<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.190> lovely

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
and the reason why I'm using this lovely

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.940 
and the reason why I'm using this lovely
take<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.940> brush<00:02:47.210> is<00:02:48.080> because<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:48.590> needs<00:02:48.830> to

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
take the brush is because this needs to

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:58.089 
take the brush is because this needs to
go<00:02:49.160> through<00:02:49.820> a<00:02:50.000> socket<00:02:51.940> quite<00:02:52.940> high<00:02:53.270> up

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.899 

so<00:02:58.700> all<00:02:58.939> the<00:02:59.090> way<00:02:59.209> across<00:02:59.510> and<00:03:00.760> then<00:03:01.760> this

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
so all the way across and then this

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:14.680 
so all the way across and then this
flicks<00:03:02.299> out

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.600 

so<00:03:15.200> if<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.380> can<00:03:15.500> see<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.800> line<00:03:16.010> up<00:03:16.250> draw<00:03:16.460> and

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
so if you can see that line up draw and

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.710 
so if you can see that line up draw and
that's<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.850> kind<00:03:17.030> of<00:03:17.060> line<00:03:17.270> now<00:03:17.300> I'm<00:03:17.510> going<00:03:17.660> to

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
that's the kind of line now I'm going to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.690 
that's the kind of line now I'm going to
be<00:03:17.810> following<00:03:17.960> but<00:03:18.860> what<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.070> need<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.310> do<00:03:19.490> now

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
be following but what you need to do now

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.970 
be following but what you need to do now
is<00:03:20.030> just<00:03:20.330> keep<00:03:20.570> building<00:03:20.960> on<00:03:21.350> this<00:03:21.470> line<00:03:23.980> and

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
is just keep building on this line and

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.440 
is just keep building on this line and
then<00:03:25.430> take<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.700> 207<00:03:26.450> brush<00:03:27.850> so<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:28.910> can<00:03:29.210> use<00:03:29.300> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
then take a 207 brush so you can use the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.690 
then take a 207 brush so you can use the
one<00:03:29.570> that<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.810> use<00:03:30.170> naked<00:03:30.500> lunch<00:03:30.710> with<00:03:30.920> and

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
one that you use naked lunch with and

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.020 
one that you use naked lunch with and
just<00:03:31.910> blend<00:03:32.270> it<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:34.370> then<00:03:34.490> take<00:03:34.670> your<00:03:34.790> brown

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
just blend it and then take your brown

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.030 
just blend it and then take your brown
eyeshadow<00:03:35.480> again<00:03:35.810> with<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.290> smaller<00:03:36.590> tapered

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
eyeshadow again with a smaller tapered

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.200 
eyeshadow again with a smaller tapered
brush<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:40.190> will<00:03:40.340> give<00:03:40.460> you<00:03:40.520> a<00:03:40.580> more<00:03:40.730> definite

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
brush this will give you a more definite

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:51.550 
brush this will give you a more definite
line<00:03:41.390> going<00:03:41.780> over<00:03:41.960> this<00:03:42.080> smaller<00:03:42.410> brush

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.860 

so<00:03:52.130> it's<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.520> really<00:03:52.880> quite<00:03:53.150> definite<00:03:53.660> line

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
so it's a really quite definite line

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.280 
so it's a really quite definite line
like<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:55.420> but<00:03:56.420> because<00:03:56.480> it's<00:03:56.780> shimmery<00:03:57.170> it

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
like that but because it's shimmery it

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.040 
like that but because it's shimmery it
doesn't<00:03:57.650> look<00:03:57.740> too<00:03:58.160> harsh<00:03:58.780> when<00:03:59.780> we<00:03:59.900> are

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
doesn't look too harsh when we are

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.290 
doesn't look too harsh when we are
blending<00:04:00.260> out<00:04:00.620> okay<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.610> next<00:04:01.880> stages<00:04:02.060> we

eyeshadow<00:05:48.810> brush<00:05:49.290> and<00:05:49.320> shimmery<00:05:50.280> white

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
eyeshadow brush and shimmery white

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.370 
eyeshadow brush and shimmery white
eyeshadow<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:52.970> pop<00:05:53.970> this<00:05:54.210> underneath<00:05:55.050> the

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
eyeshadow and pop this underneath the

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:01.210 
eyeshadow and pop this underneath the
eyeliner<00:05:56.450> not<00:05:57.450> too<00:05:57.690> much<00:05:57.900> of<00:05:58.110> this<00:05:58.260> just<00:06:00.170> there

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
eyeliner not too much of this just there

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.620 
eyeliner not too much of this just there
as<00:06:02.220> beyonce<00:06:02.670> has<00:06:03.030> done<00:06:03.270> that
