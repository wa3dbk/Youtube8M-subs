00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.290 

probably<00:00:47.870> that<00:00:48.140> I<00:00:48.410> should<00:00:48.770> always<00:00:49.129> like<00:00:49.969> do<00:00:50.149> my

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
probably that I should always like do my

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.040 
probably that I should always like do my
best<00:00:51.039> for<00:00:52.039> example<00:00:52.610> in<00:00:52.820> Singapore<00:00:53.390> dumb

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
best for example in Singapore dumb

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.229 
best for example in Singapore dumb
the<00:00:55.620> day<00:00:55.800> before<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.190> competition<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:57.059> had

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the day before the competition we had

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.060 
the day before the competition we had
just<00:00:57.450> a<00:00:57.600> training<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.829> still

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
just a training but it was still

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 
just a training but it was still
important<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.879> show<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> judges<00:01:00.540> that<00:01:00.750> I

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
important to show the judges that I

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.070 
important to show the judges that I
could<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.500> even<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:02.040> it<00:01:02.190> wasn't<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.790> competition

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
could do even if it wasn't a competition

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.690 
could do even if it wasn't a competition
it<00:01:04.080> was<00:01:04.229> only<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> practice<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:05.129> had<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.460> show<00:01:05.640> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it was only a practice I had to show to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490 
it was only a practice I had to show to
the<00:01:05.880> judges<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.750> could<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.260> really

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the judges that I could do it really

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.640 
the judges that I could do it really
well<00:01:09.320> when<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.560> look<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.490> those<00:01:12.650> Russian

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
well when you look at those Russian

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.469 
well when you look at those Russian
girls<00:01:13.680> competing<00:01:14.580> what's<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.240> through

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
girls competing what's going through

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.810 
girls competing what's going through
your<00:01:15.509> mind<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.140> think<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
your mind you think I can really if I

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.090 
your mind you think I can really if I
work<00:01:18.030> hard<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.540> get<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> same<00:01:19.800> level

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
work hard I can get to that same level

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.820 
work hard I can get to that same level
well<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.180> course<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.810> difficult<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.500> compare

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
well of course it's difficult to compare

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.850 
well of course it's difficult to compare
because<00:01:23.100> they're<00:01:23.520> training<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.680> seven<00:01:25.680> days

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
because they're training like seven days

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.790 
because they're training like seven days
a<00:01:25.890> week<00:01:26.040> eight<00:01:26.580> hours<00:01:26.940> a<00:01:26.970> day<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.570> I'm<00:01:28.350> going

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
a week eight hours a day and I'm going

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.710 
a week eight hours a day and I'm going
to<00:01:28.860> school<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.550> also<00:01:29.729> i'm<00:01:30.210> training<00:01:30.479> only

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
to school and also i'm training only

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.810 
to school and also i'm training only
like<00:01:30.990> four<00:01:31.259> times<00:01:31.410> four<00:01:31.770> hours<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> day<00:01:32.399> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
like four times four hours a day and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.029 
like four times four hours a day and
like<00:01:33.210> six<00:01:33.479> times<00:01:33.660> a<00:01:33.899> week<00:01:34.080> so<00:01:34.679> it's<00:01:34.860> difficult

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
like six times a week so it's difficult

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.060 
like six times a week so it's difficult
to<00:01:35.460> compare<00:01:35.820> myself<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.330> them<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.440> still<00:01:38.039> I

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
to compare myself to them but still I

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.010 
to compare myself to them but still I
think<00:01:38.190> that<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.550> can<00:01:38.850> achieve<00:01:38.970> something<00:01:39.450> like

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
think that I can achieve something like

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
think that I can achieve something like
them

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.760 

when<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:45.760> look<00:01:45.970> at<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.900> next<00:01:47.110> steps<00:01:47.440> for<00:01:47.560> you

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
when you look at the next steps for you

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.230 
when you look at the next steps for you
what<00:01:47.980> are<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.310> next<00:01:48.460> steps<00:01:48.580> what<00:01:49.030> kind<00:01:49.210> of

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
what are the next steps what kind of

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.020 
what are the next steps what kind of
goals<00:01:49.510> to<00:01:49.750> be<00:01:49.900> some<00:01:50.190> probably<00:01:51.190> learning<00:01:51.580> like

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
goals to be some probably learning like

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.230 
goals to be some probably learning like

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
new difficulties yes more more difficult

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.700 
new difficulties yes more more difficult
