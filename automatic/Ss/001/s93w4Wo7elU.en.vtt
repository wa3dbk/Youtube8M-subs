00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:09.000
 guys tell them about what they found to run to 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:10.830
 me the first half the game was difficult 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.130
 for us there is not so as you expected of course 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.080
 let's say two goals that you yourself 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.180
 drove 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.560
 in the second time pieces add scored 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.239
 spiritual 2 methyl and captured playing 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.670
 not bad created a lot of moments 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.519
 they simply did not implement if called upon 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:35.010
 It was all different and of course very much 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:41.310
 sorry it's time to go down to a good 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:43.769
 team what dates play good 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:50.849
 teams senka book lies on teams 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:54.090
 this had an idea of â€‹â€‹my opinion as 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.350
 at the goalkeeper that did not prompt in time 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.660
 released the ball missed the second goal 20 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.799
 after the ending of the second half more or less 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.660
 already something began to turn out well that 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.910
 second half second half completely 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.870
 Owned initiatives have created a lot of good 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.870
 moments unfortunately did not realize 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.870
 thank
