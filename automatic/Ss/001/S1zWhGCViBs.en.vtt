to<00:06:15.110> dispel<00:06:15.470> it<00:06:15.530> and<00:06:15.920> might<00:06:16.430> reveal<00:06:16.460> all<00:06:17.300> of

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
to dispel it and might reveal all of

to dispel it and might reveal all of
Raymond<00:06:18.140> tail<00:06:18.290> at<00:06:18.440> the<00:06:18.470> stadium<00:06:19.070> and<00:06:19.720> I<00:06:20.720> guess

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
Raymond tail at the stadium and I guess

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.920 
Raymond tail at the stadium and I guess
if<00:06:21.650> they're<00:06:22.280> caught<00:06:22.730> then<00:06:23.300> that<00:06:23.540> means<00:06:23.690> they

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
if they're caught then that means they

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.230 
if they're caught then that means they
would<00:06:24.080> be<00:06:24.200> disqualified<00:06:24.670> at<00:06:25.670> first<00:06:25.940> I<00:06:26.060> thought

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
would be disqualified at first I thought

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.130
