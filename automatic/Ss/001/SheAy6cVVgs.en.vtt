 Good day dear friends with 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.389
 We are a computer educational program and in this 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.740
 video tutorial i will show you how you can 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.690
 simplify the launch of applications on behalf of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.779
 administrator and for whom it is no secret that 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.580
 windows 7 and windows 8 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.529
 action from applications that when 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.410
 start-up clarify whether you really 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.219
 want them to make changes to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.530
 your computer i have windows 81 and 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.350
 such applications that run from 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.020
 admin name you can see a reason 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.540
 so that the account icon is this 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.320
 particular doctor bret me then yes and 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.140
 scandander 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.469
 there is also a sign and here is the program 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.399
 called st st also she with such 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.110
 Here I have a scutum so when you click on 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.600
 any of these shortcuts 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.100
 Allah sent a good extra 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.730
 prompt you really want 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.150
 for this program to make changes for 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.850
 those who want to get around this one 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.939
 and run just double program 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.420
 pressing a key today i will show you how 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.810
 This can be done so I will show on 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.540
 An example of a doctor running right now thoughts 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.610
 run it, he asks us what 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.409
 do you really want to allow 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.340
 next program make a change to 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.620
 this computer 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.310
 if i click yes he doesn't 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.480
 will launch here the mode itself let's us now 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.910
 with you try to do so that when 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.050
 just click on the label that we 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.850
 Now let's create right away 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.140
 the scanner itself started directly 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.010
 doctor or further how to do it to us 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.330
 only one program is needed 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.160
 additional which is already in 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.270
 complete windows and planner 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.210
 tasks nothing complicated here 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.790
 the neighbor will come here 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.670
 then I switch task scheduler 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.570
 me windows 81 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:16.110
 so here I am already here 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.500
 practiced what you see he doesn't 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.240
 even write that result is success before 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.270
 than to record a video I start 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.270
 I tried to just but I can later 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.700
 I would somehow be interested 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:36.090
 does it really work or not here 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.690
 so everywhere I delete this 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.640
 the task 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.790
 Well, actually go to 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.410
 task scheduler and click here 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.600
 actions create a task 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.880
 here in the field name 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.960
 we need to enter some 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.350
 simple name why simple 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:02.150
 you will go further we will 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:06.190
 work doctor web then let's us with 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:10.550
 we see you with such a name 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:14.420
 just die arme all three letters of this 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.630
 enough that further needs to be done 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.490
 here we put a check run 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:26.150
 the highest took and that and after that we 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:30.560
 go to the action tab and one 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:34.940
 create button right here in this field to us 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.360
 you will need to specify the path to the folder 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.710
 where is my web doctor 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.450
 lies on disk c 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:47.420
 folder program files dr.web 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:51.680
 so what is on the desktop 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.720
 label this here is the motto of cameras called here 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.140
 actually pointed to him the way apparently 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.370
 and more and more we do nothing here 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.890
 press the ok button 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:06.840
 it appears in the action window and 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.590
 once again ok button so that's it 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.340
 planner we are minimizing and 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.709
 directly begin to engage 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.570
 creating labels then here is world lac 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.549
 here we will need to lead 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.340
 specific team 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.800
 this command will be written under video 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.890
 so you can remember nothing 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.919
 just under the roller read copy 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.470
 and put and here is such a 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.410
 the team is the only thing you need here 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:42.140
 will replace it here instead of cmd 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:45.000
 admin you will need to put a name 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.070
 the name that was displayed in the first step 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.560
 which we introduced in the first step here are those 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.000
 I have three letters deer why 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:57.000
 so I put them or tear them on 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.010
 This I press the button further further from me 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.230
 ask run and the world vk 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:07.080
 let's enter doctor web if you 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.690
 introduce accuracy like here it is not for you 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.430
 it will not give to create and if we allow 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.200
 write a doctor web scanner because 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.830
 two desktop shortcuts are the same 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.130
 by name 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.610
 will fail so I entered just not 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.790
 tear it up 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:25.800
 and pressing the button is done my 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:28.590
 a label like this let's do it now 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.540
 for this label to be beautiful but for 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.030
 so that he has an icon like here 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.360
 for this click with the right mouse button 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.690
 go to properties and here here 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.650
 The tab label is such and such a field 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.330
 change icon 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.990
 we press it 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:49.500
 he came to us he tells us that 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.080
 defaults here from sea of ​​tasks not 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.229
 contains icons select icon from 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.509
 list or specify another file click ok 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.319
 if you like something from these 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:02.180
 badges 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:04.889
 You can choose them but I will choose 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.110
 specific doctor verb icon for 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:10.099
 this again I will need to go to 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.259
 the case folder I set Dr. Web 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:16.759
 turn here and choose again devi 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:19.830
 scanner push button 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:23.870
 be here it does not show that icon and 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:28.680
 I can take this one here I choose it 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:32.250
 I press the button to apply okay as 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.379
 see these two icons here there is a shield about 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.139
 the volume that this will be run on behalf of 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:42.719
 admin here account we do not see 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:46.430
 but nevertheless, when you double-click on 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:49.340
 their label that we see creeps out to us 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:53.190
 directly the scanner itself without unnecessary 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.110
 inquiries let 's again here's a shortcut i'm on 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:59.580
 I click him twice 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:02.219
 the doctor panel opens either at the same time 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:05.669
 no threat to your computer 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:08.279
 nothing will bring any infections 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:10.289
 no hacks will follow here 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:13.080
 because if something were not 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:15.539
 so antivirus would take you a long time ago 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.759
 when the limit you can do it is not on 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:20.370
 An example of antivirus can do on 

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:22.440
 any other program that requires u 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.860
