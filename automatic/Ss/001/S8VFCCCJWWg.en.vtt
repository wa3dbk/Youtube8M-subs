00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.400

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.830
 star mouse pérez and like enough 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.750
 once you have asked me hey 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.790
 well your books books but that is 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.160
 school can do from that 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.369
 I thought that it did not cost 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.040
 nothing to leave you 45 ideas for each of 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.399
 the titles that I present here 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.070
 we have tito juggler holder 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.200
 analyst is ideal to introduce the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.940
 geometric shapes because the noses 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.059
 who is looking for tito when he has lost 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.609
 yours is that it's perfect for that 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.339
 finds that he offers her noses in 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:48.469
 of triangle rectangle square 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.719
 of rhombus with a bunch in the book 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.329
 when yours is shaped like a circle 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.789
 we can make them we can 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.339
 plasticize and the with a little bit gross 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.000
 we can fix them and play with the children 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.790
 once since the story is well known 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.190
 and we can do the second one would be 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.800
 work the colors because a part 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.190
 crucial of the book is when tito does 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.870
 juggle with colored balls 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.930
 then they are all circles but 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.400
 different colors 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.400
 perfect for colors too 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.600
 very good if we want to introduce or 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.910
 to work 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.800
 the circus if we have to do some 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.010
 craftsmanship of those so beautiful that they do 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.080
 with cardboard rolls cylinders 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.150
 toilet paper or rolls of paper 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.270
 good kitchen are seen preciosidades 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.070
 internet so you can take advantage of it for 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.680
 introduce the craft count a 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.110
 tale circus clown with 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.110
 protagonist and I like it 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.740
 especially to work theme of 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.560
 emotions the subject here we give 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.259
 importance to each of our 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.930
 person of ourselves in the case of 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.119
 Tito gives enormous importance to his 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.729
 physical appearance especially to your nose 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.550
 He does not care if he is tall if he is 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.060
 low if he is fat if he is skinny but ankara 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.790
 and he needs his nose to be others we 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.940
 we worry about how much we weigh in case 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.900
 We wear shoes with heels or not if we 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.180
 we have planted our hair 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.340
 we each attach importance to one thing 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.680
 the problem is when we give it so much 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.209
 importance to physical appearance or a 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.730
 small part of our appearance 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.769
 physical as the passat quoted that already what 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.860
 we value nothing else then 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.590
 he is convinced of how to silence his 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.470
 If you do not have your nose, it's because 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.780
 It can not be that it is not being able to 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.299
 you remember the dumbo movie when 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.340
 they teach him to fly to dumbo and he is 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.590
 there on the trampoline and without the pen 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.389
 host with the trunk because he does not dare 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.940
 to jump because it is in the pen he does not 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.310
 can you cited without your nose is 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.739
 convinced that he can not and that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.769
 happened to the children and it happens to us 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.019
 adults that we are sometimes like so 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.060
 obsessed in that if that's not perfect 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.329
 as we want, we are going to 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.670
 be able we will not be able to give 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.950
 a little act juggler or that 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.710
 someone read it to us tell us what 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.070
 we can go pearls 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.410
 nothing four brief strokes for how 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.680
 use teaching resources from 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.870
 titto málaga list there are infinity insurance 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.030
 what are you going to find and what it says 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.620
