00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.970
 treat our hair we want to know 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.070
 what kind of brush and what kind of comb 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.490
 or comb we should use for the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.769
 hair 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.119
 Curl for straight hair for the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.030
 abundant hair in which we have 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.440
 three wicks on the head so the theme 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.059
 It's all yours I wanted where 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.100
 we started that can show us look 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.570
 let's start first all good 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.570
 days to all the friends of the program 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.680
 So many brushes that tend to 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.680
 use in the house the owner of the house 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.800
 yes or good in the office wherever 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.010
 be perfect, we have a brush here 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.550
 palette or that is an ideal brush for 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.730
 untangle the hair 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:10.080
 smooth 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:13.080
 but to comb the hair that has been 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.290
 enlisted permanently for example 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.580
 absolute keratin chocolate everything 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.030
 made with brush with keratin with 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.009
 chocolate with that has ions with everything 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.740
 what is done we have this brush and 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.290
 how to proceed to look at yourself is 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.150
 caught by regulations following tip 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.990
 from top to bottom we are going down the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.080
 knot from the media to the tips 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.450
 of medium points effect and we are going up 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.399
 until you reach the level of the scalp 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.380
 from the top that is the way of 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.570
 unravel and you are in the background 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.030
 affirming because when people because 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.759
 they say that it is very healthy hundred and before 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.030
 produce but a book and also that you 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:03.480
 has brushed and one feel specific the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:05.250
 times that development 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.760
 now it is very important also this 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.040
 brush why is it because it helps me 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.500
 go immediately readying the hair 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.020
 When I'm going through it, it also helps me 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.570
 eliminate the frizz and the psuv happy because 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.220
 they are condemning frizz and annoying all 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.440
 the unraveling we must do with the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.470
 Wet hair fresh out of the shower 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.180
 or dry hair with a towel 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.740
 important dry hair with towel 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.930
 we remove the excess moisture and there 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.460
 untangled is so what happens when we 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.460
 we found a knot like that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.860
 and that's where I'm going to work, what do we have 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.760
 that work, take the hair 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.770
 ok to pass until we want to undo it 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.360
 that nudity any faith 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.860
 we already have then I was not going to throw 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.540
 strong the hair so that we do not 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.980
 break to tell a question when 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.560
 one is with the towel on his head 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.480
 I'm drying with maskin towels drying the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.480
 Hair dry dryer obviously yes 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.749
 of water and dry it from dryness and 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.819
 quick for but it's not good then to 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:11.599
 rub your hair like doing so with the 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.849
 towel not that broke the topic hurry and 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.510
 opens the cut and tangles dresses was not so 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:19.969
 bad joke needed a week to dry 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.409
 nothing of them soak 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:25.700
 the exact xiii get down ready then we 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.889
 You showed the first type of brush 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.139
 dental or that this one here is 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.669
 You look like you can not say this 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.859
 suv rings we go with the brush but 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:36.349
 then ok then with which one are we going to 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.900
 follow now from here in our model 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.719
 has thick hair thick hair effect 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.449
 thick so much she likes it smooth so 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:46.819
 So, if I'm going to do a breaking 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.650
 to use a thermal brush with it which 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.409
 is the brush ends here I have to see 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.349
 what has that eternal s the best known 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.930
 the house for the housewife if it is this 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.689
 brush ok for thermal ace that simple 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.699
 because it generates heat helps you maintain 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.280
 the heat of the dryer why does this have 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:06.230
 metalized maybe activate preserves the 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.569
 heat then in a closed 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.239
 explain and it's easy to handle it but 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.580
 that plastic bristle does not damage the hair 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.170
 it gets too hot the idea is 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.109
 I want to show something I can do it 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.060
 of course well look happens and when the 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:25.570
 housewife or we dry our hair 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.570
 in the house and we usually do this 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:37.880
 I accept if you take a lot of hair and take 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.180
 much that he did he left behind years and makes 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.180
 this 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:46.819
 like leaving the snag and then like 

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:51.229
 It takes a lot and sticks to the hair 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:53.269
 tangle ok I'm going to throw it short 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.609
 then we should not be afraid we are going to 

00:04:53.269 --> 00:05:00.009
 do then they took thin cadejo 

00:04:55.609 --> 00:05:03.180
 because he was more skinny and 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.180
 go moving 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.790
 perfect then your recommendation is 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.860
 always grab little hair so that 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.750
 we have mobility with the brightness and not 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.270
 leave the brush stuck you know that 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.750
 we do many that we do not know forgiving 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.750
 the hair 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.170
 we do this if we leave the dryer 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.170
 that's wrong wrong
