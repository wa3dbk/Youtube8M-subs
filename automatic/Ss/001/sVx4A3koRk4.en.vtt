rustic<00:01:42.420> mixed<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.320> industrial<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.130> love

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
rustic mixed with industrial I just love

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.270 
rustic mixed with industrial I just love
that<00:01:44.909> style<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.710> I<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.890> some<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
that style and I like some of the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.460 
that style and I like some of the
industrial<00:01:47.549> materials<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> used<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:49.110> for

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
industrial materials and I used one for

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.670 
industrial materials and I used one for
the<00:01:49.680> appliance<00:01:50.520> garage<00:01:50.990> which<00:01:51.990> hides<00:01:52.380> all<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the appliance garage which hides all the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.109 
the appliance garage which hides all the
stuff<00:01:53.009> that's<00:01:53.189> usually<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.549> your<00:01:53.700> countertop

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
stuff that's usually on your countertop

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.310 
stuff that's usually on your countertop
in<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:54.420> which<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.689> great<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.049> that's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
in there which is great because that's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.020 
in there which is great because that's
really<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.829> most<00:01:55.979> kitchens<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.490> sort<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.729> dead

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
really in most kitchens a sort of dead

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.539 
really in most kitchens a sort of dead
corner<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.469> was<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> perfect<00:01:59.130> solution<00:01:59.340> for

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
corner so it was a perfect solution for

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.940 
corner so it was a perfect solution for
their<00:01:59.820> well<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> feeling<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.829> know

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
their well the feeling was that you know

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.770 
their well the feeling was that you know
because<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.549> not<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.240> kitchen<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.719> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
because it's not just a kitchen it's a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.420 
because it's not just a kitchen it's a
kitchen<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.530> sitting<00:02:04.890> area<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.310> would

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
kitchen with this sitting area we would

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.100 
kitchen with this sitting area we would
entertain<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.570> didn't<00:02:06.840> want<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
entertain here we didn't want it to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.770 
entertain here we didn't want it to
scream<00:02:07.649> kitchen<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.879> we<00:02:08.910> sort<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.330> did<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.660> in

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
scream kitchen so we sort of did it in

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.420 
scream kitchen so we sort of did it in
an<00:02:09.929> off-white

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
an off-white

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.390 
an off-white
I<00:02:11.489> love<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.150> Bistro<00:02:12.510> feel<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
I love the Bistro feel of the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.339 
I love the Bistro feel of the
subway-tile<00:02:13.879> with<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.120> great<00:02:14.299> kind<00:02:14.599> of<00:02:14.720> takes

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
it a bit away from the kitchen as well

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.240 
it a bit away from the kitchen as well
as<00:02:17.230> introducing<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.319> bits<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.650> walnut<00:02:19.099> so

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
as introducing the bits of walnut so

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.250 
as introducing the bits of walnut so
it's<00:02:19.400> not<00:02:19.519> just<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.790> white<00:02:20.000> kitchen<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.629> it<00:02:21.019> kind

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
it's not just a white kitchen so it kind

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.490 
it's not just a white kitchen so it kind
of<00:02:21.349> blends<00:02:21.739> with<00:02:22.159> a<00:02:22.190> living<00:02:22.640> area<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.500> floors

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
of blends with a living area the floors

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.720 
of blends with a living area the floors
throughout<00:02:24.799> in<00:02:24.950> our<00:02:25.040> house<00:02:25.190> were<00:02:25.430> in<00:02:25.580> really

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
throughout in our house were in really

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.640 
throughout in our house were in really
bad<00:02:25.909> shape<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.480> we<00:02:26.599> replaced<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.200> floors<00:02:27.470> with

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
bad shape so we replaced the floors with

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.589 
bad shape so we replaced the floors with
a<00:02:27.680> wide<00:02:27.950> plank<00:02:28.370> white<00:02:28.640> oak<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:29.150> doesn't<00:02:29.450> have<00:02:29.569> a

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
a wide plank white oak it doesn't have a

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.360 
a wide plank white oak it doesn't have a
high<00:02:29.840> gloss<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.409> it<00:02:30.530> it's<00:02:30.680> like<00:02:30.769> an<00:02:30.980> oiled

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
high gloss to it it's like an oiled

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.130 
high gloss to it it's like an oiled
finish<00:02:31.760> which<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.120> really<00:02:32.390> love<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.750> has<00:02:32.900> more

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
finish which I really love it has more

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.839 
finish which I really love it has more
of<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.349> country<00:02:33.799> feel<00:02:33.980> without<00:02:34.099> being<00:02:34.459> too

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
of a country feel without being too

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.059 
of a country feel without being too
country<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.480> then<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.349> ceiling<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.860> just

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.300 
sure we knew it had to have a TV I

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.490 
didn't want to put it above the
fireplace<00:02:49.519> because<00:02:49.940> it's<00:02:50.090> too<00:02:50.390> high<00:02:50.599> I<00:02:50.930> didn't

fireplace because it's too high I didn't

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.630 
fireplace because it's too high I didn't
like<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.769> idea<00:02:51.799> that<00:02:52.069> you<00:02:52.250> would<00:02:52.400> walk<00:02:52.609> into

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
like the idea that you would walk into

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.339 
like the idea that you would walk into
this<00:02:53.030> room<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.450> first<00:02:53.629> thing<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:53.989> would<00:02:54.109> see

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
this room the first thing you would see

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.949 
this room the first thing you would see
is<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> TV<00:02:54.799> but<00:02:55.129> by<00:02:55.430> encasing<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.209> in<00:02:56.359> walnut<00:02:56.780> it

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
is a TV but by encasing it in walnut it

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.449 
is a TV but by encasing it in walnut it
doesn't<00:02:57.230> pop<00:02:57.410> out<00:02:57.650> at<00:02:57.859> you<00:02:57.980> as<00:02:58.129> soon<00:02:58.250> as<00:02:58.340> you

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
doesn't pop out at you as soon as you

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.949 
doesn't pop out at you as soon as you
come<00:02:58.640> in<00:02:58.819> so<00:02:58.970> it's<00:02:59.120> a<00:02:59.180> little<00:02:59.299> bit<00:02:59.480> more<00:02:59.629> subtle

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
come in so it's a little bit more subtle

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.259 
come in so it's a little bit more subtle
and<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.980> has<00:03:01.099> an<00:03:01.220> arm<00:03:01.370> on<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.549> that<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:01.940> can<00:03:02.090> move

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
and it has an arm on it that it can move

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.710 
and it has an arm on it that it can move
and<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.540> actually<00:03:02.900> works<00:03:03.049> quite<00:03:03.140> well<00:03:04.720> now

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
and it actually works quite well now

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.479 
and it actually works quite well now

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
that's sort of Phase six so actually at

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.759 
that's sort of Phase six so actually at
this<00:03:13.549> point<00:03:13.819> we<00:03:14.000> eat<00:03:14.239> on<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.780> island<00:03:15.140> but<00:03:15.620> we

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
still have this Ottoman which we can if

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.960 
still have this Ottoman which we can if
it's<00:03:18.620> just<00:03:18.799> a<00:03:18.889> casual<00:03:19.280> meal<00:03:19.489> we<00:03:19.639> can<00:03:19.760> sit<00:03:19.940> here

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.640 
it's just a casual meal we can sit here
and<00:03:20.239> eat<00:03:20.389> in<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.810> more<00:03:20.959> comfortable<00:03:21.349> seating

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
and eat in the more comfortable seating

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.979 
and eat in the more comfortable seating
I<00:03:21.940> haven't<00:03:22.940> gone<00:03:23.060> through<00:03:23.359> this<00:03:23.480> whole<00:03:23.690> thing

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
I haven't gone through this whole thing

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.720 
I haven't gone through this whole thing
of<00:03:24.139> reorganizing<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:24.950> space<00:03:25.160> at<00:03:25.340> one<00:03:25.489> point

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
of reorganizing the space at one point

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.309 
of reorganizing the space at one point
we'd<00:03:25.970> sort<00:03:26.209> of<00:03:26.269> started<00:03:26.630> thinking<00:03:26.930> maybe<00:03:27.079> we

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
we'd sort of started thinking maybe we

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.289 
we'd sort of started thinking maybe we
need<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.620> add<00:03:27.739> on<00:03:27.980> we<00:03:28.190> need<00:03:28.340> more<00:03:28.549> space<00:03:28.940> we

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
need to add on we need more space we

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.900 
need to add on we need more space we
need<00:03:29.450> space<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.810> put<00:03:30.139> our<00:03:30.260> kitchen<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.919> you

know<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.180> beauty<00:03:32.540> is<00:03:32.690> by<00:03:33.079> flipping<00:03:33.500> spaces

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
know the beauty is by flipping spaces

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.670 
know the beauty is by flipping spaces
reorganizing<00:03:35.269> what<00:03:35.450> used<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.810> be<00:03:35.900> space<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.500> we

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
reorganizing what used to be space is we

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.860 
reorganizing what used to be space is we
can<00:03:36.889> create<00:03:37.700> these<00:03:38.120> spaces<00:03:38.269> within<00:03:38.720> the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
can create these spaces within the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.509 
can create these spaces within the
footprint<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.500> not<00:03:39.709> have<00:03:39.980> to<00:03:40.160> add<00:03:40.280> in

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
footprint and not have to add in

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.039 
footprint and not have to add in
addition<00:03:40.940> on<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:41.299> we<00:03:41.389> actually<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.750> turned<00:03:41.959> out

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
addition on so we actually it turned out

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:52.610 
addition on so we actually it turned out
to<00:03:42.199> be<00:03:42.290> great

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.680
