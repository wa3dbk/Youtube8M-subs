00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
to be good animation and then there's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.140 
to be good animation and then there's
gonna<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.830> those<00:01:23.070> weird<00:01:23.340> stick<00:01:23.759> figure

moments<00:01:24.570> which<00:01:24.900> honestly<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.380> think<00:01:25.530> are

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
moments which honestly I think are

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.080 
moments which honestly I think are
really<00:01:26.009> funny<00:01:26.250> because<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.640> sort<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.909> play

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
really funny because they sort of play

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.370 
really funny because they sort of play

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
believe because in the second half of
the<00:01:52.619> episode<00:01:53.009> ninja<00:01:53.670> Slayer<00:01:53.880> fights<00:01:54.180> against

this one cybernetic ninja by the name of
cloud<00:01:56.790> Buster<00:01:57.299> who's<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.659> flying<00:01:57.960> ninja<00:01:58.290> who

actually<00:02:00.840> kind<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.079> looked<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.290> ed-209<00:02:01.799> from

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
actually kind of looked like ed-209 from

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.429 
actually kind of looked like ed-209 from
Robocop<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.689> probably<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.110> best

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
Robocop and this is probably the best

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.959 
Robocop and this is probably the best
sequence<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> episode<00:02:05.399> because<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.790> shows

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
sequence of the episode because it shows

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.249 
sequence of the episode because it shows
that<00:02:06.000> ninja<00:02:06.420> Slayer<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.020> able<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
that ninja Slayer is going to be able to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.650 
that ninja Slayer is going to be able to
use<00:02:07.409> his<00:02:07.619> hidden<00:02:07.860> naraku<00:02:08.819> ninja<00:02:09.239> ability

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
