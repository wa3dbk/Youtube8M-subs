00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.589 
would like to say is that these
headphones<00:06:37.400> are<00:06:38.169> not<00:06:39.169> very<00:06:39.560> expensive<00:06:40.599> even

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
headphones are not very expensive even

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:45.029 
headphones are not very expensive even
its<00:06:41.930> quality<00:06:42.800> some<00:06:43.729> quality<00:06:44.180> and<00:06:44.330> ease<00:06:44.479> view

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 
its quality some quality and ease view

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.990 
its quality some quality and ease view
so<00:06:46.039> I<00:06:46.610> think<00:06:47.120> it<00:06:47.449> will<00:06:47.750> be<00:06:47.900> a<00:06:47.930> good<00:06:48.169> buy<00:06:48.440> I<00:06:49.000> will

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
so I think it will be a good buy I will

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.749 
so I think it will be a good buy I will
be<00:06:50.180> variable<00:06:50.599> B<00:06:50.870> if<00:06:51.860> you<00:06:52.070> were<00:06:52.219> to<00:06:52.370> buy<00:06:52.550> it

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
be variable B if you were to buy it

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.330 
be variable B if you were to buy it
however<00:06:53.479> I<00:06:53.630> also<00:06:53.900> like<00:06:54.199> to<00:06:54.229> talk<00:06:54.620> about<00:06:54.860> the

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
however I also like to talk about the

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.080 
however I also like to talk about the
cons<00:06:56.000> of<00:06:56.270> this<00:06:56.449> headphone<00:06:56.960> first<00:06:57.860> it<00:06:58.820> doesn't

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 
cons of this headphone first it doesn't

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.980 
cons of this headphone first it doesn't
have<00:06:59.449> a<00:06:59.479> detachable<00:06:59.990> cable<00:07:00.380> so<00:07:01.270> it<00:07:02.270> is<00:07:02.509> not

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
have a detachable cable so it is not

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.390 
have a detachable cable so it is not
very<00:07:03.259> good<00:07:03.409> for<00:07:03.620> storage

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
very good for storage

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.170 
very good for storage
I<00:07:04.430> don't<00:07:04.729> know<00:07:04.820> how<00:07:04.969> sometimes<00:07:05.300> you<00:07:05.539> might

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
I don't know how sometimes you might

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.890 
I don't know how sometimes you might
then<00:07:06.300> Taliban<00:07:06.780> despot<00:07:07.259> and<00:07:08.389> also<00:07:09.389> the<00:07:09.660> cable

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
then Taliban despot and also the cable

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.680 
then Taliban despot and also the cable
is<00:07:10.259> very<00:07:10.740> very<00:07:11.250> long<00:07:11.669> so<00:07:12.380> you<00:07:13.380> might<00:07:13.560> do<00:07:14.690> the

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
is very very long so you might do the

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.890 
is very very long so you might do the
cable<00:07:15.930> might<00:07:16.229> be<00:07:16.350> dangling<00:07:16.889> out<00:07:17.660> when<00:07:18.660> you<00:07:18.810> are

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900 
cable might be dangling out when you are

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.960 
cable might be dangling out when you are
carrying<00:07:19.169> them<00:07:19.440> around<00:07:19.620> like<00:07:20.130> walking<00:07:20.729> in<00:07:20.850> a

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:20.970 
carrying them around like walking in a

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.790 
carrying them around like walking in a
public<00:07:21.389> where<00:07:21.990> in<00:07:22.110> this<00:07:22.229> cell<00:07:22.440> phone<00:07:22.650> the

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 
public where in this cell phone the

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.120 
public where in this cell phone the
killer<00:07:23.130> might<00:07:23.370> be<00:07:23.520> then<00:07:23.789> clean<00:07:24.830> yeah<00:07:25.830> and

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.130 
killer might be then clean yeah and

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.840 
killer might be then clean yeah and
that's<00:07:27.000> all<00:07:27.330> there<00:07:28.110> are<00:07:28.139> only<00:07:28.320> like<00:07:28.860> two<00:07:29.550> cons

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:29.850 
that's all there are only like two cons

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.860 
that's all there are only like two cons
I<00:07:30.180> think<00:07:30.419> so<00:07:31.550> overall<00:07:32.550> this<00:07:33.150> headphone<00:07:33.600> is

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:33.870 
I think so overall this headphone is

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.830 
I think so overall this headphone is
still<00:07:34.650> very<00:07:34.830> good<00:07:34.949> and<00:07:35.360> it<00:07:36.360> is<00:07:36.509> highly

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 
still very good and it is highly

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.249 
still very good and it is highly
recommend<00:07:37.440> for<00:07:37.770> those<00:07:38.780> particularly<00:07:39.780> looking

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:40.259 
recommend for those particularly looking

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:44.330 
recommend for those particularly looking
for<00:07:40.740> full-size<00:07:41.520> headphones
