just giving me an answer off the top of

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.830 
just giving me an answer off the top of
their<00:01:55.229> head<00:01:55.410> they'll<00:01:55.590> go<00:01:56.509> wait<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.539> minute<00:01:57.720> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
their head they'll go wait a minute and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.719 
their head they'll go wait a minute and
then<00:01:57.899> they'll<00:01:58.500> try<00:01:58.679> to<00:01:58.740> expound<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.520> that's

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
then they'll try to expound on it that's

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.669 
then they'll try to expound on it that's
great<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.600> really<00:02:00.990> fun<00:02:01.200> times<00:02:01.500> we

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
great and here it's really fun times we

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.949

really<00:02:07.229> fun<00:02:07.470> she<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.670> think<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.479> she<00:02:09.660> would<00:02:09.780> be

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
really fun she I think that she would be

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.960 
really fun she I think that she would be
like<00:02:10.259> she<00:02:10.800> should<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> top<00:02:11.730> university

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
like she should be like a top university

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.750 
like she should be like a top university
of<00:02:12.480> teaching<00:02:12.870> math<00:02:13.050> really<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:14.099> some<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
of teaching math really just some of the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.220 
of teaching math really just some of the
things<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:15.180> seems<00:02:15.300> like<00:02:15.510> really<00:02:15.750> difficult<00:02:16.170> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
things it seems like really difficult to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.570 
things it seems like really difficult to
be<00:02:16.290> able<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.500> do<00:02:16.650> when<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.340> her<00:02:17.430> it's

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
be able to do when like for her it's

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.630 
be able to do when like for her it's
just<00:02:17.640> easy<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.980> comprehend<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.400> one<00:02:20.610> thing

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
just easy to comprehend and one thing

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.270 
just easy to comprehend and one thing
that<00:02:20.940> she<00:02:21.569> her<00:02:22.020> strengths<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.650> getting

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
that she her strengths is getting

teacher<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.290> math<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.310> tell<00:02:26.489> she's<00:02:26.670> done

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
teacher of math I can tell she's done

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.610 
teacher of math I can tell she's done
this<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.150> many<00:02:27.270> years<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.780> she<00:02:28.260> does<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> good

job breaking it into different levels
for<00:02:31.470> different<00:02:31.500> students<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.819> because<00:02:33.569> she

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
for different students so because she

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.420 
for different students so because she

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
you're already good at it so they were

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.520 
you're already good at it so they were
they<00:03:59.760> were<00:03:59.820> bought<00:04:00.300> into<00:04:00.570> that<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:01.020> think

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
they were bought into that and think

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.250 
they were bought into that and think
link<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:02.100> shows<00:04:02.430> us<00:04:02.760> like<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.390> if<00:04:03.600> we're

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
link it shows us like it if we're

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.410 
link it shows us like it if we're
progressing<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:05.370> certain<00:04:05.820> things<00:04:05.850> in<00:04:06.300> our

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
progressing and certain things in our

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.970 
progressing and certain things in our
class<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.110> some<00:04:07.530> things<00:04:07.710> that<00:04:07.800> were

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
class and some things that were

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.370 
class and some things that were
decreasing<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.670> so<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.750> things<00:04:09.990> that<00:04:10.140> were

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
decreasing in so the things that were

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.620 
decreasing in so the things that were
really<00:04:10.650> high<00:04:11.010> up<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.550> she<00:04:12.180> knows<00:04:12.330> that<00:04:12.480> we're

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
really high up in she knows that we're

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.060 
really high up in she knows that we're
doing<00:04:12.720> good<00:04:13.020> in<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.500> we<00:04:13.620> don't<00:04:13.770> like<00:04:13.890> to

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
doing good in that so we don't like to

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.039 
doing good in that so we don't like to
talk<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.250> whole<00:04:14.430> lot<00:04:14.490> about<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.840> things

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
talk a whole lot about that the things

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.229 
talk a whole lot about that the things
that<00:04:16.200> we're<00:04:16.320> kind<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.560> low<00:04:16.739> in<00:04:16.980> she'll<00:04:17.489> teach

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
that we're kind of low in she'll teach

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.780 
that we're kind of low in she'll teach
more<00:04:18.630> frequently<00:04:19.230> on<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:20.100> we<00:04:20.280> can<00:04:20.310> get<00:04:20.549> the

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
more frequently on so we can get the

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.270 
more frequently on so we can get the
better<00:04:21.359> idea<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:21.930> she<00:04:21.989> prepares<00:04:22.470> us<00:04:22.620> more<00:04:22.890> for

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
better idea and she prepares us more for

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.240 
better idea and she prepares us more for
