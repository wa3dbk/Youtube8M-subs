00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.530 
going to go ahead and put our soup in
but<00:02:32.769> like<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:33.040> said<00:02:33.099> you<00:02:33.400> can<00:02:33.430> see<00:02:33.849> in<00:02:34.209> here

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
but like I said you can see in here

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.130 
but like I said you can see in here
there's<00:02:34.780> really<00:02:35.940> no<00:02:36.940> there's<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.630> little<00:02:37.900> bit

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
there's really no there's a little bit

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.330 
there's really no there's a little bit
but<00:02:38.380> it's<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.920> know<00:02:38.950> it's<00:02:40.739> hard<00:02:41.739> enough<00:02:41.980> to

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
but it's you know it's hard enough to

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.180 
but it's you know it's hard enough to
drain<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.850> off<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.500> will<00:02:44.650> just<00:02:44.709> go<00:02:44.980> ahead

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
drain that off so we will just go ahead

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.080 
drain that off so we will just go ahead
and<00:02:45.370> we're<00:02:45.730> going<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.880> add<00:02:46.030> our<00:02:46.060> soup<00:02:50.910> just<00:02:51.910> a

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
and we're going to add our soup just a

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:05.280 
and we're going to add our soup just a
can<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.530> tomato<00:02:59.099> have<00:03:00.099> our<00:03:00.310> water

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.530 

this<00:03:06.290> all<00:03:06.500> stir<00:03:06.860> up<00:03:07.069> in<00:03:07.880> our<00:03:08.060> rice

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.660 

that<00:03:12.170> was<00:03:12.319> a<00:03:12.349> cup<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.799> half<00:03:12.829> of<00:03:13.159> brown<00:03:13.400> rice

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
that was a cup and a half of brown rice

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.110 
that was a cup and a half of brown rice
or<00:03:14.000> white<00:03:14.599> if<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.959> prefer<00:03:18.819> this<00:03:19.819> would<00:03:20.000> be<00:03:20.090> a

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
or white if you prefer this would be a

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.830 
or white if you prefer this would be a
good<00:03:20.299> time<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.540> introduce<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.409> brown<00:03:22.129> rice

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.850 

well<00:05:26.540> I<00:05:26.660> don't<00:05:26.840> ever<00:05:26.990> feel<00:05:27.110> that<00:05:27.290> food<00:05:27.620> is<00:05:27.740> too

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
well I don't ever feel that food is too

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.000 
well I don't ever feel that food is too
pretty<00:05:28.100> beat<00:05:28.340> okay<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:32.560> we<00:05:33.560> need<00:05:33.680> to<00:05:33.740> put

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
pretty beat okay and we need to put

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.130 
pretty beat okay and we need to put
these<00:05:34.160> with<00:05:34.400> a<00:05:35.530> bowl<00:05:36.530> or<00:05:37.300> if<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:38.510> feel<00:05:38.690> really

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
these with a bowl or if you feel really

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:52.380 
these with a bowl or if you feel really
ambitious<00:05:39.560> kind<00:05:40.370> of<00:05:40.490> stick<00:05:40.790> them<00:05:40.940> all<00:05:49.630> yeah

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
ambitious kind of stick them all yeah

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.970 
ambitious kind of stick them all yeah
this<00:05:53.390> I<00:05:53.630> think<00:05:53.870> would<00:05:53.960> be<00:05:54.110> good<00:05:54.140> too<00:05:54.740> as<00:05:54.950> a

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
this I think would be good too as a

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:02.080 
this I think would be good too as a
little<00:05:55.250> appetizer<00:05:59.620> for<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:00.650> superbowl<00:06:01.130> not

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
little appetizer for the superbowl not

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:11.740 
little appetizer for the superbowl not
what<00:06:02.240> somebody<00:06:02.390> said

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.700 

and<00:06:12.750> then<00:06:12.930> you<00:06:13.020> probably<00:06:13.230> want<00:06:13.440> to<00:06:13.470> put<00:06:13.620> an

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
and then you probably want to put an

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.990 
and then you probably want to put an
extra<00:06:14.000> bowl<00:06:15.000> beside<00:06:15.480> that<00:06:16.370> so<00:06:17.370> there<00:06:17.580> is<00:06:17.820> our

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
extra bowl beside that so there is our

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.220 
extra bowl beside that so there is our
dinner<00:06:18.270> nachos<00:06:19.220> here
