00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.979
 and electronic music I love 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.719
 eleanora cassano maestro 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.520
 In the glory 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.339
 d 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.269
 as good for that 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:56.070
 I love to see it eleonora cassano 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.600
 played by the show I love I love it 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.939
 I like good to do all the various 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.310
 contemporary evils I say it but I do not 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.850
 I am a specialist but I like it 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.739
 that they play it a lot that they dance 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.420
 contemporaries always have the style 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.000
 I do not say it for anyone in particular but 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.410
 my ex- wife was also a graduate of 4 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.690
 san martín and also one thing those 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.730
 dancers however paula was also 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.709
 transgressors and I like it, I'm not 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.470
 comparing but some form of dancing 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.329
 I do this and you looked worried 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.360
 I loved it because I was worried 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:31.420
 by your movements and doing it well and 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.670
 this in the voice of a lion is now an air 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.769
 cool to me I love watching it I love it 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.019
 in front of a superb attitude of others 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.830
 people have a person with attitude 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.810
 humble that I love 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.770
 it's not him 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.069
 the rhythm that fits you the best you know 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.989
 they had some inaccuracies some 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.500
 trick drops that were also 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.440
 loose 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.450
 but I know you know how to take these past 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.210
 worse things in life 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.680
 being who you are but really is not what 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.370
 What I liked most is not what most 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.370
 It fits but it's something that's going to happen 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.990
 so good to my note is not very good 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.750
 in this opportunity but neither is 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.520
 dreadful 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.380
 I do not know if you fit the note but good 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.290
 let's see 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.340
 advanced the note your secret vote advance 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.080
 vote of the lady died casan 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.970
 eliana nicolás yadiel welcome to the 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.550
 track in this performance all 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.440
 all are wired you change 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.880
 very high would be a little bit afraid of the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.880
 for this I'm all dizzy 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:54.120
 I did not know what I saw a discomfort 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.600
 very pressure really died 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.710
 decompensated in the low trick because 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.720
 you lost stability for the battery 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.990
 what's wrong with it 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.730
 do not 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.830
 weighs weighs not know what is it 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.620
 impressed up the battery no no but 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.940
 I know what I know now I thought it was something 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.940
 modern this we are taking out 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:30.330
 this you put it on me you take me right 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:33.319
 the chacarita stayed underground 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.319
 I was heavy 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:43.979
 I noticed it uncomfortable if as blocked 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.229
 not wired blocked because in the 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.289
 movements were hard you want 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.479
 guys if you notice it is given as it did not give you 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.629
 as a beginner but something came to them 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.969
 happened I thought something with shoes a 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.680
 good thing is an element that they had to 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.169
 it was not known but it was not seen at all 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.629
 fluid even the moment of unison is 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.780
 We looked like heavy you are weird 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:15.479
 that will not move clear can be 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:17.430
 that then within two or three 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.530
 notorious inaccuracies unfortunately 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.210
 when you got off the trick and all those 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.650
 parts that could have been more loose 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.819
 clear with this thing that started you 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.590
 you did not see a it was seen as a performance 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:31.169
 pixilated let's say as a half blurred 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.840
 or to give a new one even if 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.830
 a creativity to a western return 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.040
 dances of precision and yes 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.630
 can give fun returns good 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.160
 guys whores that for you tonight 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.160
 is this 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:57.340
 lady eleonora unique ariel thanks the 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.690
 locker room 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.010
 it's theirs but it's not useful I think what 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.710
 I should have evaluated a little 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.290
 more because it was really shocking but 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.830
 it did not work for the dance there was not much 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:14.350
 to be able to move with such a weight 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.139
 miss your arms those glorious arms 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.479
 this one with such a suit obviously not 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.520
 You could look like I think it was a 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.740
 mistake that could have been 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.470
 solved but good one is 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.680
 I also think that this type of dance 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.930
 it does not allow me to show my arms and 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.180
 move them accordingly that is something 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.610
 to make it harder because it's kind 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.560
 robotic the dance if this too 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.169
 I also want to thank the friendship that 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.680
 helped us with the steps and style of 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:47.380
 dance that is let's say almost opposite to what 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.460
 that we have put I do not say that the arms 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.410
 move like in the classic 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.930
 obviously but good makes 8 others 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:56.289
 dances where the popular arms where 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:59.259
 the arms are fundamental and good 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:01.479
 a battle is not the war gentlemen there 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:05.409
 there is the single vote for the honor of 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:08.909
 nicolás is a 7 until here the 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:08.909
 final count of Mr. mothers
