so<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.759> go<00:01:41.880> ahead<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.110> click<00:01:43.110> five

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
so if you go ahead and click five

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.590 
so if you go ahead and click five
seconds<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.310> timer<00:01:44.579> will<00:01:44.850> begin<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> countdown

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
seconds the timer will begin a countdown

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.319 
seconds the timer will begin a countdown
and<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.380> last<00:01:46.560> two<00:01:46.829> seconds<00:01:47.280> will<00:01:47.460> sound<00:01:48.119> off

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and the last two seconds will sound off

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.060 
and the last two seconds will sound off
a<00:01:48.360> beep<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.930> they<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.500> easily<00:01:49.740> take<00:01:49.890> your

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
a beep and they can easily take your

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.429 
a beep and they can easily take your
photo<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:51.000> also<00:01:51.240> does<00:01:51.570> work<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:51.899> both<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
photo this also does work for both the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
photo this also does work for both the
video<00:01:52.740> time<00:01:53.040> mode<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.090> want<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.329> go

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
video time mode so if you want to go

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.630 
video time mode so if you want to go
ahead<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.750> put<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.140> three<00:01:55.409> seconds<00:01:55.829> here<00:01:56.159> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
ahead and put in three seconds here it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.850 
ahead and put in three seconds here it
will<00:01:57.030> begin<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.420> count<00:01:57.689> down<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.290> they<00:01:58.710> will

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
will begin to count down and they will

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.889 
will begin to count down and they will
take<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> picture<00:01:59.549> or<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> video<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.659> also

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
take a picture or a video and this also

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.530 
take a picture or a video and this also
does<00:02:01.229> work<00:02:01.469> for<00:02:01.500> both<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.070> front<00:02:02.520> time<00:02:02.759> camera

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
does work for both the front time camera

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.899 
does work for both the front time camera
our<00:02:03.960> next<00:02:04.469> set<00:02:04.619> each<00:02:04.710> week<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.159> called<00:02:05.369> nitrous

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
our next set each week is called nitrous

our next set each week is called nitrous
now<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.240> allows<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.810> add<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.320> JavaScript

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
now this allows you to add a JavaScript

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.339 
now this allows you to add a JavaScript
