00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello and welcome to mine 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.620
 may my name is where and how I 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.960
 announced my lectures video 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.780
 I said that I have a video on 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.010
 I'll upload youtube as I mean 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.859
 make videos edit and dmb number 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.039
 make it smaller in order to make it faster 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.939
 upload youtube 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.849
 by the way, this question was from 12 ago 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.140
 asked me time what name the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.390
 Names promise but we see here 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.770
 always simple comes down and that is 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.260
 well, so I take mine 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.340
 play with roxy pc game capture on the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.309
 is therefore a recording program plus one 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.239
 editing program for videos has me 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.520
 50 euro costs at saturn 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.149
 maybe you know that too 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.210
 company roxio also produces this game 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.240
 cards to play on the xbox or on 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.030
 to record the ps3 and yes the time 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.610
 pick up for the pc version and yes is 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:17.369
 really good for the first time 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.950
 So here you can stand out 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.530
 maybe like game that there at wii 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.990
 if you like the free version 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.240
 it down were you want you can 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.520
 later insert the description 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.130
 only the only problem is you can 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.900
 then only half sit so that is 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.299
 quality from the videos not so good 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.799
 but if you do not buy a program 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.960
 because to regulate your has just great 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:46.909
 for that and I had stream on at that time 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.450
 There is really much to say 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.030
 quality requirements when the videos 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.899
 saved here have the most 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.899
 games and here are all teams though 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.500
 not previously mine and mine 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.190
 the recording program and edit here 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.190
 and pass it on 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:17.700
 we expect that there once 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.330
 little bit so new project too 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.610
 create 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.930
 all the production for the videos i 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.500
 For example, I did one 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.000
 example video and although I take now 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:36.080
 Just that here that I am now 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.690
 also just upload to youtube 21 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.580
 should that be in here now and if so 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.620
 her if you have the video in here 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.670
 then you can have the ones here 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.820
 brightness adjust the contrast 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.120
 color saturation and yes I put that 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.310
 actually always at 53 and that fits 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.320
 Actually, then you have here 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:04.380
 exports as that means that is 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.910
 then you would have finished the video 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.580
 we have worked on it now below 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:14.910
 can you still add music? 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:17.370
 an intro or a wise thing he and her 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.680
 Can you always do that too? 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.660
 ton quieter I should do here now 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.020
 this is the normal correction of the video 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.880
 with halt with the normal volume with 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.070
 that's much too loud for the bartender 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.420
 so I put the time to -4 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.120
 and yes in any case exported here 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.790
 as no 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.790
 and here you can all the whole 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.020
 options formations choose what 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.780
 a quality as I suppose so 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.250
 example always nothing hd 27 p at 30 vps 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.420
 that takes about a seven 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.240
 minutes video so 10 12 minutes to the 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.190
 video is done if in addition 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.470
 Changed is what you call it 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.220
 but otherwise there would still be here 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.820
 Hypes is reasonably good 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.609
 quality but without HD svc better 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:23.890
 quality that's what you call it better here 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:27.340
 served and therefore always because I 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.710
 wants to edit a video and up here 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.930
 Add comment if I have the video 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.850
 I can record it in here 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.910
 you can already see this here 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.320
 yellow beams that is my vote 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.050
 and yes, if I stop clique then 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.290
 this video stops and thus synonymous 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.950
 my voice is inserted there today and yes 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:51.490
 It 's not live commentary though 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.169
 otherwise it works so if I then 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.790
 finished that and saved that 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.010
 added this to one of the book 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.890
 I go to this program that 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.940
 finally easy h 264 figure like me 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.710
 heard that normally 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.380
 actually for contact source videos 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.450
 but I do not know it 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.250
 what ever 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.770
 In any case, I can on video files 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.320
 elected office body I have now 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.479
 video of borderlands 2 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.860
 I actually wanted to network one of 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.440
 Borderlands 2 but I have the game 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.419
 just played by and since that 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.270
 Game I did not like that much 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.860
 also thought come takes too long 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.720
 and the game is not that good 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.490
 sword a hot house is not so 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.770
 long but there are many others 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.409
 made by bordellen 2 let's plays 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.629
 and that just never got boring 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:47.479
 who could i do that for that 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:51.589
 insert is in here and then find 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:53.029
 I the output if I is the talk 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.279
 a 23 11 4 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.330
 and there I can for this video for 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.569
 set peace 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.050
 I was at 29.97 as this goes 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.669
 really fast down here on what for 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.769
 a quality that wanted to have 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:12.469
 this video is fast on the extreme 

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:14.809
 you see us in the making, it is better now 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:16.550
 but here also in brackets away that is 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:19.159
 that the video synonymous later then more mb 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.759
 has become extremely hd is actually that 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.079
 same 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:26.209
 and that has a little tick better 

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:28.729
 a little better resolution but only 

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:32.869
 you do not really notice it that way 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:35.059
 yes that was only so who now 

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:36.919
 actually want to make live commentary 

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:39.649
 how I want to do that later than that 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:42.019
 I have worried extra fraps yes here is 

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:47.149
 that's the way he is at 90.9 in the morning 

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:47.899
 vbs set can have on the micro 

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:50.209
 like or not 

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:51.979
 your accounts windows 7 should that 

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:53.749
 balls for example at call of duty 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:58.039
 if you play us live com with her 

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:59.959
 pick up call of duty and yes presidencies 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.360
 only problem is what call of 

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:03.800
 Duty definitely at forbes on everyone 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.469
 case happens now I say one time 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.959
 two-minute video recording with presidency 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:10.369
 So with the highest quality then is 

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:14.809
 it is very likely that you will be on 

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:16.759
 end of the 2 minute video mb size of 

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:19.429
 1 5 to 2 gb 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:22.099
 if not worse and that's why 

00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:22.819
 I would actually be helped 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:25.119
 recommend 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:27.529
 that could later also here with 

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:29.239
 edit or with that even smaller 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:31.909
 for example, I say 1 gb now 

00:07:29.239 --> 00:07:34.989
 will come out 100 mb and that 

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:39.229
 Of course, that's a big difference 

00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:41.959
 so that's about me and 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:43.819
 I hope it has the video if 

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:45.860
 you want to comment on the video 

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:48.319
 licon and would be even if namely 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.370
 of course, you do not have to subscribe 

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:53.530
 it is of course free 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:56.160
 well, happy people still day and three 

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.160
 new style
