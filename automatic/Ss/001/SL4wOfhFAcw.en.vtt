keep going that's the tenth time we
tried<00:00:44.710> maybe<00:00:45.710> we<00:00:45.949> should<00:00:46.129> just<00:00:46.309> give<00:00:46.610> up<00:00:46.640> I<00:00:49.360> got

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
tried maybe we should just give up I got

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.700 
tried maybe we should just give up I got
all<00:00:50.510> excited<00:00:50.660> when<00:00:51.199> I<00:00:51.260> heard<00:00:51.530> that

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
all excited when I heard that

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.650 
all excited when I heard that
what's-his-name<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.670> monkey<00:00:53.150> came<00:00:53.390> back

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
what's-his-name the monkey came back

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.450 
what's-his-name the monkey came back
from<00:00:53.840> outer<00:00:53.989> space<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:54.650> was<00:00:54.980> going<00:00:55.220> to<00:00:55.309> give

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
from outer space and was going to give

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.910 
from outer space and was going to give
us<00:00:55.580> ancient<00:00:56.059> technology<00:00:59.440> but<00:01:00.440> it<00:01:00.589> just

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
us ancient technology but it just

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.299 
us ancient technology but it just
doesn't<00:01:01.519> seem<00:01:01.699> to<00:01:01.879> live<00:01:02.059> up<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.239> all<00:01:02.479> the<00:01:02.839> hype

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
doesn't seem to live up to all the hype

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.940 
doesn't seem to live up to all the hype
hmm<00:01:04.339> going<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:04.970> stars<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:05.690> task<00:01:06.290> not<00:01:06.440> easily

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
hmm going to the stars a task not easily

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.620 
hmm going to the stars a task not easily
undertaken<00:01:07.760> there's<00:01:08.060> bound<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.540> be

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
undertaken there's bound to be

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.680 
undertaken there's bound to be
difficulties<00:01:09.520> yes<00:01:10.520> but<00:01:11.060> looks<00:01:11.330> like<00:01:11.540> they're

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
difficulties yes but looks like they're

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.940 
difficulties yes but looks like they're
on<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.900> right<00:01:12.080> track<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.560> me

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.000 

[Music]

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.870 

I<00:01:21.070> think<00:01:21.970> this<00:01:22.210> system<00:01:22.690> was<00:01:22.870> too<00:01:23.140> complex<00:01:23.880> we

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
I think this system was too complex we

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.820 
I think this system was too complex we
need<00:01:24.910> to<00:01:25.180> keep<00:01:25.330> things<00:01:25.660> simpler<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.620> way

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
need to keep things simpler that way

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.400 
need to keep things simpler that way
less<00:01:27.100> things<00:01:27.370> can<00:01:27.580> go<00:01:27.700> wrong<00:01:27.910> but<00:01:28.840> if<00:01:28.990> we<00:01:29.140> build

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
less things can go wrong but if we build

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.130 
less things can go wrong but if we build
it<00:01:29.590> this<00:01:29.800> way<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.400> will<00:01:30.490> cost<00:01:30.760> too<00:01:31.060> much<00:01:31.300> if<00:01:31.930> we

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
it this way it will cost too much if we

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.570 
it this way it will cost too much if we
take<00:01:32.290> existing<00:01:32.650> parts<00:01:33.160> and<00:01:33.280> put<00:01:33.430> them

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
take existing parts and put them

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.860 
take existing parts and put them
together<00:01:33.730> this<00:01:34.180> way<00:01:35.730> see<00:01:36.730> just<00:01:37.510> look<00:01:37.660> at<00:01:37.750> how

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
together this way see just look at how

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.250 
together this way see just look at how
much<00:01:38.020> money<00:01:38.230> we<00:01:38.470> can<00:01:38.620> save<00:01:38.890> I<00:01:39.780> think<00:01:40.780> if<00:01:41.020> we

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
much money we can save I think if we

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.770 
much money we can save I think if we
modify<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.890> fuel<00:01:42.370> injectors<00:01:42.970> like<00:01:43.270> this<00:01:43.540> it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
modify the fuel injectors like this it

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:54.900 
modify the fuel injectors like this it
just<00:01:43.840> might<00:01:44.410> solve<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.920> problem<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:54.520> need<00:01:54.760> to

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
just might solve the problem we need to

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.820 
just might solve the problem we need to
make<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.210> cargo<00:01:55.540> hold<00:01:55.780> smaller<00:01:56.080> we<00:01:56.440> can<00:01:56.470> save

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
make the cargo hold smaller we can save

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.740 
make the cargo hold smaller we can save
space<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.130> make<00:01:57.400> it<00:01:57.520> lighter<00:01:57.760> that<00:01:58.000> way<00:01:58.180> it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
space and make it lighter that way it

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.650 
space and make it lighter that way it
doesn't<00:01:59.110> matter<00:01:59.710> with<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.670> new<00:02:01.120> amazing

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
doesn't matter with this new amazing

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.830 
doesn't matter with this new amazing
engine<00:02:02.380> I<00:02:02.500> design<00:02:03.070> we<00:02:03.760> will<00:02:03.970> have<00:02:04.150> more<00:02:04.600> than

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
engine I design we will have more than

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.590 
engine I design we will have more than
enough<00:02:05.170> power<00:02:05.500> your<00:02:06.100> engine<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:06.940> believe<00:02:07.450> you

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
enough power your engine I believe you

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.090 
enough power your engine I believe you
if<00:02:07.720> your<00:02:07.900> engines<00:02:08.229> weren't<00:02:08.410> made<00:02:08.590> from<00:02:08.830> spare

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
if your engines weren't made from spare

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.680 
if your engines weren't made from spare
parts<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:09.520> needed<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:09.910> be<00:02:10.000> adjusted<00:02:10.479> every

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
parts and needed to be adjusted every

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.560 
parts and needed to be adjusted every
five<00:02:10.899> minutes<00:02:11.110> not<00:02:11.590> everybody<00:02:12.459> has<00:02:12.790> tons<00:02:13.209> of

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
five minutes not everybody has tons of

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:36.660 
five minutes not everybody has tons of
money<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.050> build<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:35.530> have<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.040> get<00:02:36.190> this<00:02:36.400> thing

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
money to build we have to get this thing

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.190 
money to build we have to get this thing
working<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.390> we<00:02:37.540> think<00:02:37.690> I'll<00:02:37.870> get<00:02:38.080> in

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
working so we think I'll get in

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.950 
working so we think I'll get in
