00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.440
 plus 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:16.450
 good morning as we said in all 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.910
 our campaign we wanted that 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.710
 the people the players that came to the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.400
 central were reinforcements or 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.100
 hiring and we have great pride 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.279
 to receive 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.920
 a reinforcement that I think will give us 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.640
 many satisfactions after 10 years 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.950
 in europe we welcome you to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.720
 Javier and we wish you the greatest of 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.390
 sold lots 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.990
 thank you very much for the words for the 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.990
 trust that 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.149
 that they give me or that they gave me these days 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.809
 now it's a huge joy I'm very 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.809
 happy to be able to come to the central 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.740
 I was with so many already a few 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.229
 days 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.400
 and now that was it was all very very 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.909
 positive 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.060
 and hopefully good things 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.420
 I get it right I will try to always give 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.790
 the best as the audi in my whole life and 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:28.430
 I hope I can help the institution 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.780
 to get to achieve more goals 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.270
 great good the first interested was 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.180
 central was the technician who wrote me 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.820
 he called me 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.360
 and for me that's fundamental to this 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.360
 height of my career 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:51.510
 I feel good and one needs to have 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.090
 the confidence of a club and the coach 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.120
 and from the first moment I consulted 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.330
 with my family they told me if we're going 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.330
 there 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.030
 we have many friends and acquaintances 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.360
 of rosary while living in Germany 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.250
 as here and we inform ourselves a little and 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.980
 they told us that the truth was that it was a 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.989
 spectacular place 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.739
 just as we did not make the decision and 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.450
 we are really happy that 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.030
 We decided to return to Argentina not the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.200
 true that we are very happy and the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.240
 good objectives logically you want 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.500
 and continue down the road 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.660
 which began 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.980
 a very good first part of the tournament 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.129
 the truth that the club did 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.220
 I hope that from my place I can help 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.350
 to the group to the team to follow for that 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.550
 same path and 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.730
 and try that if there are objectives 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.730
 greater 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.020
 Javier brings bit of it 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.820
 football that is what you were green 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.820
 central and that what most seduces you 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.510
 the truth is that it is a very good 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.470
 combination experienced with people 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.360
 young in the team 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.550
 many young players with a lot 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.680
 future the truth that that is 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.920
 important to those who are given 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.920
 trust 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.980
 a team that tries to be the protagonist 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.980
 what you're trying 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.400
 press well in attack and try 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.370
 play well do not try to win 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.939
 by chance they have a proposal 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.939
 of game 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.329
 good 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.650
 it's basically because of what I had for 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.390
 what I had the opportunity to talk to 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.420
 the coaching staff 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.890
 just short with my colleagues is a 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.040
 technical staff that works very well 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:03.270
 so I hope you can start how much 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.700
 before training and logically 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.090
 out there in a way to 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.200
 to be able to help inside or if it is decided 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.200
 something else from wherever
