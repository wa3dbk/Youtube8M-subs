I'm<00:01:07.950> brushing<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.400> back<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.820> create<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.390> half<00:01:09.990> up

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
I'm brushing it back to create a half up

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.050 
I'm brushing it back to create a half up
half<00:01:10.229> down<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.159> leaving<00:01:11.310> part<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.970> my

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
half down and I'm leaving part of my

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.630 
half down and I'm leaving part of my
bangs<00:01:12.330> out<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.020> I'm<00:01:13.740> doing<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.130> above<00:01:14.400> my<00:01:14.610> ear

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
bangs out and I'm doing it above my ear

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.670

so<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.150> my<00:01:15.270> ears<00:01:15.570> are<00:01:15.720> covered<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.500> think

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
so that my ears are covered I just think

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.039 
so that my ears are covered I just think
it<00:01:16.799> has<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> really<00:01:17.340> nice<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.299> clean<00:01:18.479> simple

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
it has a really nice and clean simple

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:34.030 
it has a really nice and clean simple
look

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.470 

so<00:01:35.040> now<00:01:35.160> I'm<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.550> add<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.030> SPO<00:01:36.270> that

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
so now I'm going to add in the SPO that

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.320 
so now I'm going to add in the SPO that
I<00:01:36.540> made<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.980> can<00:01:38.460> add<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.820> any<00:01:39.060> Bo<00:01:39.300> that

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
I made and you can add in any Bo that

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.360 
I made and you can add in any Bo that
you<00:01:39.630> want<00:01:39.810> or<00:01:40.050> you<00:01:40.260> don't<00:01:40.410> have<00:01:40.620> to<00:01:40.830> add<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.160> one

you want or you don't have to add in one

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.370 
you want or you don't have to add in one
I<00:01:41.580> just<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.330> because<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:42.660> it<00:01:42.930> adds<00:01:43.080> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
I just like it because I think it adds a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
I just like it because I think it adds a
nice<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.620> extra<00:01:44.460> touch<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:45.030> school<00:01:45.300> spirit

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
nice little extra touch of school spirit

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.820 
nice little extra touch of school spirit
