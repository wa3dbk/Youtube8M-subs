00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.514
 How is my nose so itchy? 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.480
 Little bird don’t sing a little bird 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.140
 Hello, everyone, I am back. 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.300
 Sorry, I disappeared for a short time. 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.274
 I recently lost the power to film 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.660
 There are films that fail and I don't want to upload short films that I am not satisfied with. 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.980
 But I finally came back today and will share my favorite foundation in autumn and winter. 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.140
 I will also apply the foundation to my face. 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.160
 Let you see the effect, I will also turn on the rouge and the powder 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.320
 Let you see the effect of the entire makeup 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.620
 I hope you like us to get started. 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.700
 The first one is the Tinted Moisturizer of NARS. Everyone knows how much I love it. 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.060
 This is a must for lazy people. It has a sunscreen effect and balances skin tone. 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.640
 This is really good 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.780
 Concealer is not super good 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.140
 But really let the skin tone balance 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.080
 Most suitable for some makeup with zero makeup 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.140
 Or if you don’t have a lot of time, you want to modify your skin. 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.654
 This is a good choice 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.640
 Although after the application, a few disappeared enough to moisturize 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.220
 After a while, it will start to dry. 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.620
 Especially at night, I started to see dry lines. 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.380
 Not good, it will be itchy after the skin is dry. 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.280
 I don't usually paint for too long. 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.400
 I really like the texture of it is very moist 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.060
 But also a little creamy 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.320
 Not too thick or too thin 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.380
 Feeling thin on the skin, I can’t feel anything on my face. 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.940
 So lazy makeup is suitable. 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.620
 And I really like the effect on the face is not too shiny 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.794
 Also not too matte 

00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:58.787
 Very balanced 

00:01:58.787 --> 00:02:02.560
 Sometimes I will forget the powder 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.520
 Because it's so beautiful, it doesn't feel very oily. 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.320
 So I won’t remember the powder 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.093
 Actually, it is not necessary 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.800
 I will use it when I am too lazy to make up. 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.760
 The second is LM's Silk Creme Foundation 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.280
 Because now I am in the autumn and winter, I can finally use it. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.120
 Summer will be too thick 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.040
 Concealing degree is super good 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.400
 Not super thick but also very creamy 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.700
 Although I dare not use it in summer. 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.920
 It will make the skin feel very slippery 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.200
 I really like its concealer 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.060
 Really makes the skin look like silk half texture 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.720
 I am using Rose Ivory. 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.380
 Now this post is too light because I was tanned before. 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.500
 But I still use a layer of bronze. 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.880
 This must be crushed. I think oily skin friends may not like it. 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.300
 Because it is biased towards thick 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.700
 But in autumn and winter, I really like it because it is moist enough. 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.800
 Autumn and winter favorite open-air foundation is Rimmel's Wake Me Up Foundation 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.580
 I mentioned many times that the color I used is 100 Ivory. 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.580
 This also has sun protection 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.560
 Some people may feel thick but I personally think it is OK. 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.520
 Really moisturizing 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.120
 And I really like the effect of it. 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.620
 Very beautiful gloss 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.320
 Really make the skin look less tired 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.780
 I also like its concealer 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.300
 It can cover the flaws on my face 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.720
 I really like it and my favorite open-air foundation. 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.940
 A more expensive liquid foundation is the Diorskin Nude Foundation 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.720
 I also mentioned it before using the clear film. 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.400
 I am working hard to get the liquid foundation out again. 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.920
 But this time it really used up. 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.720
 This also has 15 degrees sunscreen 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.820
 Very similar to Rimmel, especially in terms of texture 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.480
 The effect is very similar and very shiny 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.440
 I don’t need to apply powder immediately after painting. 

00:04:20.474 --> 00:04:22.474
 After a few hours 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.720
 But the effect is really good, the oily gloss is not too oily. 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.840
 If you don't want to buy too expensive, Rimmel really looks a lot like 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.780
 Although both fall and winter are applicable, Diorskin Nude can still be used in summer. 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.880
 Rimmel is less useful in summer. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.020
 There are also two first Dior Capture Totale essence liquid foundations. 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.340
 I am running out of this and I try not to use it. 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.280
 Because it is too expensive 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.260
 This is a thicker and higher concealer 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.254
 Liquid foundation 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.600
 The price is of course higher 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.940
 Very creamy 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.654
 Very thick 

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:15.934
 This mirror is super nice 

00:05:16.074 --> 00:05:18.074
 It should be because of the high degree of concealment. 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.500
 I just mentioned that some foundations will make my skin dry after a few hours. 

00:05:23.754 --> 00:05:25.754
 But this won't 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.720
 But because the price is also expensive 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.720
 So I don't know if I will buy back. 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.040
 But I really like it in autumn and winter. 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.680
 It has a little gloss and looks good on the mirror. 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.600
 If you want to find a texture-like foundation, this is actually very similar. 

00:05:45.714 --> 00:05:47.714
 Of course, it does not have the skin care effect of the essence foundation. 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.140
 This is 3CE Honey Face Chiffon Fluid 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.320
 Also like the Silk Creme Foundation 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.380
 Is a thicker foundation 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.920
 Although I don't think this is as thick as the other two 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.900
 The effect is also very good 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.600
 Good gloss and high concealing 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.740
 I won't use this in summer. 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.380
 But I am very excited to finally use this in autumn and winter. 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.860
 Very moist 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.020
 It’s natural when it’s off makeup. 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.920
 There will be no block without dry lines 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.320
 It will be very natural and balanced 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:37.360
 This will start to oil after a while, so you must make up your makeup. 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.320
 But just said it is very moisturizing 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.060
 The concealer is very good, so I like it very much in autumn and winter. 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.720
 These are my favorite liquid foundations for autumn and winter. 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.600
 I hope this piece is useful and I hope that different angles and demonstrations are also practical. 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.420
 It should be better than I explained because my words are very limited. 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.500
 Remember to praise it! 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.520
 Remember to leave a message and tell me if you will go out and try these foundations. 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.840
 Or which one are you interested in? 

00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:11.595
 Or is it already there? 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.460
 Leave a message and tell me that I am chatting with you downstairs. 

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:16.214
 See you next time! Bye!
