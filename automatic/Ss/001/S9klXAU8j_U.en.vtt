00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.720
 do not be fooled by the friendly 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.390
 look of this cart 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.730
 two years after launching in Europe the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.310
 another Brazilian comes to the stores to 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.970
 difficult mission that is the new popular 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.970
 volkswagen 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.710
 the model that comes to fight with fiat 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.440
 one and one ford ka is being produced in 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.480
 taubatÃ© in the interior of sÃ£o paulo will be 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.580
 in stores in the second half of March 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.380
 to be sold here the other 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.830
 has undergone some changes 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.420
 compared to the European from column b to 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.640
 behind is another car 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.640
 This is because he has gained glasses that go up 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.979
 and go down instead of the more 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.110
 space in the trunk and tank of 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.060
 and this has become more 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:18.890
 long and taller than the model 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:22.520
 sold in Europe as an actor was premiered 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.590
 by focus motion that 1.03 cylinders 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.720
 of 800 horsepower 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.310
 power that works in conjunction with 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.369
 a manual transmission of five 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.369
 speeds 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.650
 by price range the finish of the acre 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.810
 I like it though I've just been all 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.940
 plastic the color combination gives a 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.760
 best fit printing between 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.820
 parts is also neat the bank and 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.070
 head restraint a piece only has 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.440
 a good flow but the space to bring 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:19.290
 does not allow rides that the driver 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.290
 put the whole back rest because 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.450
 these are the six finishing versions 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.450
 all with the same engine and gearbox 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.409
 the pope 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.629
 the version I chose to drive is the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.269
 move that will be the most sought after 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.950
 the whole line the first impressions of the 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.870
 car are positive 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.000
 the finishing is good the position for 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.010
 driving very comfortable despite the fact 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.590
 bank be a single piece 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.750
 visually pleasing blend with the car 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.340
 but whoever was behind loses 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.079
 view from here 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.299
 the exchange project despite being a 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.129
 little antique has more than a decade 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.440
 if the super good with this new engine 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.150
 point 0 3 cylinders that has already been premiered 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.609
 fox bluemotion 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.459
 We are here in a mountainous region. 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.379
 that the amount of advance and reduction of 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.819
 and he is responding 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.730
 very well 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.170
 the payout limit is six thousand votes 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.349
 We have not had a chance to do 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.390
 an overdrive what you repair 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.400
 so the engine noise is a bit 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.040
 different from a four-cylinder but in 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.040
 practice the drivability is very good 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.290
 the get a well balanced set 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.690
 considering comfort appearance 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.790
 performance is a modern design that 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.010
 serves couples or families with children 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.980
 but one can not forget that it is a 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.169
 veiled vehicle the most basic veiled 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.239
 and the most complete is expensive 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.510
 the best option is with the version 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.510
 intermediary
