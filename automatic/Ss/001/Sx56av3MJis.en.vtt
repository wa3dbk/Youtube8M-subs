00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
find out where all the problems are so

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.639 
find out where all the problems are so
we<00:00:40.160> can<00:00:40.280> give<00:00:40.430> them<00:00:40.520> an<00:00:40.640> accurate<00:00:40.789> quote<00:00:44.649> so

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
we can give them an accurate quote so

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.110 
we can give them an accurate quote so
here<00:00:45.859> we<00:00:45.980> are<00:00:46.010> back<00:00:46.129> with<00:00:46.429> the<00:00:46.519> drain<00:00:46.699> camera

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
here we are back with the drain camera

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.970 
here we are back with the drain camera
I'm<00:00:47.749> going<00:00:47.899> to<00:00:47.989> use<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.319> images<00:00:48.679> from<00:00:48.800> the

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
I'm going to use the images from the

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.619 
I'm going to use the images from the
Australian<00:00:49.309> camera<00:00:49.609> to<00:00:49.670> help<00:00:49.940> me<00:00:50.059> find<00:00:50.359> and

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629

Australian camera to help me find and
then<00:00:51.109> locate<00:00:51.499> any<00:00:51.739> of<00:00:51.859> the<00:00:51.920> problems<00:00:52.249> in<00:00:52.370> the

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
then locate any of the problems in the

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.399 
then locate any of the problems in the
drain<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:52.940> way<00:00:53.480> I<00:00:53.510> can<00:00:53.780> give<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.019> owners<00:00:54.319> an

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
drain that way I can give the owners an

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.169 
drain that way I can give the owners an
accurate<00:00:54.679> quote<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.190> they<00:00:55.640> can<00:00:55.850> use<00:00:56.030> the

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
accurate quote and they can use the

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.209 
accurate quote and they can use the
images<00:00:56.479> are<00:00:56.659> recorded<00:00:56.749> from<00:00:57.289> this<00:00:57.530> inspection

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
images are recorded from this inspection

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.810 
images are recorded from this inspection
to<00:00:58.819> get<00:00:58.940> other<00:00:59.089> quotes<00:00:59.390> as<00:00:59.600> well<00:01:03.670> now<00:01:04.670> we're

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
to get other quotes as well now we're

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.070 
to get other quotes as well now we're
starting<00:01:05.030> at<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.330> top<00:01:05.479> of<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.690> line<00:01:05.840> with<00:01:05.990> the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
starting at the top of the line with the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.020 
starting at the top of the line with the
drain<00:01:06.260> camera<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.610> we're<00:01:07.700> going<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.850> have<00:01:08.000> a

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
drain camera and we're going to have a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.520 
drain camera and we're going to have a
look<00:01:08.210> all<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.479> way<00:01:08.570> through<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.930> drain<00:01:14.530> the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
look all the way through the drain the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.950 
look all the way through the drain the
camera<00:01:15.890> head<00:01:16.100> sends<00:01:16.940> electronic<00:01:17.300> signal<00:01:17.780> back

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
camera head sends electronic signal back

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.050 
camera head sends electronic signal back
to<00:01:17.990> ground<00:01:18.290> level<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:18.830> every<00:01:19.370> time<00:01:19.550> we<00:01:20.030> see

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
to ground level so every time we see

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.300 
to ground level so every time we see
tree<00:01:20.510> roots<00:01:20.720> will<00:01:21.230> go<00:01:21.380> on<00:01:21.470> locate<00:01:21.860> where<00:01:22.070> it<00:01:22.190> is

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
tree roots will go on locate where it is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:36.360 
tree roots will go on locate where it is
and<00:01:22.520> get<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.700> depth

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.620 

now<00:01:37.370> that<00:01:37.550> is<00:01:37.640> giving<00:01:37.910> us<00:01:37.970> an<00:01:38.090> accurate<00:01:38.240> depth

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
now that is giving us an accurate depth

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.530 
now that is giving us an accurate depth
of<00:01:38.810> 1.5<00:01:39.440> meters<00:01:39.880> that<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:41.000> just<00:01:41.180> one<00:01:41.330> of<00:01:41.360> the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
of 1.5 meters that is just one of the

00:01:41.540 --> 00:02:11.140 
of 1.5 meters that is just one of the
tree<00:01:41.750> root<00:01:41.900> blockages<00:01:42.350> in<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.590> drain

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.030 

we've<00:02:12.150> used<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.540> drain<00:02:12.750> camera<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.379> was<00:02:13.769> helped

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
we've used the drain camera I was helped

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.710 
we've used the drain camera I was helped
to<00:02:14.160> record<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.670> images<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.000> saw<00:02:15.239> in<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> drain

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
to record the images I saw in the drain

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.559 
to record the images I saw in the drain
