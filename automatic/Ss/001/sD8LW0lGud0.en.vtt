00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.300 
and I use these to help them to stay
secure<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:38.000> have<00:02:38.300> this<00:02:38.540> half<00:02:38.870> left<00:02:39.230> right<00:02:39.560> so

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
secure so I have this half left right so

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.900 
secure so I have this half left right so
I<00:02:40.550> begin<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.030> pull<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.780> top<00:02:42.230> as<00:02:42.730> much<00:02:43.730> as

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
I begin to pull this top as much as

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:55.600 
I begin to pull this top as much as
possible<00:02:44.860> against<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.160> side<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.910> my<00:02:47.980> head

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.520 

and<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.360> reason<00:02:56.690> why<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:58.180> don't<00:02:59.180> go<00:02:59.570> like<00:03:00.110> go

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
and the reason why I don't go like go

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.980 
and the reason why I don't go like go
all<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:01.010> way<00:03:01.040> around<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.790> one<00:03:02.030> way<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.600> because

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
all the way around in one way is because

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.260 
all the way around in one way is because
I<00:03:03.080> just<00:03:03.110> I've<00:03:03.740> done<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.160> before<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:04.790> I

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
I just I've done that before and it's I

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.680 
I just I've done that before and it's I
don't<00:03:05.600> know<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.840> doesn't<00:03:05.960> seem<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:07.480> work<00:03:08.480> out

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
don't know it doesn't seem to work out

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.620 
don't know it doesn't seem to work out
for<00:03:08.960> me<00:03:09.110> when<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.320> do<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.710> that<00:03:09.920> way<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:11.360> way

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
for me when I do it that way so this way

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:20.490 
for me when I do it that way so this way
just<00:03:11.900> works<00:03:12.110> better<00:03:12.470> for<00:03:13.510> me

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:40.899
