plastic trumpets their design kind of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.260 
plastic trumpets their design kind of
weird<00:00:59.129> they<00:00:59.640> seem<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.850> they're<00:01:00.059> very

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
weird they seem like they're very

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.689 
weird they seem like they're very
awkward<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.690> hold<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.410> actually<00:01:02.309> shaped

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
awkward to hold this one actually shaped

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.210 
awkward to hold this one actually shaped
more<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.090> regular<00:01:03.300> trumpet<00:01:03.979> as<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.070> can

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
more like a regular trumpet as you can

lightweight<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.270> having<00:01:57.869> nothing<00:01:58.020> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
lightweight it's like having nothing I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
lightweight it's like having nothing I
still<00:01:58.500> can't<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.770> over<00:01:58.829> how<00:01:59.070> lightweight

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
still can't get over how lightweight

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.999 
still can't get over how lightweight
this<00:01:59.670> thing<00:01:59.880> feels<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.899> how<00:02:01.200> light<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
this thing feels and how light it is to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.639 
this thing feels and how light it is to
carry<00:02:02.219> around<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:03.540> valves<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> slides

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
carry around the valves and the slides

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.120 
carry around the valves and the slides
they<00:02:04.950> work

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
they work

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.679 
they work
they're<00:02:06.490> serviceable<00:02:07.060> they're<00:02:07.329> not<00:02:07.450> great

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
they're serviceable they're not great

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.199 
they're serviceable they're not great
but<00:02:08.380> for<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:09.220> know<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.640> horn<00:02:09.849> that's<00:02:09.940> under

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
but for you know the horn that's under

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.120 
but for you know the horn that's under
$200<00:02:10.840> that's<00:02:11.080> made<00:02:11.230> out<00:02:11.319> of<00:02:11.440> plastic<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:11.980> mean

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
$200 that's made out of plastic I mean

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.460 
$200 that's made out of plastic I mean
what<00:02:12.220> can<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.370> really<00:02:12.640> expect<00:02:13.120> right<00:02:13.330> um<00:02:14.140> so

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
what can you really expect right um so

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.130 
what can you really expect right um so
the<00:02:15.459> horn<00:02:15.700> does<00:02:15.910> come<00:02:16.150> with<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.510> plastic

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the horn does come with a plastic

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.630 
the horn does come with a plastic
mouthpiece<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.980> guess<00:02:18.160> since<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.459> have<00:02:18.550> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
mouthpiece and I guess since I have the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.729 
mouthpiece and I guess since I have the
black<00:02:18.880> model<00:02:19.330> came<00:02:19.690> with<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.840> black<00:02:20.019> plastic

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
black model came with a black plastic

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.259 
black model came with a black plastic
mouthpiece<00:02:20.920> um<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.790> wouldn't<00:02:22.120> really

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
mouthpiece um I wouldn't really

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.020 
mouthpiece um I wouldn't really
recommend<00:02:22.390> using<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:24.220> plastic<00:02:24.700> mouthpiece

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
recommend using the plastic mouthpiece

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.240 
recommend using the plastic mouthpiece
that<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.630> comes<00:02:25.810> with<00:02:26.019> just<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.739> combination

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
that it comes with just the combination

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.470 
that it comes with just the combination
of<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.430> plastic<00:02:27.849> mouthpiece<00:02:28.030> with<00:02:28.390> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
of the plastic mouthpiece with the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.080 
of the plastic mouthpiece with the
plastic<00:02:28.870> horn<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:30.220> tone<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.819> get<00:02:30.970> is

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
plastic horn the tone that you get is

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.360 
plastic horn the tone that you get is
very<00:02:31.209> very<00:02:31.480> tubby<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.410> guess<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.190> could<00:02:33.280> be

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
very very tubby I guess it could be

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.059 
very very tubby I guess it could be
almost<00:02:33.700> flugelhorn<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.900> which<00:02:35.680> might<00:02:35.890> be

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
almost flugelhorn like which might be

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.570 
almost flugelhorn like which might be
usable<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:37.019> some<00:02:38.019> situations<00:02:38.590> like<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.799> small

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
usable in some situations like a small

00:02:39.580 --> 00:03:06.630 
usable in some situations like a small
groups<00:02:39.880> restaurant<00:02:40.420> gigs

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.520 

the<00:03:07.640> second<00:03:07.910> valve<00:03:08.090> but<00:03:08.810> as<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:08.990> can<00:03:09.110> tell<00:03:09.290> the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
the second valve but as you can tell the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.680 
the second valve but as you can tell the
tone<00:03:09.740> it's<00:03:09.950> it's<00:03:10.220> okay<00:03:10.520> it's<00:03:11.180> it's<00:03:11.570> not

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
tone it's it's okay it's it's not

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.270 
tone it's it's okay it's it's not
horrible<00:03:11.990> but<00:03:12.230> it's<00:03:12.530> not<00:03:12.680> anything<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.070> you

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
horrible but it's not anything that you

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.820 
horrible but it's not anything that you
would<00:03:13.400> actually<00:03:13.520> want<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:15.410> use<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.740> a<00:03:15.770> regular

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
would actually want to use on a regular

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.650 
would actually want to use on a regular
basis<00:03:16.490> I<00:03:16.700> wouldn't<00:03:16.880> really<00:03:16.970> recommend<00:03:17.060> using

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
basis I wouldn't really recommend using

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.720 
basis I wouldn't really recommend using
that<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.830> plastic<00:03:19.190> mouthpiece<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.640> it

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
that the plastic mouthpiece that it

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.380 
that the plastic mouthpiece that it
comes<00:03:19.910> with

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
comes with

now with the metal mouthpiece the tone

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.780 
now with the metal mouthpiece the tone

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.040 
you get against I'm not fantastic but
it's<00:03:25.880> actually<00:03:26.120> very<00:03:26.150> serviceable<00:03:26.750> very

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050
