00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.529
 I know he wants 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:02.219
 to Ana 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.019

 if you can do this 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:39.559
 I think the city 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.059
 it was shameful 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:47.309
 clear 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:49.939

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.990

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.159
 Antonio Pereira I was studying or working 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.639
 Thank God for that, he insisted 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.409
 but not at any price by doing this 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.930

 with the adoption 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.879
 but a new message to g1 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:45.979
 Let's do this genre. 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.979

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.419

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.419
 looking for the best attack with a lot of affection 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.629

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.550
 drunk driver and those in the taste 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.430
 the realization of 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.069

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:35.959
 however our future the president of the cdl 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.240

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.240
 preparing to suffer 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:43.680
 year 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.389
