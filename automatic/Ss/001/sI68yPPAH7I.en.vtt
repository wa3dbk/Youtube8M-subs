00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
front panels that have been cut out for

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.820 
front panels that have been cut out for
actually<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.730> hx1<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.540> what<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.470> want<00:00:16.680> to

actually the hx1 and what I want to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.099 
actually the hx1 and what I want to
review<00:00:16.949> now<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.580> how<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.760> pre-drill<00:00:18.539> holes<00:00:18.570> for

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
review now is how to pre-drill holes for

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.570 
review now is how to pre-drill holes for
attaching<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.680> screws<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.310> going<00:00:20.520> to

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
attaching the screws that are going to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.330 
attaching the screws that are going to
have<00:00:20.789> hold<00:00:21.119> your<00:00:21.810> exterior<00:00:22.350> skin<00:00:22.680> panels<00:00:23.070> to

have hold your exterior skin panels to

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.810 
have hold your exterior skin panels to
your<00:00:23.640> framework<00:00:24.949> basically<00:00:25.949> as<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.670> see

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
your framework basically as you can see

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.150 
your framework basically as you can see
here<00:00:27.119> I've<00:00:27.359> got<00:00:27.390> clamps<00:00:28.050> because<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.740> have

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
here I've got clamps because I have

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.950 
here I've got clamps because I have
mirrored<00:00:29.640> two<00:00:29.820> pieces<00:00:30.210> together<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
mirrored two pieces together for the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.709 
mirrored two pieces together for the
right<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.320> left<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:32.090> they<00:00:33.090> are<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.600> know

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
right and left and they are you know

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.229 
right and left and they are you know
even<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.530> four<00:00:34.770> corners<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:35.340> edges<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
even on all four corners or edges and

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.630 
even on all four corners or edges and
are<00:00:36.899> ready<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.140> be<00:00:37.350> drilled<00:00:37.590> now<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.399> all

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
are ready to be drilled now and I do all

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.190 
are ready to be drilled now and I do all
this<00:00:38.790> before<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> paint<00:00:39.510> because<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.960> want<00:00:40.140> to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
this before I paint because you want to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
this before I paint because you want to
get<00:00:40.320> all<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.469> dust<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.460> debris<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.850> all

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.630 
get all your dust and debris and all
that<00:00:42.090> stuff<00:00:42.210> out<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.660> way<00:00:43.460> at<00:00:44.460> least

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that stuff out of the way at least

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.860 
that stuff out of the way at least
that's<00:00:44.850> how<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.750> could

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
that's how I like to do it you could

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.450 
that's how I like to do it you could
paint<00:00:46.110> these<00:00:46.230> first<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:46.710> whole<00:00:46.890> sheets<00:00:47.190> then

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
paint these first as whole sheets then

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.850 
paint these first as whole sheets then
come<00:00:47.670> back<00:00:47.700> cut<00:00:48.239> them<00:00:48.390> drill<00:00:49.050> them<00:00:49.170> etc<00:00:49.289> then

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
come back cut them drill them etc then

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.680 
come back cut them drill them etc then
maybe<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.250> touch<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.640> paint<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.969> necessary<00:00:51.510> but

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
maybe do touch up paint is necessary but

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.869 
maybe do touch up paint is necessary but
basically<00:00:52.079> how<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.340> trace<00:00:53.579> all<00:00:53.760> my

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
basically how I do it is I trace all my

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.090 
basically how I do it is I trace all my
lines<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.960> lay<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> frames<00:00:55.590> down<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
lines out you lay the frames down on the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.920 
lines out you lay the frames down on the
wall<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.059> see<00:00:57.270> i<00:00:57.300> trace<00:00:57.719> out<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
wall as you can see i trace out the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.750 
wall as you can see i trace out the
insides<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.829> wall<00:00:59.010> frames<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.640> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
insides of the wall frames so that you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.160 
insides of the wall frames so that you
know<00:00:59.910> where<00:01:00.120> your<00:01:00.239> wall<00:01:00.420> frame<00:01:00.690> members<00:01:01.020> are

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
know where your wall frame members are

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.080 
know where your wall frame members are
going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> actually<00:01:01.530> sit<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> frame<00:01:02.370> that

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
going to actually sit on the frame that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.289 
going to actually sit on the frame that
I<00:01:03.120> mirror<00:01:03.510> two<00:01:03.750> sheets<00:01:03.989> together<00:01:04.229> making<00:01:04.650> sure

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
I mirror two sheets together making sure

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.880 
I mirror two sheets together making sure
that<00:01:06.299> they're<00:01:06.510> mirrored<00:01:06.900> properly<00:01:07.619> got

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that they're mirrored properly got

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.280 
that they're mirrored properly got
through<00:01:08.100> think<00:01:08.580> three-dimensionally<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.750> you

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
through think three-dimensionally so you

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.840 
through think three-dimensionally so you
know<00:01:10.380> imagine<00:01:10.830> how<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> wall<00:01:11.369> frames<00:01:11.670> are

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
know imagine how the wall frames are

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.420 
know imagine how the wall frames are
supposed<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:13.740> know<00:01:13.830> position<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
supposed to go you know position the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.490 
supposed to go you know position the
sheets<00:01:14.640> accordingly<00:01:15.150> line<00:01:15.479> them<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.780> use

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
sheets accordingly line them up use

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
sheets accordingly line them up use
clamps<00:01:16.890> use<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.700> floor<00:01:17.939> cutting<00:01:18.210> platform

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
clamps use your floor cutting platform

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840 
clamps use your floor cutting platform
cut<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.619> sheets<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:20.340> we've<00:01:20.549> arrived

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
cut out the sheets and now we've arrived

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.020 
cut out the sheets and now we've arrived
to<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.750> step<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.290> pre-drilling<00:01:22.890> poles<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.549> so

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
to the step of pre-drilling poles and so

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.280 
to the step of pre-drilling poles and so
what<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.390> want<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.659> do<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.930> take<00:01:25.080> your

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
what you want to do is take your

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
what you want to do is take your
measurement<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.979> measure<00:01:26.250> across<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.330> know

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
measurement and measure across you know

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.170 
measurement and measure across you know
from<00:01:27.720> any<00:01:27.930> distance<00:01:28.610> first<00:01:29.610> before<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
from any distance first before I do that

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.749 
from any distance first before I do that
I<00:01:30.570> draw<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> line<00:01:31.439> down<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.740> center<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.430> can

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
I draw a line down the center so you can

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.149 
I draw a line down the center so you can
see<00:01:32.939> these<00:01:33.210> darker<00:01:33.659> lines<00:01:33.900> where<00:01:34.680> my<00:01:34.829> two<00:01:34.890> by

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
see these darker lines where my two by

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.590 
see these darker lines where my two by
four<00:01:35.189> wall<00:01:35.579> frame<00:01:35.880> members<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.329> actually

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
four wall frame members are actually

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.969 
four wall frame members are actually
going<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.810> sit<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.229> then<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.409> draw<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> center

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
going to sit and then I draw a center

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.429 
going to sit and then I draw a center
line<00:01:38.329> down<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.810> that's<00:01:39.960> three<00:01:40.200> quarter

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
line down that so that's three quarter

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.960 
line down that so that's three quarter
inches<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.829> from<00:01:41.009> each<00:01:41.130> side<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.640> actually

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
inches in from each side and actually

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.270 
inches in from each side and actually
from<00:01:42.180> from<00:01:42.570> here<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> outer<00:01:43.229> side<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:44.100> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
from from here on the outer side if you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.520 
from from here on the outer side if you
remember<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.670> earlier<00:01:45.000> video<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.390> said<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.320> cut

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
remember in earlier video I said to cut

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.289 
remember in earlier video I said to cut
this<00:01:46.710> an<00:01:46.920> eighth<00:01:47.130> inch<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.640> three<00:01:47.820> sixteenth

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
this an eighth inch to three sixteenth

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.929 
this an eighth inch to three sixteenth
inch<00:01:48.570> thicker<00:01:49.140> because<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:50.100> actually<00:01:50.399> want

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
inch thicker because we actually want

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.469 
inch thicker because we actually want
your<00:01:51.740> side<00:01:52.740> wall<00:01:53.009> frames<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.790> penetrate<00:01:54.270> up

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
your side wall frames to penetrate up

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.319 
your side wall frames to penetrate up
and<00:01:54.630> over<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.380> top<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.490> back<00:01:56.670> frame<00:01:57.030> so

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and over the top and the back frame so

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.120 
and over the top and the back frame so
meaning<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.719> wall<00:01:57.899> frames<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.979> going

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
meaning your wall frames here it's going

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.160 
meaning your wall frames here it's going
to<00:01:59.219> come<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.729> actually<00:02:00.060> come<00:02:00.390> over<00:02:00.750> what's

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
to come up and actually come over what's

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.020 
to come up and actually come over what's
going<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.500> your<00:02:01.530> top<00:02:01.860> skin<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.729> these

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
going to be your top skin so these

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.660 
going to be your top skin so these
distances<00:02:03.420> here<00:02:03.930> are<00:02:04.110> actually<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:05.310> inch<00:02:05.520> and

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
distances here are actually in inch and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.920 
distances here are actually in inch and
five-eighths<00:02:06.030> instead<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.540> an<00:02:06.630> inch<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.899> a

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
five-eighths instead of an inch and a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.160 
five-eighths instead of an inch and a
half<00:02:06.960> these<00:02:07.680> interior<00:02:08.220> frames<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.700> back

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
half these interior frames in the back

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.870 
half these interior frames in the back
or<00:02:09.410> an<00:02:09.860> inch<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.160> half<00:02:10.190> that's<00:02:10.520> what<00:02:10.759> these

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
or an inch and a half that's what these

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.690 
or an inch and a half that's what these
lines<00:02:11.660> here<00:02:11.810> are<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.950> your<00:02:13.250> three<00:02:13.430> quarter

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
lines here are so your three quarter

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.820 
lines here are so your three quarter
inches<00:02:13.910> here<00:02:14.360> on<00:02:14.690> each<00:02:15.020> side<00:02:15.260> three<00:02:15.530> quarter

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
inches here on each side three quarter

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.800 
inches here on each side three quarter
three<00:02:16.040> quarter<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.520> then<00:02:16.640> on<00:02:16.819> this<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.599> want

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
three quarter and then on this you want

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.930 
three quarter and then on this you want
to<00:02:17.870> measure<00:02:18.050> over<00:02:18.590> from<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.980> inside<00:02:19.580> three

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
to measure over from the inside three

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.210 
to measure over from the inside three
quarter<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.500> know<00:02:21.620> you'll<00:02:21.800> hit<00:02:21.980> the

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
quarter so that you know you'll hit the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.699 
quarter so that you know you'll hit the
exact<00:02:22.849> center<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.180> your<00:02:23.360> two<00:02:23.510> by<00:02:23.660> four<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.440> I

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
exact center of your two by four so I

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.530 
exact center of your two by four so I
basically<00:02:24.980> done<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.640> now<00:02:25.850> just<00:02:26.239> making

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
basically done that now just making

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.900 
basically done that now just making
little<00:02:26.690> V<00:02:27.020> style<00:02:27.530> hash<00:02:27.770> marks<00:02:28.220> all<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.819> way

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
little V style hash marks all the way

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.190 
little V style hash marks all the way
around<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.270> perimeter<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.810> mark<00:02:29.989> out<00:02:30.170> where

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
around the perimeter to mark out where

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.110 
around the perimeter to mark out where
the<00:02:30.410> center<00:02:30.650> lines<00:02:30.890> are<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.459> then<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.819> like<00:02:32.000> to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
the center lines are and then I like to

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.610 
the center lines are and then I like to
use<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.270> metal<00:02:32.630> ruler<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.140> can<00:02:33.170> pick<00:02:33.440> these<00:02:33.560> up

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
use a metal ruler you can pick these up

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.460 
use a metal ruler you can pick these up
in<00:02:33.860> an<00:02:33.950> art<00:02:34.190> supply<00:02:34.370> store<00:02:34.910> or<00:02:35.600> maybe<00:02:36.140> even<00:02:36.230> a

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
in an art supply store or maybe even a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.710 
in an art supply store or maybe even a
hobby<00:02:36.650> store<00:02:37.010> something<00:02:37.400> like<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.970> like

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
hobby store something like that I like

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.479 
hobby store something like that I like
using<00:02:38.870> metal<00:02:39.290> rulers<00:02:39.650> because<00:02:39.950> they're

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
using metal rulers because they're

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.340 
using metal rulers because they're
easier<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.790> work<00:02:40.970> with<00:02:41.030> sometimes<00:02:41.450> than<00:02:42.319> a

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
easier to work with sometimes than a

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.990 
easier to work with sometimes than a
standard<00:02:42.739> tape<00:02:42.950> measure<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.730> can<00:02:43.850> get

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
standard tape measure and you can get

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.520 
standard tape measure and you can get
more<00:02:44.180> accurate<00:02:44.690> dimensions<00:02:44.840> and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
more accurate dimensions and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.110 
more accurate dimensions and
measurements<00:02:46.100> with<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.489> metal<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.940> tape

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
measurements with the metal to tape

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.530 
measurements with the metal to tape
measure<00:02:47.299> or<00:02:47.630> metal<00:02:48.290> roller<00:02:48.470> excuse<00:02:48.769> me<00:02:49.540> so

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
measure or metal roller excuse me so

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.509 
measure or metal roller excuse me so
basically<00:02:51.350> as<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.620> can<00:02:51.769> see<00:02:51.920> I've<00:02:52.040> now<00:02:52.190> drawn

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
basically as you can see I've now drawn

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.330 
basically as you can see I've now drawn
lines<00:02:52.910> through<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.900> dead<00:02:54.350> center<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.830> each<00:02:55.190> of

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
lines through the dead center of each of

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.500 
lines through the dead center of each of
where<00:02:55.459> my<00:02:55.580> two<00:02:55.640> by<00:02:55.850> fours<00:02:56.090> are<00:02:56.209> going<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.420> go

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
where my two by fours are going to go

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.690 
where my two by fours are going to go
but<00:02:57.080> now<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.260> need<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.530> know<00:02:57.769> our<00:02:58.100> determine

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
but now you need to know our determine

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.370 
but now you need to know our determine
where<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.090> going<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.330> drill<00:02:59.540> your<00:03:00.110> screw

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
where you going to drill your screw

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.470 
where you going to drill your screw
holes<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.739> how<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.370> do<00:03:01.549> that<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.090> want<00:03:02.420> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
holes and how you do that is you want to

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.650 
holes and how you do that is you want to
take<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:03.049> full<00:03:03.290> measurement<00:03:03.819> across<00:03:04.819> and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
take the full measurement across and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.960 
take the full measurement across and
take<00:03:06.410> note<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.650> however<00:03:07.310> long<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.700> is

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
take note of however long it is

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.700 
take note of however long it is
and<00:03:09.270> because<00:03:09.960> we<00:03:10.110> know<00:03:10.200> these<00:03:10.290> are<00:03:10.470> two<00:03:10.560> by

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
and because we know these are two by

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.890 
and because we know these are two by
fours<00:03:10.980> you're<00:03:11.520> going<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.730> come<00:03:11.910> out<00:03:11.940> at<00:03:12.780> a

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
fours you're going to come out at a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.540 
fours you're going to come out at a
distance<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.590> know<00:03:13.650> I'm<00:03:14.040> going<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.250> come<00:03:14.400> out<00:03:14.520> of

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
distance I know I'm going to come out of

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.950 
distance I know I'm going to come out of
distance<00:03:14.970> from<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.210> inside<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.720> one

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
distance from the inside of this one

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.050 
distance from the inside of this one
three-quarters<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.620> an<00:03:16.740> inch<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.910> I'm<00:03:17.970> gonna

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
three-quarters of an inch so I'm gonna

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.230 
three-quarters of an inch so I'm gonna
line<00:03:18.240> that<00:03:18.450> up<00:03:18.480> I'm<00:03:18.780> going<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.990> mark<00:03:19.110> that

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
line that up I'm going to mark that

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.080 
line that up I'm going to mark that
right<00:03:21.240> now<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.990> make<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.170> little<00:03:22.760> hash<00:03:23.760> mark

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
right now just make a little hash mark

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.140 
right now just make a little hash mark
across<00:03:24.360> there<00:03:25.130> sectioning<00:03:26.130> over<00:03:26.340> here<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.790> know

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
across there sectioning over here I know

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.490 
across there sectioning over here I know
that<00:03:27.390> that's<00:03:27.480> an<00:03:27.720> inch<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:27.990> a<00:03:28.020> half<00:03:28.050> from<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
that that's an inch and a half from the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.560 
that that's an inch and a half from the
back<00:03:28.710> so<00:03:29.520> I'm<00:03:29.580> going<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.760> make<00:03:29.880> my<00:03:30.030> hash<00:03:30.240> mark

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
back so I'm going to make my hash mark

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.200 
back so I'm going to make my hash mark
right<00:03:30.930> there<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:34.080> then<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.280> know<00:03:35.730> what<00:03:35.970> the

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
right there and then I know what the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.030 
right there and then I know what the
total<00:03:36.420> measurement<00:03:36.990> is<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.650> need<00:03:37.890> to

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
total measurement is and so I need to

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.270 
total measurement is and so I need to
reduce<00:03:38.820> that<00:03:39.200> by<00:03:40.200> whatever<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.740> outside

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
reduce that by whatever that outside

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.980 
reduce that by whatever that outside
dimension<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.420> other<00:03:42.540> outside

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
dimension is and that other outside

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.710 
dimension is and that other outside
dimension<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:44.360> because<00:03:45.360> just<00:03:45.540> have<00:03:45.630> to

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
dimension is because just have to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.210 
dimension is because just have to
consult<00:03:45.959> your<00:03:46.140> blueprints<00:03:46.650> obviously<00:03:47.100> this

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
consult your blueprints obviously this

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.290 
consult your blueprints obviously this
is<00:03:47.340> going<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.550> be<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.670> little<00:03:47.790> bit<00:03:47.910> different

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
is going to be a little bit different

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.780 
is going to be a little bit different
for<00:03:48.390> each<00:03:48.450> model

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.140 

so<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.480> subtract<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.079> amount<00:03:54.150> three

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
so you subtract that amount three

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.520 
so you subtract that amount three
quarters<00:03:55.480> of<00:03:55.629> an<00:03:55.810> inch<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.140> three<00:03:56.230> quarters

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
quarters of an inch and three quarters

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.839 
quarters of an inch and three quarters
of<00:03:56.620> an<00:03:56.739> inch<00:03:56.829> you<00:03:56.950> left<00:03:57.219> over<00:03:57.519> with<00:03:57.640> whatever

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
of an inch you left over with whatever

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.300 
of an inch you left over with whatever
to<00:03:58.060> mention<00:03:58.390> your<00:03:58.689> leftover<00:03:59.109> wealth<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.709> then

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
to mention your leftover wealth and then

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.369 
to mention your leftover wealth and then
you<00:04:00.400> need<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:00.670> divide<00:04:00.969> that<00:04:01.209> dimension<00:04:01.780> by<00:04:02.319> the

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
you need to divide that dimension by the

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.920 
you need to divide that dimension by the
amount<00:04:02.680> of<00:04:02.799> spaces<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.370> want<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:03.640> use<00:04:03.849> and<00:04:04.510> in

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
amount of spaces you want to use and in

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.630 
amount of spaces you want to use and in
this<00:04:05.049> case<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.469> knew<00:04:05.709> from<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.159> previous<00:04:06.519> video

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
this case I knew from the previous video

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.309 
this case I knew from the previous video
that<00:04:06.849> I<00:04:07.030> discussed<00:04:07.450> this<00:04:07.599> i<00:04:07.750> wanted<00:04:08.049> to<00:04:08.140> use

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
that I discussed this i wanted to use

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.399 
that I discussed this i wanted to use
four<00:04:08.650> spaces<00:04:08.950> because<00:04:09.939> i<00:04:10.180> wanted<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.540> have<00:04:10.720> one

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
four spaces because i wanted to have one

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.009 
four spaces because i wanted to have one
screw<00:04:11.769> two<00:04:12.129> screws<00:04:12.519> three<00:04:12.939> screws<00:04:13.209> four

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
screw two screws three screws four

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.039 
screw two screws three screws four
screws<00:04:14.439> so<00:04:14.799> actually<00:04:15.370> let's<00:04:15.489> see<00:04:15.640> one<00:04:16.049> there

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
screws so actually let's see one there

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.659 
screws so actually let's see one there
one<00:04:17.470> there<00:04:18.419> four<00:04:19.419> screws<00:04:20.039> 56<00:04:21.039> total<00:04:21.280> if<00:04:21.579> you

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
one there four screws 56 total if you

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.100 
one there four screws 56 total if you
count<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.000> two<00:04:22.150> on<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.360> end<00:04:22.539> so<00:04:22.780> i'm<00:04:22.930> going<00:04:23.020> to

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
count the two on the end so i'm going to

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.610 
count the two on the end so i'm going to
have<00:04:23.199> one<00:04:23.229> two<00:04:23.830> three<00:04:24.610> four<00:04:25.000> five<00:04:25.360> spaces<00:04:25.780> i'm

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
have one two three four five spaces i'm

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.230 
have one two three four five spaces i'm
going<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.800> divide<00:04:26.919> this<00:04:27.280> by<00:04:27.490> five<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:30.490> i<00:04:31.060> come

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
going to divide this by five and i come

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.870 
going to divide this by five and i come
up<00:04:31.360> with<00:04:31.570> round<00:04:32.310> about<00:04:33.310> six<00:04:33.699> and

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
up with round about six and

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.760 
up with round about six and
three-quarter<00:04:34.270> inches<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:35.470> can<00:04:35.620> round

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
three-quarter inches and you can round

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.100 
three-quarter inches and you can round
off<00:04:36.039> if<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:36.639> measure<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.210> mark<00:04:37.720> those<00:04:37.900> from

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
off if you measure and mark those from

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.310 
off if you measure and mark those from
the<00:04:38.199> outside<00:04:38.620> in<00:04:38.860> then<00:04:39.520> your<00:04:39.759> center<00:04:40.419> distance

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
the outside in then your center distance

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.129 
the outside in then your center distance
to<00:04:41.590> distance<00:04:41.979> would<00:04:42.490> be<00:04:42.520> a<00:04:42.669> little<00:04:42.880> smaller<00:04:43.210> so

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
to distance would be a little smaller so

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.350 
to distance would be a little smaller so
basically<00:04:44.919> once<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.460> know<00:04:45.610> what<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:45.970> space

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
basically once you know what that space

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.150 
basically once you know what that space
distance<00:04:46.870> is<00:04:47.050> that's<00:04:47.289> the<00:04:47.560> space<00:04:47.889> between

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
distance is that's the space between

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.850 
distance is that's the space between
your<00:04:48.520> screws<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:49.900> i'll<00:04:50.110> now<00:04:50.320> measure<00:04:50.650> that

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
your screws and so i'll now measure that

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.290 
your screws and so i'll now measure that
off<00:04:51.479> here

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.499 

and<00:04:57.289> then<00:04:58.039> come<00:04:58.310> same<00:04:58.819> distance<00:04:59.210> starting

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
and then come same distance starting

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:00.969 
and then come same distance starting
from<00:04:59.659> the<00:04:59.780> other<00:04:59.900> end<00:05:00.139> at<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.590> hat<00:05:00.740> first

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
from the other end at that hat first

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.870 
from the other end at that hat first
hash<00:05:01.190> mark<00:05:01.490> we<00:05:01.610> made

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.650 

and<00:05:06.420> so<00:05:06.870> on<00:05:09.020> another<00:05:10.020> mark<00:05:10.380> there<00:05:11.420> come<00:05:12.420> back

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
and so on another mark there come back

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.090 
and so on another mark there come back
down<00:05:13.050> this<00:05:13.320> one<00:05:13.590> another<00:05:13.860> mark<00:05:14.130> there<00:05:16.100> and

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
down this one another mark there and

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.560 
down this one another mark there and
then<00:05:17.220> basically<00:05:17.400> those<00:05:17.820> same<00:05:18.060> two<00:05:18.240> should<00:05:18.540> be

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
then basically those same two should be

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.130 
then basically those same two should be
almost<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.710> same<00:05:19.890> maybe<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.310> little<00:05:20.460> less<00:05:21.080> or<00:05:22.080> a

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
almost the same maybe a little less or a

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.570 
almost the same maybe a little less or a
little<00:05:22.170> closer<00:05:22.530> together<00:05:22.830> but<00:05:23.370> all<00:05:23.460> the

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
little closer together but all the

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.930 
little closer together but all the
outside<00:05:23.880> ones<00:05:24.150> are<00:05:24.450> exactly<00:05:25.170> equal<00:05:25.940> basically

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
outside ones are exactly equal basically

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.580 
outside ones are exactly equal basically
my<00:05:27.060> builder<00:05:27.360> Manuel<00:05:27.540> talks<00:05:28.140> about<00:05:28.380> this<00:05:28.530> in

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
my builder Manuel talks about this in

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.680 
my builder Manuel talks about this in
detail<00:05:28.790> this<00:05:29.790> is<00:05:29.940> one<00:05:30.090> of<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.270> finer<00:05:30.540> points

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
detail this is one of the finer points

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.140 
detail this is one of the finer points
of<00:05:31.080> carpentry<00:05:31.620> of<00:05:31.830> how<00:05:32.160> to<00:05:32.220> you<00:05:32.850> know<00:05:32.880> be

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
of carpentry of how to you know be

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.640 
of carpentry of how to you know be
really<00:05:33.390> symmetrical<00:05:33.720> how<00:05:34.230> to<00:05:34.290> get<00:05:34.470> all<00:05:34.620> your

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
really symmetrical how to get all your

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.370 
really symmetrical how to get all your
Subaru<00:05:35.160> space<00:05:35.640> nice<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:36.270> properly<00:05:36.660> so<00:05:37.350> that

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
Subaru space nice and properly so that

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.560 
Subaru space nice and properly so that
each<00:05:37.770> spacing<00:05:38.370> distance<00:05:38.730> between<00:05:39.030> each<00:05:39.090> screw

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
each spacing distance between each screw

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.960 
each spacing distance between each screw
is<00:05:39.720> exactly<00:05:40.140> the<00:05:40.350> same<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:41.040> would<00:05:41.850> recommend

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
is exactly the same I would recommend

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.570 
is exactly the same I would recommend
practicing<00:05:42.600> on<00:05:43.050> a<00:05:43.080> piece<00:05:43.320> of<00:05:43.550> scrap<00:05:44.550> wood

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
practicing on a piece of scrap wood

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.070 
practicing on a piece of scrap wood
first<00:05:45.030> if<00:05:45.270> this<00:05:45.390> is<00:05:45.540> something<00:05:45.720> that<00:05:45.930> you've

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
first if this is something that you've

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.500 
first if this is something that you've
never<00:05:46.290> done<00:05:46.530> before<00:05:47.090> it's<00:05:48.090> actually<00:05:48.390> really

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
never done before it's actually really

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.000 
never done before it's actually really
easy<00:05:48.630> to<00:05:48.960> do<00:05:49.080> once<00:05:49.260> you<00:05:49.410> kind<00:05:49.530> of<00:05:49.620> get<00:05:49.740> into<00:05:49.890> the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
easy to do once you kind of get into the

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.890 
easy to do once you kind of get into the
habit<00:05:50.160> of<00:05:50.400> it<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:50.730> we'll<00:05:51.360> just<00:05:51.480> make<00:05:51.690> sure

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
habit of it and we'll just make sure

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.810 
habit of it and we'll just make sure
that<00:05:52.140> all<00:05:52.320> your<00:05:52.470> screws<00:05:52.860> are<00:05:53.040> nice<00:05:53.370> and<00:05:53.610> evenly

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
that all your screws are nice and evenly

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.670 
that all your screws are nice and evenly
spaced<00:05:54.210> and<00:05:54.570> again<00:05:55.050> once<00:05:55.290> you<00:05:55.380> do<00:05:55.500> this<00:05:55.620> for

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
spaced and again once you do this for

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.560 
spaced and again once you do this for
this<00:05:55.980> obviously<00:05:56.820> you<00:05:56.970> know<00:05:57.090> these<00:05:57.240> two<00:05:57.420> links

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
this obviously you know these two links

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.880 
this obviously you know these two links
are<00:05:57.750> going<00:05:57.870> to<00:05:57.930> be<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.110> same<00:05:58.350> so<00:05:58.560> you<00:05:58.620> can<00:05:58.770> use

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
are going to be the same so you can use

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
are going to be the same so you can use
the<00:05:58.980> same<00:05:59.190> measurement<00:05:59.640> for<00:05:59.760> this

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
the same measurement for this

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.000 
the same measurement for this
crossmember<00:06:00.180> so<00:06:01.110> same<00:06:01.410> thing<00:06:01.440> if<00:06:01.800> you<00:06:01.830> ever

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
crossmember so same thing if you ever

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.550 
crossmember so same thing if you ever
have<00:06:02.250> one<00:06:02.720> member<00:06:03.720> that's<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:04.110> same<00:06:04.290> length

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
have one member that's the same length

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.230 
have one member that's the same length
you<00:06:04.740> know<00:06:04.860> you<00:06:05.160> can<00:06:05.310> use<00:06:05.430> that<00:06:05.610> same<00:06:05.790> distance

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
you know you can use that same distance

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.730 
you know you can use that same distance
or<00:06:06.390> space<00:06:06.660> measurement<00:06:07.230> before<00:06:07.500> the<00:06:07.590> other

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
or space measurement before the other

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.920 
or space measurement before the other
member<00:06:08.070> and<00:06:08.430> then<00:06:08.850> you<00:06:09.240> know<00:06:09.360> just<00:06:09.720> continue

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
member and then you know just continue

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.600 
member and then you know just continue
around<00:06:10.260> the<00:06:10.530> whole<00:06:10.680> sheet<00:06:11.040> where<00:06:11.460> your

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
around the whole sheet where your

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.270 
around the whole sheet where your
framework<00:06:11.850> is<00:06:12.240> and<00:06:12.510> do<00:06:12.660> the<00:06:12.750> same<00:06:12.930> thing<00:06:13.280> it's

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
framework is and do the same thing it's

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.710 
framework is and do the same thing it's
pretty<00:06:14.490> simple<00:06:14.700> pretty<00:06:14.940> straightforward<00:06:15.090> and

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
pretty simple pretty straightforward and

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.990 
pretty simple pretty straightforward and
then<00:06:15.810> once<00:06:15.960> you're<00:06:16.080> done<00:06:16.230> I'm<00:06:17.190> using<00:06:17.430> a<00:06:17.610> 3<00:06:17.790> 30

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
then once you're done I'm using a 3 30

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.360 
then once you're done I'm using a 3 30
second<00:06:18.420> 2<00:06:18.510> inch<00:06:18.750> drill<00:06:19.080> bit<00:06:19.140> I'm<00:06:19.920> going<00:06:20.040> to<00:06:20.100> set

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
second 2 inch drill bit I'm going to set

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.470 
second 2 inch drill bit I'm going to set
that<00:06:20.400> to<00:06:20.700> a<00:06:20.730> depth<00:06:21.060> of<00:06:21.270> 58<00:06:22.170> inch<00:06:22.940> maybe<00:06:23.940> maybe

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
that to a depth of 58 inch maybe maybe

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.570 
that to a depth of 58 inch maybe maybe
give<00:06:24.660> it<00:06:24.750> a<00:06:24.810> little<00:06:24.930> less<00:06:25.140> about<00:06:25.350> half<00:06:25.650> right

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
give it a little less about half right

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.190 
give it a little less about half right
there<00:06:26.820> and<00:06:27.000> now<00:06:27.030> I'm<00:06:27.390> ready<00:06:27.570> to<00:06:27.660> drill<00:06:27.990> and

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
there and now I'm ready to drill and

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.960 
there and now I'm ready to drill and
before<00:06:28.950> you<00:06:29.130> draw<00:06:29.400> you<00:06:29.460> just<00:06:29.670> want<00:06:29.820> to<00:06:29.850> make

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
before you draw you just want to make

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.970 
before you draw you just want to make
sure<00:06:30.030> that<00:06:30.390> you're<00:06:30.660> cutting<00:06:31.140> platform<00:06:31.650> stuff

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
sure that you're cutting platform stuff

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.470 
sure that you're cutting platform stuff
is<00:06:32.130> up<00:06:32.280> underneath<00:06:32.610> where<00:06:33.060> you're<00:06:33.240> going<00:06:33.390> to

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
is up underneath where you're going to

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.480 
is up underneath where you're going to
drill<00:06:33.690> through<00:06:33.720> and<00:06:34.380> this<00:06:34.710> is<00:06:34.860> so<00:06:35.010> that<00:06:35.280> you

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
drill through and this is so that you

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.700 
drill through and this is so that you
know<00:06:35.610> if<00:06:36.030> you<00:06:36.120> penetrated<00:06:36.660> through<00:06:37.380> without

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
know if you penetrated through without

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.170 
know if you penetrated through without
using<00:06:38.010> this<00:06:38.250> you<00:06:38.490> can<00:06:38.640> make<00:06:38.910> a<00:06:38.940> lot<00:06:39.150> of

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
using this you can make a lot of

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.530 
using this you can make a lot of
splinters<00:06:39.510> in<00:06:39.810> rough<00:06:40.290> penetration<00:06:41.220> on<00:06:42.210> the

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
splinters in rough penetration on the

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.810 
splinters in rough penetration on the
back<00:06:43.170> side<00:06:43.410> of<00:06:43.470> your<00:06:43.770> material<00:06:44.370> whereas<00:06:44.640> if

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
back side of your material whereas if

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.850 
back side of your material whereas if
you<00:06:44.970> have<00:06:45.480> something<00:06:45.870> solid<00:06:46.080> underneath<00:06:46.560> it

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
you have something solid underneath it

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.530 
you have something solid underneath it
will<00:06:46.950> help<00:06:47.100> it<00:06:47.310> make<00:06:47.460> a<00:06:47.670> much<00:06:47.850> nicer<00:06:48.060> clean

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
will help it make a much nicer clean

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.360 
will help it make a much nicer clean
your<00:06:48.660> hole<00:06:48.840> when<00:06:49.560> the<00:06:49.650> drill<00:06:49.860> comes<00:06:50.100> out<00:06:50.250> the
