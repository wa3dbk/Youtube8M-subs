00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.590
 there the aya galera ayache that always you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.710
 but the midfield commented law plus one 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.050
 video of his goals and this time it is 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.119
 the first video covering let's say 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.010
 so more fully 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.900
 neodi one of the four mode maps 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.240
 multiplayer and came in the latter 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.349
 must be theirs and 11 at the top right already 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.390
 I had promised you that I was going to 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.130
 bringing videos there is not speaking in a way 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.110
 more specific about what I found of 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.730
 each of the maps and such I always do 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.399
 this in lcd releases should already 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.550
 also I have become accustomed to every 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.770
 dops 2 cells and I want to do it here 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.090
 Also in the code delights to surround 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.879
 the first because I'll be covering 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.559
 here for you is a bayview map is already 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.420
 also from the background gameplay including myself 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.129
 I'm using the new america weapon on 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.510
 assault version in the video neighborhood too 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.980
 I already promised you that I will. 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.899
 bring a video talking a little better 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.579
 more specifically about the weapon in question. 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.890
 are connected in the channel that the cover 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.049
 an award that will continue to be complete 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.640
 as it always is, even if you do not 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.619
 saw a video has left on the channel today 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.770
 showing one of the steroids, which 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.479
 brought that which came this dlc will be very 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.400
 cool that involves extinct multiplayer 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.810
 the following is grace and such is good 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.509
 easy to do, I recommend you give a 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 look if you have not seen okay but 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.909
 without further ado we'll talk about the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.830
 map 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.330
 okay I'll take the actor that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.799
 part of the map on the top and already 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.409
 point out that this is a party that 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.079
 I did not like the map is the design of the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.180
 map itself the part let's say so from the ground 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.310
 - the lower part the main floor 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.049
 So it 's really good I liked it. 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.640
 I thought you got some nice wheels . 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.860
 Good local legal entries for 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.470
 block enemies however this 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.360
 map it has many high places 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.130
 many windows that tower itself 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.530
 I was there now on but I'm 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.939
 climbing another high place again and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.380
 This is a bit annoying because depending on 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.799
 the kind you get on the opposing side 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.420
 You'll always face guys up there. 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.640
 these places always know faces that 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.200
 Are on top of the hill waiting for you 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 went from waiting with more at the time or 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.979
 thing or just kept 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.450
 Neither fernando nor pass and this is 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.179
 very boring we know how much this 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.950
 irritates right and what is sadly 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.510
 always on almost every map I was 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.240
 commenting with my friends for now 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.610
 little 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.670
 when I was playing that one of the great 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.520
 problems of good code maps is 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.340
 whenever they always have a high place 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.660
 You know, one can be the best brand. 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.970
 that has but he will always have a local 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.040
 zinho potatos with a window to the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.050
 face jacket and guitar the guy who is 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.120
 field and get a jacket in this is a 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.220
 A little boring of course you have to have 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.770
 from old photos and always 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.330
 It existed but whether or not it is a little 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.370
 boring huh 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.900
 Another boring thing about this map is that 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.780
 what happened now this bastard 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.270
 Bondinho is not a nice interaction that 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.200
 tram he keeps walking the whole match 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.970
 nonstop 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.530
 there's no way you can stop or even 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.240
 you activate the highest speed and 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.770
 son stays at the same speed walking 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.030
 same route along the same route as the 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.570
 map 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.360
 what happens is that it is boring right but 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.190
 Finally it is also a strategy of 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.500
 campaign already by not such a strategy 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.910
 Good, that 's why you walk. 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.460
 alone inside for you to make a 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.930
 great night, well, I miss you, and there's a 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.460
 little hard you kill the guy is there 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.200
 inside however for the face that is 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.900
 there is also not easy to kill the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.730
 dude it's out because if you have to 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.460
 opportunity to play enters that 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.260
 Try to kill someone from there. 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.730
 inside where I did because at the same time 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.560
 That you have to fiddle with your sights. 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.120
 because your opponent is moving 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.070
 the cable car is moving and stirring 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.540
 automatically, then it's a 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.100
 Bit annoying that you can kill 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.630
 someone in there but it's also very 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.090
 boring you kill someone it's in there 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.400
 because the ebit roll of laughing of itself 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.200
 cable car is very strong and zinho and the tram 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.250
 are constantly walking are Carlos 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.070
 where the market is always in a 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.620
 half -way fast nÃ© 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.050
 but finally taking away those problems that are 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.480
 precisely the question of the cable car and these 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.790
 and I liked this map. 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.600
 How I told them their routes are fine. 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.490
 cool 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.980
 the issue of support I think of 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.960
 all four maps in this series c 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.540
 this is your best the main one because the 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.950
 I support the others but I do not like it 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.860
 all very badly programmed in my 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.900
 mainly DodÃ´ Fog and the 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.989
 ignition such an initiation that remastering 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.820
 of the air scrap and in there I did not feel 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.010
 So much this problem is not that I found 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.240
 that what is missing is more acceptable to give 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.450
 play a good 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.010
 the question of map coloring is this 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.360
 column- specific map 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.760
 They're very nice, it's remembering a little. 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.280
 the maps of the tele arq he is not even 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.810
 somewhat that gray pattern of maps of the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.700
 infinity ward and that is what the very 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.110
 Collor called if he brought some maps 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.930
 gray pattern even though it no longer 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.210
 be as strong as bill 3 was 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.550
 ok but in general it is a nifty 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.880
 so it 's a good idea, it's a map not much 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.500
 large and is a map from small to medium 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.180
 And it's for you, but it's not cool if 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.890
 you do not if you're lucky not 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.480
 find many faces on the second floor 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.410
 and leave the houses and buildings scattered 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.910
 by map 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.920
 I do not think so but that's what the video is 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.390
 arriving at the end company arrives at the end 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.550
 I apologize for not doing so 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.100
 Well you know I do not play well at 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.750
 much less console in xbox 360 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.150
 but I'll bring what I can get there 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.410
 As much as possible but I will not 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.630
 staying here I hope you have 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.370
 liked this video if you liked 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.500
 do not forget to leave your limit and 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.000
 possible your favorite as you say stay 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.500
 connected on the channel that has many videos 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.680
 even though the second video of the day 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.650
 yesterday on Wednesday where it was broken 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.120
 It was Wednesday, three videos were 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.190
 gives a check on the channel tomorrow should 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.110
 have two more also get online 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.180
 because there's a lot going out and taking 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.680
 this stab to leave your doll is 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.210
 who would say my old colorful friend 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.380
 so I'm going to stay here I hope 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.300
 You liked this video like me 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.040
 said I liked how I said I also left 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.170
 the team and if I need the favorite and then only 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.350
 So a hug to everyone, stay with God. 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.350
 and it's even more
