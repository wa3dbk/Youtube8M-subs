00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.990 
to measure how far six inches I've know
that<00:02:37.380> by<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:38.100> portion<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.580> bricks<00:02:38.820> because

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
that by the portion of bricks because

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.070 
that by the portion of bricks because
normally<00:02:39.360> they're<00:02:39.450> about<00:02:39.570> three<00:02:39.870> inches

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
normally they're about three inches

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.370 
normally they're about three inches
thick<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.590> two<00:02:41.070> points<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.459> bricks<00:02:41.700> should<00:02:41.970> be

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
thick so two points of bricks should be

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:50.990 
thick so two points of bricks should be
the<00:02:43.380> right

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.640 

I've<00:02:52.000> waited<00:02:52.300> two<00:02:52.510> hours<00:02:52.810> now<00:02:52.989> for<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.379> roof

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
I've waited two hours now for the roof

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.589 
I've waited two hours now for the roof
to<00:02:53.800> draw<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.790> think<00:02:55.090> if<00:02:55.150> we<00:02:55.239> just<00:02:55.269> touch<00:02:55.569> it

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
to draw and I think if we just touch it

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.949 
to draw and I think if we just touch it
we<00:02:55.989> should<00:02:56.200> be<00:02:56.379> able<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.769> tell

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
we should be able to tell

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.229 
we should be able to tell
otherwise<00:02:58.959> you'll<00:02:59.230> be<00:02:59.260> sticking<00:02:59.709> to<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.950> roof

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
otherwise you'll be sticking to the roof

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.170 
otherwise you'll be sticking to the roof
and<00:03:01.239> that's<00:03:01.420> how<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.630> farm<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.989> roof
