00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello everyone tankers with you as always 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.190
 hoops and today will tell you about 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.230
 innovation which by its might 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.890
 moved numbering updates bolt of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.050
 tanks blitz to version 2.0 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.050
 today talk about the clans 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.370
 in this video I will touch exclusively 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.390
 only that and the fact that the clan from itself will be 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.900
 represent 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.390
 about the functionality and interface, I will tell you 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.290
 only tomorrow but before the update 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.290
 So go to the light wot blitz 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.200
 the game is still more social 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.989
 team allies are living people 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.080
 as in the opposing team with each 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.570
 you can talk or in battle or already in 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.390
 hangar just remembering his nickname and 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.650
 adding it to your contact list before 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.750
 update 2.0 your social circle was 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.990
 limited only by personal messages and 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.280
 also general chat rooms in the client forum and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.440
 social networks but the latter are 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.520
 open areas where besides your 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.470
 acquaintances for some common interests 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.860
 there is quite a large audience 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.520
 which does not always agree with your point 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.400
 view on absolutely any subject and for 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.830
 order to rally even stronger between 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.370
 a blitz tanker system is introduced 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.280
 clans that allow you to collect your 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.000
 private community united by common 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.090
 purpose and moreover, pretty solid right up to 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.120
 50 people in the same clan 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 crowd no one will argue if in 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.050
 clan will be the rule one for all and all 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.560
 for one 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.590
 but how is everything inside this cell 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.710
 tank community in any plan there 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.180
 the team is the person who created the clan 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.879
 it is he who sets 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.970
 main vector of development and responsible 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.459
 for all the deeds of their wards therefore 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.849
 players need to be treated 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.670
 as seriously as possible and on the other hand 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.519
 to any tankman who enters the clan 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.769
 need to understand that he will be responsible 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.069
 not only for their reputation but also 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.319
 the reputation of the whole clan as a whole is commander 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.780
 may appoint an assistant 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.240
 or deputy 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.940
 which will have advanced 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.500
 opportunities in terms of 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.290
 functional to take the load off 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.080
 commander further but what can 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.750
 achieve a clan at this stage of development 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.530
 wot blitz presents only basic 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.500
 functional 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.750
 to a serious challenge and battle mode 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.640
 it was possible to prepare in advance 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.550
 they potyhi recruit the same whom 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.590
 horrible when the reward is announced 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.290
 participation in them no doubt that 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.720
 she will at least take a look at 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.410
 update 2 and 0 plans will be 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.780
 exist 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.090
 just as a tank cell 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.940
 community and will only perform 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.550
 social roles in the clan will be 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.250
 find a partner in the platoon to help each 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.069
 friend perform combat missions to help 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.530
 tips for beginners and just between themselves 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.170
 communicate breaks between fights 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.540
 as for the purely technical 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.450
 information then clan symbolism will 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.660
 consist of his name landtag and 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.700
 general information about him all this will be 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.910
 appear in the planned profile about 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.180
 which I will tell tomorrow but clan 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.160
 tag 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.160
 and this abbreviated clan name 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.799
 a maximum of five letters will be displayed 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.019
 next to the nickname on the boot screen in 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.870
 any fight therefore belonging 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.690
 tankman clan will be obvious and easy 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.570
 prominent commander when creating a clan 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.180
 must be very attentive to 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.799
 what to change mistakenly entered data 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.950
 it will be very very difficult only through 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.290
 technical support 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.170
 so if you already have in advance 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.920
 assembled composition discuss options 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.930
 tag names and descriptions in advance to 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.959
 everyone agreed with them 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.750
 create a clan can have any tankman 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.050
 which there is a tank at least 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.750
 5 levla is pure creation protection 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.500
 clans twinks in order to score beautiful 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.890
 titles 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.410
 creation cost will be one million 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.690
 silver may be such a situation that 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.620
 the clan will eventually exceed the number 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.139
 fighters 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.710
 50 then optional commander 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.780
 you can create another clan 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.580
 imperative that the 2 clan 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.979
 considered an affiliate 1 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.249
 the main thing is the similarity of the names 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.749
 clan tag and in the description should be 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:00.330
 reference to base 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:02.909
 so as not to drive tankers in 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.090
 delusion and last moment but 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:08.999
 perhaps the most important concerns him 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.969
 how does a new clan commander find himself 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:15.240
 like-minded people and bring them together for 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:18.020
 This forum has a clan section where 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.620
 can and should create a theme dedicated 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.439
 to your clan 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.620
 it is necessary to describe the main objectives 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:28.349
 clan requirements for recruitment it can be 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.270
 as well as personal statistics tanker as 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.509
 personal preferences based on 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.659
 any hobby even in general already themselves 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:39.960
 decide everything theme should create either 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:42.589
 clan commander or his deputy in 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.419
 otherwise , it will be considered 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:47.849
 invalid and can remove it 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.810
 again so as not to introduce tankers to 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.800
 delusion 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.199
 still so important on march that July 31 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.439
 clan section of this kind it is 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.319
 will now be deleted and restored 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:03.839
 only after the update and therefore 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:06.839
 some already big plans gathered 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:09.750
 Temko should create their own community 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:10.770
 anew well, but on this i have so far on 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.830
 today everything 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:18.649
 tomorrow there will be more information so 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.649
 see you soon tankers and say goodbye
