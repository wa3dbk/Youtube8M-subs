 hello to all and thank you for sharing 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.060
 our rendezvous the secret of a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.349
 successful pool the mag that explains you 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.450
 everything you have always wanted 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.960
 know about pools without ever daring 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.570
 ask for it 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.160
 you are the proud owner of a 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.790
 pool you plan to do 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.320
 build a 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.899
 it's up to you 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.210
 is addressing a swimming pool 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.500
 how does it work it's the subject that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.420
 we are going to treat a subject today 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.190
 exciting that will help you I am 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.780
 sure and see more clearly but especially to 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.340
 make the right choices for your pool 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.960
 for many of us the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.500
 functioning of a swimming pool remains a 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.690
 mystery 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.070
 however, it is fundamental to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.360
 understand the basic principles and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.460
 the interaction between these different 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.860
 equipment to understand everything let's follow 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.570
 together the course of the water the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.120
 mouths located on the top of the walls 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.860
 of the pelvis is called the skimmers their 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.480
 role is to recover and decree puts 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.980
 the water on the surface to make it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.600
 flow towards the filters in 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.939
 retaining most of the debris in 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.380
 their basket the bottom bomb recovers 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.240
 the cooler water of the fund for 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.920
 improve brewing this allows 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.749
 to ensure a homogeneous temperature in 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.030
 the basin but also better 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:16.950
 distribute the products of the treatment the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.539
 pump draws water and sends it to the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.079
 filter another key element of 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.819
 Installation 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.399
 its role is to retain impurities 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.869
 to guarantee clean water capital to 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.490
 both for the comfort of swimming 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.460
 and the durability of the installation 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.130
 The couple pump filter should be 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.780
 perfectly matched the flow of the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.759
 pump never to exceed 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.289
 filter capacity that's why it 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.630
 first choose the filter 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.060
 adapted to the volume of the basin and then 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.310
 to size the pump according to 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.189
 your filter at the water filter outlet 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.509
 can be played by various methods 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.779
 electric heater installation 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.759
 solar heat pumps treatment 

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:55.649
 water is the last stage of 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.689
 his trip but it's a milestone 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.240
 to get a perfectly healthy water 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.679
 and permanently balanced a solution 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.950
 to the economy can be disastrous 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.409
 because the balance of the water is fragile one 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.660
 opt for an automated system such a 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.430
 electrolyser able to control its 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.780
 quality including in your absence 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.460
 for an installation to work well 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.560
 the pipes and the diameter 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.630
 adapted to the flow of the pump and the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.420
 wire capacity 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.400
 it's about establishing a fair ratio with 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.080
 the volume of the basin knowing that the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.930
 renewal of the advisor and 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.940
