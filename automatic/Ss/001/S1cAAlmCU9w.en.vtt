00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.000
 yes, it's me who I say in Europe 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.010
 looking that is part two microphones 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.840
 I have a little bit of difficulty 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:25.430
 placed with the system where there are always two 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:32.699
 xlr on the microphone to letters can here 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:35.250
 and I have the impression that only one 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:39.899
 microphone really good or does that come 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.260
 others also he a bit weak that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.710
 what we in the second xlr 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.390
 same make, connection, plug only 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.050
 But that's not all 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.739
 what about the microphone with the ups 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.739
 to do 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.360
 the hip on the blank or dots 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.609
 is in the case I have refunded 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.909
 now close and it comes here 

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:10.289
 so will be three maximum three 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.859
 rashes and I can not 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:16.939
 imagine that the quality is so 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:22.380
 then we take the other micro 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:26.999
 hello everything and now we do 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.069
 I'm even the other one in Cuba 

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:33.359
 how to take pictures in the 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:37.219
 auditorium for the bootcamp at 15 o'clock 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:40.139
 blogger forces is media partner 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.259
 and watch some live broadcast 

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:42.259
 should 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:57.869
 and over to that state microphone and 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.469
 see that the rashes there probably better 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.979
 are 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.920
 I'll put it away now if I am 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:10.619
 then I'm still good at understanding 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.200
 or is it too light? 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.750
 transfer deficit comes in the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.090
 audio quality if you have the now 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.040
 discussion then also higher away if 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.840
 one is not so close and he am 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.310
 mikrofon I'll get close and close 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.830
 say hello hello hello 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:38.420
 so the hour is playing so slowly 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:42.060
 gestures because I am because I am 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.160
 wednesday at a network can be found 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.900
 my sharing is organized by yours 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.299
 go up and that's all about 10 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.190
 to 17 clock and I would probably too 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.980
 some live broadcast 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.860
 is also difficult to change where 16 17 18 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.370
 People in a room are sitting the microphones 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.690
 I do not wear anything 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:09.239
 ties I do not have a microphone 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:12.329
 unquestionably and length of the cable or 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.840
 but not enough in your microphone 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:19.310
 both have to give it too stupid maybe 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.880
 I will then synonymous with the microphone 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.799
 logitech conference camp works like this 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:31.709
 so far a microphone test 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:34.049
 with the solid 366 and I believe it is 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.640
 not so great maybe i have to 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.299
 then it may be a bit on to 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.359
 screws make adjustments 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.329
 So then at the latest on Wednesday 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.769
 So the 11 o'clock broadcast falls out hans 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.200
 think so I'm not left with 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.450
 once this network conference 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.470
 file sharing and we will be direct 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.470
 at 17 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.660
 the trade I will then as 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.790
 Outdoor reporter emerges from the sleeping place 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.160
 report from the network meeting with it 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.209
 to get some more kettles and then 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.290
 if we talk a bit about that 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:13.230
 Results report so you will and 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.470
 at the latest on Wednesday at 17 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.950
 Clock 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.950
 See you
