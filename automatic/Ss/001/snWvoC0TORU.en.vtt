00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:10.290
 hello friends rains land 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.269
 became very soft good and come 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.150
 favorable time to 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.630
 sow new lawn and repair 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.369
 old 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.619
 Now we are in the garden of Nina 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 Viktorovna percent look like she 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.960
 wisely made seeding lawn between 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.820
 fruit trees and beautiful and whether 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.630
 no nina viktorovna 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.679
 trees are not sick if no 3 months was not 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.500
 you see 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.340
 grass plays the role of mulch under the trees in 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.899
 the heat does not allow to dry out and in winter it saves from 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.440
 frost and freezing 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.690
 look here where the land is bare 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.860
 bald spot here cracks and there cracks 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.860
 never is grass 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.540
 Nina Viktorovna what are you working 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.730
 the usual hoe but try 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.210
 flat cutter unfamiliar try 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.360
 more convenient for much more convenient and easier 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.760
 incomparably 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.980
 and now let's see this 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.280
 why the grass is under the trees 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.010
 good green and here bald spots though 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.560
 sowed all the same kind of grass when 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.250
 choose lawn grass necessarily 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.940
 look for some herbs here 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.400
 was seeded 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.020
 one bluegrass meadow bluegrass meadow 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.660
 grows well in the shade 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.910
 and in sunny places it burns out now 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.430
 on a sunny place I advise to sow here 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.720
 such a composition of grass meadow fescue 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 Timothy meadow and ryegrass perennial 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.280
 such a universal mixture can be sown in 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.920
 any part of the garden and in the shade and in the sun behind 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.800
 the ryegrass bill this lawn is not afraid 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.990
 trampling on it you can walk to play 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.759
 children is a universal mixture which 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.700
 sown in any part of the garden 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.840
 and now we start repairing the lawn 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.600
 bald spots we are now 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.110
 loosened with the help of a flat-cut cauldron 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.850
 too sick so both contagious earth 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:10.240
 microbiological preparation baksiz or 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.240
 you can shed the drug east m1 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.520
 start sowing evenly by sowing and 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.120
 thicker 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.690
 so that the birds do not peck the seeds cover 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.670
 their layer of earth is half a centimeter thick 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.690
 or you can rake up grass seeds 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.270
 circular movements Larisa Igorevna 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.220

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.069
 obviously not all grow well everywhere from it at 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.680
 me to 1 already general yellowing of the left side 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.730

 trace elements and torrio comp lawn needles 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.510
 here in chelated form 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.670
 it is easily accessible to plants 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.950
 states how to breed 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.860
 one pack per bag per 10 liters of water 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.150
 that's enough for the whole area 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.750

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.110
 Victorovna 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.230
 I advise you to remove from the tree

 circle the whole grass 1 com distance across 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.870

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.859
 dolomite k so you can take pine and 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:45.180
 Spruce needles impose a cones if 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.180
 in the cover then being beautiful 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.220
 processed by the site and side mix 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.250
