00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Hello dear friends with you Kuzya 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.940
 welcome to my channel and this 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.250
 another issue of mod reviews today 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.349
 I'll show you one mod but what am I 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.820
 I think everyone knows the game portal who does not know 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.590
 The main feature of this game is 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.330
 that you can create certain 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.279
 portals and from one portal 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.380
 teleport to another as well 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.939
 I will move the items now and explain 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.769
 show more, do not forget to immediately 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.470
 rate this video like and 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.119
 let's start right away saying that the link 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.830
 on the mod is in the description when downloading 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.630
 mod will be detailed instructions like it 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.130
 install actually when you enter 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.200
 into the game in order to create the first 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.899
 portal you need a gun that way 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.550
 called a gun. 50 shoot from 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.010
 him to any place and there instantly 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.140
 a big blue ball appears this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.700
 means you created the first portal 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.010
 in order to create a second portal 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.230
 take out a gun heavy gun and also 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.090
 shoot at the place you need and now 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.280
 already from the heavy gun appears 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.440
 a gray ball and from means that the second 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.090
 portal was created and now you can 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.829
 move one ball but the other 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.570
 being done it just needs to come up 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.789
 for example to the blue ball and you 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.309
 move instantly to a gray scarf 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.320
 that's all this whole concept of these 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.820
 portals you can now shoot where 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.470
 please, there is a certain 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.510
 the distance at which the balls will spawn 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.970
 if you shoot very far that ball 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.740
 there will not appear but what fun you can 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.759
 not only themselves this way with ease 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.650
 overcome obstacles 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.299
 and also move with a motorcycle whether you 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.830
 with another vehicle at 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.630
 I am so very interesting 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.520
 the possibility of such a move because you 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.259
 you can be at least at the end of the city 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.689
 but if one portal is somewhere 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.490
 in the center is already forced in front of you 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.170
 can fill in using the desk then 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.700
 a different color portal and thereby 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.020
 move from a far distance 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.340
 straight to the center 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.840
 also for convenience by 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.850
 certain keys you can change 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.680
 default weapon for example gray scarf 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.450
 you can sleep not only with the help of hard 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.159
 gun but if you take for example in 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.360
 hands sniper rifle you click on 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.009
 English letter o 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.509
 and now only with the help of 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.399
 sniper rifle you can 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.659
 I would like to perform a gray ball 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.820
 tell about one interesting and 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.530
 fun feature of this mod you also 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.840
 can perform randomly in front of you 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.610
 people and can send them also through 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.799
 portal and do it with English 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.790
 the letters b and actually what can 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.650
 turn out 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.660
 one portal I zaspavnyu right on high 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.730
 building another on the road and thereby 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.680
 people that I put in front of right in front 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.870
 themselves fall on the blue portal 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.330
 from it is teleported to sulfur and themes 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.860
 most falls by creating with this mod you can 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.080
 have a lot of fun to create 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.910
 all sorts of cool stuff and make up 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.250
 schemes of portals and send through them 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.620
 bots recommend you try this mod 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.330
