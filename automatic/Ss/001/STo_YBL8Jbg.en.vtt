boning<00:00:08.809> so<00:00:09.809> with<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> male<00:00:10.650> Johnston<00:00:11.010> Perfector

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
boning so with a male Johnston Perfector

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.919 
boning so with a male Johnston Perfector
there's<00:00:11.639> three<00:00:11.880> different<00:00:11.969> phenotypes<00:00:12.599> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
there's three different phenotypes the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.950 
there's three different phenotypes the
first<00:00:13.200> phenotype<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.040> hypoplastic<00:00:14.960> it's

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
first phenotype is hypoplastic it's

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.650 
first phenotype is hypoplastic it's
characterized<00:00:16.379> by<00:00:16.619> reduced<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.300> size<00:00:18.300> and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
characterized by reduced to size and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.109 
characterized by reduced to size and
enamel<00:00:18.869> small<00:00:19.320> spaces<00:00:19.800> between<00:00:19.980> teeth<00:00:20.250> as

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
enamel small spaces between teeth as

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.170 
enamel small spaces between teeth as
well<00:00:21.330> as<00:00:21.449> having<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.840> yellowish<00:00:22.230> brown<00:00:22.529> color

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
well as having a yellowish brown color

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.670 
well as having a yellowish brown color
as<00:00:24.180> evidence<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.750> defect<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.230> converting

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
as evidence of a defect of converting

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.990 
as evidence of a defect of converting
organic<00:00:25.830> materials<00:00:26.519> into<00:00:26.760> inorganic

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
organic materials into inorganic

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.150 
organic materials into inorganic
materials<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.590> see<00:00:28.710> almost<00:00:28.859> two

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
materials so you can see almost two

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.870 
materials so you can see almost two
pictures<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.929> hyper<00:00:31.140> mineralized

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
pictures you have hyper mineralized

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.450 
pictures you have hyper mineralized
enamel<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.090> some<00:00:33.780> brown<00:00:33.989> spots<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.890> lost<00:00:35.250> in

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
enamel and some brown spots I'm lost in

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.880 
enamel and some brown spots I'm lost in
a<00:00:35.550> proximal<00:00:35.820> contact<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:37.020> next<00:00:37.260> phenotype<00:00:37.680> is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
a proximal contact the next phenotype is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.950 
a proximal contact the next phenotype is
high<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.250> calcified<00:00:38.700> phenotype<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.780> that's

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
high as a calcified phenotype and that's

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.360 
high as a calcified phenotype and that's
just<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.230> general<00:00:40.410> failure<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.070> mineralization

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
just a general failure of mineralization

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.880 
just a general failure of mineralization
and<00:00:42.300> that's<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.989> most<00:00:43.140> extreme<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.770> this

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
and that's the most extreme in this

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.069 
and that's the most extreme in this
phenotype<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.670> see<00:00:44.910> enamel<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.780> tooth

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
phenotype so you see enamel on the tooth

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410 
phenotype so you see enamel on the tooth
but<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.500> easily<00:00:47.219> wears<00:00:47.579> away<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.090> flakes

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
but it's easily wears away and flakes

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.889 
but it's easily wears away and flakes
away<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.930> time<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> wire<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:51.570> next

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
away with time and wire the next

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.880 
away with time and wire the next
phenotype<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.620> hypo<00:00:52.980> mature<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
phenotype is hypo mature and that is a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.569 
phenotype is hypo mature and that is a
failure<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> enamel<00:00:57.329> matrix<00:00:57.870> proteins<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
failure of the enamel matrix proteins to

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.760 
failure of the enamel matrix proteins to
to<00:00:59.579> promote<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.899> hardening<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> enamel

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
to promote the hardening of the enamel

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.289 
to promote the hardening of the enamel
wire<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.989> two<00:01:03.989> structure<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.710> it's

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
wire so you see a two structure but it's

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.260 
wire so you see a two structure but it's
brown<00:01:06.299> color<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.680> there's<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.979> lack<00:01:08.189> of

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
brown color because there's a lack of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.539 
brown color because there's a lack of
the<00:01:09.270> radiopaque<00:01:09.930> enamel<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.650> you've<00:01:11.280> seen

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the radiopaque enamel and you've seen

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.330 
the radiopaque enamel and you've seen
with<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:12.000> mainly<00:01:12.689> dentin<00:01:13.229> structure<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.280> you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
with just mainly dentin structure so you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.550 
with just mainly dentin structure so you
see<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> general<00:01:15.240> loss<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.659> proximal<00:01:16.140> contacts

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
see a general loss of proximal contacts

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.929 
see a general loss of proximal contacts
and<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> decreased<00:01:17.310> size<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:18.000> crowns<00:01:18.860> our

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939
