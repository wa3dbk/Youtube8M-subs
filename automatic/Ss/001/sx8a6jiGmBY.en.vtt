you guys to wait BOSU ball workout with

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.650 
you guys to wait BOSU ball workout with
a<00:00:22.410> pulley<00:00:22.740> system<00:00:22.859> now<00:00:23.820> you'll<00:00:24.029> also<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.480> able

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
a pulley system now you'll also be able

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.390 
a pulley system now you'll also be able
to<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> resistance<00:00:25.890> band<00:00:25.980> but

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
to do this with a resistance band but

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.980 
to do this with a resistance band but
you<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:26.910> very<00:00:27.119> careful<00:00:27.599> with

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
you just have to be very careful with

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.210 
you just have to be very careful with
how<00:00:28.170> much<00:00:28.230> resistance<00:00:28.650> you're<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.130> be

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
how much resistance you're going to be

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.919 
how much resistance you're going to be
having<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.179> sometimes<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> distance

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
having on that so sometimes the distance

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.260 
having on that so sometimes the distance
can<00:00:31.260> influence<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.669> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
can influence it this is going to be a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.410 
can influence it this is going to be a
very<00:00:33.870> beneficial<00:00:34.280> extra<00:00:35.280> set<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> exercises

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
very beneficial extra set of exercises

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420 
very beneficial extra set of exercises
specifically<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.290> developing<00:00:37.739> center<00:00:38.250> of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
specifically for developing center of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.520 
specifically for developing center of
gravity<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> find<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:39.840> many<00:00:40.050> people<00:00:40.440> is

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
gravity what I find with many people is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.750 
gravity what I find with many people is
that<00:00:40.559> their<00:00:40.770> center<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.040> gravity<00:00:41.129> tends<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that their center of gravity tends to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.280 
that their center of gravity tends to
get<00:00:41.910> thrown<00:00:42.090> off<00:00:42.329> because<00:00:42.960> they<00:00:43.050> tend<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
get thrown off because they tend to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
get thrown off because they tend to
shift<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.160> side<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.489> their<00:00:44.640> body<00:00:44.670> over<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
shift to one side of their body over the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.330 
shift to one side of their body over the
other<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.500> asymmetrical

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
other because they have asymmetrical

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.010 
other because they have asymmetrical
weight<00:00:47.460> shifts<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.000> when<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.629> get<00:00:48.780> them<00:00:48.930> on

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
weight shifts and when you get them on

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.410 
weight shifts and when you get them on
to<00:00:49.200> an<00:00:49.289> unstable<00:00:49.649> surface<00:00:50.090> what<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.270> really

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
to an unstable surface what that really

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.840 
to an unstable surface what that really
does<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.170> forces<00:00:52.739> them<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.160> Center

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
does is it forces them to Center

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.790 
does is it forces them to Center
themselves<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.360> can't<00:00:54.539> lean<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.199> side<00:00:55.440> or

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
themselves you can't lean on one side or

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.970 
themselves you can't lean on one side or
the<00:00:56.640> other<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:57.289> you<00:00:58.289> expect<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.649> balance

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the other if you expect to balance

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.470 
the other if you expect to balance
yourself<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.430> BOSU<00:00:59.789> ball<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> great<00:01:00.329> way<00:01:00.449> for

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
yourself so BOSU ball is a great way for

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.060 
yourself so BOSU ball is a great way for
developing<00:01:01.170> those<00:01:01.260> center<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.680> gravity

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
developing those center of gravity

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.619 
developing those center of gravity
dynamics<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:03.030> I'm<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.359> my<00:01:03.449> good

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
dynamics now I'm going to have my good

friend Lindsey right here demonstrate
these<00:01:05.400> two<00:01:05.580> exercises<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
these two exercises for you so for the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.510 
these two exercises for you so for the
first<00:01:07.710> exercise<00:01:07.979> you're<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> be

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
first exercise you're going to be

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.660 
first exercise you're going to be
grabbing<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.939> bully<00:01:10.189> now<00:01:11.189> mounting

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
grabbing the bully now mounting

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.980 
grabbing the bully now mounting
ourselves<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.390> extremely

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
ourselves is going to be extremely

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.350 
ourselves is going to be extremely
important<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:15.210> going

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
important as we do this and so I'm going

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.899 
important as we do this and so I'm going
to<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.509> her<00:01:15.659> bring<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.470> leg<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.770> I'm<00:01:17.759> going

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
to have her bring one leg on I'm going

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.310 
to have her bring one leg on I'm going
to<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.150> her<00:01:18.330> standing<00:01:18.720> there<00:01:18.780> she's<00:01:19.170> going

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to have her standing there she's going

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
to have her standing there she's going
to<00:01:19.380> keep<00:01:19.500> her<00:01:19.560> right<00:01:19.860> arm<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.400> way<00:01:20.580> back

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
to keep her right arm all the way back

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
to keep her right arm all the way back
as<00:01:21.090> she's<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.570> while<00:01:21.869> she's<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> be

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
as she's there while she's going to be

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.260 
as she's there while she's going to be
centering<00:01:22.680> herself<00:01:23.130> forward<00:01:23.400> she's<00:01:24.000> kind<00:01:24.240> of

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
centering herself forward she's kind of

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.030 
centering herself forward she's kind of
a<00:01:24.390> little<00:01:24.570> further<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.530> BOSU<00:01:25.710> ball

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
a little further on the BOSU ball

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.039 
a little further on the BOSU ball
forward<00:01:26.610> simply<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.360> that's<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
forward simply because that's going to

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.630 
forward simply because that's going to
pull<00:01:28.170> her<00:01:28.290> center<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.619> gravity<00:01:28.680> backwards<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
pull her center of gravity backwards so

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.289 
pull her center of gravity backwards so
that's<00:01:29.790> how<00:01:29.880> we're<00:01:30.000> gonna<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that's how we're gonna have to

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.390 
that's how we're gonna have to
reposition<00:01:30.720> ourselves<00:01:30.960> forward<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.250> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
reposition ourselves forward on to that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.039 
reposition ourselves forward on to that
BOSU<00:01:32.729> ball<00:01:32.909> after<00:01:33.150> she<00:01:33.689> gets<00:01:33.780> into<00:01:33.990> that

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
BOSU ball after she gets into that

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.179 
BOSU ball after she gets into that
position<00:01:34.290> she's<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> reach<00:01:35.009> around

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
position she's going to reach around

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.050 
position she's going to reach around
with<00:01:35.400> her

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
with her

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.969 
with her
and<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:37.320> from<00:01:37.439> there<00:01:37.590> she's<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:37.920> to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and and then from there she's going to

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.460 
and and then from there she's going to
pull<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.250> them<00:01:38.490> under<00:01:38.850> okay<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.229> now<00:01:40.350> we're

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
pull that them under okay so now we're

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.530 
pull that them under okay so now we're
going<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.649> go<00:01:40.799> into<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> one-arm<00:01:41.970> press<00:01:42.299> from

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
going to go into a one-arm press from

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.560 
going to go into a one-arm press from
there<00:01:43.549> now<00:01:44.549> we're<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> look<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.299> here

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
there now we're going to look for here

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.789 
there now we're going to look for here
is<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> spine<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> stay<00:01:46.619> neutral

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
is it the spine is going to stay neutral

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.139 
is it the spine is going to stay neutral
at<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.189> point<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.610> Penn<00:01:47.820> dollars<00:01:48.060> this

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
at this point but you Penn dollars this

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.850 
at this point but you Penn dollars this
way<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:48.630> let's<00:01:48.810> try<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.020> posterior<00:01:49.649> tilt

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
way here let's try going posterior tilt

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.289 
way here let's try going posterior tilt
a<00:01:49.950> little<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.250> there<00:01:50.430> now<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:50.970> want<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.210> make

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
a little bit there now we want to make

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.940 
a little bit there now we want to make
sure<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.659> symptom<00:01:51.990> specific<00:01:52.530> area<00:01:52.830> is

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
sure that symptom specific area is

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.919 
sure that symptom specific area is
completely<00:01:53.490> neutral<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.539> core<00:01:54.780> is

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
completely neutral and that the core is

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.870 
completely neutral and that the core is
really<00:01:55.080> getting<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.560> rotation<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.759> we

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
really getting that rotation now if we

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.460 
really getting that rotation now if we
maintain<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.270> thoracic<00:01:57.780> extension<00:01:57.899> we'll

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
maintain that thoracic extension we'll

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.319 
maintain that thoracic extension we'll
in<00:01:59.250> conjunction<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.789> that<00:02:00.000> neutral<00:02:00.299> spine

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
in conjunction with that neutral spine

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.179 
in conjunction with that neutral spine
at<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.929> lower<00:02:01.110> ends<00:02:01.470> we're<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.039> get<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
at the lower ends we're going to get a

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.279 
at the lower ends we're going to get a
nice<00:02:02.460> rotation<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:03.179> happens<00:02:03.600> right<00:02:03.810> here<00:02:04.110> in

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
nice rotation that happens right here in

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.449 
nice rotation that happens right here in
that<00:02:05.009> key<00:02:05.250> spine<00:02:05.549> region<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:08.130> is<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
that key spine region this is going to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.190 
that key spine region this is going to
promote<00:02:08.729> great<00:02:09.179> activation<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.840> anterior

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
promote great activation of the anterior

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.720 
promote great activation of the anterior
and<00:02:10.500> posterior<00:02:10.679> oblique<00:02:11.250> systems<00:02:11.370> that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
and posterior oblique systems that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.580 
and posterior oblique systems that
should<00:02:11.880> go<00:02:12.030> through<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.299> movement<00:02:12.590> trying

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
should go through this movement trying

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.750 
should go through this movement trying
to<00:02:13.709> live<00:02:13.830> but<00:02:13.920> leveraging<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.340> little<00:02:14.610> more

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
to live but leveraging a little more

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.039 
to live but leveraging a little more
from<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> hips<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.269> come<00:02:15.480> forward<00:02:15.660> good

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
from the hips as you come forward good

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.150 
from the hips as you come forward good
and<00:02:16.200> we're<00:02:16.290> going<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.590> extend<00:02:16.799> straight

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and we're going to just extend straight

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.550 
and we're going to just extend straight
forward<00:02:17.580> be<00:02:18.180> sure<00:02:18.360> not<00:02:18.510> not<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.930> aim<00:02:19.080> across

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
forward be sure not not to aim across

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.020 
forward be sure not not to aim across
because<00:02:19.950> oftentimes<00:02:20.220> if<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.549> aim<00:02:20.670> across

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
because oftentimes if you aim across

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.940 
because oftentimes if you aim across
this<00:02:21.299> way<00:02:21.480> what<00:02:22.260> I'll<00:02:22.349> actually<00:02:22.530> do<00:02:22.739> is<00:02:22.830> just

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
this way what I'll actually do is just

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.130 
this way what I'll actually do is just
promote<00:02:23.220> more<00:02:23.849> shoulder<00:02:24.180> activation<00:02:24.930> going

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
promote more shoulder activation going

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.440 
promote more shoulder activation going
this<00:02:25.319> way<00:02:25.500> we'd<00:02:25.709> rather<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.280> go<00:02:26.519> get<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.299> load

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
this way we'd rather it go get the load

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.120 
this way we'd rather it go get the load
completely<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> obliques<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> core

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
completely on the obliques and the core

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.620 
completely on the obliques and the core
as<00:02:29.250> we're<00:02:29.400> going<00:02:29.519> back<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.910> forth<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.510> we'll

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
as we're going back and forth so we'll

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.130 
as we're going back and forth so we'll
come<00:02:30.780> back<00:02:30.920> bingo<00:02:31.950> spine<00:02:32.819> neutral<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.690> we

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
come back bingo spine neutral and we

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.270 
come back bingo spine neutral and we
want<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.410> have<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.560> slight<00:02:34.830> bit<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.160> hip

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
want to have a slight bit of hip

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.979 
want to have a slight bit of hip
movement<00:02:35.310> but<00:02:35.849> primarily<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.480> want<00:02:36.660> most<00:02:36.840> of

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
movement but primarily we want most of

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.710 
movement but primarily we want most of
the<00:02:37.049> movement<00:02:37.349> coming<00:02:37.500> from<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.769> core

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
the movement coming from the core

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.849 
the movement coming from the core
okay<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:39.780> let's<00:02:40.049> bring<00:02:40.200> them<00:02:40.290> closer<00:02:40.620> together

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
okay so let's bring them closer together

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.229 
okay so let's bring them closer together
here<00:02:41.220> now<00:02:41.489> we're<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.790> bring<00:02:41.940> them<00:02:42.090> up

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
here now we're going to bring them up

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.699 
here now we're going to bring them up
and<00:02:42.390> over<00:02:42.510> she's<00:02:43.170> keeping<00:02:43.470> her<00:02:43.560> weight

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
and over she's keeping her weight

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.500 
and over she's keeping her weight
forward<00:02:44.160> she<00:02:44.549> switched<00:02:44.790> hands<00:02:45.060> there<00:02:45.299> now

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
forward she switched hands there now

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.280 
forward she switched hands there now
we're<00:02:45.660> going<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.840> go<00:02:45.930> with<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.140> left<00:02:46.320> arm<00:02:48.290> in

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
we're going to go with the left arm in

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.720 
we're going to go with the left arm in
and<00:02:49.440> from<00:02:49.560> us<00:02:49.680> if<00:02:49.829> we<00:02:49.950> look<00:02:50.130> over<00:02:50.310> from<00:02:50.579> this

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
and from us if we look over from this

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.059 
and from us if we look over from this
side<00:02:50.970> we<00:02:51.780> want<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.019> ensure<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.680> spine<00:02:52.920> is

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
side we want to ensure that the spine is

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.180 
side we want to ensure that the spine is
completely<00:02:53.190> neutral<00:02:53.959> as<00:02:54.959> she's<00:02:55.920> doing<00:02:56.130> a

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
completely neutral as she's doing a

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.960 
completely neutral as she's doing a
really<00:02:56.370> good<00:02:56.549> job

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
really good job

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.250 
really good job
you'll<00:02:57.180> also<00:02:57.329> notice<00:02:57.569> she's<00:02:57.720> kind<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:57.959> leaning

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
you'll also notice she's kind of leaning

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.900 
you'll also notice she's kind of leaning
her<00:02:58.350> weight<00:02:58.560> forward<00:02:59.100> as<00:02:59.250> she's<00:02:59.700> in<00:02:59.819> that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
her weight forward as she's in that

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.550 
her weight forward as she's in that
position<00:03:02.239> do<00:03:03.239> realize<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.380> a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
position do realize that this is a

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.319 
position do realize that this is a
progression<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.400> significant<00:03:05.970> progression

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
progression a significant progression

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.030 
progression a significant progression
let's<00:03:06.480> draw<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:06.660> navel<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.109> this<00:03:07.889> is<00:03:08.010> a

let's draw that navel in this is a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.740 
let's draw that navel in this is a

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
significant progression that we kind of

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.690 
significant progression that we kind of
already<00:03:09.870> took<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.530> protocols<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.069> focus<00:03:11.609> on

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
already took the protocols to focus on

are intrinsic or muscular systems and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.809 
are intrinsic or muscular systems and
since<00:03:14.010> we've<00:03:14.130> already<00:03:14.250> focused<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.730> those

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
since we've already focused on those

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.610 
since we've already focused on those
basic<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.359> eight<00:03:15.450> principles<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.319> is<00:03:16.500> going

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
basic and eight principles this is going

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.979 
basic and eight principles this is going
to<00:03:16.680> be<00:03:16.769> much<00:03:16.980> easier<00:03:17.370> for<00:03:17.549> her<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.989> maneuver

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
to be much easier for her to maneuver

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.990 
to be much easier for her to maneuver
because<00:03:19.650> she<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:19.950> an<00:03:20.100> active<00:03:20.519> in<00:03:20.639> compensation

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
because she is an active in compensation

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.460 
because she is an active in compensation
because<00:03:21.450> we've<00:03:21.690> addressed<00:03:21.930> most<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.350> those

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
because we've addressed most of those

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.569 
because we've addressed most of those
things<00:03:22.680> as<00:03:22.799> you'll<00:03:22.920> notice<00:03:23.100> she<00:03:23.220> has<00:03:23.400> pretty

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
things as you'll notice she has pretty

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.400 
things as you'll notice she has pretty
good<00:03:23.730> posture<00:03:24.239> her<00:03:24.600> alignment<00:03:25.049> seems<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.290> be

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
good posture her alignment seems to be

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.259 
good posture her alignment seems to be
intact<00:03:25.680> she's<00:03:26.130> not<00:03:26.280> struggling<00:03:26.609> here<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.120> her

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
intact she's not struggling here so her

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.599 
intact she's not struggling here so her
nervous<00:03:27.989> system<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.380> very<00:03:28.650> very<00:03:28.769> adapted<00:03:29.489> to

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
nervous system is very very adapted to

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.099 
nervous system is very very adapted to
this<00:03:29.730> environment<00:03:29.790> okay<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.660> now<00:03:30.870> we're<00:03:30.989> going

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
this environment okay so now we're going

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.289 
this environment okay so now we're going
to<00:03:31.170> bring<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.410> back<00:03:31.530> we're<00:03:32.010> going<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.269> let<00:03:33.269> that

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
to bring it back we're going to let that

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.180 
to bring it back we're going to let that
go<00:03:33.600> with<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.810> left<00:03:34.019> arm<00:03:34.139> now<00:03:34.440> we're<00:03:34.980> going<00:03:35.100> to

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
go with the left arm now we're going to

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.660 
go with the left arm now we're going to
be<00:03:35.340> stepping<00:03:35.609> off<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:37.380> as<00:03:37.769> you'll<00:03:37.920> see<00:03:37.950> she

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
be stepping off and as you'll see she

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.220 
be stepping off and as you'll see she
came<00:03:38.819> off<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.269> quite<00:03:39.510> easily<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.109> what

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
came off of that quite easily so what

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.300 
came off of that quite easily so what
you'll<00:03:40.350> want<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.560> do<00:03:40.709> is<00:03:40.829> if<00:03:40.950> you're<00:03:41.100> holding

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
you'll want to do is if you're holding

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.640 
you'll want to do is if you're holding
with<00:03:41.459> your<00:03:41.579> left<00:03:41.730> arm<00:03:41.910> you're<00:03:42.299> going<00:03:42.389> to

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
with your left arm you're going to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.990 
with your left arm you're going to
your<00:03:42.860> weight<00:03:42.980> onto<00:03:43.189> your<00:03:43.400> right<00:03:43.519> foot<00:03:43.579> then

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
your weight onto your right foot then

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.550 
your weight onto your right foot then
you'll<00:03:44.090> be<00:03:44.180> stepping<00:03:44.420> off<00:03:44.720> with<00:03:45.230> your<00:03:45.379> left

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
you'll be stepping off with your left

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.780 
you'll be stepping off with your left
foot<00:03:45.620> coming<00:03:45.890> off<00:03:46.069> of<00:03:46.099> there<00:03:46.340> now<00:03:46.579> we're<00:03:46.700> going

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
foot coming off of there now we're going

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.699 
foot coming off of there now we're going
to<00:03:46.849> go<00:03:47.000> into<00:03:47.180> another<00:03:47.360> advanced<00:03:48.260> progression

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
to go into another advanced progression

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.309 
to go into another advanced progression
going<00:03:48.860> into<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.250> pendulum<00:03:49.760> squat<00:03:50.150> row<00:03:50.420> so<00:03:51.110> now

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
going into a pendulum squat row so now

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.039 
going into a pendulum squat row so now
we<00:03:51.739> have<00:03:52.040> you're<00:03:52.480> facing<00:03:53.480> towards<00:03:53.870> the

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
we have you're facing towards the

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.050 
we have you're facing towards the
towards<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:54.980> cable<00:03:55.340> machine<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.790> now<00:03:55.939> it's

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
towards the cable machine and now it's

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.020 
towards the cable machine and now it's
going<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.269> be<00:03:56.360> stepping<00:03:56.599> on<00:03:57.579> so<00:03:58.579> you<00:03:58.640> can<00:03:58.879> step

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
going to be stepping on so you can step

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.339 
going to be stepping on so you can step
it<00:03:59.150> on<00:03:59.239> with<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.420> right<00:03:59.569> foot<00:03:59.780> first<00:04:00.019> then

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
it on with the right foot first then

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.259 
it on with the right foot first then
your<00:04:01.069> left<00:04:01.250> leg<00:04:01.459> she's<00:04:01.700> going<00:04:01.849> to<00:04:01.909> be<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.030> little

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
your left leg she's going to be a little

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.270 
your left leg she's going to be a little
bit<00:04:02.480> behind<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:03.290> BOSU<00:04:03.620> ball<00:04:03.799> we<00:04:03.920> don't<00:04:04.129> want

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
bit behind the BOSU ball we don't want

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.890 
bit behind the BOSU ball we don't want
to<00:04:04.340> be<00:04:04.459> directly<00:04:05.090> on<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.299> center<00:04:05.599> simply

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
to be directly on the center simply

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.240 
to be directly on the center simply
because<00:04:06.200> that's<00:04:06.560> going<00:04:06.739> to<00:04:06.799> end<00:04:06.950> up<00:04:07.069> pulling

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
because that's going to end up pulling

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.819 
because that's going to end up pulling
her<00:04:07.579> off<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:08.870> she's<00:04:09.049> going<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.230> be<00:04:09.349> slightly

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
her off so she's going to be slightly

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.949 
her off so she's going to be slightly
behind<00:04:09.980> there<00:04:10.569> now<00:04:11.569> we're<00:04:11.659> going<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.810> be

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
behind there now we're going to be

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.410 
behind there now we're going to be
holding<00:04:12.290> this<00:04:12.379> onto<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.859> arm<00:04:13.299> from<00:04:14.299> there

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
holding this onto the arm from there

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.910 
holding this onto the arm from there
she's<00:04:14.540> going<00:04:14.659> to<00:04:14.750> go<00:04:14.840> into<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:15.079> pendulum<00:04:15.470> squat

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
she's going to go into a pendulum squat

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.500 
she's going to go into a pendulum squat
rows<00:04:16.190> your<00:04:16.699> load<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:16.880> right<00:04:17.000> here<00:04:17.150> she<00:04:17.299> has<00:04:17.419> her

actually holding a very neutral spine at

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.090 
actually holding a very neutral spine at
all<00:04:23.510> throughout<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.199> exercise<00:04:24.470> okay<00:04:25.039> so

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
all throughout the exercise okay so

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.200 
all throughout the exercise okay so
let's<00:04:25.340> go<00:04:25.430> back<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.789> forth<00:04:25.940> into<00:04:26.120> the

let's go back and forth into the
pendulum<00:04:26.570> squat<00:04:26.840> row<00:04:27.789> good<00:04:28.789> and<00:04:29.150> we're<00:04:29.600> going

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
pendulum squat row good and we're going

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.000 
pendulum squat row good and we're going
to<00:04:29.780> be<00:04:29.870> looking<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.260> she's<00:04:30.380> not<00:04:30.530> leaning<00:04:30.979> too

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
to be looking that she's not leaning too

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.310 
to be looking that she's not leaning too
far<00:04:31.160> forward<00:04:31.400> again<00:04:32.240> notice<00:04:32.810> those<00:04:32.930> good

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
far forward again notice those good

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.080 
far forward again notice those good
spinal<00:04:33.650> dynamics<00:04:34.250> a<00:04:34.370> little<00:04:34.669> too<00:04:34.789> much<00:04:34.910> of<00:04:34.940> a

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
spinal dynamics a little too much of a

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.460 
spinal dynamics a little too much of a
sway<00:04:35.300> going<00:04:35.599> on<00:04:35.750> there<00:04:35.930> there<00:04:36.169> it<00:04:36.260> is<00:04:36.349> just

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
sway going on there there it is just

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.710 
sway going on there there it is just
focus<00:04:36.800> on<00:04:36.919> that<00:04:36.949> cord<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.550> give<00:04:38.419> me<00:04:38.510> a<00:04:38.539> little

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
focus on that cord and give me a little

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.779 
focus on that cord and give me a little
more<00:04:38.900> back<00:04:39.110> swing<00:04:39.410> on<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:40.010> pendulum<00:04:40.280> it's<00:04:40.729> a

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
more back swing on the pendulum it's a

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.070 
more back swing on the pendulum it's a
little<00:04:41.000> more<00:04:41.090> swing<00:04:41.330> coming<00:04:41.599> backwards<00:04:41.750> over

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
little more swing coming backwards over

here<00:04:42.289> there<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:42.919> is<00:04:42.979> so<00:04:43.070> that<00:04:43.190> way<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.370> can

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
here there it is so that way you can

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.830 
here there it is so that way you can
kind<00:04:43.669> of<00:04:43.729> carry<00:04:43.880> off<00:04:44.090> with<00:04:44.240> some<00:04:44.389> momentum

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
kind of carry off with some momentum

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.469 
kind of carry off with some momentum
there<00:04:45.530> you<00:04:45.710> go<00:04:45.830> right<00:04:46.009> there

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
there you go right there

the key point is focusing focusing on

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:53.950 
the key point is focusing focusing on
that<00:04:52.789> center<00:04:53.090> of<00:04:53.120> gravity<00:04:53.539> so<00:04:53.570> you'll<00:04:53.810> notice

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
that center of gravity so you'll notice

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.570 
that center of gravity so you'll notice
that<00:04:54.110> her<00:04:54.440> Center<00:04:54.740> isn't<00:04:54.889> kind<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:55.190> rocking

is that we follow the swing we follow
the<00:05:18.919> swing<00:05:19.130> of<00:05:19.220> the<00:05:19.340> movement<00:05:19.789> so<00:05:20.150> she's<00:05:20.360> not

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
the swing of the movement so she's not

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.820 
the swing of the movement so she's not
really<00:05:20.659> trying<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:20.990> row<00:05:21.169> so<00:05:21.380> much<00:05:21.530> with<00:05:21.650> your

good bingo excellent so now's not so
much<00:05:30.530> to<00:05:30.680> row<00:05:30.889> happening<00:05:31.580> on<00:05:31.669> the<00:05:31.759> right<00:05:31.879> side

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
much to row happening on the right side

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.330 
much to row happening on the right side
that's<00:05:32.629> helping<00:05:33.080> us<00:05:33.229> with<00:05:33.409> this<00:05:33.590> it's<00:05:34.039> more

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
that's helping us with this it's more

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.219 
that's helping us with this it's more
the<00:05:34.789> scapular<00:05:35.300> function<00:05:35.659> bringing<00:05:35.930> us<00:05:36.020> back

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
the scapular function bringing us back

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.540 
the scapular function bringing us back
and<00:05:36.590> that's<00:05:36.889> going<00:05:37.009> to<00:05:37.099> give<00:05:37.190> us<00:05:37.310> a<00:05:37.400> better

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
and that's going to give us a better

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.129 
and that's going to give us a better
recruitment<00:05:37.940> of<00:05:38.120> the<00:05:38.240> posterior<00:05:38.659> oblique

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
recruitment of the posterior oblique

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.860 
recruitment of the posterior oblique
system<00:05:39.530> while<00:05:40.099> we're<00:05:40.280> doing<00:05:40.370> this

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
system while we're doing this

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.820 
system while we're doing this
so<00:05:41.870> about<00:05:42.110> another<00:05:42.319> two<00:05:44.199> all<00:05:45.199> right<00:05:45.259> good

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
so about another two all right good

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.290 
so about another two all right good
so<00:05:46.250> now<00:05:46.340> we're<00:05:46.460> going<00:05:46.550> to<00:05:46.610> release<00:05:46.849> that<00:05:46.909> back

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
so now we're going to release that back

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.580 
so now we're going to release that back
and<00:05:47.509> then<00:05:47.569> we're<00:05:47.720> going<00:05:47.810> to<00:05:47.870> be<00:05:48.050> stepping<00:05:48.349> off

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
and then we're going to be stepping off

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.439 
and then we're going to be stepping off
towards<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:48.919> direction<00:05:49.069> of<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:49.909> weight<00:05:50.180> so

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
towards the direction of the weight so

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:51.520 
towards the direction of the weight so
actually<00:05:50.750> we're<00:05:50.900> going<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.050> come<00:05:51.199> back<00:05:51.319> this

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
actually we're going to come back this

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.140 
actually we're going to come back this
way<00:05:51.740> and<00:05:51.979> then<00:05:52.639> from<00:05:52.759> there<00:05:52.879> we'll<00:05:53.000> step

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
way and then from there we'll step

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.330 
way and then from there we'll step
across<00:05:53.419> with<00:05:54.229> the<00:05:54.349> other<00:05:54.470> foot<00:05:54.710> and<00:05:54.949> that<00:05:55.129> that

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
across with the other foot and that that

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.680 
across with the other foot and that that
one<00:05:55.520> we<00:05:55.639> get<00:05:55.789> off<00:05:55.879> of<00:05:55.909> the<00:05:56.060> BOSU<00:05:56.330> ball<00:05:56.509> very

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
one we get off of the BOSU ball very

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.260 
one we get off of the BOSU ball very
easily<00:05:56.870> I<00:05:57.199> let's<00:05:57.530> bring<00:05:57.650> that<00:05:57.800> thing<00:05:57.949> back<00:05:58.270> so

you to develop horizontal plane dynamics
in<00:06:04.639> terms<00:06:04.969> of<00:06:05.090> your<00:06:05.210> movement<00:06:05.629> how<00:06:05.750> much<00:06:06.110> of

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
in terms of your movement how much of

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.110 
in terms of your movement how much of
the<00:06:06.349> movements<00:06:06.680> that<00:06:06.770> I've<00:06:06.860> seen<00:06:07.120> tradition

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
the movements that I've seen tradition

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.550 
the movements that I've seen tradition
traditional<00:06:08.599> types<00:06:08.870> of<00:06:09.020> lifting<00:06:09.349> is<00:06:09.440> that

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
traditional types of lifting is that

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.719 
traditional types of lifting is that
when<00:06:09.680> people<00:06:09.710> try<00:06:10.159> and<00:06:10.190> live<00:06:10.490> something

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
when people try and live something

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:11.920 
when people try and live something
they'll<00:06:11.150> usually<00:06:11.419> try<00:06:11.569> lifting<00:06:11.780> it

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
they'll usually try lifting it

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.930 
they'll usually try lifting it
vertically<00:06:12.530> when<00:06:13.009> most<00:06:13.250> of<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.460> movements

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
vertically when most of the movements

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.219 
vertically when most of the movements
that<00:06:14.030> happen<00:06:14.300> right<00:06:14.449> in<00:06:14.569> reality<00:06:15.110> are

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
that happen right in reality are

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.709 
that happen right in reality are
actually<00:06:15.650> horizontal<00:06:16.490> and<00:06:16.699> more<00:06:17.000> than<00:06:17.180> beyond

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
actually horizontal and more than beyond

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.749 
actually horizontal and more than beyond
that<00:06:17.900> it's<00:06:18.050> in<00:06:18.110> a<00:06:18.139> be<00:06:18.289> transverse<00:06:18.710> so<00:06:19.460> if<00:06:19.580> we're

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 
that it's in a be transverse so if we're

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.219 
that it's in a be transverse so if we're
training<00:06:20.120> here<00:06:20.240> on<00:06:20.330> an<00:06:20.449> unstable<00:06:20.780> surface

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
training here on an unstable surface

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:23.559 
training here on an unstable surface
she's<00:06:22.190> going<00:06:22.310> to<00:06:22.370> have<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:22.520> force<00:06:22.849> herself<00:06:23.060> to

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:23.569 
she's going to have to force herself to

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:25.209 
she's going to have to force herself to
go<00:06:23.840> into<00:06:24.020> a<00:06:24.050> centered<00:06:24.379> position<00:06:24.500> and<00:06:25.099> we're

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:25.219 
go into a centered position and we're

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:26.589 
go into a centered position and we're
going<00:06:25.340> to<00:06:25.370> do<00:06:25.550> these<00:06:25.699> things<00:06:25.879> correctly<00:06:26.360> so

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
going to do these things correctly so

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:28.270 
going to do these things correctly so
it's<00:06:26.719> going<00:06:26.810> to<00:06:26.900> have<00:06:27.020> direct<00:06:27.650> applications

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
it's going to have direct applications

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.520 
it's going to have direct applications
that<00:06:28.370> will<00:06:28.490> go<00:06:28.639> specifically<00:06:29.539> into<00:06:29.629> reality<00:06:30.349> I

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
that will go specifically into reality I

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.219 
that will go specifically into reality I
