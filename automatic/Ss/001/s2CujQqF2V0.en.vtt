allow me to introduce the snowflake my
painting<00:00:07.980> machine<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.460> named<00:00:09.030> after<00:00:09.240> both

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
painting machine it is named after both

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.140 
painting machine it is named after both
it's<00:00:09.870> hexagonal<00:00:10.230> design<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.160> its<00:00:11.639> uniqueness

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
it's hexagonal design and its uniqueness

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.060 
it's hexagonal design and its uniqueness
and<00:00:12.509> its<00:00:12.840> design<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.259> informed<00:00:13.650> by<00:00:13.710> exactly

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
and its design is informed by exactly

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.200 
and its design is informed by exactly
what<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.280> learned<00:00:14.549> out<00:00:14.700> here<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> bomb

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
what I learned out here on the bomb

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.420 
what I learned out here on the bomb
range<00:00:15.450> earlier<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.080> week<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
range earlier this week and this is the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.279 
range earlier this week and this is the
result<00:00:17.789> some<00:00:18.539> might<00:00:18.720> feel<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.170> have

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
result some might feel like I have

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.429 
result some might feel like I have
broken<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.740> rules<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.279> design

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
broken the rules with this design

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.800

clearly Adams up to something right

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.560 
clearly Adams up to something right
and<00:00:25.380> as<00:00:25.680> he<00:00:25.830> welds<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> final<00:00:26.910> touches<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.330> the

Jamie's<00:00:29.220> confused<00:00:29.730> I'm<00:00:30.539> guessing<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> paint

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
Jamie's confused I'm guessing the paint

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.470 
Jamie's confused I'm guessing the paint
goes<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.859> middle<00:00:32.009> yep<00:00:32.669> right<00:00:33.180> along<00:00:33.390> with

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
goes in the middle yep right along with

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.170 
goes in the middle yep right along with
the<00:00:33.600> explosives<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.640> these<00:00:35.640> things<00:00:35.880> are<00:00:36.030> in

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the explosives so these things are in

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.160 
the explosives so these things are in
the<00:00:36.270> way<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:36.840> supposed<00:00:37.110> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the way what are they supposed to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.930

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
disperse the paint or something nope

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.729 
disperse the paint or something nope
these<00:00:39.270> panels<00:00:39.719> are<00:00:39.840> exactly<00:00:40.290> where<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.530> want

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
these panels are exactly where I want

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
paintings with explosives yeah I thought

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.450 
paintings with explosives yeah I thought
I'm<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.649> that's<00:00:52.860> supposed<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.190> cheat

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.700 
yeah I thought I'd steal your Thunder
this<00:00:54.870> time<00:00:56.420> usually<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> underhanded

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this time usually it's the underhanded

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.140 
this time usually it's the underhanded
vitamin<00:00:59.250> who<00:00:59.430> decides<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.059> bend<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> rules

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.520 

and<00:01:04.150> stack<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.870> odds<00:01:05.020> in<00:01:05.320> his<00:01:05.379> favor<00:01:07.530> but

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
and stack the odds in his favor but

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.000 
and stack the odds in his favor but
after<00:01:08.860> 10<00:01:09.190> years<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.910> you<00:01:10.630> clearly<00:01:11.230> all<00:01:11.590> that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
after 10 years and you clearly all that

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.010 
after 10 years and you clearly all that
devious<00:01:12.700> designing<00:01:13.330> has<00:01:13.810> rubbed<00:01:14.230> off<00:01:14.410> on<00:01:14.650> Adam

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.570 

well<00:01:20.020> it<00:01:20.560> all<00:01:20.770> started<00:01:21.130> when<00:01:21.190> I<00:01:21.250> was<00:01:21.400> out<00:01:21.550> here

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
well it all started when I was out here

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.219 
well it all started when I was out here
at<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:21.850> bomb<00:01:22.030> range<00:01:22.060> doing<00:01:22.810> my<00:01:22.960> preliminary

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
at the bomb range doing my preliminary

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.840 
at the bomb range doing my preliminary
test<00:01:23.800> with<00:01:23.950> painting<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.250> explosives<00:01:24.760> I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
test with painting and explosives I

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.180 
test with painting and explosives I
really<00:01:25.840> really<00:01:26.110> liked<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.500> patterns<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.100> I

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
really really liked the patterns that I

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.190 
really really liked the patterns that I
was<00:01:27.400> getting<00:01:27.700> on<00:01:28.060> my<00:01:28.270> target<00:01:28.600> board<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.140> I

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
was getting on my target board and I

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.190 
was getting on my target board and I
thought<00:01:29.380> what<00:01:30.130> if<00:01:30.340> we<00:01:30.370> made<00:01:30.910> art<00:01:31.300> I'm<00:01:31.870> still

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
thought what if we made art I'm still

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.920 
thought what if we made art I'm still
technically<00:01:32.740> painting<00:01:33.490> with<00:01:33.790> explosives<00:01:34.030> I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
technically painting with explosives I

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.140 
technically painting with explosives I
just<00:01:35.740> figured<00:01:36.040> Jane<00:01:36.340> was<00:01:36.550> gonna<00:01:36.700> go<00:01:36.850> whole<00:01:37.119> hog

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
just figured Jane was gonna go whole hog

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.880 
just figured Jane was gonna go whole hog
on<00:01:37.600> getting<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:37.960> room<00:01:38.200> covered<00:01:38.410> with<00:01:38.680> paint

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
on getting that room covered with paint

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.560 
on getting that room covered with paint
and<00:01:38.979> I<00:01:39.160> could<00:01:39.340> kind<00:01:39.550> of<00:01:39.580> do<00:01:39.729> my<00:01:39.910> own<00:01:39.940> thing<00:01:40.390> and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
and I could kind of do my own thing and

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.859 
and I could kind of do my own thing and
that's<00:01:41.080> what<00:01:41.290> I<00:01:41.350> did<00:01:41.940> now<00:01:42.940> it's<00:01:43.270> time<00:01:43.540> for<00:01:43.570> the

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
that's what I did now it's time for the

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.320 
that's what I did now it's time for the
snowflake<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.500> make<00:01:44.800> its<00:01:45.009> kinetic<00:01:45.580> art<00:01:45.820> debut
