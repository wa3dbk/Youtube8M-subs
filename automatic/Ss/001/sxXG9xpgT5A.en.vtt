00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.309 

okay<00:00:02.820> so<00:00:02.879> now<00:00:03.149> I'm<00:00:03.270> going<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.600> discuss<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.290> few

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
okay so now I'm going to discuss a few

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.889 
okay so now I'm going to discuss a few
of<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.979> particle<00:00:05.760> interactions<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.599> I<00:00:06.660> have

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
of the particle interactions that I have

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.810 
of the particle interactions that I have
some<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.800> the<00:00:07.859> particles<00:00:08.309> they<00:00:08.400> didn't<00:00:08.670> show

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
some of the particles they didn't show

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.810 
some of the particles they didn't show
you<00:00:08.880> last<00:00:09.120> time<00:00:09.390> so<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.860> here<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> plant

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
you last time so this here is a plant

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.810 
you last time so this here is a plant
particle<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.200> mobile<00:00:13.590> acts<00:00:14.130> like<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> wall

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
particle it's in mobile acts like a wall

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.180 
particle it's in mobile acts like a wall
but<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.599> grows<00:00:15.870> when<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.740> comes<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.160> contact

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
but it grows when it comes in contact

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.170 
but it grows when it comes in contact
with<00:00:17.820> water<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.810> drop<00:00:19.080> some<00:00:19.289> water<00:00:19.530> on<00:00:19.680> it

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
with water if I drop some water on it

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.490 
with water if I drop some water on it
you<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.330> see<00:00:21.570> there<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.780> the<00:00:22.020> water<00:00:22.230> turned

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
you can see there that the water turned

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.820 
you can see there that the water turned
into<00:00:22.980> plant<00:00:23.690> next<00:00:24.690> I'm<00:00:24.810> going<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.170> draw<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
into plant next I'm going to draw a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.620 
into plant next I'm going to draw a
stout<00:00:26.250> particle<00:00:26.850> which<00:00:27.029> basically<00:00:27.480> just

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
stout particle which basically just

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.999 
stout particle which basically just
emits<00:00:28.170> water<00:00:29.960> as<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.410> see<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.770> plant

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
emits water as you can see the plant

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.040 
emits water as you can see the plant
will<00:00:32.219> grow<00:00:32.250> into<00:00:32.819> the<00:00:32.940> water<00:00:33.179> as<00:00:33.479> it<00:00:33.659> falls<00:00:33.839> on

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
will grow into the water as it falls on

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.869 
will grow into the water as it falls on
top<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.620> forming<00:00:35.039> some<00:00:35.249> interesting

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
top of it forming some interesting

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.729 
top of it forming some interesting
growth<00:00:36.089> patterns<00:00:37.429> and<00:00:38.429> if<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.389> just<00:00:39.739> extend

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
growth patterns and if I just extend

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.709 
growth patterns and if I just extend
this<00:00:40.859> plant<00:00:41.190> into<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.699> pool<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.089> water<00:00:42.300> here

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
this plant into this pool of water here

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.660 
this plant into this pool of water here
you'll<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.589> basically<00:00:43.710> takes<00:00:44.249> over

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
you'll see that it basically takes over

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.259 
you'll see that it basically takes over
pretty<00:00:45.510> quickly<00:00:46.399> same<00:00:47.399> things<00:00:47.670> happening<00:00:47.760> up

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
pretty quickly same things happening up

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.090 
pretty quickly same things happening up
here<00:00:48.299> it's<00:00:48.870> growing<00:00:49.289> around<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.769> spout<00:00:50.069> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
here it's growing around the spout and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.139 
here it's growing around the spout and
basically<00:00:50.760> preventing<00:00:51.420> further<00:00:51.600> water<00:00:52.019> from

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
basically preventing further water from

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.340 
basically preventing further water from
being<00:00:54.149> emitted<00:00:55.370> now<00:00:56.370> over<00:00:56.909> here<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.179> have<00:00:57.350> pool

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
being emitted now over here I have pool

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.199 
being emitted now over here I have pool
of<00:00:58.499> oil<00:00:58.679> you<00:00:59.069> notice<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.789> turned<00:01:00.030> off<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:00.209 
of oil you notice I turned off the

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:03.139 
of oil you notice I turned off the
faucets<00:01:00.749> at<00:01:00.869> the<00:01:00.989> top<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.379> I'll<00:01:01.440> turn<00:01:01.679> back<00:01:02.149> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
faucets at the top so I'll turn back the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.430 
faucets at the top so I'll turn back the
oil<00:01:03.329> faucet<00:01:04.100> oil<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.430> flammable<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.960> can

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
oil faucet oil is flammable so I can

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.820 
oil faucet oil is flammable so I can
draw<00:01:07.770> fire<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.960> if<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> fire<00:01:10.320> comes<00:01:10.680> in

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
draw fire and if the fire comes in

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.190 
draw fire and if the fire comes in
contact<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.550> oil<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.450> oil<00:01:12.480> will<00:01:12.990> light

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
contact with the oil the oil will light

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
contact with the oil the oil will light
on<00:01:13.350> fire<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:14.510> can<00:01:15.510> also<00:01:15.660> draw<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> torch<00:01:16.800> which<00:01:17.070> is

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
on fire I can also draw a torch which is

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.050 
on fire I can also draw a torch which is
basically<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.760> permanent<00:01:18.630> emitter<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.680> fire<00:01:20.070> so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
basically a permanent emitter of fire so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.210 
basically a permanent emitter of fire so
now<00:01:21.210> every<00:01:21.510> time<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.930> oil<00:01:22.380> falls<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.980> fills

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
now every time that oil falls and fills

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.420 
now every time that oil falls and fills
up<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.670> bin<00:01:24.630> over<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.410> it<00:01:25.800> will<00:01:25.920> get<00:01:26.070> lit<00:01:26.310> on

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
up the bin over here it will get lit on

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.150 
up the bin over here it will get lit on
fire<00:01:27.410> and<00:01:28.410> next<00:01:28.980> I'm<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:31.100> discuss<00:01:32.100> this

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
fire and next I'm going to discuss this

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.120 
fire and next I'm going to discuss this
wax<00:01:32.670> over<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.420> wax<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.200> also<00:01:34.530> flammable

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
wax over here wax is also flammable

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.570 
wax over here wax is also flammable
accept<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:37.770> lights<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> much<00:01:38.550> slower

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
accept it it lights at a much slower

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.470 
accept it it lights at a much slower
rate<00:01:39.330> than<00:01:39.900> oil<00:01:43.010> so<00:01:44.010> if<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.280> touch<00:01:44.820> fire<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
rate than oil so if I touch fire to that

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.360 
rate than oil so if I touch fire to that
you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.900> see<00:01:46.080> it<00:01:46.170> burns<00:01:46.440> but<00:01:46.740> not<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:47.070> quickly

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
you can see it burns but not as quickly

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.100 
you can see it burns but not as quickly
as<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.880> oil<00:01:48.060> does

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.870 

similarly<00:01:53.110> plants<00:01:53.650> are<00:01:53.770> flammable<00:01:54.009> so<00:01:54.640> if<00:01:54.790> I

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
similarly plants are flammable so if I

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.289 
similarly plants are flammable so if I
like<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.330> plant<00:01:55.600> on<00:01:55.780> fire<00:01:56.460> then<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:58.180> entire

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
like to plant on fire then the entire

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:05.160 
like to plant on fire then the entire
thing<00:01:58.479> lights<00:01:58.960> up<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:02.280> then<00:02:03.840> once<00:02:04.840> it's<00:02:05.020> been

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
thing lights up and then once it's been

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.810 
thing lights up and then once it's been
removed<00:02:05.530> from<00:02:05.680> around<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.189> spout<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.610> water

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
removed from around the spout the water

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.400 
removed from around the spout the water
starts<00:02:07.180> falling<00:02:07.570> again

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.470 

you
