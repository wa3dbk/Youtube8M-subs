00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 have you ever wondered how 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.549
 so strict calculating and very clever 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.560
 the country has become so crazy right now 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.690
 the Internet is just a bunch of sites that 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.280
 trying to grasp all this madness from Japan 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.679
 never really work because 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.450
 it's endless chaos honestly myself 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.520
 I don't fully understand how the country is 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.070
 which was the samurai who actually 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:29.730
 currently have a harakiri or job as they 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:31.470
 turned vodka it if you don't 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.090
 familiar with all this madness let's 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.469
 show you a couple of videos here for example 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.469
 Japanese advertising on 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.360
 again bouquets 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.960
 he would be wearing us 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.550
 you know really like an ax 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.770
 no, but I will tell them that they are great 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.570
 because this advertisement I fill up 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.579
 the end of his days or this one here is an advertisement 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.019
 I suggest to see and how longer 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.269
 they thought of such a tilde 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.750
 hitch model dude his laugh just 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.750
 kills me 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.790
 every second 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.489
 arms 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.410
 quarrel time avoid thousands of questions 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.120
 what do i say right away i'm doing combat 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.100
 arts therefore on me can sometimes 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.890
 appear all sorts of bruises and abrasions nothing 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.020
 interesting go home 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.700
 I already sweating and so that's actually 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.590
 assigned answer not why is it 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.320
 many people think that this is a language 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.060
 political tour that went 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.260
 200 years and now in Japan 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.060
 liberated 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.549
 but there is one version that the Japanese themselves 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.260
 speak and which also most believe 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.940
 they said that at one moment they understood 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.040
 something that can't make good money on 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.019
 this and everything itself is just a business 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.459
 inside really cool that is not to draw 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.890
 attention to this is simply impossible 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.750
 if you sit at home and start on TV 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.600
 go such an advertisement for bananas or some 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.310
 drink in a champ with this face and even me 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.290
 I can not even probably design it 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.239
 You clearly remember their advertising clearly 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.430
 pay attention well of course that yourself 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.930
 I will say I really like the Japanese at least 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.000
 for what they did anime 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.130
 i'm a big fan of anime okroshka well now 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.900
 sometimes I will also look straight i believe in this 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.640
 the nation I'm waiting for when they do something 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.420
 really grand they are already in principle 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.130
 did you acquired but i 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.540
 even something more grandiose new 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.370
 technology and new technology but it 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.020
 perhaps everything between them is a new type 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.120
 known how would have reacted themselves 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.680
 Japanese 200 years ago if we show 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.360
 this ad is an indicator of some 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.459
 I think he is happy with a severe amount 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.050
