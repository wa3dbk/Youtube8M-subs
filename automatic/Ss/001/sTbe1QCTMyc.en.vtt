00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
nowhere for two weeks nearby yourself a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.859 
nowhere for two weeks nearby yourself a
lot<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> time<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> lot<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.689> time

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
lot of the time you have a lot of time

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.420 
lot of the time you have a lot of time
to<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.590> kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.829> re-evaluate<00:01:46.950> my

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
to think so I kind of re-evaluate my

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.740

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
life

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.240 
life
I<00:01:47.780> just<00:01:48.110> thought<00:01:48.290> about<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.710> past<00:01:48.950> in<00:01:49.160> the

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
I just thought about the past in the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.070 
I just thought about the past in the
future<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:50.240> was<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.630> was<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.810> life-changing

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
future it was it was a life-changing

time for me honestly so for me that was

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.340 
time for me honestly so for me that was
probably<00:01:53.270> one<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.480> the<00:01:53.570> most<00:01:53.690> fun<00:01:53.990> things<00:01:54.230> that
