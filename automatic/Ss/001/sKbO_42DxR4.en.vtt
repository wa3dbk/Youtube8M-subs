00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello my name is I'm going to teach 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:13.889
 how can they do super cute things with 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:16.770
 very few materials what are we going to 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.199
 need is 3 straws or sorbets 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.150
 some paper cardboard cardboard 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.760
 I use this one sees it in black 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.830
 Scissors and some paint of any 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.880
 color can use spray virtue 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.079
 acrylic paint or even enamels a 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.280
 chain 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:40.500
 and four rings the first thing we're going to 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.500
 to do is to fold the straw in this way 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.410
 we must do the same with the three 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.120
 Absorbent pages is very important 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.120
 that the 32 remain the same size 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.420
 and so we should stay now what 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.420
 will do is heat a needle 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.580
 and then pass it to the sorbets for a 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.580
 corner 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.250
 and on the other also 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.170
 let's grab a needle and let's 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.490
 pierce these corners with a needle 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.180
 let's do the same in the three 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.180
 triangles 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.729
 once we 've done the little holes 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.000
 in the corners we will go through the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.000
 rings 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.490
 and so we should stay now what 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.230
 Now what we 're going to do is grab the 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.540
 paper or cardboard we have 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.069
 chosen and we will mark the three 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.069
 triangles from the inside 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.990
 do not 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.020
 and we are going to cut out the triangles that 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.820
 we did we are going to cut it leaving a 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.240
 little more than triangle space that 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.240
 we draw 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.819
 Now what we 're going to do is grab the 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.640
 paint or enamel that we have chosen 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.640
 and we are going to paint the absorbent straws 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.440
 and so should not be left what 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.150
 let's do now it's start to paste 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.989

00:03:49.600 --> 00:04:07.700
