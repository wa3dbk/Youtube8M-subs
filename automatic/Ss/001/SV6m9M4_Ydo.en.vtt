00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.790
 I would like to talk about user settings this time 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.740
 I'm going to fl when I work on that bill 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.980
 In addition to the improvement of starting from 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.029
 Anno example screen divided into two 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.670
 And E-value card cards Men here say that camera 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.329
 It is in such a state well 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.230
 Well I wish I could start from the beginning 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.070
 I think that you have the main 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.479
 It is this state of the day It is easy to use everyday 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.789
 You can save it in the form of fuser settings 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:35.580
 Then 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.120
 You can start in this state from the beginning when you receive it after publishing 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.670
 It will be said that the way is very easy 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.650
 So it's in the menu 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.000
 There is a sev user setting 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.810
 To button once 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.170
 This way, 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.650
 It is this situation now 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.890
 Because it is saved by the initial setting, it is in the fifth place 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.460
 I do it when I do 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.480
 For example, in such a situation where the situation for soldiers is different 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.560
 When the file comes in 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.830
 You can start from this state 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 I owed after I finished that one time 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.950
 Even when the brand is launched 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.220
 It is this state 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.220
 Yes, with this pre-saved state 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.550
 I can start work 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.330
 Well that way like that 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.980
 That user settings can be made 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.610
 At that time it became the back screen part tel of that person's hand 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.850
 Wrong in the situation 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.540
 This user setting even once 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.140
 It's all about moving your body high 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.250
 Control boiled muza approachable key operation 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.690
 I miss it and say that it is a shortcut and high function 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.420
 If you choose 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.110
 This situation is now that this situation is the default setting 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.880
 It becomes strange, so every time you start efender something strange 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.750
 It means that the effect side starts from the state 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.680
 is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.530
 The strange user approach of that user setting has been done 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.460
 If you're a customer, here's the Labor Bureau and resettingt 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.450
 Well, that's the factory default 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.770
 If you decide to return to the casino state to determine how open 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.770
 It is effective to say that fat reset and this mother face 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.629
 received 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.629
 Because it returns to the factory default condition with this 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.279
 1 time of previous war 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.709
 Yes, it's six times set and this is the state that's shipped 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.879
 It is 1 state that can be used in this state 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.309
 I am resting on the sea 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:32.039
 If it is said that it is eco 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:34.409
 I will return to the state of the day 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:35.699
 I'm sorry 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.289
 A little confirmation and intervention 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:42.519
 For example, on two screens to make it easy to use yourself 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.409
 It is said that it is possible to leave the house for many years 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.349
 Here 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.319
 Government user settings 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.829
 Put in the room 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:52.749
 So that 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.599
 Former Seibu user setting 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.520
 Then to 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.689
 It is close to the load factor factory condition 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.789
 I think I should keep in mind these two things 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.489
 liquid crystal 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.230
 Estimated
