it frame using the rear facing camera on
the<00:02:36.920> X<00:02:37.270> for<00:02:38.270> something<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.780> view<00:02:38.990> it<00:02:39.140> now<00:02:39.740> if<00:02:39.830> I

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
the X for something to view it now if I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.270 
the X for something to view it now if I
were<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.100> take<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.610> spin<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:40.940> around<00:02:42.280> and

were to take it and spin it around and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.640 
were to take it and spin it around and
now<00:02:43.820> just<00:02:44.000> take<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.240> rear<00:02:44.420> facing<00:02:44.660> camera<00:02:45.170> now

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
now just take the rear facing camera now

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.990 
now just take the rear facing camera now
you<00:02:45.710> can<00:02:45.980> see<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.340> am<00:02:46.520> looking<00:02:46.820> at<00:02:46.910> myself

you can see that I am looking at myself

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.840 
you can see that I am looking at myself
on<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.750> EVO<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.130> could<00:02:49.340> have<00:02:49.520> a<00:02:49.550> video

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.380 
on the EVO so you could have a video
call<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.480> speak<00:02:51.080> with<00:02:51.380> someone<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:52.210> if<00:02:53.210> you

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
that's what I wanted to show in the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.820 
that's what I wanted to show in the
video<00:03:02.060> calls<00:03:02.510> still<00:03:02.870> capable<00:03:03.050> of<00:03:03.380> doing<00:03:03.710> it

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
video calls still capable of doing it

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.920 
video calls still capable of doing it
it's<00:03:04.130> just<00:03:04.520> that<00:03:04.820> if<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.120> were<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.330> now<00:03:05.870> I'm

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
just looking at the X screen that if you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.340 
just looking at the X screen that if you
wanted<00:03:08.240> to<00:03:08.330> see<00:03:08.510> yourself<00:03:08.960> while<00:03:09.200> you're

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
wanted to see yourself while you're

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.810 
wanted to see yourself while you're
doing<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.600> video<00:03:11.840> call<00:03:12.430> then<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.460> aren't

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
doing the the video call then you aren't

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.820 
doing the the video call then you aren't
seeing<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.300> you<00:03:14.510> know<00:03:14.630> obviously<00:03:15.110> again<00:03:15.590> as

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
seeing it you know obviously again as

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.410 
seeing it you know obviously again as
it's<00:03:16.130> wherever<00:03:16.430> i'm<00:03:16.670> pointing<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.150> i'm

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
it's wherever i'm pointing it i'm

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.840 
it's wherever i'm pointing it i'm
pointing<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.810> toward<00:03:18.050> my<00:03:18.200> cat<00:03:18.410> then<00:03:19.310> that's

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
pointing it toward my cat then that's

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.430 
pointing it toward my cat then that's
what<00:03:19.970> i'm<00:03:20.090> seeing<00:03:20.300> I'm<00:03:20.480> not<00:03:20.510> seeing<00:03:20.690> myself<00:03:21.080> in

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
what i'm seeing I'm not seeing myself in

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.660 
what i'm seeing I'm not seeing myself in
the<00:03:21.560> screen<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.070> part<00:03:22.400> would<00:03:22.520> be<00:03:22.550> a

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
the screen so that part would be a

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.340 
the screen so that part would be a
little<00:03:22.760> bit<00:03:22.910> awkward<00:03:23.330> whereas<00:03:24.110> when<00:03:24.320> you're

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
little bit awkward whereas when you're

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.350 
little bit awkward whereas when you're
on<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.590> evo<00:03:24.920> then<00:03:25.250> I'm<00:03:25.610> seeing<00:03:25.910> myself<00:03:26.060> up

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
on the evo then I'm seeing myself up

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.820 
on the evo then I'm seeing myself up
there<00:03:26.390> in<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.690> upper<00:03:26.750> right<00:03:27.050> hand<00:03:27.200> corner<00:03:27.350> and

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
there in the upper right hand corner and

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.710 
there in the upper right hand corner and
so<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:28.940> can<00:03:29.030> get<00:03:29.120> yourself<00:03:29.270> centered

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
so that you can get yourself centered

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.510 
so that you can get yourself centered
and<00:03:29.960> know<00:03:30.110> where<00:03:30.290> you're<00:03:30.410> looking<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.920> then

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
and know where you're looking and then

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.960 
and know where you're looking and then
otherwise<00:03:31.730> wherever<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:33.280> other<00:03:34.280> phone<00:03:34.940> is

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
otherwise wherever the other phone is

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.520 
otherwise wherever the other phone is
looking<00:03:35.510> than<00:03:35.660> you're<00:03:35.930> getting<00:03:36.020> that<00:03:36.260> shot

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
looking than you're getting that shot

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.830 
looking than you're getting that shot
looking<00:03:36.890> into<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.130> larger<00:03:37.489> screen<00:03:37.760> so<00:03:38.480> it

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
looking into the larger screen so it

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.990 
looking into the larger screen so it
still<00:03:39.140> theoretically<00:03:39.650> works<00:03:39.950> but<00:03:40.430> definitely

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
still theoretically works but definitely

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.699 
still theoretically works but definitely
a<00:03:41.060> short<00:03:41.540> coming<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:42.020> not<00:03:42.170> have<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.440> front

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
a short coming to not have a front

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.470 
a short coming to not have a front
facing<00:03:42.770> camera<00:03:43.400> especially<00:03:43.520> with<00:03:43.910> as<00:03:44.030> hot<00:03:44.209> as

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
facing camera especially with as hot as

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.090 
facing camera especially with as hot as
video<00:03:44.870> calling<00:03:45.170> has<00:03:45.530> become<00:03:47.739> I'll<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:48.920> that

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
video calling has become I'll and that

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.370 
video calling has become I'll and that
call
