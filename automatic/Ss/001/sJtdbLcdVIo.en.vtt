00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:03.730
 Hello, friends 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.950
 today thursday 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.350
 I love you all 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.259
 some percent demonstration about what miami what they asked me 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:13.500
 yes 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.220
 if there is any method to load them luxury of pisces a world have asked without 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.419
 chip 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.439
 Well, this method that you assign ar is 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.380
 very, very simple 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.130
 believes it is worth setting out 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.380
 what to load to 100 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.239
 what do we need 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:30.880
 how to quote is 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.740
 group of festes 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.620
 does not matter how 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.290
 if they have a single 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.660
 There is a possibility 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 I'm going to load the boats 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.350
 eleven 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.280
 is that my pc are doubly 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.050
 in its versions and 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.050
 then the country that 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.670
 Here you manipulate the octopus and push buttons where you will work 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.910
 this is a method that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.210
 open the lid before the shell 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.100
 what can be manipulated a bit so that only pushbuttons remain 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.800
 could work 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.710
 but when our city 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.710
 the Japanese 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.420
 abbot polar 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.660
 then he made origins 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.660
 international superstars or 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.800
 to see that this 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.290
 I just beat myself to an error 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.750
 well because this is not a consumption yes 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.750
 I want citigroup as indisposed 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.680
 ravel 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 therefore the entity 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.549
 forgiveness bush 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.739
 here I will create a network of networks 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.239
 ponce seems to follow music 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.239
 but that he is a people 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:30.389
 but that has music 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.389
 it happens to me like tacoma curtain 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.049
 how do you know this town 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.249
 original 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.809
 and this 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.749
 he is the pirate 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.749
 pay attention 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.829
 on this screen 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:03.619
 very close to 10 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.799
 if he made us possible 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.489
 of course you can do it 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.120
 you just have to have this original playstation disc 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.579
 db games 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.539
 Prestige 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:21.509
 what can be done is 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.509
 if they have a friend who has prescription power 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:28.759
 original boom went out of style 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:34.359
 it seems 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.879
 it was already clear that yes 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.029
 the only thing I can 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.709
 get your goal 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.919
 this was confirmed in your blog you can spend the internet 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.959
 you can download the stews 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.959
 but it has to be in civil format 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.339
 it is also good that they comment 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:55.489
 this book because 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.439
 it's not easy 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.659
 I trade 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.239
 I want to believe I hope you enjoy it 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.759
 at that level 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:05.989
 and as the study says
