00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
that long clip point there and I really

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.060 
that long clip point there and I really
just<00:00:21.840> wanted<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.439> video<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.859> show<00:00:22.920> a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
this blade and I'll go ahead and get a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.169 
this blade and I'll go ahead and get a
couple<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.859> things<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.429> way<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:29.910> and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
show you the first beam although not

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.720 
show you the first beam although not
practical<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.840> thigh<00:00:37.200> strap<00:00:37.590> hole<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.430> guess

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
practical but a thigh strap hole I guess

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.360 
practical but a thigh strap hole I guess
is<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.059> I'll<00:00:39.149> call<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.649> slash<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> drain<00:00:41.160> hole

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
is what I'll call it slash a drain hole

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.450 
is what I'll call it slash a drain hole
and<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.120> use<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> soldering<00:00:42.600> iron<00:00:43.460> there's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and I use the soldering iron there's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.420 
and I use the soldering iron there's
actually<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> plastic<00:00:45.300> sleeve<00:00:45.710> inside<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:47.070> this

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
actually a plastic sleeve inside of this

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.040 
actually a plastic sleeve inside of this
sheath<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.719> actually<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> pretty

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
sheath here and it's actually a pretty

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.410 
sheath here and it's actually a pretty
decent<00:00:49.440> sheath<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.280> can't<00:00:50.820> say<00:00:51.030> too<00:00:51.090> much<00:00:51.239> about

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
decent sheath I can't say too much about

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.150 
decent sheath I can't say too much about
it<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.780> know<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> couple<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.620> guys<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.980> talked

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
it I know a couple of guys have talked

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160 
it I know a couple of guys have talked
about<00:00:53.280> tacking<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.300> down<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.840> making<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
about tacking it down here making a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.630 
about tacking it down here making a
little<00:00:55.289> tighter<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.710> their<00:00:55.829> belt<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.309> I've

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
little tighter on their belt but I've

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.869 
little tighter on their belt but I've
never<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.030> had<00:00:57.149> an<00:00:57.270> issue<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.879> took

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
never really had an issue with it I took

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.790 
never really had an issue with it I took
a<00:01:00.210> soldering<00:01:00.809> iron<00:01:00.930> punched<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.590> through<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
a soldering iron punched it through the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.880 
a soldering iron punched it through the
bottom<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.229> inadvertently<00:01:04.229> punched<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
bottom here and inadvertently punched a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.340 
bottom here and inadvertently punched a
hole<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> bottom<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.479> plastic<00:01:06.930> inside

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
hole in the bottom of the plastic inside

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.370 
hole in the bottom of the plastic inside
liner<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:09.119> doubles<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> drain<00:01:10.140> hole

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
liner so now doubles is a drain hole

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.190 
liner so now doubles is a drain hole
which<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.710> convenient<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.900> just<00:01:12.900> put<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> little

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
which is convenient I just put a little

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.929 
which is convenient I just put a little
piece<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.439> leather<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.220> figured<00:01:14.909> that

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
piece of leather here and figured that

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.570 
piece of leather here and figured that
if<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.180> really<00:01:15.570> wanted<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.290> hook<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.130> down<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.430> my

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
if I really wanted to hook it down to my

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.249 
if I really wanted to hook it down to my
thigh<00:01:17.850> or<00:01:18.150> something<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.930> my<00:01:18.960> side

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
thigh or something like that on my side

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.859 
thigh or something like that on my side
which<00:01:19.590> chances<00:01:20.130> are<00:01:20.250> slim<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.820> could<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.659> run

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
which chances are slim I could just run

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.469 
which chances are slim I could just run
it<00:01:21.990> through<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:23.100> leather<00:01:23.340> strap<00:01:23.490> because

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it through this leather strap because

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.800 
it through this leather strap because
honestly<00:01:24.900> feeding<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.619> line<00:01:26.130> through<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.810> was

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
honestly feeding a line through that was

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
honestly feeding a line through that was
kind<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.140> hard<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.650> then<00:01:29.340> your<00:01:29.549> tie<00:01:29.729> down

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
kind of hard and then your tie down

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.999 
kind of hard and then your tie down
angle<00:01:30.240> would<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.869> slightly<00:01:31.110> wrong<00:01:31.470> because

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
angle would be slightly wrong because

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.800 
angle would be slightly wrong because
you'd<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> run<00:01:33.090> them<00:01:33.240> through<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you'd have to run them through that

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.590 
you'd have to run them through that
angle<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.909> doesn't<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.119> thigh<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
angle and doesn't your thigh is going to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.120 
angle and doesn't your thigh is going to
be<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:37.049> back<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.530> side<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.040> not

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
be right back on this side so it's not

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.730 
be right back on this side so it's not
only<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.460> work<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:40.500> was<00:01:40.590> kind

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
only going to work out but that was kind

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.429 
only going to work out but that was kind
of<00:01:40.799> what<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> did<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.340> option<00:01:41.640> there<00:01:42.439> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
of what I did for that option there the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.380 
of what I did for that option there the
rest<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> sheath<00:01:44.159> there<00:01:44.970> was<00:01:45.090> no<00:01:45.210> real

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
rest on the sheath there was no real

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.010 
rest on the sheath there was no real
changes<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.049> did<00:01:46.799> use<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.270> bicycle<00:01:48.270> inner<00:01:48.750> tube

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
changes I did use the bicycle inner tube

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.830 
changes I did use the bicycle inner tube
and<00:01:49.259> put<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> cover<00:01:50.460> over<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.270> added<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and put a cover over it and added a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.450 
and put a cover over it and added a

a<00:01:53.490> couple<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.790> guys<00:01:53.880> doing<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:55.079> tried

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
a couple of guys doing that and I tried

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.260 
a couple of guys doing that and I tried
it<00:01:55.470> as<00:01:55.619> far<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> survival<00:01:56.640> blade<00:01:56.880> just

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it as far as like a survival blade just

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.520 
it as far as like a survival blade just
to<00:01:57.390> throw<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.750> backpack<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
to throw in a backpack and have a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.469 
to throw in a backpack and have a
lighter<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.009> far<00:01:59.219> fire<00:01:59.579> making<00:01:59.820> capabilities

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
lighter and far fire making capabilities

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.990 
lighter and far fire making capabilities
with<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> knife<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.640> found<00:02:02.880> it

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
with a knife but I really just found it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.300 
with a knife but I really just found it
impractical<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.810> never<00:02:04.500> used<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.250> took

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
impractical and never used it so I took

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.300 
impractical and never used it so I took
it<00:02:05.520> off<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:07.220> now<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.550> blade<00:02:08.789> itself

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
it off and now to the blade itself

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.170 
it off and now to the blade itself
nothing<00:02:11.310> different<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> blade

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
nothing different to the blade

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.899 
nothing different to the blade
did<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.450> couple<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:13.719> times<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.829> the<00:02:15.400> first<00:02:15.609> mod

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
did a couple of times but the first mod

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.059 
did a couple of times but the first mod

countersink tool and just made it to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.339 
countersink tool and just made it to
where<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:34.659> wouldn't<00:02:34.959> cut<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.170> leather

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
that I didn't put in there this is just

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.140 
that I didn't put in there this is just
a<00:02:39.370> piece<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.700> leather<00:02:40.000> for<00:02:40.329> a<00:02:40.359> lanyard<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:42.150> it

pretty good grab on the hand this is

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.619 
pretty good grab on the hand this is
hard<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.139> do<00:02:47.819> one-handed<00:02:48.819> but<00:02:49.299> you<00:02:49.389> can<00:02:49.510> see

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
hard to do one-handed but you can see

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:50.970 
hard to do one-handed but you can see
when<00:02:49.750> I'm<00:02:49.840> talking<00:02:50.109> about<00:02:50.169> here<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.859> get

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
when I'm talking about here you get

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.409 
when I'm talking about here you get
pretty<00:02:51.189> good<00:02:51.250> purchase<00:02:51.579> on<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:51.970> knife<00:02:52.120> handle

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:52.419 
pretty good purchase on the knife handle

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.649 
pretty good purchase on the knife handle
itself<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:53.379> still<00:02:53.590> got<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.950> pretty<00:02:54.220> good

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
itself you still got a pretty good

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.690 
itself you still got a pretty good
pretty<00:02:55.659> good<00:02:55.900> grip<00:02:56.139> and<00:02:56.290> now<00:02:56.829> if<00:02:57.069> you<00:02:57.310> drop<00:02:57.549> the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
pretty good grip and now if you drop the

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.509 
pretty good grip and now if you drop the
knife<00:02:57.879> then<00:02:58.719> you're<00:02:59.200> still<00:02:59.409> hanging<00:03:00.400> and

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
knife then you're still hanging and

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
dangling kind of deal

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.159 
dangling kind of deal
so<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:02.260> actually<00:03:02.680> worked<00:03:03.069> out<00:03:03.219> pretty<00:03:03.370> good<00:03:04.169> the

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
so I actually worked out pretty good the

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:10.319 
so I actually worked out pretty good the
next<00:03:05.530> one<00:03:05.730> was<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:07.120> took<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.840> hacksaw<00:03:08.379> and<00:03:09.329> put

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
next one was I took a hacksaw and put

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.390 
next one was I took a hacksaw and put
grip<00:03:10.629> texture<00:03:11.079> going<00:03:11.620> down<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.889> side<00:03:12.099> of<00:03:12.129> this

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
grip texture going down the side of this

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.699 
grip texture going down the side of this
phenolic<00:03:12.939> and<00:03:13.150> that's<00:03:14.079> all<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.409> is<00:03:14.620> just

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
phenolic and that's all it is is just

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.640 
phenolic and that's all it is is just
like<00:03:14.829> a<00:03:14.950> black<00:03:15.219> phenolic<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:17.470> put<00:03:17.620> some

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
like a black phenolic and just put some

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.830 
like a black phenolic and just put some
hacksaw<00:03:18.069> hash<00:03:18.340> marks<00:03:18.669> in<00:03:18.790> there<00:03:19.000> just<00:03:19.569> to<00:03:19.720> make

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
hacksaw hash marks in there just to make

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.360 
hacksaw hash marks in there just to make
it<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.989> little<00:03:20.079> easier<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.560> grip<00:03:20.829> onto<00:03:21.040> my<00:03:21.190> skin

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
it a little easier to grip onto my skin

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.800 
it a little easier to grip onto my skin
and<00:03:21.549> actually<00:03:21.699> as<00:03:21.940> effective<00:03:22.389> I<00:03:22.510> know<00:03:22.569> a<00:03:22.659> lot

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
and actually as effective I know a lot

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.719 
and actually as effective I know a lot
of<00:03:22.840> guys<00:03:23.019> are<00:03:23.169> thinking<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:23.530> it's<00:03:23.650> not<00:03:23.859> but

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:24.729 
of guys are thinking that it's not but

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:26.939 
of guys are thinking that it's not but
it<00:03:25.000> really<00:03:25.209> by<00:03:26.109> looking<00:03:26.409> at<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.680> wouldn't

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
it really by looking at it you wouldn't

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:28.319 
it really by looking at it you wouldn't
think<00:03:27.069> it<00:03:27.190> would<00:03:27.310> be<00:03:27.459> as<00:03:27.549> effective<00:03:27.579> as<00:03:28.180> it

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
think it would be as effective as it

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.039 
think it would be as effective as it
actually<00:03:28.510> is

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
actually is

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.920 
actually is
and<00:03:29.409> it<00:03:29.500> worked<00:03:29.650> out<00:03:29.769> fairly<00:03:29.949> well<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.750> back

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
and it worked out fairly well the back

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.990 
and it worked out fairly well the back
part<00:03:32.260> really<00:03:33.159> I<00:03:33.189> couldn't<00:03:33.430> notice<00:03:33.639> too<00:03:33.879> much

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
part really I couldn't notice too much

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.879 
part really I couldn't notice too much
of<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.180> difference<00:03:34.449> by<00:03:34.750> adding<00:03:35.049> those<00:03:35.229> but

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
of a difference by adding those but

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.009 
of a difference by adding those but
these<00:03:36.489> sides<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.909> could<00:03:37.060> really<00:03:37.269> tell<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.720> slight

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
these sides I could really tell a slight

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.050 
these sides I could really tell a slight
difference<00:03:38.379> in<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.680> I'll<00:03:39.280> say<00:03:39.459> it's<00:03:39.609> light<00:03:39.819> but

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
difference in it I'll say it's light but

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.369 
difference in it I'll say it's light but
I<00:03:40.090> can<00:03:40.359> tell<00:03:40.479> a<00:03:40.510> pretty<00:03:40.659> decent<00:03:40.989> difference<00:03:41.290> in

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
I can tell a pretty decent difference in

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.280 
I can tell a pretty decent difference in
it<00:03:41.500> so<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:42.370> was<00:03:42.459> pretty<00:03:42.609> good<00:03:42.879> and<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.989> next

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
it so that was pretty good and the next

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.460 
it so that was pretty good and the next
mod<00:03:44.590> would<00:03:45.519> be<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:46.019> drill<00:03:47.019> hole<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:48.430> through

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
mod would be a drill hole going through

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.020 
mod would be a drill hole going through
the<00:03:50.470> top<00:03:50.680> part<00:03:50.979> of<00:03:51.069> your<00:03:51.220> finger<00:03:51.400> guard<00:03:51.759> and

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
the top part of your finger guard and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.009 
the top part of your finger guard and
all<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.769> way<00:03:53.889> through<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:55.239> I<00:03:55.449> did<00:03:55.599> that<00:03:55.780> just

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
all the way through and I did that just

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.890 
all the way through and I did that just
because<00:03:56.680> I'd<00:03:56.829> watched<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.159> couple<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.400> videos

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
because I'd watched a couple of videos

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.420 
because I'd watched a couple of videos
people<00:03:58.900> had<00:03:59.109> used<00:03:59.319> knives<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.919> survival

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
people had used knives of survival

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.280 
people had used knives of survival
blades<00:04:00.699> and<00:04:00.970> making<00:04:01.269> Spears<00:04:01.599> out<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:02.019> them<00:04:02.139> and

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
blades and making Spears out of them and

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.860 
blades and making Spears out of them and
all<00:04:02.349> that<00:04:02.530> stuff<00:04:02.829> and<00:04:03.579> I<00:04:03.729> saw<00:04:03.939> one<00:04:04.209> where<00:04:04.659> a<00:04:04.689> guy

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
all that stuff and I saw one where a guy

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.679 
all that stuff and I saw one where a guy
had<00:04:05.199> attached<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.709> from<00:04:05.889> here<00:04:06.189> and<00:04:06.310> here<00:04:07.269> to<00:04:07.659> a

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
had attached it from here and here to a

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.780 
had attached it from here and here to a
stick<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:08.319> I<00:04:09.129> thought<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.459> was<00:04:09.639> a<00:04:09.669> pretty

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
stick and I thought that was a pretty

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.629 
stick and I thought that was a pretty
pretty<00:04:10.389> good<00:04:10.659> idea<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:11.290> by<00:04:12.009> not<00:04:12.159> having<00:04:12.370> a

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
pretty good idea and by not having a

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.309 
pretty good idea and by not having a
hole<00:04:12.790> here<00:04:13.090> might<00:04:13.659> make<00:04:13.840> that<00:04:13.959> a<00:04:14.019> little<00:04:14.229> bit

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
hole here might make that a little bit

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.839 
hole here might make that a little bit
more<00:04:14.439> difficult<00:04:14.919> so<00:04:14.979> I<00:04:15.099> added<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.459> hole<00:04:15.639> there

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
more difficult so I added the hole there

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.460 
more difficult so I added the hole there
just<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.449> give<00:04:16.570> me<00:04:16.659> more<00:04:16.840> options<00:04:17.049> in<00:04:17.380> the

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
just to give me more options in the

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.749 
just to give me more options in the
wilderness<00:04:17.620> just<00:04:17.889> in<00:04:18.159> case<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.459> needed

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:18.759 
wilderness just in case I needed

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.159 
wilderness just in case I needed
something<00:04:19.180> like<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.570> it'd<00:04:19.780> just<00:04:19.870> be<00:04:20.019> more

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
something like that it'd just be more

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.300 
something like that it'd just be more
convenient<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.709> have<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.919> hole<00:04:21.099> there

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
convenient to have the hole there

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.640 
convenient to have the hole there
instead<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.270> wasting<00:04:22.690> twine<00:04:23.110> or<00:04:23.440> line<00:04:23.620> or

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
instead of wasting twine or line or

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.719 
instead of wasting twine or line or
anything<00:04:24.130> like<00:04:24.430> that

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
anything like that

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.730 
anything like that
trying<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.180> wrap<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.479> around<00:04:25.539> the<00:04:25.750> grip<00:04:25.960> here

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
trying to wrap it around the grip here

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.670 
trying to wrap it around the grip here
so<00:04:26.889> worked<00:04:27.130> out<00:04:27.280> pretty<00:04:27.460> good<00:04:27.669> and<00:04:28.680> that's

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
so worked out pretty good and that's

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.340 
so worked out pretty good and that's
really<00:04:30.009> about<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.280> no<00:04:30.789> other<00:04:30.910> changes<00:04:31.419> to<00:04:32.229> the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
really about it no other changes to the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.050 
really about it no other changes to the
knife<00:04:32.500> have<00:04:32.710> been<00:04:32.860> made<00:04:33.069> yet<00:04:33.430> I'd<00:04:33.669> like<00:04:33.910> to

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
knife have been made yet I'd like to

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.300 
knife have been made yet I'd like to
model<00:04:34.389> mount<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:35.139> I<00:04:35.229> just<00:04:35.440> get<00:04:35.530> kind<00:04:35.919> of<00:04:36.039> not

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
model mount and I just get kind of not

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.670 
model mount and I just get kind of not
really<00:04:36.400> customized<00:04:37.030> but<00:04:37.270> really<00:04:37.539> just<00:04:38.349> what<00:04:38.650> I

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
really customized but really just what I

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.189 
really customized but really just what I
would<00:04:38.860> want<00:04:39.520> in<00:04:39.669> a<00:04:39.729> knife<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.210> what<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:40.960> could

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
would want in a knife and what I could

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.990 
would want in a knife and what I could
do<00:04:41.349> and<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.770> think<00:04:41.830> that<00:04:42.069> modifying<00:04:42.789> what

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
do and I think that modifying what

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.550 
do and I think that modifying what
you've<00:04:43.150> got<00:04:43.389> if<00:04:43.569> you<00:04:43.660> saw<00:04:43.810> my<00:04:43.960> stippling<00:04:44.289> video

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
you've got if you saw my stippling video

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.189 
you've got if you saw my stippling video
you'll<00:04:44.800> know<00:04:44.919> what<00:04:45.039> I'm<00:04:45.099> talking<00:04:45.400> about<00:04:45.460> but

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
you'll know what I'm talking about but

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.200 
you'll know what I'm talking about but
modifying<00:04:47.199> what<00:04:47.410> you<00:04:47.530> got<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:48.699> make<00:04:48.880> it<00:04:49.000> more

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
modifying what you got to make it more

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.820 
modifying what you got to make it more
functional<00:04:49.449> for<00:04:49.660> yourself<00:04:50.169> has<00:04:50.380> really<00:04:50.650> been

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
functional for yourself has really been

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.700 
functional for yourself has really been
something<00:04:51.669> that<00:04:51.699> I<00:04:51.819> like<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.180> do<00:04:52.360> and

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
something that I like to do and

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.960 
something that I like to do and
something<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.800> find<00:04:53.919> practical<00:04:54.190> people<00:04:54.699> do<00:04:54.880> it

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
something to find practical people do it

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.180 
something to find practical people do it
a<00:04:55.030> lot<00:04:55.150> of<00:04:55.300> times<00:04:55.509> and<00:04:55.840> simple<00:04:56.770> stuff<00:04:56.979> that<00:04:57.130> you

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
a lot of times and simple stuff that you

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.879 
a lot of times and simple stuff that you
don't<00:04:57.370> even<00:04:57.430> really<00:04:57.580> think<00:04:57.729> about<00:04:57.990> but<00:04:58.990> you<00:04:59.710> do

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
don't even really think about but you do

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.260 
don't even really think about but you do
it<00:05:00.039> some<00:05:00.280> people<00:05:00.310> break<00:05:00.699> the<00:05:00.849> little<00:05:00.970> tangs

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
it some people break the little tangs

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.450 
it some people break the little tangs
off<00:05:01.509> of<00:05:01.630> an<00:05:01.780> ink<00:05:01.930> pen<00:05:02.110> so<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.740> fits<00:05:03.280> in<00:05:03.370> their

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
off of an ink pen so it fits in their

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.650 
off of an ink pen so it fits in their
hand<00:05:03.639> better<00:05:03.849> and<00:05:04.090> all<00:05:04.180> that<00:05:04.300> kind<00:05:04.479> of<00:05:04.539> stuff

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
hand better and all that kind of stuff

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.180 
hand better and all that kind of stuff
so<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.020> mean<00:05:05.169> you<00:05:05.259> do<00:05:05.380> it<00:05:05.410> all<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.710> time<00:05:05.740> it's

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
so I mean you do it all the time it's

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.520 
so I mean you do it all the time it's
just<00:05:06.400> not<00:05:07.330> too<00:05:07.449> many<00:05:07.599> people<00:05:08.110> go<00:05:08.229> out<00:05:08.349> and<00:05:08.380> buy

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530
