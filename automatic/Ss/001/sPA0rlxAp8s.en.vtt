in<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.429> video<00:00:02.850> we're<00:00:03.090> gonna<00:00:03.179> look<00:00:03.449> at<00:00:03.659> data

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
in this video we're gonna look at data

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.340 
in this video we're gonna look at data
and<00:00:04.859> we're<00:00:05.220> going<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.730> represent<00:00:05.940> it<00:00:06.270> by<00:00:06.480> tool

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
and we're going to represent it by tool

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.150 
and we're going to represent it by tool

school or more well when are they equal

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.660 
school or more well when are they equal
they're<00:00:56.789> equal<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.510> spot<00:00:57.870> right<00:00:58.170> here

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
they're equal this spot right here

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
they're equal this spot right here
when<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> that<00:00:59.910> spot<00:01:00.660> we'll<00:01:00.960> come<00:01:01.199> down<00:01:01.230> here

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
when is that spot we'll come down here

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.700 
when is that spot we'll come down here
and<00:01:02.520> we'll<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.870> little<00:01:03.989> bit<00:01:04.110> past<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and we'll see it's a little bit past the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.750 
and we'll see it's a little bit past the
halfway<00:01:04.949> point<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.640> we'd<00:01:05.820> say<00:01:06.030> about<00:01:08.270> 1967<00:01:09.409> 68

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
halfway point so we'd say about 1967 68

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.880 
halfway point so we'd say about 1967 68
the<00:01:11.760> number<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> percent<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.500> people<00:01:13.710> were

the number of the percent of people were

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.850 
the number of the percent of people were
less<00:01:14.220> than<00:01:14.490> 12<00:01:14.909> years<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.630> Education<00:01:16.560> and

what person to the people were at that
time<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.299> look<00:01:36.420> across<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> other

time and we look across to the other
axis<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.070> say<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.460> about<00:01:38.960> 55<00:01:39.960> percent<00:01:40.939> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
axis and say it's about 55 percent and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.270 
axis and say it's about 55 percent and
that<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.180> when<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.899> number<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.380> people<00:01:44.040> with

four years of college or more well it

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.860 
four years of college or more well it
looks<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:11.000> you're<00:02:12.000> there<00:02:12.209> are<00:02:12.330> about

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
looks like you're there are about

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.649 
looks like you're there are about
maybe<00:02:13.049> 20<00:02:13.590> apart<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.909> they<00:02:15.060> might<00:02:15.330> be<00:02:15.540> as

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
maybe 20 apart here they might be as

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.350 
maybe 20 apart here they might be as
much<00:02:15.870> as<00:02:16.019> 60<00:02:16.440> apart<00:02:16.769> so<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.099> trend<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.610> is

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
much as 60 apart so the trend is is

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.399 
much as 60 apart so the trend is is
getting<00:02:18.810> farther<00:02:20.000> more<00:02:21.000> percent<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.959> students

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.059 
college and more and a third thing they
might<00:02:30.480> ask<00:02:30.659> you<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.049> do<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.319> think<00:02:31.379> that<00:02:31.680> trend

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
might ask you is do you think that trend

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.509 
might ask you is do you think that trend
will<00:02:32.099> continue<00:02:32.959> well<00:02:33.959> that's<00:02:34.560> your<00:02:34.829> guess<00:02:35.099> but

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
will continue well that's your guess but

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.280 
will continue well that's your guess but
I<00:02:35.760> would<00:02:36.180> probably<00:02:36.390> say<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.959> eventually

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
I would probably say that eventually

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.140 
I would probably say that eventually
those<00:02:37.680> with<00:02:37.950> four<00:02:38.190> years<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.489> college<00:02:38.700> or<00:02:38.940> more

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
those with four years of college or more

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.649 
those with four years of college or more
will<00:02:39.840> get<00:02:39.959> closer<00:02:40.409> to<00:02:40.890> those<00:02:41.159> with<00:02:42.150> four<00:02:42.450> years

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
will get closer to those with four years

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.860 
will get closer to those with four years
of<00:02:42.780> high<00:02:43.409> school<00:02:43.709> more<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.310> reason<00:02:44.670> being

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
of high school more and the reason being

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.869 
of high school more and the reason being
pretty<00:02:45.870> soon<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.500> number<00:02:46.859> in<00:02:47.069> four<00:02:47.519> years<00:02:47.700> of

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
pretty soon this number in four years of

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.089 
pretty soon this number in four years of
high<00:02:48.120> school<00:02:48.150> more<00:02:48.599> will<00:02:49.290> get<00:02:49.500> close<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:50.069> a

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
high school more will get close to a

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.860 
high school more will get close to a
hundred<00:02:50.250> percent<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.879> a<00:02:51.000> kink<00:02:51.299> any<00:02:51.540> higher

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
hundred percent and a kink any higher

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.440 
hundred percent and a kink any higher
than<00:02:52.109> that<00:02:52.290> whether<00:02:53.099> this<00:02:53.400> one<00:02:53.700> will<00:02:53.910> continue

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
than that whether this one will continue

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.690 
than that whether this one will continue
to<00:02:54.660> rise<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.769> there<00:02:55.890> are<00:02:55.980> some<00:02:56.099> reading<00:02:56.519> and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
to rise so there are some reading and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.030 
to rise so there are some reading and
interpreting<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.359> line<00:02:58.109> graphs<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.709> hope<00:02:58.859> that

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
interpreting of line graphs I hope that

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.470 
interpreting of line graphs I hope that
helps<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.370> as<00:02:59.609> always<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.629> very<00:03:01.019> happy<00:03:01.319> day
