00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
birchbox in the past because i had seen

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.759 
birchbox in the past because i had seen

videos on it and what I saw in other

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.659 
on your lips and it kind of is over the
natural<00:03:39.199> pink<00:03:39.709> color<00:03:39.979> of<00:03:40.129> your<00:03:40.250> lips<00:03:40.489> it

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
natural pink color of your lips it

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.879 
natural pink color of your lips it
definitely<00:03:41.000> turns<00:03:41.419> into<00:03:41.629> more<00:03:42.049> of<00:03:42.109> a<00:03:42.319> coral

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
definitely turns into more of a coral

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.629 
definitely turns into more of a coral
pinkish<00:03:43.879> color<00:03:44.150> if<00:03:44.389> you<00:03:44.479> can<00:03:44.659> tell<00:03:44.949> my<00:03:45.949> lips<00:03:46.190> I

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
pinkish color if you can tell my lips I

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.670 
pinkish color if you can tell my lips I
think<00:03:47.359> it<00:03:47.419> actually<00:03:47.540> looks<00:03:47.930> kind<00:03:48.169> of<00:03:48.229> reddish

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
think it actually looks kind of reddish

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.399 
think it actually looks kind of reddish

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
with a couple coats of this just so you

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.730 
with a couple coats of this just so you
could<00:04:30.210> get<00:04:30.360> an<00:04:30.479> idea<00:04:30.750> what<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:31.080> looks<00:04:31.289> like<00:04:31.470> and

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
could get an idea what it looks like and

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.189 
could get an idea what it looks like and
it<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.789> very<00:04:32.819> sheer<00:04:33.659> so<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.550> mean<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.960> can't

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
it is very sheer so I mean you can't

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.629 
it is very sheer so I mean you can't
expect<00:04:37.530> this<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.830> be<00:04:37.860> very<00:04:37.979> opaque<00:04:38.490> or

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
expect this to be very opaque or

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.550 
expect this to be very opaque or
anything<00:04:38.970> like<00:04:39.000> that<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.569> if<00:04:40.169> you<00:04:40.289> really

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
anything like that and if you really

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.219 
anything like that and if you really
really<00:04:40.860> want<00:04:40.979> a<00:04:41.220> lot<00:04:41.460> of<00:04:41.580> sparkle<00:04:42.030> to<00:04:42.330> show<00:04:43.050> up

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
really want a lot of sparkle to show up

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.839 
really want a lot of sparkle to show up
on<00:04:43.349> your<00:04:43.379> nails<00:04:43.710> when<00:04:43.949> you<00:04:44.069> use<00:04:44.280> this<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:44.520> have

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
on your nails when you use this you have

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.330 
on your nails when you use this you have
to<00:04:45.000> use<00:04:45.150> multiple<00:04:45.780> coats<00:04:46.020> but<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:46.740> really<00:04:47.190> think

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
to use multiple coats but I really think

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.399 
to use multiple coats but I really think
that<00:04:47.460> maybe<00:04:47.970> this<00:04:48.240> would<00:04:48.419> look<00:04:48.509> pretty<00:04:48.810> over

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
that maybe this would look pretty over

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.740 
that maybe this would look pretty over
like<00:04:50.009> a<00:04:50.039> hot<00:04:50.370> pink<00:04:50.610> nail<00:04:50.849> polish<00:04:51.030> or<00:04:51.449> some

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
like a hot pink nail polish or some

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.499 
like a hot pink nail polish or some
other<00:04:51.870> color<00:04:52.169> so<00:04:52.409> I'm<00:04:52.470> going<00:04:52.650> to<00:04:52.680> try<00:04:52.949> that

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.719 
and I think that they that description
really<00:05:33.210> fits<00:05:33.419> it<00:05:33.539> well<00:05:33.569> because<00:05:34.009> it<00:05:35.009> does<00:05:35.520> kind

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
really fits it well because it does kind

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.010 
really fits it well because it does kind
of<00:05:35.789> smell<00:05:35.909> like<00:05:36.090> all<00:05:36.240> of<00:05:36.360> those<00:05:36.479> things<00:05:36.539> mixed

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
of smell like all of those things mixed

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.140 
of smell like all of those things mixed
together<00:05:37.289> but<00:05:37.770> I<00:05:38.069> mean<00:05:38.669> it<00:05:38.729> does<00:05:38.909> smell<00:05:39.029> good

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
together but I mean it does smell good

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.909 
together but I mean it does smell good
it's<00:05:39.630> nice<00:05:39.840> it's<00:05:40.110> not<00:05:40.199> my<00:05:40.319> favorite<00:05:40.469> like<00:05:40.830> I

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919

nicely you know whatever I don't really

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.519 
nicely you know whatever I don't really
have<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.610> problem<00:05:59.879> that<00:06:00.330> much<00:06:00.539> with<00:06:00.810> oil<00:06:01.139> on<00:06:01.440> my

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:01.529 
have a problem that much with oil on my

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.510 
have a problem that much with oil on my
face<00:06:01.740> so<00:06:02.180> these<00:06:03.180> are<00:06:03.449> not<00:06:03.949> really<00:06:04.949> essential

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
face so these are not really essential

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.249 
face so these are not really essential
for<00:06:05.699> me<00:06:05.849> but<00:06:06.120> it's<00:06:06.449> still<00:06:06.659> nice<00:06:06.840> to<00:06:06.900> have

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
for me but it's still nice to have

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.589 
for me but it's still nice to have
especially<00:06:07.830> with<00:06:08.279> the<00:06:08.430> warmer<00:06:08.940> months<00:06:08.969> ahead

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
especially with the warmer months ahead

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.390 
especially with the warmer months ahead
I<00:06:10.169> think<00:06:10.529> that<00:06:10.680> it<00:06:10.770> will<00:06:10.860> be<00:06:10.919> nice<00:06:11.129> to<00:06:11.310> have

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
I think that it will be nice to have

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.019 
I think that it will be nice to have
something<00:06:11.729> like<00:06:11.909> that<00:06:12.229> overall<00:06:13.229> I<00:06:13.740> really<00:06:14.219> am

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029
