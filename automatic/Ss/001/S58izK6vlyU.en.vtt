00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
so a lot of people are trying to build

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.419 
so a lot of people are trying to build
sound<00:00:04.620> booths<00:00:04.950> in<00:00:05.279> their<00:00:05.580> studios<00:00:06.170> in<00:00:07.170> a

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:07.429 
sound booths in their studios in a

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.299 
sound booths in their studios in a
do-it-yourself<00:00:08.429> fashion<00:00:08.940> cheaply<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.130> I<00:00:11.130> did

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
do-it-yourself fashion cheaply and I did

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.830 
do-it-yourself fashion cheaply and I did
a<00:00:11.340> lot<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.490> research<00:00:11.670> before<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.269> went<00:00:12.540> about<00:00:12.750> it

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
a lot of research before I went about it

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.180 
a lot of research before I went about it
myself<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.469> when<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.590> came<00:00:13.740> up<00:00:13.860> with<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.099> was

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
myself and when I came up with it was

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.980 
myself and when I came up with it was
good<00:00:14.580> enough<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.179> wanted<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.719> make<00:00:15.900> this

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
good enough that I wanted to make this

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.320 
good enough that I wanted to make this
video<00:00:16.230> for<00:00:16.619> those<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.820> who<00:00:17.940> are<00:00:18.029> trying<00:00:18.210> to

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
video for those of you who are trying to

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.439 
video for those of you who are trying to
do<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.570> same<00:00:18.750> thing<00:00:19.160> now<00:00:20.160> you're<00:00:21.090> looking<00:00:21.180> at

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
do the same thing now you're looking at

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.990 
do the same thing now you're looking at
my<00:00:21.600> enclosure<00:00:22.080> right<00:00:22.350> now<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.130> cloth

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
my enclosure right now I have this cloth

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.210 
my enclosure right now I have this cloth
decorating<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.619> actually<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.980> door

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
decorating one this is actually the door

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.179 
decorating one this is actually the door
and<00:00:26.609> then<00:00:27.570> there's<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> sound<00:00:28.470> absorption<00:00:28.830> pad

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
and then there's a sound absorption pad

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.859 
and then there's a sound absorption pad
on<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> left<00:00:29.670> there<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.119> that's<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
on the left there but that's the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.299 
on the left there but that's the
structure<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.289> mean<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.710> about<00:00:31.859> size<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
structure I mean it's about size of the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.790 
structure I mean it's about size of the
phone<00:00:32.520> booth<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.149> fits<00:00:33.870> inside<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.559> very

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
phone booth it fits inside of this very

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.340 
phone booth it fits inside of this very
small<00:00:34.890> 7<00:00:35.430> by<00:00:35.550> 7<00:00:35.760> room<00:00:36.120> which<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.420> use<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
small 7 by 7 room which I use as a as a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.160 
small 7 by 7 room which I use as a as a
studio<00:00:37.969> far<00:00:38.969> too<00:00:39.149> small<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.420> listening<00:00:39.930> space

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
studio far too small for listening space

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.330 
studio far too small for listening space
but<00:00:40.500> whatever<00:00:42.140> and<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.320> did<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.559> pretty<00:00:43.829> cheaply

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
but whatever and I did it pretty cheaply

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.860 
but whatever and I did it pretty cheaply
it<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> few<00:00:45.090> hundred<00:00:45.239> dollars<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
it was just a few hundred dollars to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.139 
it was just a few hundred dollars to
build<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.980> not<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.489> sound<00:00:47.910> condition

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
build and it's not just sound condition

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.750 
build and it's not just sound condition
but<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.750> also<00:00:48.899> sound<00:00:49.260> proofed<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.100> an<00:00:50.370> extent

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
but it's also sound proofed to an extent

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.299 
but it's also sound proofed to an extent
where<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.750> record<00:00:52.140> fairly<00:00:52.770> high<00:00:52.920> volume

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
where I can record fairly high volume

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.170 
where I can record fairly high volume
guitar<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.820> there

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
guitar in there

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.900 
guitar in there
and<00:00:54.469> loud<00:00:55.469> vocals<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.399> disturb<00:00:56.730> my

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
and loud vocals and not disturb my

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.760 
and loud vocals and not disturb my
upstairs<00:00:57.149> neighbors<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.320> disturb<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
upstairs neighbors and not disturb the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.760 
upstairs neighbors and not disturb the
neighbors<00:00:59.039> next<00:00:59.190> door<00:00:59.690> so<00:01:00.690> I'm<00:01:01.410> making<00:01:01.620> this

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
neighbors next door so I'm making this

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.219 
neighbors next door so I'm making this
video<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.309> show<00:01:02.670> exactly<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.270> did<00:01:03.600> so

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
video to just show exactly what I did so

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.620 
video to just show exactly what I did so
the<00:01:04.890> four<00:01:05.129> walls<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.909> enclosure<00:01:06.210> are

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the four walls of this enclosure are

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.020 
the four walls of this enclosure are
each<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.110> door<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.950> bought<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.580> doors<00:01:08.820> from

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
each a door I bought the doors from

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.890 
each a door I bought the doors from
Lowe's<00:01:09.360> hardware<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:10.290> $20<00:01:11.280> each<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.900> know

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
Lowe's hardware to $20 each you know

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
Lowe's hardware to $20 each you know
doors<00:01:13.860> are<00:01:14.040> hollow<00:01:14.720> but<00:01:16.040> along<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> edge<00:01:17.280> we

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
doors are hollow but along the edge we

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.760 
doors are hollow but along the edge we
have<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.210> framework<00:01:18.450> which<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.530> soft

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
have the framework which is just soft

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.130 
have the framework which is just soft
pine<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.610> think<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.150> there's<00:01:21.299> also<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.630> door

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
pine I think and there's also a door

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
pine I think and there's also a door
chock<00:01:22.500> right<00:01:22.799> around<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> door<00:01:23.369> handle<00:01:23.610> area

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
chock right around the door handle area

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.890 
chock right around the door handle area
but<00:01:24.840> these<00:01:25.020> doors<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.729> uncut<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.150> there<00:01:27.689> are

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
but these doors are uncut so there are

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.649 
but these doors are uncut so there are
no<00:01:28.080> door<00:01:28.380> handle<00:01:28.799> holes<00:01:29.040> yet<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.420> should<00:01:30.509> be

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
no door handle holes yet you should be

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.499 
no door handle holes yet you should be
able<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.869> find<00:01:31.079> these<00:01:31.229> at<00:01:31.439> any<00:01:31.560> hardware<00:01:31.799> store

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
able to find these at any hardware store

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.690 
able to find these at any hardware store
so<00:01:33.509> there's<00:01:33.659> four<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.900> those<00:01:34.280> they're<00:01:35.280> sitting

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
so there's four of those they're sitting

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.450 
so there's four of those they're sitting
on<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.240> carpet<00:01:36.689> fragment<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.439> white<00:01:37.740> carpet

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
on a carpet fragment that white carpet

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429 
on a carpet fragment that white carpet
down<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> bottom<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.540> spent<00:01:40.350> about

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
down there at the bottom I spent about

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.740 
down there at the bottom I spent about
$10<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> carpet<00:01:41.880> fragment<00:01:42.240> from<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> carpet

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
$10 on a carpet fragment from a carpet

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.990 
$10 on a carpet fragment from a carpet
store<00:01:43.049> which<00:01:43.470> was<00:01:43.500> about<00:01:43.860> three<00:01:44.460> times<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
store which was about three times that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030 
store which was about three times that
length<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.450> cut<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> piece<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.829> whole

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
length and cut that piece the whole

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.300 
length and cut that piece the whole
structure<00:01:47.460> sits<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.409> which<00:01:49.409> helps<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.100> D

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
structure sits on it which helps to D

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.109 
structure sits on it which helps to D
couple<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.479> booth<00:01:52.439> from<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.369> floor<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.060> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
couple the booth from the floor so that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.719 
couple the booth from the floor so that
there<00:01:54.329> isn't<00:01:54.570> any<00:01:54.720> low-frequency

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
there isn't any low-frequency

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.649 
there isn't any low-frequency
transference<00:01:56.729> from<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> floor<00:01:57.240> into<00:01:57.570> the

booth also the booth is not touching the
wall<00:02:00.840> which<00:02:01.320> helps<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> same<00:02:02.280> reason

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
wall which helps for the same reason

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.590 
wall which helps for the same reason
same<00:02:03.450> purpose<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.909> see<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> outside<00:02:06.479> of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
same purpose you can see the outside of

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.620 
same purpose you can see the outside of
the<00:02:06.689> hinges<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> door<00:02:07.409> there

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.260 

so<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:12.650> front<00:02:12.860> door<00:02:13.100> here<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.700> only<00:02:13.940> attached

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
so the front door here is only attached

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.270 
so the front door here is only attached
by<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.480> hinges<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:14.960> this<00:02:15.200> eyelet<00:02:15.620> screw<00:02:15.920> on

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
by the hinges in this eyelet screw on

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.310 
by the hinges in this eyelet screw on
the<00:02:16.490> inside<00:02:16.820> it's<00:02:17.090> actually<00:02:17.570> a<00:02:17.600> sliding<00:02:18.140> bolt

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
the inside it's actually a sliding bolt

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.780 
the inside it's actually a sliding bolt
mechanism<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.250> can<00:02:19.400> lock<00:02:19.580> it

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
mechanism so that you can lock it

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.850 
mechanism so that you can lock it
whether<00:02:19.970> you're<00:02:20.120> inside<00:02:20.360> or<00:02:20.720> outside<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.410> I

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
whether you're inside or outside and I

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.050 
whether you're inside or outside and I
put<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.040> handle<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.460> there<00:02:22.640> for<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.910> ease<00:02:23.030> of

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
put a handle in there for the ease of

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.960 
put a handle in there for the ease of
use<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.470> we<00:02:24.650> see<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:24.950> there's<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.220> hinge<00:02:25.490> here

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
use and we see that there's a hinge here

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.810 
use and we see that there's a hinge here
this<00:02:26.360> was<00:02:26.630> chiseled<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.490> that<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.730> would

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
this was chiseled in so that it would

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.460 
this was chiseled in so that it would
sit<00:02:29.030> flush<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.660> then<00:02:29.930> there's<00:02:30.140> another<00:02:30.320> one

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
sit flush and then there's another one

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.770 
sit flush and then there's another one
at<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.590> bottom<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.290> other<00:02:33.410> three<00:02:33.680> walls

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780

at the bottom but the other three walls
that<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.900> see<00:02:36.080> here<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:37.460> then<00:02:37.580> in<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.760> back<00:02:37.940> I

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
that you see here and then in the back I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.450 
that you see here and then in the back I
have<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> light<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.110> corner<00:02:39.380> there<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.340> in

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
have a light in the corner there and in

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.280 
have a light in the corner there and in

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
together autofocus has to work so if we

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.150 
together autofocus has to work so if we
go<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.050> back<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:49.040> can<00:02:49.190> see<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.760> joint<00:02:50.660> and

insulation<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.840> has<00:04:02.959> been<00:04:03.140> hung<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.590> then

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
insulation that has been hung and then

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.790 
insulation that has been hung and then
stapled<00:04:04.670> back<00:04:04.940> with<00:04:05.570> a<00:04:05.600> staple<00:04:06.080> gun<00:04:06.110> using

stapled back with a staple gun using

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.199 
stapled back with a staple gun using
spare<00:04:07.190> fabric<00:04:07.610> that<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:07.760> had<00:04:07.940> laying<00:04:08.090> around

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
spare fabric that I had laying around

this<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.630> actually<00:04:08.930> an<00:04:08.989> old<00:04:09.140> sheet<00:04:09.440> this<00:04:10.340> is

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
this is actually an old sheet this is

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.570 
this is actually an old sheet this is
small<00:04:10.760> felt<00:04:11.120> from<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.420> Halloween<00:04:11.810> project<00:04:12.580> and

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
small felt from a Halloween project and

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.260 
small felt from a Halloween project and
that<00:04:13.760> worked<00:04:13.940> out<00:04:14.120> pretty<00:04:14.330> well<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:16.270> then

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
that worked out pretty well and then

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.390 
that worked out pretty well and then
ultimately<00:04:17.419> it<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.410> deadens<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.070> stone

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
ultimately it it deadens the stone

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.890 
ultimately it it deadens the stone
excellently<00:04:19.940> I've<00:04:20.120> had<00:04:20.330> no

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
excellently I've had no

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.560 
excellently I've had no
with<00:04:21.460> sonic<00:04:22.460> isolation<00:04:22.970> since<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.270> built<00:04:23.419> the

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
with sonic isolation since I built the

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.469 
with sonic isolation since I built the
booth<00:04:23.720> now<00:04:23.930> it's<00:04:24.320> not<00:04:24.560> useful<00:04:24.919> as<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.479> live

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
booth now it's not useful as a live

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.270 
booth now it's not useful as a live
space<00:04:26.870> by<00:04:27.290> any<00:04:27.470> means<00:04:28.300> it's<00:04:29.300> just<00:04:29.419> too<00:04:29.780> small

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
space by any means it's just too small

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.950 
space by any means it's just too small
the<00:04:31.280> walls<00:04:31.490> are<00:04:31.729> parallel<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.509> then<00:04:32.840> of

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
the walls are parallel and then of

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.420 
the walls are parallel and then of
course<00:04:33.169> with<00:04:33.350> all<00:04:33.380> of<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:33.889> insulation

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
course with all of this insulation

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.760 
course with all of this insulation
there's<00:04:35.060> just<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:35.660> much<00:04:35.810> deadening<00:04:36.350> that

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
there's just so much deadening that

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.860 
there's just so much deadening that
you're<00:04:37.370> not<00:04:37.580> gonna<00:04:37.699> get<00:04:37.940> any<00:04:38.150> useful<00:04:38.360> room

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
you're not gonna get any useful room

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.730 
you're not gonna get any useful room
sound<00:04:39.229> out<00:04:39.530> of<00:04:39.560> it<00:04:39.740> but<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:41.270> works<00:04:41.570> for<00:04:41.900> keeping

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
sound out of it but it works for keeping

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.400 
sound out of it but it works for keeping
everything<00:04:42.919> isolated<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.930> that's<00:04:45.229> what<00:04:45.380> I

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
everything isolated and that's what I

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.290 
everything isolated and that's what I
did

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
did

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.300 
did
thanks
