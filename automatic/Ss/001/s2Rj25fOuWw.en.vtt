00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
obviously what we were talking about but

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.459 
obviously what we were talking about but
the<00:00:35.579> biggest<00:00:35.820> thing<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> lot<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the biggest thing that I see is a lot of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.709 
the biggest thing that I see is a lot of
people<00:00:37.860> don't<00:00:38.280> go<00:00:38.430> back<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.820> two<00:00:39.030> hands<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
people don't go back to two hands to the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.319 
people don't go back to two hands to the
third<00:00:39.930> barrel<00:00:40.290> very<00:00:40.829> simple<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.489> basic<00:00:41.670> yes

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
third barrel very simple and basic yes

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.209 
third barrel very simple and basic yes
and<00:00:42.690> I'm<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.870> strong<00:00:43.200> believer<00:00:43.260> when<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.040> go

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and I'm a strong believer when you go

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.160 
and I'm a strong believer when you go
back<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> two<00:00:44.910> hands<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.050> does

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
back to two hands that it does

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
back to two hands that it does
straighten<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.710> body<00:00:46.950> back<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.550> my<00:00:48.149> center

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
straighten your body back out my center

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.270 
straighten your body back out my center
of<00:00:48.629> gravity<00:00:48.750> rather<00:00:49.500> than<00:00:49.770> lean<00:00:49.980> into<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of gravity rather than lean into the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.860 
of gravity rather than lean into the
inside<00:00:50.700> maybe<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.300> bit<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.719> might

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
inside maybe a little bit that might

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.350 
inside maybe a little bit that might
have<00:00:52.020> thrown<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.530> turn<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:54.000> also

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
have thrown you in the turn it also

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.650 
have thrown you in the turn it also
makes<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.379> horse<00:00:56.100> line<00:00:56.520> get<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> straighter

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
makes the horse line get a straighter

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.740 
makes the horse line get a straighter
line<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.890> bow<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.579> correct<00:01:00.480> right

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
line I think that bow out correct right

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.139 
line I think that bow out correct right
because<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> longer<00:01:02.129> run<00:01:02.340> obviously<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
because it is a longer run obviously to

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.050 
because it is a longer run obviously to
the<00:01:03.180> film<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.799> stay<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.460> hand<00:01:05.820> in

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the film so if you stay one hand in

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.020 
the film so if you stay one hand in
you're<00:01:06.600> still<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> horn<00:01:07.590> when<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.640> got

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
you're still on the horn when you got

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.760 
you're still on the horn when you got
out<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> barrel<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.990> pushed<00:01:10.290> against<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
out of the barrel you pushed against the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.160 
out of the barrel you pushed against the
Horde<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.430> brace<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.299> get<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.750> center<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
Horde to brace it and get that center of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.499 
Horde to brace it and get that center of
gravity<00:01:13.290> now<00:01:13.979> when<00:01:14.250> you're<00:01:14.400> pushing<00:01:14.640> forward

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
gravity now when you're pushing forward

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.260 
gravity now when you're pushing forward
you're<00:01:16.229> starting<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.100> pull<00:01:17.430> against<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> horn

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
you're starting to pull against the horn

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.910 
you're starting to pull against the horn
well<00:01:18.479> now<00:01:18.689> that's<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.290> make<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.619> shape

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
well now that's going to make you shape

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.160 
well now that's going to make you shape
your<00:01:19.950> horse<00:01:20.400> kind<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.330> without<00:01:21.659> maybe<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
your horse kind of without maybe you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.830 
your horse kind of without maybe you
knowing<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.860> now<00:01:23.670> you're<00:01:23.880> pushing<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.540> horse

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
knowing so now you're pushing that horse

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.249 
knowing so now you're pushing that horse
out<00:01:25.070> rather<00:01:26.070> than<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.729> go<00:01:26.880> two<00:01:26.939> handed<00:01:27.750> you

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
out rather than if you go two handed you

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.580 
out rather than if you go two handed you
can<00:01:28.439> keep<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.740> straight<00:01:29.280> line<00:01:29.340> right<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
can keep that straight line right and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.020 
can keep that straight line right and
obviously<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.070> horse<00:01:32.250> moves<00:01:32.640> way<00:01:32.880> out

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
obviously if a horse moves way out

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
obviously if a horse moves way out
before<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> turn<00:01:33.869> they're<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.860> know

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
before a turn they're going to know

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.859 
before a turn they're going to know
they're<00:01:35.280> too<00:01:35.490> far<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.210> need<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.659> in

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
they're too far out and need to get in

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.450 
they're too far out and need to get in
and<00:01:37.079> that's<00:01:37.320> where<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> lot<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and that's where you see a lot of the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.569 
and that's where you see a lot of the
bowing<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:39.380> slicing<00:01:40.380> off<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.710> backside<00:01:41.250> and

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
bowing out slicing off the backside and

three strides out of the bird
one-handed<00:02:12.829> then<00:02:13.129> go<00:02:13.370> back<00:02:13.549> to<00:02:13.609> two<00:02:14.060> hands

one-handed then go back to two hands

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.539 
one-handed then go back to two hands
then<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.319> can<00:02:15.500> still<00:02:15.769> drop<00:02:16.010> for<00:02:16.250> your<00:02:16.340> third

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
lot of those riders might be riding

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.140 
lot of those riders might be riding
straight<00:02:24.530> in<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.890> middle<00:02:25.189> right<00:02:25.640> or<00:02:26.000> maybe

straight in the middle right or maybe

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.209 
straight in the middle right or maybe
they<00:02:26.359> practice<00:02:26.840> two<00:02:27.049> hands<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.590> then<00:02:27.920> for<00:02:28.129> the

they practice two hands and then for the

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.459 
they practice two hands and then for the
run<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.519> never<00:02:28.730> know<00:02:28.969> yes<00:02:29.569> makes<00:02:29.989> perfect

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:30.469 
run you never know yes makes perfect

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.949 
run you never know yes makes perfect
absolutely<00:02:31.370> but<00:02:31.849> that<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.389> biggest<00:02:32.599> thing

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
absolutely but that is the biggest thing

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.069 
absolutely but that is the biggest thing
that<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.200> see<00:02:33.590> if<00:02:33.859> if<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.659> you're<00:02:35.659> really

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
that I see if if the you're really

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.220 
that I see if if the you're really
critiquing<00:02:36.829> all<00:02:37.219> the<00:02:37.430> barrels<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:38.230> most

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
critiquing all the barrels is most

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.160 
critiquing all the barrels is most
people<00:02:39.709> make<00:02:39.889> too<00:02:40.400> big<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.969> pocket<00:02:41.510> going

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
people make too big of a pocket going

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.589 
people make too big of a pocket going
into<00:02:42.469> that<00:02:42.650> third<00:02:42.859> barrel<00:02:43.310> by<00:02:43.760> not<00:02:44.030> going<00:02:44.269> back

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
into that third barrel by not going back

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.690 
into that third barrel by not going back
to<00:02:45.200> handed<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.769> getting<00:02:46.069> that<00:02:46.220> hip<00:02:46.370> slightly

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
to handed and getting that hip slightly

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.670 
to handed and getting that hip slightly
to<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.030> inside<00:02:47.480> we're<00:02:47.989> starting<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.349> kick<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
to the inside we're starting to kick the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.190 
to the inside we're starting to kick the
hip<00:02:48.859> out<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:49.310> getting<00:02:49.549> this<00:02:49.700> swooping<00:02:50.419> effect

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
hip out and getting this swooping effect

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.899 
hip out and getting this swooping effect
which<00:02:51.709> then<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> lot<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.370> horses<00:02:52.579> will

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
which then a lot of horses will

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.360 
which then a lot of horses will
obviously<00:02:53.209> hit<00:02:53.659> it<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.230> side<00:02:54.500> slicing<00:02:54.950> knife

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
obviously hit it the side slicing knife

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.740 
obviously hit it the side slicing knife
and<00:02:56.349> or<00:02:57.349> even<00:02:58.159> coming<00:02:58.760> on<00:02:58.879> to<00:02:59.180> them<00:02:59.359> if<00:02:59.599> the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
and or even coming on to them if the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.959 
and or even coming on to them if the
honest<00:03:00.230> horse<00:03:00.439> goes<00:03:00.680> all<00:03:00.859> the<00:03:00.889> way<00:03:01.069> by<00:03:01.310> he's

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 
honest horse goes all the way by he's

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.240 
honest horse goes all the way by he's
going<00:03:02.239> to<00:03:02.329> slice<00:03:02.569> it<00:03:02.599> with<00:03:03.079> this<00:03:03.230> hip<00:03:03.500> coming

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
going to slice it with this hip coming

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.220 
going to slice it with this hip coming
out<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:05.239> then<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.569> have<00:03:05.689> a<00:03:05.719> plus<00:03:05.989> five

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
out and you then you have a plus five

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.830 
out and you then you have a plus five
correct<00:03:07.069> what<00:03:07.579> should<00:03:07.819> you<00:03:08.000> be<00:03:08.150> thinking<00:03:08.689> when

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
correct what should you be thinking when

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.199 
correct what should you be thinking when
you<00:03:08.959> leave<00:03:09.139> the<00:03:09.290> second<00:03:09.680> barrel<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.159> mean<00:03:10.340> if<00:03:11.000> we

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
you leave the second barrel I mean if we

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.699 
you leave the second barrel I mean if we
were<00:03:11.329> at<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.659> house<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.109> we<00:03:12.200> were<00:03:12.319> doing<00:03:12.349> it

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
were at the house and we were doing it

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.030 
were at the house and we were doing it
slow<00:03:13.099> we<00:03:14.000> would<00:03:14.150> be<00:03:14.269> thinking<00:03:14.719> what<00:03:15.200> are<00:03:15.409> our

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
slow we would be thinking what are our

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.699 
slow we would be thinking what are our
strategy<00:03:16.699> should<00:03:16.760> be<00:03:16.940> because<00:03:17.599> really<00:03:18.470> one<00:03:18.680> of

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
strategy should be because really one of

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:19.629 
strategy should be because really one of
the<00:03:18.859> things<00:03:19.040> we<00:03:19.129> were<00:03:19.159> going<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.400> talk<00:03:19.489> about

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
the things we were going to talk about

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.189 
the things we were going to talk about
next<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.090> what<00:03:20.299> should<00:03:20.479> you<00:03:20.599> be<00:03:20.690> thinking<00:03:21.079> in

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:21.199 
next is what should you be thinking in

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.589 
next is what should you be thinking in
the<00:03:21.290> run<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:21.859> if<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.370> practice<00:03:22.940> everything

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
the run so if you practice everything

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.000 
the run so if you practice everything
that<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:23.959> just<00:03:23.989> discuss<00:03:24.560> when<00:03:24.889> you're

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
that you just discuss when you're
