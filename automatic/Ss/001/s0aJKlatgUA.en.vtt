00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
show you how to analyze your hard drive

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.270 
show you how to analyze your hard drive
usage<00:00:04.380> with<00:00:04.770> win<00:00:05.190> dir<00:00:06.029> stat<00:00:07.010> otherwise<00:00:08.010> known

usage with win dir stat otherwise known

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.970 
usage with win dir stat otherwise known
as<00:00:08.309> win<00:00:08.910> directory<00:00:09.750> stat<00:00:10.139> or<00:00:10.759> windirstat<00:00:12.980> so

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
as win directory stat or windirstat so

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.730 
as win directory stat or windirstat so
we<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.610> our<00:00:14.670> desktop<00:00:14.940> here<00:00:15.740> we'll

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
we have it on our desktop here we'll

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.330 
we have it on our desktop here we'll
load<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.130> up<00:00:18.350> okay<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.410> gives<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> option

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.070 
load it up okay it gives you the option
of<00:00:20.750> scanning<00:00:21.800> all<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.100> your<00:00:23.279> local<00:00:23.609> drives

of scanning all of your local drives
individual<00:00:25.080> drives<00:00:25.380> or<00:00:25.920> folders<00:00:26.640> I'm<00:00:26.970> just

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
individual drives or folders I'm just

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.720 
individual drives or folders I'm just
going<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.480> scan<00:00:27.720> an<00:00:27.869> individual<00:00:28.439> Drive<00:00:28.730> select

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
going to scan an individual Drive select

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.020 
going to scan an individual Drive select
my<00:00:30.060> C<00:00:30.300> Drive<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.840> click<00:00:31.470> OK

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.630 

so<00:00:37.570> you<00:00:37.630> can<00:00:37.750> see<00:00:37.900> this<00:00:38.080> little<00:00:38.290> pac-man<00:00:38.770> went

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
so you can see this little pac-man went

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:48.610 
so you can see this little pac-man went
to<00:00:39.730> working

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.390 

okay<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:49.700> now<00:00:49.850> it's<00:00:50.030> done<00:00:50.440> took<00:00:51.440> 11<00:00:51.860> seconds<00:00:52.310> to

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
okay so now it's done took 11 seconds to

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.060 
okay so now it's done took 11 seconds to
scan<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.150> little<00:00:53.510> 8<00:00:53.720> gigabyte<00:00:54.230> Drive

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
scan this little 8 gigabyte Drive

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.090 
scan this little 8 gigabyte Drive
okay<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.660> there<00:00:57.660> are<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.900> few<00:00:57.960> parts<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.739> when

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
okay so there are a few parts of when

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.150 
okay so there are a few parts of when
dir<00:00:59.700> stat<00:01:00.090> there's<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.230> gridview<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.860> here

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
dir stat there's the gridview up here

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.020 
dir stat there's the gridview up here
which<00:01:02.790> sorts<00:01:03.390> your<00:01:04.580> directories<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
which sorts your directories on the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.450 
which sorts your directories on the
partition<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:08.450> can<00:01:09.450> expand<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.890> directories

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
partition you can expand the directories

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.080 
partition you can expand the directories
and<00:01:11.729> then<00:01:12.830> in<00:01:13.830> addition<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.580> grid<00:01:14.820> you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and then in addition to the grid you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.640 
and then in addition to the grid you
have<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.450> tree<00:01:15.690> map<00:01:15.900> down<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:19.229> tree

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
have the tree map down here so the tree

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
have the tree map down here so the tree
map<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.250> another<00:01:20.580> representation<00:01:21.119> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
map is just another representation of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.900 
map is just another representation of
the<00:01:21.810> grid<00:01:22.050> so<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.130> click<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> windows

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
the grid so if we click on the windows

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.450 
the grid so if we click on the windows
folder<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.560> whole<00:01:26.009> rectangle

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
folder we see that this whole rectangle

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.270 
folder we see that this whole rectangle
gets<00:01:27.030> highlighted<00:01:27.390> down<00:01:27.690> here<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.130> click

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
gets highlighted down here if we click

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.730 
gets highlighted down here if we click
on<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> sub<00:01:29.820> sub<00:01:30.330> folder<00:01:30.720> inside<00:01:31.050> windows<00:01:31.640> this

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
on a sub sub folder inside windows this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.320 
on a sub sub folder inside windows this
rectangle<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.860> highlighted<00:01:35.430> here's<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
rectangle is highlighted here's the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.380 
rectangle is highlighted here's the
system32<00:01:36.930> folder<00:01:37.970> so

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.360 

it's<00:01:41.870> very<00:01:42.050> intuitive<00:01:42.410> than<00:01:42.830> how<00:01:42.980> the<00:01:43.040> tree

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
it's very intuitive than how the tree

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.440 
it's very intuitive than how the tree
map<00:01:43.580> works<00:01:45.310> one<00:01:46.310> thing<00:01:46.520> that<00:01:46.700> stands<00:01:47.000> out<00:01:47.240> is

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
map works one thing that stands out is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.690 
map works one thing that stands out is
this<00:01:47.870> giant<00:01:48.230> red<00:01:49.180> rectangle<00:01:50.180> here<00:01:50.920> if<00:01:51.920> you

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
this giant red rectangle here if you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.400 
this giant red rectangle here if you
click<00:01:52.880> on<00:01:53.150> it<00:01:53.330> if<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:53.870> click<00:01:53.990> on<00:01:54.140> any

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
click on it if you click on any

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.220 
click on it if you click on any
rectangle<00:01:55.040> in<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:56.540> tree<00:01:56.750> map<00:01:56.930> it

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
rectangle in the tree map it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.470 
rectangle in the tree map it
automatically<00:01:57.800> navigates<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.730> file<00:01:59.180> on

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
automatically navigates to the file on

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.210 
automatically navigates to the file on
the<00:01:59.780> grid

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
the grid

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.760 
the grid
so<00:02:01.880> this<00:02:02.120> is<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.540> page<00:02:02.750> file<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:03.650> would

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
so this is the page file and you would

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.500 
so this is the page file and you would
expect<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.400> be<00:02:04.490> one<00:02:04.790> of<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:04.970> biggest<00:02:05.150> files

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
expect it to be one of the biggest files

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.500 
expect it to be one of the biggest files
on<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:07.160> drive<00:02:08.260> another<00:02:09.260> thing<00:02:09.619> as<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.510> mouse

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
on the drive another thing as you mouse

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.100 
on the drive another thing as you mouse
over<00:02:11.810> as<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:14.240> mouse<00:02:14.420> over<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.140> different

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
over as you mouse over the different

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.930 
over as you mouse over the different
boxes<00:02:18.110> down<00:02:18.770> here<00:02:18.800> on<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.370> tree<00:02:19.580> map<00:02:19.930> then<00:02:21.940> the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
boxes down here on the tree map then the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.750 
boxes down here on the tree map then the
file<00:02:23.270> shows<00:02:23.660> up<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.590> status<00:02:24.950> bar<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.430> can

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
file shows up in the status bar you can

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.140 
file shows up in the status bar you can
see<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.120> changing<00:02:26.959> as<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:28.580> move<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.000> mouse

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
see it changing as I move the mouse

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.710 
see it changing as I move the mouse
around<00:02:30.490> another<00:02:31.490> part<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.910> grid<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.480> that

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
around another part of the grid is that

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.300 
around another part of the grid is that
all<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.980> files<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.820> tree<00:02:35.060> map<00:02:35.270> are

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
all the files in the tree map are

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.940 
all the files in the tree map are
color-coded<00:02:37.310> by<00:02:37.459> file<00:02:37.790> extension<00:02:38.770> so<00:02:39.770> these

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
color-coded by file extension so these

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.990 
color-coded by file extension so these
dark<00:02:40.190> blues<00:02:40.810> all<00:02:41.810> get<00:02:42.140> highlighted<00:02:42.910> when<00:02:43.910> you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
dark blues all get highlighted when you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.400 
dark blues all get highlighted when you
click<00:02:44.240> them<00:02:44.510> there<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.080> DLLs<00:02:45.850> red<00:02:46.850> source<00:02:47.410> dot

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.090 
usually a backup program that's gone
haywire<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.890> you<00:04:27.890> either<00:04:28.070> need<00:04:28.220> to

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
haywire and you either need to

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.880 
haywire and you either need to
adjust<00:04:30.910> its<00:04:31.120> settings<00:04:31.390> or<00:04:31.930> uninstall<00:04:32.860> that

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
backup program and find it one that

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.950

works<00:04:35.710> correctly

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
works correctly

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.590 
works correctly
okay<00:04:37.960> so<00:04:38.020> I'll<00:04:38.410> unselect<00:04:40.470> those<00:04:41.470> options<00:04:42.040> and

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
okay so I'll unselect those options and

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.430 
okay so I'll unselect those options and
go<00:04:43.600> into<00:04:43.810> some<00:04:44.110> deeper<00:04:44.560> options<00:04:46.140> okay<00:04:47.140> so<00:04:47.200> you

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
go into some deeper options okay so you

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.610 
go into some deeper options okay so you
have<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.830> general<00:04:48.330> options<00:04:49.330> here<00:04:50.230> which

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
have the general options here which

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.660 
have the general options here which
generally<00:04:51.340> are<00:04:52.680> concerned<00:04:53.680> with<00:04:53.890> cosmetic

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
generally are concerned with cosmetic

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.840 
generally are concerned with cosmetic
how<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.980> grid<00:04:56.980> looks<00:04:58.650> you<00:04:59.650> can<00:04:59.830> mess<00:05:00.370> with<00:05:00.400> how

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
how the grid looks you can mess with how

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.670 
how the grid looks you can mess with how
the<00:05:00.940> tree<00:05:01.390> map<00:05:01.570> looks<00:05:01.900> there's<00:05:02.530> also<00:05:02.800> a

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
the tree map looks there's also a

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.130 
the tree map looks there's also a
command<00:05:05.680> line<00:05:05.980> cleanup<00:05:06.760> tool<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:07.270> this<00:05:08.080> is

command line cleanup tool and this is

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.120 
command line cleanup tool and this is
really<00:05:08.620> an<00:05:08.680> advanced<00:05:09.220> option<00:05:09.540> I<00:05:10.540> don't<00:05:11.500> think

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
really an advanced option I don't think

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.610 
really an advanced option I don't think
I<00:05:12.220> need<00:05:12.280> to<00:05:12.430> explain<00:05:12.670> it<00:05:13.000> because<00:05:13.300> if<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:14.110> are

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
I need to explain it because if you are

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.330 
I need to explain it because if you are
going<00:05:15.310> to<00:05:15.370> be<00:05:15.490> using<00:05:15.850> this<00:05:16.030> then<00:05:16.950> this<00:05:17.950> video

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
going to be using this then this video

going to be using this then this video
is<00:05:18.520> probably<00:05:18.730> of<00:05:19.030> no<00:05:19.060> use<00:05:19.360> to<00:05:19.540> you<00:05:19.660> but<00:05:20.350> for<00:05:20.620> the

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
is probably of no use to you but for the

is probably of no use to you but for the
beginners<00:05:21.220> stay<00:05:22.180> away<00:05:22.420> from<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:23.530> advanced

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
beginners stay away from the advanced

beginners stay away from the advanced
cleanup<00:05:24.430> options<00:05:26.070> there's<00:05:27.070> definitely<00:05:27.550> a

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
cleanup options there's definitely a

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.750 
cleanup options there's definitely a
possibility<00:05:27.760> that<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.660> will<00:05:29.160> erase<00:05:30.160> a<00:05:30.190> system

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
possibility that you will erase a system

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.150
