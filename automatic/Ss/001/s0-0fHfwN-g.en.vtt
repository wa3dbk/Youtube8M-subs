braces we're also going to countersink
those<00:02:04.679> holes<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.459> screws<00:02:05.759> are<00:02:06.000> flush<00:02:06.390> with

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
those holes so the screws are flush with

we'll<00:02:35.250> be<00:02:35.370> using<00:02:35.489> some<00:02:35.670> lag<00:02:36.060> bolts<00:02:36.510> and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
we'll be using some lag bolts and

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.110 
we'll be using some lag bolts and
washers<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.530> do<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.340> easiest<00:02:38.370> way<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.849> do
