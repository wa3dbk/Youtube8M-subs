00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.300
 to the whole world of the anses guide and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.340
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.840
 multiplayer of grand theft auto 5 and 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.210
 this trick is to get money 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.430
 infinite and this time we will get 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.200
 quite money and more easily even 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.489
 without spending a lot of money so good 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.739
 Well let's start with the tutorial 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.689
 Well then all first thing we have 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.220
 what to do is buy a vehicle that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.410
 called karim revel that is the most 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.759
 cheap dgt to that vehicle we have to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.680
 buy because it 's the one that we're going to 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.510
 replace in our garage so that it 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.670
 double the vehicle is worth that vehicle 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.950
 we buy it and when we have it 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.900
 We will have to buy another vehicle myself 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.640
 I'm going to buy this mini that is two 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.200
 doors and this trick before you can 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.580
 do with four doors does not reach 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.440
 climbing could only be done with 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.090
 four-door vehicles and I'm going 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.800
 to teach how to do it with a vehicle 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.750
 of two doors that's why we're going to buy 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.910
 this mini that is the one that gives the most money 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.310
 until now and then we're going to 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.350
 tune to the limit if you want if not then this 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.390
 vehicle is already and then finally 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.920
 we will need a vehicle that does not matter 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.090
 If you already have it in the garage or not because 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.790
 This vehicle is going to take 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.799
 police so it does not matter if they keep it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.510
 or not unless it's worth a lot of money and 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.890
 do not want to pay a lot of money for that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.020
 and well then when we are 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.610
 prepared we will need a friend in 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.980
 our departure in our same session 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.780
 I recommend that he be the host of the 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.700
 game and if the trick does not work then 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.140
 you try it the other way around, it's worth it because 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.630
 I say that this trick has cost me of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.340
 record several times when we have 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.680
 all our vehicles in our 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.300
 garage we will remove the vehicle that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.350
 we want the police take him 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.060
 OK because this is very important 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.460
 because otherwise the trick will not work 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.020
 when the police kill us or they are 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.150
 take the vehicle because when it kills us 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.010
 and we are close to our vehicle it 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.630
 will take you to this vehicle has to be 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.800
 a vehicle that I tell you that he can already 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.540
 have it in the garage or you have 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.800
 bought because it does not matter because this 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.270
 vehicle we will not use it to 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.250
 nothing is simply going to take 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.170
 police then when they kill us 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.000
 We will see each appear so we will see that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.979
 the police have taken it away when 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.840
 have passed this we will go walking 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.880
 to our garage and when we are 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.229
 inside we will have to invite our 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.570
 friend is worth the one who was in the game 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.030
 we invite you to select the bear 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.160
 we keep the select and then we're going 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.780
 to invite we invite you and when it comes 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.520
 he will ride with us in the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.130
 vehicle but before it is very important 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.440
 that you put in the same selection you put 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.360
 below the vehicle access 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.920
 passengers because if we do it the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.530
 vehicle or if we do the trick with a 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.750
 Two-seater vehicle has to be like this 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.280
 if you do it with four gives equal and good 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.200
 then we ride in the vehicle that 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.200
 we want to duplicate in my case this the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.270
 mini this I ride and when our 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.920
 friend is mounted next to what 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.600
 we have to do is start when 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.640
 start we'll see this alert that 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.950
 if we want to leave because the vehicle 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.140
 good is a bus that has gone through 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.180
 caught the police of the previous vehicle 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.940
 and what you have to do now is press 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.890
 the time the circle and the X or also 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.900
 it may be a little before the circle and 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.970
 then the X but now I tell you that I 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.800
 it has cost a lot to do even 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.080
 most people there are others who have 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.700
 come out a little before others later and 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.470
 Well, the only thing you have to do is that 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.060
 and then we will see that the screen 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.920
 is black if you see that below is 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.870
 loading means that it has gone wrong 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.970
 you can try again if you keep 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.440
 again the start button until 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.300
 At the end, go out and come back 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.770
 try to do the trick but my case 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.630
 Well, you can see that the screen comes out 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.790
 black and that means it has come out 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.830
 Now what you have to do is keep 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.989
 the little arrow below where it is 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.350
 our command we still keep down to 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.540
 be 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.420
 a character from the online campaign today 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.830
 ok and then when we keep going 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.630
 what you have to do is with the joystick 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.730
 on the right we will have to change 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.410
 character to one of the campaign is worth I know 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.120
 that you will not see anything but there are also 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.010
 what to do and I tell you that if it is 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.930
 charging under the symbol is 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.730
 downloading as I tell you then it is not going to 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.600
 work so it has to be the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.580
 screen has is the screen 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.100
 completely in black and when also 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.080
 it's from character to one of the campaign 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.360
 whatever it is, you will simply see 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.640
 another warning message and this means 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.770
 Well, the trick has already come out and we'll see 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.000
 that the screen takes off the black and 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.500
 we will see again the screen and 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.910
 we are inside our garage what 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.040
 we have to do is give the triangle 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.500
 we leave our vehicle and we leave 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.560
 the vehicle manager is worth where it is 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.970
 is the the circle is in blue and when 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.860
 let's put ourselves there what we will have to 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.210
 to do is to replace the vehicle that 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.070
 we just duplicated good what 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.500
 we want to duplicate rather said that is the 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.470
 that we got to lower that slab 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.210
 We give the X and change it by 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.260
 bear we change it sideways for the karim 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.820
 revel that is the vehicle we have 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.770
 bought at the beginning which is the most 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.900
 cheap gta when we do this what 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.320
 will happen is that the vehicle will be duplicated and 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.970
 now 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.160
 you have to do is get on the vehicle 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.740
 original to the before the duplicate does not 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.840
 must be mounted in the original exit 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.430
 of the garage and just what you have to 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.960
 do now is sell it and so 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.940
 We can unlimitedly do this 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.380
 vehicle without waiting and the truth that goes 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.870
 very good how bad we need help 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.550
 but of increase is what there is and I believe 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.140
 that the best because apart you can 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.180
 do with two-door vehicles 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.010
 not like before, so well, this has 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.360
 been everything if you liked the video 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.070
 it would help a lot andrea like
