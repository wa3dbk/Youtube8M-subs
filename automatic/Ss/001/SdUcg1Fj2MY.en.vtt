this<00:00:04.560> is<00:00:05.009> at<00:00:05.250> over<00:00:05.549> 2,000<00:00:06.330> gTLD<00:00:07.109> station<00:00:07.880> that

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
this is at over 2,000 gTLD station that

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.660 
this is at over 2,000 gTLD station that
I<00:00:08.910> got<00:00:09.150> from<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.450> friend<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.809> mine

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
I got from a friend of mine

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.169 
I got from a friend of mine
this<00:00:11.670> one<00:00:11.910> here<00:00:12.570> came<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.530> me<00:00:14.179> because

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
this one here came to me because

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.660 
this one here came to me because
somebody<00:00:15.509> had<00:00:15.870> actually<00:00:16.490> pulled<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
somebody had actually pulled the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.550 
somebody had actually pulled the
frequency<00:00:18.300> counter<00:00:18.690> out<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.380> whatever

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
frequency counter out of it for whatever

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.800 
frequency counter out of it for whatever
reason<00:00:19.800> maybe<00:00:20.460> they<00:00:20.730> needed<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.240> better<00:00:21.510> than

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
reason maybe they needed it better than

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.109 
reason maybe they needed it better than
maybe<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.260> was<00:00:22.500> broken<00:00:22.830> they<00:00:23.340> couldn't<00:00:23.699> fix<00:00:23.910> it

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
maybe it was broken they couldn't fix it

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.200 
maybe it was broken they couldn't fix it
who<00:00:24.300> knows<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:25.310> anyways<00:00:26.310> they<00:00:26.490> replaced<00:00:26.910> it

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
who knows but anyways they replaced it

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.620 
who knows but anyways they replaced it
with<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.689> Galaxy<00:00:28.260> FC<00:00:28.699> 347<00:00:29.699> frequency<00:00:30.240> counter

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
with the Galaxy FC 347 frequency counter

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.880 
with the Galaxy FC 347 frequency counter
as<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.109> can<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.500> right<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.230> had

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
as you can see right here and so I had

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.770 
as you can see right here and so I had
an<00:00:35.040> old<00:00:35.190> frequency<00:00:35.760> counter<00:00:36.120> module<00:00:36.540> laying

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
an old frequency counter module laying

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
an old frequency counter module laying
around<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.500> went<00:00:37.710> ahead<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.980> put<00:00:38.340> back

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
around that I went ahead and put back

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.680 
around that I went ahead and put back
into<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> radio<00:00:40.040> you<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.070> right<00:00:41.520> there

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
into the radio you see right there

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.049 
into the radio you see right there
now<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.230> frequency<00:00:43.680> counter<00:00:44.219> actually<00:00:44.820> came

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
now this frequency counter actually came

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.100 
now this frequency counter actually came
out<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:46.399> another<00:00:47.399> Cobra<00:00:47.879> mm<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.960> my

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
out of another Cobra mm it was on my

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.020 
out of another Cobra mm it was on my
bench<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.680> probably<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.309> three<00:00:50.730> or<00:00:50.760> four

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
bench here probably about three or four

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.299 
bench here probably about three or four
weeks<00:00:51.239> ago<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:52.260> radio<00:00:52.620> used<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.129> belong<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
weeks ago that radio used to belong to a

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.459 
weeks ago that radio used to belong to a
Phoenix<00:00:56.309> Phoenix<00:00:57.289> operator<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.649> goes<00:00:59.430> by

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
Phoenix Phoenix operator that goes by

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.640 
Phoenix Phoenix operator that goes by
Midnight<00:01:01.469> Rider<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:03.090> radio<00:01:03.449> came<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.500> my

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
Midnight Rider and that radio came to my

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.320 
Midnight Rider and that radio came to my
bench<00:01:04.890> because<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> was<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> somebody

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
bench because it was going to somebody

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.719 
bench because it was going to somebody
else<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.080> front<00:01:07.680> panel<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.130> everything<00:01:08.580> was

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
else the front panel and everything was

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.399 
else the front panel and everything was
all<00:01:08.909> whacked<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:09.960> I'd<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.170> redo

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
all whacked out on it so I'd to redo

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.640 
all whacked out on it so I'd to redo
that<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.030> frequency<00:01:12.570> counter<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.140> fubar

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that but the frequency counter was fubar

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.420 
that but the frequency counter was fubar
on<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.229> so<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> took<00:01:16.350> another<00:01:16.740> module<00:01:17.040> that

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
on it and so I took another module that

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.340 
on it and so I took another module that
I<00:01:17.460> had<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.850> put<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.180> one<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:18.990> sent

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
I had and put that one in and then sent

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.170 
I had and put that one in and then sent
it<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:19.920> friend<00:01:20.250> who<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:20.880> that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
it out to my friend who now has that

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.870 
it out to my friend who now has that
radio<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> kept<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.770> frequency<00:01:23.400> counter

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
radio but I kept this frequency counter

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
radio but I kept this frequency counter
here<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.210> came<00:01:24.420> from<00:01:24.570> midnight<00:01:24.810> radios<00:01:25.350> or

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
here that came from midnight radios or

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.469 
here that came from midnight radios or
midnight<00:01:26.070> riders<00:01:26.610> radio<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:29.329> what<00:01:30.329> was

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
midnight riders radio and what was

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.469 
midnight riders radio and what was
happening<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:32.610> digit<00:01:33.299> right

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
happening was that this this digit right

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.249 
happening was that this this digit right
here<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.229> two<00:01:34.439> was<00:01:35.340> flashing<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.840> when<00:01:37.110> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
here the two was flashing and when it

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.069 
here the two was flashing and when it
was<00:01:37.409> flashing<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.250> could<00:01:38.460> hear<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.900> kind<00:01:39.900> of

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
was flashing you could hear this kind of

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.109 
was flashing you could hear this kind of
sound<00:01:40.350> coming<00:01:40.650> through<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> speakers<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.820> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
sound coming through the speakers so I

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.620 
sound coming through the speakers so I
did<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:42.960> investigation<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
did a little investigation in that and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.740 
did a little investigation in that and
turns<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:47.149> capacitors<00:01:48.149> inside<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
turns out the capacitors inside the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.630 
turns out the capacitors inside the
frequency<00:01:49.259> counter<00:01:49.649> were<00:01:49.799> bad<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> went

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
frequency counter were bad so I went

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
frequency counter were bad so I went
ahead<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.000> replaced<00:01:51.090> every<00:01:51.630> single<00:01:51.899> one<00:01:51.960> of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
ahead and replaced every single one of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.740 
ahead and replaced every single one of
those<00:01:52.170> capacitors<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.759> now<00:01:54.119> let's<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:54.540> it's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
those capacitors and now let's see it's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.330 
those capacitors and now let's see it's
working<00:01:55.020> fine<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> now<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.500> radio<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.159> is

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
working fine so now this radio here is

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.109 
working fine so now this radio here is
going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> my<00:01:59.850> friend<00:02:00.180> 238<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.409> here

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
going to my friend 238 and this one here

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.780 
going to my friend 238 and this one here
like<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.270> said<00:02:03.329> had<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.899> FC<00:02:04.320> 347<00:02:05.280> frequency

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
like I said had this FC 347 frequency

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.440 
like I said had this FC 347 frequency
counter<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.099> so<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.129> put<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.700> original

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
counter in it and so I put the original

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.080 
counter in it and so I put the original
back<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.530> now<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.280> seems<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.610> work<00:02:11.819> just

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
back in it and now it seems to work just

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.850 
back in it and now it seems to work just
fine<00:02:12.390> did<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> little<00:02:13.170> bit<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.470> lining

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
fine did a little bit of a lining
