 impression then on the blog you will find worth 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.990
 I don't think I've ever done any articles

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.369
 these two boxes is mine I do n't know 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.719
 I have to call the make up in collection 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.640
 reality is not a collection of its own 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.980
 you have enough glass because you don't 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.350
 collect the snow wall here 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.730
 that many very thick brushes the cream 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.309
 for this wall with all the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:51.329
 earrings and then the door the coat rack 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.829
 with that you always live my videos here 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.930
 instead on this side we find in 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.239
 these two boxes and above the computer 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.550
 which contain other ring bracelets 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.109
 ceper earrings etc. and also here 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.820
 same thing but who maybe I could n't 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.680
 as soon as I closed it less 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.420
 then here are the news then this 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.850
 four times the swatch on the blog and it 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.070
 you have seen and the 0 4 debora gel 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.409
 effect and I'm really satisfied with 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.299
 this line at least of this color 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.430
 find the review on the blog with which 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.840
 I say already that they are really fantastic 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.229
 because they are so shiny and last 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.330
 a lot my boyfriend on the same 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.360
 on the same subject he gave me the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.860
 plumping set top coat then the top coat 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.369
 which should guarantee this effect 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.610
 gel so shiny mirror and also 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.630
 therefore fleshed out that transparent 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.640
 I will also use on the enamels that I do not 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.100
 they are obviously gello effect 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.270
 and then this beautiful green color 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.680
 very clear water that the 13 from not 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.560
 confuse with a slightly darker one 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.030
 because many times one thinks it is 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.159
 same color instead this case bull 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.810
 light blue and it's really beautiful 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.549
 the thing on pain of these enamels that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.240
 have the applicator that wide panel 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.460
 fat can be seen from the transparent one 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.920
 in short, we can also see why the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.140
 obviously transparent brush then me 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.149
 took this polish of the rim that 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:14.410
 they are my favorites you know it yes 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:15.819
 he calls it a banana yellow there 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.190
 you see a yellow more intense 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.880
 banana that I will pair with these earrings 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.430
 banana yellow and I'm looking for it 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.220
 even a difficult map eye shadow 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.340
 then he took me to this line 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.730
 salon perfumes always jelle effect style 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.840
 color b my first and is a green 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.970
 emerald also a little pebble octane that 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.920
 in short, unfortunately, if I had a little similar 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.019
 but this one has nothing to do with it 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.510
 how much I had it because with it you stop 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.549
 after the optical very little instead the line 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.530
 of the season also lasts 5 6 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.319
 intact days then the novelty 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.440
 absolute in nymph the gel blends of the oreal 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.450
 that 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.030
 it was also advertised on facebook 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.790
 which promises to last up to 12 days 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:08.180
 they are a glaze in two steps 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:12.690
 practically as it is composed of 22 parts a 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.560
 put the easel nature did it 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.740
 so how do you see this here the color 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.160
 005 which is called bon bon practically 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.570
 you open 112 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.980
 none of the very normal dismantle it 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.560
 real only that they have the peculiarity 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.720
 of having been in this thing for months 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.840
 tubular from this can obviously the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.360
 basic color which is a beautiful pink beard 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.520
 instead this is the gel here 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.620
 then I regarding quality 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.830
 I can tell you little about enamels 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.500
 in the sense that I don't have either or 23 but I am 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.480
 top coat but I hear many girls that yes 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.940
 they complain because they are not first though 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.710
 quality this straight forward promises to 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.190
 last up to 12 days see a 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.080
 if they are respected this 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.060
 this advice also because it says that 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.690
 then the top coat phase and see 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.209
 do not even repeat it during these 12 June 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.440
 here I am here only 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.580
 an impression we say about those that 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.100
 they are also the new collections too 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.959
 because the two rim and are now rita 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.640
 what you know is the new testimonial for 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.370
 rim so I also wanted to include a 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.350
 together with the present panoramic views 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.120
 on the market and I will also put prices 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.250
 even where I took them to where you got them 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.910
 took the crime but will not kiss the next one 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.910
 hello video
