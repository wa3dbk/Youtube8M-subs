00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.190
 It's like you do not have worries. 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.170
 enough with your car now you have to 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.809
 make it a habit to check that the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.750
 is still in place every time you leave the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.980
 vehicle on the road or even when leaving 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 of parking 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.380
 because every day more theft of the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:33.750
 spare wheel is becoming very 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:36.000
 common car manufacturers already 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.800
 are aware of this so much that some 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.920
 cars already leave the factory with items 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.899
 antitheft for the steppe an example is the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.520
 nut safety catch that eco sport 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.039
 carries 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.350
 however the vast majority of models still 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.370
 need more equipment to inhibit 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.320
 the theft 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.930
 if the step of your car is in the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.480
 vehicle is a good gauge. 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.969
 because this is a complicated factor. 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.280
 who tries to break into a car in the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.589
 However, the other options to inhibit 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.810
 this type of robbery independent of being 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.180
 inside or outside the car are the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.970
 traditional steel cables or chains 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.159
 but these are not always effective 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.280
 chains also exist are vulnerable 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.310
 to theft if he knows the method of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.290
 cheat this chain then it works 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.360
 more as an inhibitor than as the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.880
 effectiveness for theft itself 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.950
 if he leaves profute he can disarm 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.140
 a current in minutes 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.840
 today there are specific locks for 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.939
 avoid tire theft reserve this kit 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.430
 anti-theft is basically composed of a 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.619
 small mechanical device and that 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.420
 works as a screw as space 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.829
 for the locking of the key secret that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.970
 power system 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.770
 this antitheft lock of steppe she 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.329
 replaces the original butterfly what 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.310
 hold the steppe 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.740
 so we removed the butterfly and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.380
 we put this lock that it turns on 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.630
 false once it is placed, it can not 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.579
 remove without the special key 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.950
 these locks normally come with a 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.170
 key you need to hide in 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.569
 location of the car or press the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.060
 pocket and how each job has a 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.190
 this will be the guarantee that your 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:21.050
 steppe will not be 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:23.330
 the neighborhood but remember if you do not have pain 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.340
 head is best to try to leave the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.350
 car in safe places such as 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.690
 parking lots where you can take the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.810
 key or park in places as 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.090
 but when it is not possible to 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.510
 remember to check the spare tire still 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.580
 is in the right place 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.580
