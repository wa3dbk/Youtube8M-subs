be<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.399> course<00:00:42.469> but<00:00:43.469> let's<00:00:43.620> check

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
be going for of course but let's check

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.420 
be going for of course but let's check
out<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.040> scales<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.460> level<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.410> 15<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.389 

see<00:00:50.430> what<00:00:50.579> its<00:00:50.730> skills<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.680> like<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
see what its skills are actually like so

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.369 
see what its skills are actually like so
it<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.660> able<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.870> attack<00:00:55.199> all

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
it is going to be able to attack all

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.779 
it is going to be able to attack all
three<00:00:55.680> which<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.660> guess<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.899> okay<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.980> don't

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
three which I guess is okay but I don't

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.790 
three which I guess is okay but I don't
know<00:00:59.850> we'll<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.270> that's<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.680> then

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
know we'll see what that's like and then

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.910 
know we'll see what that's like and then
it's<00:01:01.920> also<00:01:02.039> got<00:01:02.399> boost<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.149> its<00:01:03.920> ability

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
it's also got boost is its ability

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.120 
it's also got boost is its ability
here's<00:01:05.309> its<00:01:05.610> first<00:01:06.210> kill<00:01:06.450> upgraded<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> then

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
here's its first kill upgraded and then

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.380 
here's its first kill upgraded and then
its<00:01:08.340> second<00:01:08.939> skill<00:01:09.299> upgraded<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:12.060> only<00:01:12.240> thing

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
its second skill upgraded the only thing

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.170 
its second skill upgraded the only thing

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that sucks about this mutant is it has

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.039 
that sucks about this mutant is it has
one<00:01:15.750> Gen<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> legendary<00:01:17.189> mean<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.850> is

pretty fast so that can help you get
some<00:01:22.890> stuff<00:01:23.130> done<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:25.439> only<00:01:25.560> downside<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.070> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
some stuff done the only downside is it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.359 
some stuff done the only downside is it
doesn't<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.270> HP<00:01:27.540> I'm<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:29.040> too<00:01:29.220> sure

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
doesn't have as much HP I'm not too sure

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.190 
doesn't have as much HP I'm not too sure
what<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.549> gold<00:01:29.970> version<00:01:30.210> looks<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.930> will

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
what the gold version looks like I will

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.600 
what the gold version looks like I will
be<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.180> gold<00:01:33.180> version<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
be going for the gold version and

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.999 
be going for the gold version and
comparing<00:01:35.610> them<00:01:35.939> they're<00:01:36.930> comparing<00:01:37.350> her<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
comparing them they're comparing her to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.350 
comparing them they're comparing her to
X<00:01:38.310> 27<00:01:39.320> but<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.799> don't<00:01:41.100> need<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.759> any<00:01:42.150> of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
X 27 but you don't need it for any of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.770 
X 27 but you don't need it for any of
the<00:01:42.509> bingo<00:01:42.780> cards<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.880> don't<00:01:45.270> technically

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the bingo cards so you don't technically

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
the bingo cards so you don't technically
have<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.170> buy<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:47.070> I'm<00:01:47.430> guessing<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.240> lot<00:01:48.420> of

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
have to buy it but I'm guessing a lot of

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.810 
have to buy it but I'm guessing a lot of
people<00:01:48.750> are<00:01:48.840> gonna<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.140> running<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:50.479> the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
people are gonna be running it in the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.859 
people are gonna be running it in the
PvP<00:01:53.820> since<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.570> gonna<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.869> faster<00:01:55.520> than<00:01:56.520> X<00:01:57.030> 27

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
PvP since it's gonna be faster than X 27

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.649 
PvP since it's gonna be faster than X 27
and<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.530> first<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.159> PvP<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.320> very<00:02:01.320> crucial

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
and going first in PvP is very crucial

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.850 
and going first in PvP is very crucial
considering<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.960> usually<00:02:04.200> decides<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.680> match

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
considering it usually decides the match

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.190 
considering it usually decides the match
depending<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:05.759> your<00:02:05.909> tag<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:07.049> it's

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
depending on what your tag is but it's

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
depending on what your tag is but it's
up<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.680> want<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.920> get<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.330> a

up to you if you want to get it it is a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.190 
up to you if you want to get it it is a
pretty<00:02:09.660> good<00:02:09.840> mutant<00:02:10.760> for<00:02:11.760> PvP<00:02:12.420> other<00:02:12.750> than

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
pretty good mutant for PvP other than

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.010 
pretty good mutant for PvP other than
that<00:02:13.379> it's<00:02:13.680> gonna<00:02:13.830> help<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.250> go<00:02:15.090> first<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.690> PvE

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
that it's gonna help you go first in PvE

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.009 
that it's gonna help you go first in PvE
or<00:02:16.680> any<00:02:17.190> other<00:02:17.370> event<00:02:17.580> stuff<00:02:18.300> like<00:02:18.480> that

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
or any other event stuff like that

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.180 
or any other event stuff like that
but<00:02:19.590> overall<00:02:20.030> it's<00:02:21.030> gonna<00:02:21.239> probably<00:02:21.950> not<00:02:22.950> be

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
but overall it's gonna probably not be

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.750 
but overall it's gonna probably not be
as<00:02:23.340> good<00:02:24.080> just<00:02:25.080> because<00:02:25.379> it<00:02:25.500> only<00:02:25.650> has<00:02:25.890> one<00:02:25.920> gen

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
as good just because it only has one gen

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.120 
as good just because it only has one gen
so<00:02:27.660> pretty<00:02:28.410> much<00:02:29.129> it<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.550> get<00:02:29.670> destroyed

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
so pretty much it can get destroyed

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.559 
so pretty much it can get destroyed
relatively<00:02:32.130> easy<00:02:32.400> all<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.730> need<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> necro

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
relatively easy all you need is a necro

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.210 
relatively easy all you need is a necro
moon<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.110> it's<00:02:34.470> gonna<00:02:34.650> basically<00:02:34.950> brutal<00:02:35.790> and

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220
