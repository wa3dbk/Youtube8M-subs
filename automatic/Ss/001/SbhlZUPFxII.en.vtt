00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.660 

okay<00:00:07.680> we're<00:00:07.770> gonna<00:00:07.890> move<00:00:08.040> on<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.190> buff<00:00:08.460> right

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
okay we're gonna move on to buff right

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.240 
okay we're gonna move on to buff right
now<00:00:08.820> but<00:00:09.150> before<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.600> I'm<00:00:10.290> gonna<00:00:10.469> explain<00:00:10.950> on

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
now but before that I'm gonna explain on

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.370 
now but before that I'm gonna explain on
just<00:00:11.820> how<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.059> engine<00:00:12.570> stores<00:00:13.230> inputs<00:00:13.920> and

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
just how the engine stores inputs and

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.140 
just how the engine stores inputs and
this<00:00:16.380> is<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:16.710> makes<00:00:16.860> buffering<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.580> useful

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
this is what makes buffering so useful

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.679 
this is what makes buffering so useful
in<00:00:18.450> the<00:00:18.570> game<00:00:19.369> so<00:00:20.369> what<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.090> game<00:00:21.240> does<00:00:21.270> is

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
in the game so what the game does is

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.250 
in the game so what the game does is
when<00:00:22.259> you<00:00:22.290> input<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.770> motion<00:00:23.190> into<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.430> game

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
when you input a motion into the game

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.320 
when you input a motion into the game
after<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.529> execute<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> move<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.850> motion<00:00:27.210> is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
after you execute a move the motion is

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.689 
after you execute a move the motion is
still<00:00:28.020> in<00:00:28.350> the<00:00:28.500> memory<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.220> game<00:00:29.430> so<00:00:29.670> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
still in the memory of the game so to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.299 
still in the memory of the game so to
speak<00:00:29.850> it's<00:00:30.480> still<00:00:30.750> stored<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.160> can

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
speak it's still stored and what you can

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.520 
speak it's still stored and what you can
do<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:32.970> use<00:00:33.629> that<00:00:33.809> motion<00:00:34.080> for

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
do is you can use that motion for

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.030 
do is you can use that motion for
something<00:00:35.129> else<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.519> well<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.500> thus<00:00:37.500> lowering

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
something else as well and thus lowering

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.570 
something else as well and thus lowering
your<00:00:38.220> steps<00:00:38.519> and<00:00:38.790> making<00:00:39.150> inputs<00:00:39.600> easier<00:00:40.580> so

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
your steps and making inputs easier so

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.560 
your steps and making inputs easier so
let<00:00:41.699> me<00:00:41.760> show<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.909> example

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
let me show you example

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.990 
let me show you example
so<00:00:43.110> with<00:00:43.260> Ryu<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.190> gonna<00:00:44.339> walk<00:00:44.670> for

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
so with Ryu here I'm just gonna walk for

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.280 
so with Ryu here I'm just gonna walk for
it<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.510> gonna<00:00:45.690> try<00:00:45.900> throwing<00:00:46.080> a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
it a bit I'm gonna try throwing a

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.310 
it a bit I'm gonna try throwing a
fireball<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.809> an<00:00:48.930> uppercut

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
fireball so you know what so an uppercut

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.920 
fireball so you know what so an uppercut
came<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.729> it's<00:00:50.729> because<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.120> game<00:00:51.330> remembers

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
came out it's because the game remembers

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.950 
came out it's because the game remembers
that<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.440> hit<00:00:53.220> forward<00:00:53.519> right<00:00:53.870> when<00:00:54.870> I'm

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that I hit forward right when I'm

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.320 
that I hit forward right when I'm
walking<00:00:55.650> but<00:00:55.830> the<00:00:56.010> forward<00:00:56.400> input<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:56.970> still

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
walking but the forward input is still

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.000 
walking but the forward input is still
in<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.629> memory<00:00:57.900> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.080> game<00:00:58.290> and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.890> when

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
in the memory of the game and then when

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.649 
in the memory of the game and then when
I<00:00:59.040> inputted<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.699> fireball<00:01:00.210> motion<00:01:00.540> the

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
I inputted the fireball motion the

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.090 
I inputted the fireball motion the
game's<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:01.019> oh<00:01:01.170> he's<00:01:01.650> trying<00:01:01.799> to<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.010> an

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
game's like oh he's trying to do an

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.119 
game's like oh he's trying to do an
uppercut<00:01:02.549> now<00:01:03.269> this<00:01:03.930> might<00:01:04.110> sound<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.799> bad

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
uppercut now this might sound like bad

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.649 
uppercut now this might sound like bad
for<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> game<00:01:05.790> right<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.630> don't

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
for the game right because you don't

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.350 
for the game right because you don't
input<00:01:07.350> 1<00:01:07.710> input<00:01:07.920> motions<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.760> screw<00:01:09.000> yourself

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
input 1 input motions and screw yourself

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.749 
input 1 input motions and screw yourself
over<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.810> want<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.579> take

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
over as you want to but you can take

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.609 
over as you want to but you can take
advantage<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.079> one<00:01:13.289> thing<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.469> keep

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
advantage of this so one thing to keep

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.620 
advantage of this so one thing to keep
in<00:01:13.770> mind<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.219> that<00:01:14.310> motions<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.240> stored

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
in mind here is that motions are stored

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.480 
in mind here is that motions are stored
longer<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.469> you're<00:01:16.590> trying<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.859> do<00:01:17.009> ultras

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
longer when you're trying to do ultras

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.990 
longer when you're trying to do ultras
than<00:01:17.700> special<00:01:17.969> moves<00:01:18.439> sure<00:01:19.439> example<00:01:19.920> here<00:01:20.189> so

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
than special moves sure example here so

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.499 
than special moves sure example here so
for<00:01:21.270> example<00:01:21.689> chun-li<00:01:22.700> she<00:01:23.700> wants<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.329> I

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
for example chun-li she wants to if I

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.090 
for example chun-li she wants to if I
want<00:01:24.719> to<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> fireball<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.799> charge

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
want to do a fireball I have to charge

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.910 
want to do a fireball I have to charge
back<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:26.789> go<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.179> punch<00:01:27.649> now<00:01:28.649> I'm<00:01:28.829> gonna

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
back and then go for punch now I'm gonna

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.130 
back and then go for punch now I'm gonna
try<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.219> do<00:01:29.399> cuz<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:29.850> gonna<00:01:29.969> charge<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
try to do cuz I'm gonna charge it and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590 
try to do cuz I'm gonna charge it and
then<00:01:31.530> I'm<00:01:31.619> gonna<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.460> my<00:01:32.490> dash<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.270> then

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
then I'm gonna go to my dash and then

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.270 
then I'm gonna go to my dash and then
I'm<00:01:33.719> gonna<00:01:33.810> try<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.320> fireball<00:01:34.859> rate

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
I'm gonna try to a fireball rate

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.560 
I'm gonna try to a fireball rate
actually<00:01:35.579> -<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.149> done

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
actually - it's done

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.789 
actually - it's done
so<00:01:37.439> show<00:01:38.399> example<00:01:39.229> notice<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.469> not<00:01:40.499> coming

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
so show example notice it's not coming

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.039 
so show example notice it's not coming
out<00:01:42.770> but<00:01:43.770> when<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> try<00:01:44.219> to<00:01:44.249> do<00:01:44.399> an<00:01:44.520> ultra<00:01:45.060> which

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
out but when I try to do an ultra which

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.380 
out but when I try to do an ultra which
also<00:01:46.259> requires<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> charge<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.520> even<00:01:48.149> though

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
also requires a charge and even though

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.230 
also requires a charge and even though
it<00:01:48.539> requires<00:01:48.659> more<00:01:49.200> directions<00:01:49.880> I'm<00:01:50.880> able<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
it requires more directions I'm able to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.359 
it requires more directions I'm able to
do<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.569> after<00:01:51.749> a<00:01:51.960> dash

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.459 

so<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.299> ultra<00:01:56.539> comes<00:01:56.719> up<00:01:56.869> with<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.049> fireball

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
so the ultra comes up with a fireball

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.440 
so the ultra comes up with a fireball
one<00:01:59.020> sir<00:02:00.020> just<00:02:00.289> something<00:02:00.829> to<00:02:00.890> keep<00:02:01.009> in<00:02:01.130> mind

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
one sir just something to keep in mind

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.459 
one sir just something to keep in mind
all<00:02:02.450> right<00:02:02.509> now<00:02:02.750> it's<00:02:02.899> time<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:03.079> explain

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
all right now it's time to explain

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.669 
all right now it's time to explain
buffering<00:02:04.090> now<00:02:05.090> buffering<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:06.170> basically

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
buffering now buffering is basically

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.029 
buffering now buffering is basically
input<00:02:07.549> in<00:02:07.640> emotion<00:02:08.209> during<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.289> animation<00:02:09.860> of

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
input in emotion during the animation of

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.890 
input in emotion during the animation of
something<00:02:10.489> else<00:02:10.670> it's<00:02:11.269> basically<00:02:11.629> like

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
something else it's basically like

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.570 
something else it's basically like
getting<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.470> head<00:02:12.620> start<00:02:12.950> on<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.220> next<00:02:13.459> thing

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
getting a head start on the next thing

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.369 
getting a head start on the next thing
you<00:02:13.700> want<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:13.940> do<00:02:14.120> while<00:02:14.750> something<00:02:15.019> else<00:02:15.230> is

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
you want to do while something else is

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.710 
you want to do while something else is
happening<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.730> reason<00:02:16.970> that's<00:02:17.060> possible

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
happening and the reason that's possible

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.380 
happening and the reason that's possible
like<00:02:18.319> I<00:02:18.410> said<00:02:18.650> before<00:02:18.769> is<00:02:19.250> because<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:20.000> engine

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
like I said before is because the engine

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.250 
like I said before is because the engine
stores<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:21.049> it<00:02:21.500> remembers<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:23.170> motion<00:02:24.170> you

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
stores it it remembers the motion you

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.559 
stores it it remembers the motion you
did<00:02:24.470> beforehand<00:02:25.069> even<00:02:25.610> if<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.760> don't<00:02:25.940> know

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
did beforehand even if you don't know

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.690 
did beforehand even if you don't know
what<00:02:26.750> buffering<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.349> everybody<00:02:28.340> uses

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
what buffering is everybody uses

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.520 
what buffering is everybody uses
buffering<00:02:29.150> whether<00:02:29.660> offensively<00:02:30.410> or

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
buffering whether offensively or

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.740 
buffering whether offensively or
defensively<00:02:31.299> okay<00:02:32.299> I'm<00:02:32.390> gonna<00:02:32.480> show<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.690> the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
defensively okay I'm gonna show you the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.140 
defensively okay I'm gonna show you the
most<00:02:32.780> basic<00:02:33.140> example<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:34.220> buffering<00:02:34.970> and

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
most basic example of buffering and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.600 
most basic example of buffering and
that's<00:02:35.690> using<00:02:35.900> reuse<00:02:36.290> crouching<00:02:36.769> medium<00:02:36.980> kick

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
that's using reuse crouching medium kick

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.930 
that's using reuse crouching medium kick
in<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:38.000> fireball<00:02:38.450> okay<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.739> inputs<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.819> do

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
in the fireball okay so the inputs to do

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.690 
in the fireball okay so the inputs to do
this<00:02:41.090> would<00:02:41.299> be<00:02:41.450> crouching<00:02:42.379> medium<00:02:42.829> kick

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
this would be crouching medium kick

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.850 
this would be crouching medium kick
which<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:44.090> down<00:02:44.480> media<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.049> and<00:02:45.260> then

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
which is down media of it and then

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.110 
which is down media of it and then
fireball<00:02:46.340> which<00:02:46.489> is<00:02:46.670> quarter-circle<00:02:47.090> forward

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
fireball which is quarter-circle forward

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.650 
fireball which is quarter-circle forward
punch<00:02:48.019> now<00:02:49.239> hopefully<00:02:50.239> most<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.569> guys

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
punch now hopefully most of you guys

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.479 
punch now hopefully most of you guys
know<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:50.930> but<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.680> don't<00:02:51.829> have<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.099> just<00:02:52.340> go

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
know this but you don't have to just go

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.000 
know this but you don't have to just go
down<00:02:53.239> me<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.720> kick<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.019> then<00:02:54.110> start<00:02:54.739> down

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
down me and kick and then start down

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.009 
down me and kick and then start down
again<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.519> slide<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.120> punch<00:02:56.390> all<00:02:56.810> you

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
again and slide it the punch all you

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.220 
again and slide it the punch all you
have<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.230> do<00:02:57.379> is<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.829> hold<00:02:58.459> down<00:02:59.049> press<00:03:00.049> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
have to do is just hold down press the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.750 
have to do is just hold down press the
medium<00:03:00.500> kick<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:00.859> then<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:01.250> slide<00:03:01.549> the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
medium kick and then just slide the

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.170 
medium kick and then just slide the
stick<00:03:01.970> forward<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.569> then<00:03:02.930> press<00:03:03.380> punch<00:03:03.620> so

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
stick forward and then press punch so

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.910 
stick forward and then press punch so
like<00:03:05.180> so<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.650> what's<00:03:07.100> happening<00:03:07.549> is<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:08.000> that

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
like so so what's happening is is that

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.620 
like so so what's happening is is that
since<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.040> press<00:03:10.220> down<00:03:10.519> a<00:03:10.549> medium<00:03:11.000> kick<00:03:11.209> the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
since you press down a medium kick the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.180 
since you press down a medium kick the
down<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:12.049> saved<00:03:12.349> it's<00:03:12.590> already<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.040> game

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
down is saved it's already the game

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.580 
down is saved it's already the game
already<00:03:13.400> knows<00:03:13.609> to<00:03:13.730> hit<00:03:13.849> down<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.989> when<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.470> go

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
already knows to hit down so when you go

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.789 
already knows to hit down so when you go
down<00:03:15.620> forward<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.549> then<00:03:17.180> forward<00:03:17.630> punch<00:03:17.959> to

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
down forward and then forward punch to

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.370 
down forward and then forward punch to
say<00:03:18.920> you're<00:03:19.069> sliding<00:03:19.340> it<00:03:19.489> afterwards<00:03:20.380> the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
say you're sliding it afterwards the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.680 
say you're sliding it afterwards the
game<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.650> like<00:03:21.739> okay<00:03:22.099> so<00:03:22.700> he's<00:03:23.060> already<00:03:23.540> hit

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
game is like okay so he's already hit

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.210 
game is like okay so he's already hit
down<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.260> then<00:03:24.410> down<00:03:24.650> forward<00:03:24.950> down<00:03:25.069> for

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
down and then down forward down for

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.009 
down and then down forward down for
punch<00:03:25.489> now<00:03:25.669> he<00:03:25.730> wants<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:25.970> do<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.090> fireball<00:03:26.540> so

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
punch now he wants to do a fireball so

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.890 
punch now he wants to do a fireball so
I'm<00:03:27.169> basically<00:03:27.650> like<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.280> 2/1<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.060> the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
I'm basically like a 2/1 and the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.170 
I'm basically like a 2/1 and the
buffering<00:03:30.319> part<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.799> combo<00:03:31.220> was<00:03:31.430> was

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
buffering part of that combo was was

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.420 
buffering part of that combo was was
during<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.840> animation<00:03:33.500> of<00:03:33.680> Ryu<00:03:34.010> sticking<00:03:34.340> out

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
during the animation of Ryu sticking out

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.009 
during the animation of Ryu sticking out
his<00:03:34.519> foot<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.120> then<00:03:35.269> crushing<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.599> kick<00:03:35.870> I'm

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
his foot and then crushing the kick I'm

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.990 
his foot and then crushing the kick I'm
already<00:03:36.410> slidin<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.280> joystick

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
already slidin the joystick

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.240 
already slidin the joystick
that's<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.630> buffering<00:03:39.049> so<00:03:39.530> I'm<00:03:39.650> buffering

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
that's the buffering so I'm buffering

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.720 
that's the buffering so I'm buffering
the<00:03:40.970> fireball<00:03:41.510> basically<00:03:42.500> um<00:03:42.829> buffering<00:03:43.459> and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
the fireball basically um buffering and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.409 
the fireball basically um buffering and
understanding<00:03:44.389> how<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.660> works<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.169> essential

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
understanding how it works is essential

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.849 
understanding how it works is essential
it<00:03:47.419> basically<00:03:47.900> makes<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.380> input<00:03:48.590> your

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
it basically makes you input your

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.780 
it basically makes you input your
motions<00:03:49.400> much<00:03:50.000> quicker<00:03:50.329> skip<00:03:51.200> steps<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.859> make

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
motions much quicker skip steps and make

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.610 
motions much quicker skip steps and make
your<00:03:52.970> window<00:03:53.299> bigger<00:03:53.569> for<00:03:54.079> executing<00:03:54.530> your

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
your window bigger for executing your

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.270 
your window bigger for executing your
combos

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
combos

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.770 
combos
okay<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:56.090> let<00:03:56.239> me<00:03:56.269> give<00:03:56.419> another<00:03:56.450> quick

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
okay so let me give another quick

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.470 
okay so let me give another quick
example<00:03:56.810> um<00:03:57.470> say<00:03:58.340> when<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.519> go<00:03:58.700> crunch<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.239> medium

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
example um say when I go crunch a medium

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.599 
example um say when I go crunch a medium
kick<00:03:59.660> it<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.810> uppercut<00:04:00.319> with<00:04:00.470> Ryu<00:04:00.680> instead<00:04:01.010> so

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
kick it the uppercut with Ryu instead so

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.610 
kick it the uppercut with Ryu instead so
since<00:04:02.000> we<00:04:02.150> know<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.419> shortcut<00:04:02.930> is<00:04:03.169> down<00:04:03.379> for

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
since we know the shortcut is down for

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.100 
since we know the shortcut is down for
it<00:04:03.680> down<00:04:03.860> for<00:04:04.159> it<00:04:04.250> all<00:04:04.969> I<00:04:05.060> gotta<00:04:05.209> do<00:04:05.420> is<00:04:05.450> go<00:04:05.750> down

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
it down for it all I gotta do is go down

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.539 
it down for it all I gotta do is go down
forward<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.560> kick

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
forward and kick

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.949 
forward and kick
move<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.610> joystick<00:04:08.640> back<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.420> then<00:04:09.599> back<00:04:09.810> to

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
move the joystick back and then back to

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.390 
move the joystick back and then back to
down<00:04:10.110> four<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.680> then<00:04:10.769> press<00:04:10.920> punch<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.370> that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
down four and then press punch and that

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.500 
down four and then press punch and that
uppercut<00:04:11.700> will<00:04:11.909> come<00:04:12.030> out<00:04:12.150> as<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.360> watch<00:04:14.510> so

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
uppercut will come out as a watch so

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.969 
uppercut will come out as a watch so
what<00:04:15.599> I'm<00:04:15.689> doing<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:15.930> I'm<00:04:16.079> buffering<00:04:16.650> once

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
what I'm doing is I'm buffering once

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.189 
what I'm doing is I'm buffering once
again<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.820> joystick<00:04:18.180> down<00:04:18.209> back<00:04:18.630> then<00:04:18.989> down

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
again the joystick down back then down

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.259 
again the joystick down back then down
forward<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.680> punch<00:04:19.889> as<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.370> can<00:04:20.519> see<00:04:20.790> that's

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
forward and punch as you can see that's

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.850 
forward and punch as you can see that's
a<00:04:21.479> lot<00:04:21.600> easier<00:04:21.810> than<00:04:22.109> in<00:04:22.320> putting<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.680> down<00:04:22.800> a

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
a lot easier than in putting it down a

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.320 
a lot easier than in putting it down a
medium<00:04:23.190> picking<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.580> starting<00:04:23.880> from<00:04:24.000> forward

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
medium picking and starting from forward

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.550 
medium picking and starting from forward
and<00:04:24.419> doing<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.660> entire<00:04:24.960> motion<00:04:25.260> of<00:04:25.470> the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
and doing the entire motion of the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.969 
and doing the entire motion of the
uppercut<00:04:26.660> so<00:04:27.660> another<00:04:27.810> common<00:04:28.080> example<00:04:28.350> is

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
uppercut so another common example is

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.240 
uppercut so another common example is
using<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.610> throw<00:04:29.850> Ultra<00:04:30.150> which<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.449> 720<00:04:31.020> or<00:04:31.250> 540

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
using a throw Ultra which is 720 or 540

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.219 
using a throw Ultra which is 720 or 540
fuse<00:04:32.460> in<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.639> shortcut<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.570> just<00:04:33.840> jump

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
fuse in the shortcut and you just jump

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.070 
fuse in the shortcut and you just jump
and<00:04:34.410> do<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:35.000> what<00:04:36.000> I'm<00:04:36.060> doing<00:04:36.300> is<00:04:36.360> I'm<00:04:36.510> offering

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
and do it what I'm doing is I'm offering

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.590 
and do it what I'm doing is I'm offering
motion<00:04:37.860> while<00:04:38.130> in<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.580> air<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.120> as<00:04:39.240> soon<00:04:39.449> as<00:04:39.510> I

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
motion while in the air and as soon as I

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.870 
motion while in the air and as soon as I
land<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:40.199> think<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:41.070> three<00:04:41.280> punches<00:04:41.639> and<00:04:41.789> the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
land I think the three punches and the

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.939 
land I think the three punches and the
ultra<00:04:42.150> comes<00:04:42.330> out<00:04:42.570> people<00:04:43.289> use<00:04:43.530> this<00:04:43.650> all<00:04:43.830> the

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
ultra comes out people use this all the

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.350 
ultra comes out people use this all the
time<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.370> that's<00:04:44.520> just<00:04:44.699> another<00:04:44.880> example<00:04:45.030> of

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
time and that's just another example of

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.210 
time and that's just another example of
buffering<00:04:45.750> it's<00:04:46.199> because<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:46.740> buffering<00:04:47.160> that

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
buffering it's because of buffering that

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.310 
buffering it's because of buffering that
makes<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:48.030> possible<00:04:48.360> for<00:04:48.660> barb<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.169> do<00:04:49.289> a

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
makes it possible for barb to do a

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.710 
makes it possible for barb to do a
headbutt<00:04:49.710> into<00:04:49.919> ultra<00:04:50.340> head<00:04:50.970> but<00:04:51.180> requires<00:04:51.570> a

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
headbutt into ultra head but requires a

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.800 
headbutt into ultra head but requires a
download<00:04:52.139> charge<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:53.250> pop<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.490> punch<00:04:53.880> but<00:04:54.660> the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
download charge to pop a punch but the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.200 
download charge to pop a punch but the
ultra<00:04:55.139> requires<00:04:55.500> you<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.740> do<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.039> downs<00:04:56.370> back

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
ultra requires you to do a downs back

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.870 
ultra requires you to do a downs back
charge<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:57.960> go<00:04:58.620> forward<00:04:59.039> back<00:04:59.520> forward

punches<00:05:00.539> or<00:05:01.110> kicks<00:05:01.139> and<00:05:02.180> what<00:05:03.180> you're<00:05:03.330> doing

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
punches or kicks and what you're doing

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:04.879 
punches or kicks and what you're doing
is<00:05:03.630> just<00:05:03.840> by<00:05:03.960> holding<00:05:04.110> down<00:05:04.289> back<00:05:04.680> you're

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
is just by holding down back you're

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.219 
is just by holding down back you're
buffering<00:05:05.370> both<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:06.000> motions<00:05:06.360> soil<00:05:07.020> for

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
buffering both the motions soil for

buffering both the motions soil for
example<00:05:07.620> to<00:05:08.810> is<00:05:09.810> I'm<00:05:09.960> holding<00:05:10.139> down<00:05:10.320> back<00:05:11.599> I'm

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
example to is I'm holding down back I'm

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.689 
example to is I'm holding down back I'm
just<00:05:12.660> sliding<00:05:13.199> the<00:05:13.440> stick<00:05:13.800> up<00:05:14.070> and<00:05:14.460> pressing

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
just sliding the stick up and pressing

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.760 
just sliding the stick up and pressing
punch<00:05:15.090> but<00:05:15.660> whilst<00:05:15.870> lying<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.199> stick<00:05:16.440> up<00:05:16.590> I'm

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
punch but whilst lying to stick up I'm

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.700 
punch but whilst lying to stick up I'm
holding<00:05:17.070> back<00:05:17.849> still<00:05:18.270> so<00:05:18.539> I'm<00:05:18.630> like<00:05:18.810> grinding

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
holding back still so I'm like grinding

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.930 
holding back still so I'm like grinding
against<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:19.979> edge<00:05:20.130> of<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.490> gate<00:05:20.729> of<00:05:20.849> the

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
against the edge of the gate of the

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.300 
against the edge of the gate of the
stick<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:21.680> because<00:05:22.680> of<00:05:22.710> that<00:05:22.860> I'm<00:05:23.070> still

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
stick and because of that I'm still

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.279 
stick and because of that I'm still
holding<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.699> back<00:05:23.849> charge<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:25.169> game

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
holding the back charge and the game

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.980 
holding the back charge and the game
remembers<00:05:25.710> that<00:05:25.889> and<00:05:26.130> then<00:05:26.820> I<00:05:27.060> just<00:05:27.360> go<00:05:27.720> for

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
remembers that and then I just go for

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.570 
remembers that and then I just go for
back<00:05:28.169> four<00:05:28.410> then<00:05:28.680> three<00:05:28.860> punches<00:05:29.280> of<00:05:29.430> three

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
back four then three punches of three

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.670 
back four then three punches of three
kicks<00:05:29.870> okay<00:05:30.870> so<00:05:30.930> I'm<00:05:31.080> not<00:05:31.139> gonna<00:05:31.289> go<00:05:31.440> through<00:05:31.590> a

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
kicks okay so I'm not gonna go through a

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.800 
kicks okay so I'm not gonna go through a
bunch<00:05:31.830> of<00:05:32.010> bullet<00:05:32.310> point<00:05:32.490> examples<00:05:32.970> using<00:05:33.539> all

the different motions in the game and
how<00:05:35.639> you<00:05:35.820> can<00:05:35.940> use<00:05:36.120> probably<00:05:36.510> when<00:05:36.930> you're
