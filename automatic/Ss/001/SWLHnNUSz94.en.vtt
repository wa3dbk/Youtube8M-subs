00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
the back of them and here is the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.969 
the back of them and here is the
Forbidden<00:01:52.409> Forest<00:01:52.439> or<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:53.810> my<00:01:54.810> own<00:01:55.110> joke<00:01:55.560> that

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
Forbidden Forest or as my own joke that

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.609 
Forbidden Forest or as my own joke that
I<00:01:56.100> made<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.700> forbidden<00:01:57.180> tree<00:01:57.619> so

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
I made up the forbidden tree so

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.760 
I made up the forbidden tree so
basically<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.610> box<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.630> haven't<00:02:01.409> read<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
basically on the box I haven't read the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.740 
basically on the box I haven't read the
books<00:02:02.009> or<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.490> movie<00:02:02.759> has<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.969> come<00:02:03.119> yet<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
books or the movie has it come yet so I

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.679 
books or the movie has it come yet so I
guess<00:02:04.320> Hagrid's<00:02:04.860> blocked<00:02:05.159> by<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.430> blue<00:02:06.329> fire

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
guess Hagrid's blocked by this blue fire

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.589 
guess Hagrid's blocked by this blue fire
so<00:02:07.200> that's<00:02:07.439> what's<00:02:07.649> shown<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.099> box<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:09.450> it

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
so that's what's shown on the box and it

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.660 
so that's what's shown on the box and it
also<00:02:09.750> has<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.229> feature<00:02:10.500> where<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.009> flings<00:02:11.400> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
also has this feature where it flings a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.760 
also has this feature where it flings a
minifigure

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.930
