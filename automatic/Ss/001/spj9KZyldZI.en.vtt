00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
on some of the other things that they

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.940 
on some of the other things that they
might<00:01:19.420> not<00:01:19.659> know<00:01:19.840> about<00:01:19.990> that<00:01:20.350> could<00:01:20.560> be<00:01:20.710> cool

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
weapon in destiny he said that players

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.679 
weapon in destiny he said that players
will<00:02:09.039> have<00:02:09.159> to<00:02:09.310> go<00:02:09.429> on<00:02:09.549> a<00:02:09.580> journey<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.179> get<00:02:10.539> it
