00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 there are very good and we need in a new 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.540
 test this time it touches which character of 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.090
 inazuma raise air 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.099
 I told you guys that I was going to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.379
 upload another test and here you have it 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.730
 has azuma obviously yes this 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.830
 which is a test that has to do a lot 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 with my channel because we have previously 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.710
 been apart from doing test of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.090
 pokemon that has a lot to do with me 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.830
 channel because he sees my pokemon channel 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.119
 et cetera etcetera but we have also 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.529
 been doing tests of another type that 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.900
 you do not have to see anything in my channel like 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.120
 is the digimon test and another type of 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.530
 test so this time we get the dim 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.910
 blue eleven that has to do a lot 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.940
 with my channel because I'm also 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 doing a series of inazuma eleven 2 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.930
 fire storm so come here 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.579
 this one could not miss and this one sure 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.530
 that amuses you and mola mogollón 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.420
 you will have the test in the description for 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.730
 that you do it at the same time that I see 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.579
 It's the character that touches you because 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.610
 I'm sure it's up to me what a cloth 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.050
 As I touch a bad one, he's going to screw me 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.510
 everything that was coming because I am a 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.579
 princess I have to be the best 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.949
 the best forwards of inazuma eleven 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.020
 I hope that I touch one of the best 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.659
 You guys can also put me in the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.799
 the comments is that you want me to do 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.360
 you can put it in the comments 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.130
 you can say but you can do this test 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.840
 that is pretty cool I will look at 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.520
 see how it is and you can also say 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.590
 which is the one that has touched you 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.069
 in the comments he has also sent me 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.509
 blasco a test of another type of other 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.369
 game that is super cool that 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.630
 possibly be the next one so 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.340
 blasco I want to say from here that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.960
 thanks for that test and that possibly 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.039
 do it in the next video if you want 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.619
 let's start 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.299
 first question there are seven questions not 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.590
 I know how this test will be but not 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.689
 I found a better one because it's 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.520
 I was quite looking from this guy 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.860
 and it is that there are not very good tests because 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.869
 most are erased over time or they 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.759
 they eliminate you do not notice unity because but 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.349
 the best tests are eliminated and they are 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.149
 those that are being a little worse but 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:52.829
 this seems to me that it looks good 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.989
 let's try to do it come what 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.450
 color you liked more the russian the red the 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:59.189
 blue and the sea obviously the blue and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.929
 you know that I have said many times that 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.880
 my favorite color is blue and it's 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.640
 just one of my favorite pokemon 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.610
 sky over that is blue or that everything 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.130
 It has a harmony and harmony 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.850
 what do you like most in a question all 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:19.140
 the mountain the ice the fire the wind 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.060
 I like ice and fire 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.510
 the ice and the fire I'm cool but it's cool 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.560
 more the sky I'm more ice 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.390
 Although I like fire a lot because 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.459
 there are fire anime characters that I 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.100
 I really like how Nazi can be 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.900
 fairytale and there is even a monde of 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.670
 Digimon Etcetera Etcetera and Characters 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.260
 of fire that I like very much in 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.300
 digimon's box office is also whose 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.490
 camera etcetera etcetera but ice 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.220
 I really like the ice itself no no 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.709
 by characters but yes in the skill 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.980
 per se 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.060
 he's a good boy i 'm going to look at him what a 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.080
 momentito to see if see it is a 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.030
 wobble boy so boy 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.220
 you like the poetry fit and if I like it 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.980
 football these questions are a bit 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.349
 obvious no 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.299
 this is doing a little bit fast and 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.250
 I'm not liking um but I thought it's going 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.870
 to be more interesting this test but 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.879
 well we'll see to see are not 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.819
 questions are not bad but they are a 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.950
 little bit brief are short and very direct 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.930
 the questions but test itself is not bad 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.760
 it's not bad that super technique you like 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.590
 more landscape side all mirages of 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.590
 fire storm ball magical hand 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.500
 I like all of them but all of them 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.970
 the illusion of 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.130
 value I do not like so much but all the 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.130
 I like others so I'm going to give all 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.260
 to work what occupation do you like the most? 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.810
 midfielder forward goalie defense 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.200
 Guarín Animator 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.680
 I am animator 00 is the best 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.160
 no one can and no one will be able to tell you 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.130
 that nobody can obviously with me obviously 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.430
 and all this is my karma today I am going to 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.430
 see water 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.720
 that has been the karma all that has to 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.880
 have if the crimson if I like the 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.190
 front post although I'm not bad 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.900
 midfielder but not midfielder 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.670
 pure more advanced of the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.460
 midfielders and a midfielder 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.500
 attacker what is called today 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.880
 playmaker who is neither forward nor 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.340
 midfielders but he's between 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.410
 stockings of both positions of the front 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.510
 and the midfielder but good if it is 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.200
 by choosing I like more forward and 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.470
 I have always been a mediapunta or extreme 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.340
 so last question what character do you 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.040
 like more 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.170
 axel nelly sound marc this what I do not 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.540
 like the tests that ask you names and 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.250
 according to the name you say possibly 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.080
 you get that character like the 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.820
 super technique told me how is this and 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.010
 the other sure yes she said one I get 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.150
 your character this is what I do not like 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.640
 of the tests this is what they do 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.140
 you mediocre but anyway not 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.450
 it's not wrong I guess it's because you 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.610
 have fun with a laugh and everything is 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.440
 exhibit a credit of these characters I 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.510
 like more sound 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.390
 although I like Celtic a lot but 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.090
 obviously sound on the ice so 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.780
 come if you touch me even if happy and 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.910
 happy with 23 you are shaun frost 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.020
 18 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:21.560
 from 16 up I'm like that 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:24.680
 I am a clx I am the law and obviously I am 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.120
 five options come loquito pin only 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.830
 there were five options for characters 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.840
 valuable this is what I do not like 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.720
 There were very few options to choose from 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.550
 the questions were brief and apart from 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.440
 short and they were few and above the 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.030
 answers that gave you to be a 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.830
 character instead of giving you the whole team 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.930
 of inazuma or give you at least ten 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.229
 players from different teams that 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.940
 they all gave the same equipment and over 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.039
 only five that surely were going to 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.360
 leave depending on the super technique 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.159
 that you liked more or the character you 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.099
 most liked has left me 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:56.810
 axel against all odds but that has 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.460
 been because I have not chosen the landscape 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.710
 side if I choose icy landscape 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.169
 possibly I would have left shaun 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.030
 frost that is my favorite character among 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.949
 the five that were here but good I am 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.870
 us airways the damn game forward 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.240
 be never less a princess or the 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.009
 princess or fire so good guys 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.479

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.129

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.539
 series in a way that I'm doing and 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.280
