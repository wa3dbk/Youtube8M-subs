all<00:00:00.120> right<00:00:00.630> here's<00:00:00.960> another<00:00:01.020> quick<00:00:01.439> video

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
all right here's another quick video

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.290 
all right here's another quick video
looking<00:00:02.129> at<00:00:02.220> some<00:00:02.370> new<00:00:02.460> technology<00:00:03.090> I

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
looking at some new technology I

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.970 
looking at some new technology I
recently<00:00:03.659> picked<00:00:03.959> up<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.230> new<00:00:04.350> MacBook<00:00:04.740> Pro

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
recently picked up a new MacBook Pro

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.740 
recently picked up a new MacBook Pro
Retina<00:00:05.339> display<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.089> was<00:00:06.210> excited<00:00:06.540> about

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
Retina display and I was excited about

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.690 
Retina display and I was excited about
the<00:00:07.020> Thunderbolt<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.950> heard<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.580> was<00:00:08.670> really

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
the Thunderbolt I heard it was really

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.730 
the Thunderbolt I heard it was really
really<00:00:09.570> fast<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.230> picked<00:00:10.500> up<00:00:10.590> another

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
really fast so I picked up another

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.919 
really fast so I picked up another
Seagate<00:00:11.490> gold<00:00:11.759> flex<00:00:12.000> drive<00:00:12.269> but<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.690> one<00:00:12.840> had

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
Seagate gold flex drive but this one had

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.360 
Seagate gold flex drive but this one had
a<00:00:12.990> thunderbolt<00:00:13.440> connection<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.219> could

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
a thunderbolt connection that I could

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.010 
a thunderbolt connection that I could
use<00:00:14.549> with<00:00:14.670> all<00:00:14.820> my<00:00:14.940> other<00:00:14.969> Seagate<00:00:15.570> go<00:00:15.750> flex

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
use with all my other Seagate go flex

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.810 
use with all my other Seagate go flex
drives<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.770> neither<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.190> my<00:00:17.220> go<00:00:17.430> flex<00:00:17.640> drives

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
drives but neither of my go flex drives

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.300 
drives but neither of my go flex drives
had<00:00:18.029> an<00:00:18.150> SSD<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.810> replaced<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.010> hard

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
had an SSD so I replaced one of the hard

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.310 
had an SSD so I replaced one of the hard
drives<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.240> an<00:00:21.359> SSD<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.170> bought

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
drives in it with an SSD that I bought

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.779 
drives in it with an SSD that I bought
from<00:00:22.500> Kingston<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.760> v+<00:00:24.269> 200<00:00:24.869> version<00:00:25.260> 3<00:00:25.949> SSD

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
from Kingston the v+ 200 version 3 SSD

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.419 
from Kingston the v+ 200 version 3 SSD
drive<00:00:27.000> let's<00:00:27.720> get<00:00:27.900> started<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.980> quickest

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
drive let's get started the quickest

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.279 
drive let's get started the quickest
tool<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> could<00:00:29.699> find<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.539> testing<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> drive

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
tool I could find for testing the drive

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.350 
tool I could find for testing the drive
speed<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.800> black<00:00:32.099> magic<00:00:32.640> disk<00:00:32.969> speed

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
speed was the black magic disk speed

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.870 
speed was the black magic disk speed
test<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> App<00:00:34.050> Store<00:00:34.399> and<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.489> found<00:00:35.730> some

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
test in the App Store and I found some

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.430 
test in the App Store and I found some
pretty<00:00:35.969> interesting<00:00:36.390> results

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
pretty interesting results

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.990 
pretty interesting results
so<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.070> first<00:00:39.220> one<00:00:39.340> we're<00:00:39.430> going<00:00:39.520> to<00:00:39.610> test<00:00:39.790> is

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
so the first one we're going to test is

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.080 
so the first one we're going to test is
the<00:00:40.210> thunderbolt<00:00:40.930> connection<00:00:41.200> with<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.400> hard

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
the thunderbolt connection with the hard

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.710 
the thunderbolt connection with the hard
disk<00:00:43.330> drive<00:00:43.450> at<00:00:43.930> 5400<00:00:44.860> rpm<00:00:45.340> s<00:00:45.610> as<00:00:46.210> you<00:00:46.270> can<00:00:46.510> see

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
disk drive at 5400 rpm s as you can see

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.110 
disk drive at 5400 rpm s as you can see
the<00:00:46.930> right<00:00:47.170> speed<00:00:47.560> is<00:00:47.740> hovering<00:00:48.580> around<00:00:48.730> the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
the right speed is hovering around the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.080 
the right speed is hovering around the
ninety<00:00:49.600> five<00:00:49.810> megabits<00:00:50.800> a<00:00:50.950> second<00:00:51.280> mark

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
ninety five megabits a second mark

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.730 
ninety five megabits a second mark
whereas<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.570> read<00:00:52.840> speed<00:00:53.260> is<00:00:53.470> about<00:00:53.710> a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
whereas the read speed is about a

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.160 
whereas the read speed is about a
hundred<00:00:54.070> and<00:00:54.400> six<00:00:55.090> or<00:00:55.330> so<00:00:55.570> what's<00:00:56.020> interesting

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
hundred and six or so what's interesting

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.380 
hundred and six or so what's interesting
here<00:00:56.620> is<00:00:56.739> that<00:00:56.770> Seagate<00:00:57.520> shipped<00:00:57.940> the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
here is that Seagate shipped the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.460 
here is that Seagate shipped the
thunderbolt<00:00:59.170> drive<00:01:00.060> with<00:01:01.060> a<00:01:01.090> 5400<00:01:01.960> rpm<00:01:02.320> hard

thunderbolt drive with a 5400 rpm hard

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.500 
thunderbolt drive with a 5400 rpm hard
drive<00:01:02.560> I<00:01:02.950> would<00:01:03.160> have<00:01:03.280> opted<00:01:03.550> for<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.820> 7200

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
drive I would have opted for the 7200

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.740 
drive I would have opted for the 7200
rpm<00:01:04.870> but<00:01:05.170> there<00:01:05.710> you<00:01:05.800> have<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:07.390> next<00:01:07.510> one

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
rpm but there you have it the next one

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.570 
rpm but there you have it the next one
you<00:01:07.840> have<00:01:08.020> is<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.500> thunderbolt<00:01:09.130> connection

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
you have is the thunderbolt connection

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.000 
you have is the thunderbolt connection
with<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.970> SSD<00:01:10.479> drive<00:01:10.960> i<00:01:11.229> had<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.500> rig<00:01:11.680> this<00:01:11.800> one

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
with the SSD drive i had to rig this one

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.690 
with the SSD drive i had to rig this one
myself

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
myself

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.640 
myself
I<00:01:12.729> like<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.090> go<00:01:13.210> Flex<00:01:13.479> adapters<00:01:13.930> that<00:01:14.380> gives

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
I like the go Flex adapters that gives

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.280 
I like the go Flex adapters that gives
me<00:01:14.740> flexibility<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.430> use<00:01:15.520> firewire<00:01:16.030> USB<00:01:16.540> USB<00:01:16.750> 3

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
me flexibility to use firewire USB USB 3

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.710 
me flexibility to use firewire USB USB 3
or<00:01:17.560> Thunderbolt<00:01:18.130> here<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:18.910> have<00:01:19.060> it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
or Thunderbolt here you have it

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.580 
or Thunderbolt here you have it
topping<00:01:20.170> out<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.320> 200<00:01:21.130> but<00:01:21.670> averaging<00:01:22.270> about

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
topping out a 200 but averaging about

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.090 
topping out a 200 but averaging about
150<00:01:23.590> or<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.759> read<00:01:25.000> speed<00:01:25.360> is<00:01:25.540> about<00:01:26.100> 175

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
150 or so the read speed is about 175

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.140 
150 or so the read speed is about 175
180<00:01:27.700> pretty<00:01:28.420> good<00:01:29.009> next<00:01:30.009> up<00:01:30.160> is<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.580> firewire

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
180 pretty good next up is the firewire

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.290 
180 pretty good next up is the firewire

800 connection the hard disk drive at
5400<00:01:35.020> rpm<00:01:35.410> a<00:01:36.280> pretty<00:01:36.820> sluggish<00:01:37.090> at<00:01:37.390> around<00:01:37.770> 47

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
5400 rpm a pretty sluggish at around 47

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.279 
5400 rpm a pretty sluggish at around 47
or<00:01:39.070> so<00:01:39.340> right<00:01:39.610> speed<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.300> only<00:01:40.930> at<00:01:41.020> about<00:01:41.140> 31

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
or so right speed and only at about 31

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.469 
or so right speed and only at about 31

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
sure if that has something to do with it

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.570 
sure if that has something to do with it

much change at all read speed 38.2 tells
me<00:03:01.299> that<00:03:02.069> USB<00:03:03.120> 2.0<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.299> probably<00:03:04.870> topping<00:03:05.290> out

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
me that USB 2.0 is probably topping out

me that USB 2.0 is probably topping out
about<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.220> has<00:03:06.730> little<00:03:06.970> effect<00:03:07.299> on<00:03:07.420> what

about that and has little effect on what

about that and has little effect on what
kind<00:03:08.049> of<00:03:08.230> drive<00:03:09.129> you're<00:03:09.340> using<00:03:09.670> flash<00:03:10.000> or<00:03:10.299> hard
