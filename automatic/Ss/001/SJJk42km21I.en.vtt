the<00:00:27.790> flood<00:00:28.029> quite<00:00:28.750> a<00:00:28.779> bit<00:00:28.930> differently<00:00:29.230> in

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
the flood quite a bit differently in

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.080 
the flood quite a bit differently in
this<00:00:29.890> level<00:00:30.160> than<00:00:30.279> I<00:00:30.369> did<00:00:30.670> on<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.060> previous

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
this level than I did on the previous

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.180 
this level than I did on the previous
level<00:00:31.690> where<00:00:31.930> I<00:00:31.990> just<00:00:32.169> ran<00:00:32.440> right<00:00:32.470> past<00:00:32.770> them

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
level where I just ran right past them

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.479 
level where I just ran right past them
oh<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:35.140> time<00:00:35.470> I've<00:00:35.920> found<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.309> best

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
oh this time I've found the best

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.580 
oh this time I've found the best
strategy<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:36.879> to<00:00:37.000> kill<00:00:37.510> every<00:00:37.960> single<00:00:37.989> flood

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
strategy is to kill every single flood

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.500 
strategy is to kill every single flood
along<00:00:39.220> the<00:00:39.370> way<00:00:39.519> because<00:00:40.030> there's<00:00:40.210> plenty<00:00:40.480> of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
along the way because there's plenty of

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.930 
along the way because there's plenty of
ammo<00:00:40.870> plenty<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.650> really<00:00:42.129> good<00:00:42.280> weapons<00:00:42.670> to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
ammo plenty of really good weapons to

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.900 
ammo plenty of really good weapons to
take<00:00:43.210> them<00:00:43.330> out<00:00:43.449> with<00:00:45.449> and<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:48.370> just<00:00:48.700> take

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
take them out with and just just take

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.220 
take them out with and just just take
your<00:00:49.059> time<00:00:49.120> and<00:00:49.329> make<00:00:49.570> sure<00:00:49.660> that<00:00:49.840> they<00:00:50.140> don't

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
your time and make sure that they don't

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.560 
your time and make sure that they don't
start<00:00:50.500> spawning<00:00:50.770> behind<00:00:51.130> you<00:00:51.280> I<00:00:51.480> usually<00:00:52.480> run

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
start spawning behind you I usually run

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.080 
start spawning behind you I usually run
off<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.899> left<00:00:53.110> over<00:00:53.379> here<00:00:53.559> first<00:00:54.190> for<00:00:55.000> a

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
off to the left over here first for a

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.330 
off to the left over here first for a
couple<00:00:55.300> reasons<00:00:55.329> a<00:00:56.079> lot<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.649> them<00:00:56.739> spawn<00:00:57.100> over

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
couple reasons a lot of them spawn over

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.639 
couple reasons a lot of them spawn over
here<00:00:57.520> and<00:00:58.270> if<00:00:58.629> you<00:00:58.840> don't<00:01:00.239> kill<00:01:01.239> them<00:01:01.480> if<00:01:02.350> you

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
here and if you don't kill them if you

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:03.600 
here and if you don't kill them if you
don't<00:01:02.680> run<00:01:02.920> over<00:01:02.950> here<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.340> kill<00:01:03.489> them

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
don't run over here and kill them

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.920 
don't run over here and kill them
they'll<00:01:03.760> probably<00:01:04.000> start<00:01:04.330> sneaking<00:01:04.660> up

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
they'll probably start sneaking up

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.469 
they'll probably start sneaking up
behind<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:05.410> later<00:01:05.649> in<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:05.890> level<00:01:06.180> also<00:01:07.180> there

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
behind you later in the level also there

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.650 
behind you later in the level also there
is<00:01:07.509> a<00:01:08.080> lot<00:01:08.979> of<00:01:09.009> rocket<00:01:09.460> launch<00:01:09.759> your<00:01:09.910> ammo<00:01:10.180> over

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
is a lot of rocket launch your ammo over

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.389 
is a lot of rocket launch your ammo over
here<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:11.500> is<00:01:13.320> obviously<00:01:14.320> very<00:01:14.410> effective<00:01:15.100> at

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
here that is obviously very effective at

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.580 
here that is obviously very effective at
killing<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.850> flood

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.840 

so<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.620> just<00:01:20.890> used<00:01:21.040> on<00:01:21.190> my<00:01:21.250> rocket<00:01:21.550> launcher

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
so I just used on my rocket launcher

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.550 
so I just used on my rocket launcher
animal<00:01:22.120> first<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.810> then<00:01:22.900> I<00:01:22.930> go<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.140> my<00:01:23.320> hammer

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
animal first and then I go to my hammer

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.610 
animal first and then I go to my hammer
I<00:01:25.590> also<00:01:26.590> use<00:01:26.800> grenades<00:01:26.980> a<00:01:27.520> lot<00:01:27.880> any<00:01:28.450> any<00:01:29.440> sort

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
I also use grenades a lot any any sort

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.660 
I also use grenades a lot any any sort
of<00:01:29.680> explosive<00:01:29.980> gun<00:01:30.310> is<00:01:30.460> really<00:01:30.910> effective<00:01:32.670> at

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
of explosive gun is really effective at

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.610 
of explosive gun is really effective at
killing<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.270> flood<00:01:36.690> also<00:01:37.690> using<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.110> butt

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
killing the flood also using the butt

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.240 
killing the flood also using the butt
end<00:01:38.830> of<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.040> hammer<00:01:40.470> takes<00:01:41.470> out<00:01:41.650> the<00:01:41.680> flood

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
end of the hammer takes out the flood

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.740 
end of the hammer takes out the flood
very<00:01:42.490> nicely<00:01:43.830> if<00:01:44.830> it<00:01:45.700> plugs<00:01:46.030> like<00:01:46.210> right<00:01:46.510> next

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
very nicely if it plugs like right next

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.010 
very nicely if it plugs like right next
to<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.100> pressing<00:01:48.100> B<00:01:48.750> instead<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.840> pressing

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
to you pressing B instead of pressing

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.380 
to you pressing B instead of pressing
right<00:01:50.290> sugar<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:52.390> melees<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.259> flood<00:01:53.470> with

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
right sugar just melees the flood with

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.820 
right sugar just melees the flood with
with<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.420> butt<00:01:55.690> of<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.840> hammer<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.259> doesn't

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
with the butt of the hammer and doesn't

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.740 
with the butt of the hammer and doesn't
use<00:01:56.920> any<00:01:57.040> ammo<00:01:59.820> alright<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:01.119> actually<00:02:01.420> save

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
use any ammo alright I actually save

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.240 
use any ammo alright I actually save
pressing<00:02:02.229> right<00:02:02.380> sugar<00:02:02.619> for<00:02:02.890> when<00:02:03.009> there's<00:02:03.160> a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
pressing right sugar for when there's a

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.550 
pressing right sugar for when there's a
group<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.610> flood<00:02:03.880> it's<00:02:04.450> much<00:02:04.990> more<00:02:05.170> effective

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
group of flood it's much more effective

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.480 
group of flood it's much more effective
at<00:02:05.650> taking<00:02:05.950> out<00:02:06.810> multiple<00:02:08.040> multiple<00:02:09.040> enemies
