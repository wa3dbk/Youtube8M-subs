 cooperation with these fans and endo is 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.550
 just the idea arose here the fan 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.590
 traders because the events 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.080
 I experienced in these fans before 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.580
 there was namely announce that 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.519
 a trailer should be turned 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.230
 and it's one has an application phase 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.469
 took place and where I am 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.469
 advertised 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.989
 we have fully considered which 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.120
 topics can be implemented well and which ones 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.739
 themes the moel fans especially 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.569
 have looked at who can do what 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.609
 who has his score where what 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:52.929
 are the possibilities here and have 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.640
 Spent a few hours now 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.510
 to put it all together and 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.429
 abzufilmen 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.659
 The beer is, so to speak, a trailer 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.120
 from fans for fans 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:04.780
 both editions act in one 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.460
 region and at pokémon black 2 and 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.840
 while it is true that it is true that 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.399
 edition two years after the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.259
 Events of the first two games 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.240
 Play poker wood is now one 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.240
 completely new area in with a 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.119
 movie studio and cinema where you are now 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.700
 can rotate a variety of films and what 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.680
 Of course, it must be unconditional 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.390
 different because that is not now 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.250
 I think the most beautiful feature ever 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.630
 what have now built him with him 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.079
 nine medals now introduced 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.680
 been 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.170
 you can do a lot 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.910
 do different tasks and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.400
 gets a reward for it you can 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.130
 for example, many pokémon a day 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.570
 catch and then you get just that 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.700
 a special medal that too 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.040
 it features many new cities 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.660
 Added many new places and it 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.440
 in fact, there are many new things 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.880
 explore 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.650
 but I do not want too much now 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.540
 especially anticipate so in the 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.550
 story there were many things that 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.470
 have changed as such show 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.260
 that pokémon virtual agent because I too 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.920
 like to fight yourself and accordingly 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.149
 it is such a competitive feature again 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.209
 and now with this new one 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.229
 possibility of the trainer data of 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.910
 world championship participants 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.860
 to download sometimes against the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.440
 world championship participants though 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.790
 not to play live 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.890
 Accordingly, it is a very cool 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.050
 feature the game was definitely still 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.680
 pokémon black is further improved 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.480
 professional white 2 offer an incredible amount 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.209
 content so you can see mine 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.230
 certainly 300 400 hours with this 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.690
 spend a game 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.400
 pokemon 12 and perfectly black 2 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.290
 many features also contain these 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.920
 players will not be back soon 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.080
 let go 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.090
 no matter if you research group and play 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.739

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.750
 taken to a whole new level 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.580
 by adding so much new 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.630

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.630
 These are just things the mat 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.910
 should go 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.440
