hi<00:00:00.630> guys<00:00:01.100> I'm<00:00:02.100> just<00:00:02.370> thinking<00:00:03.120> about<00:00:03.440> this

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
hi guys I'm just thinking about this

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.820 
hi guys I'm just thinking about this
biplane<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.580> want<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.150> make<00:00:07.250> to<00:00:08.250> use<00:00:08.940> the

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
biplane I want to make to use the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.609 
biplane I want to make to use the
variable<00:00:10.830> thrust<00:00:12.469> twin<00:00:13.469> motors<00:00:14.210> from<00:00:15.210> nuts

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
variable thrust twin motors from nuts

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.080 
variable thrust twin motors from nuts

remote controlled helicopter sketching a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.450 
remote controlled helicopter sketching a
couple<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.310> ideas<00:00:23.789> they're<00:00:25.340> looking<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.490> using

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
couple of ideas they're looking at using

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.100 
couple of ideas they're looking at using
styrofoam<00:00:29.460> plates<00:00:30.949> these<00:00:31.949> are<00:00:32.130> bits<00:00:32.279> of

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
styrofoam plates these are bits of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.630 
styrofoam plates these are bits of
styrofoam<00:00:34.130> basis<00:00:35.130> from<00:00:35.690> pizzas<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:38.460> that's

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
styrofoam basis from pizzas so that's

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.240 
styrofoam basis from pizzas so that's
the<00:00:38.790> sort<00:00:39.000> stuff<00:00:39.180> I'm<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.510> work<00:00:39.629> with

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
the sort stuff I'm going to work with

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.819 
the sort stuff I'm going to work with
but<00:00:41.250> I'm<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> build<00:00:42.239> video

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
but I'm not going to do a build video

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.700 
but I'm not going to do a build video
I'm<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:44.070> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.960> toy<00:00:45.960> around<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
I'm just going to toy around with it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.139 
I'm just going to toy around with it
till<00:00:46.829> I've<00:00:46.950> got<00:00:47.100> something<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.579> together<00:00:47.789> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
till I've got something up together and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.250 
till I've got something up together and
then<00:00:48.660> we'll<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> flies<00:00:50.870> we're<00:00:51.870> moving

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
then we'll see if it flies we're moving

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:02.450 
then we'll see if it flies we're moving
ahead

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.250 

getting<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.240> bit<00:01:03.420> closer<00:01:05.300> just<00:01:06.300> been<00:01:06.570> testing

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
getting a bit closer just been testing

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.090 
getting a bit closer just been testing
it<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.710> central<00:01:08.430> gravity<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.120> motors

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
it for central gravity with the motors

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.660 
it for central gravity with the motors
and<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> receiver<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:12.330> position<00:01:13.400> still<00:01:14.400> just

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and the receiver in position still just

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
and the receiver in position still just
a<00:01:14.730> bit<00:01:14.910> tail<00:01:15.270> heavy<00:01:17.810> it's<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:18.900> far<00:01:19.320> off

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
a bit tail heavy it's not far off

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.430 
a bit tail heavy it's not far off
actually<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:20.869> need<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.900> extend<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.560> wires<00:01:22.770> now

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
actually I need to extend the wires now

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.920 
actually I need to extend the wires now
so<00:01:25.440> need<00:01:26.340> some<00:01:26.520> pretty<00:01:26.670> thin<00:01:27.030> wire<00:01:29.690> got<00:01:30.690> an<00:01:30.780> old

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
so need some pretty thin wire got an old

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.359 
so need some pretty thin wire got an old
USB<00:01:31.560> cable<00:01:32.070> here<00:01:32.400> I'll<00:01:32.670> strip<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.300> wires<00:01:33.510> out

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
USB cable here I'll strip the wires out

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.359 
USB cable here I'll strip the wires out
and<00:01:35.369> use<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:37.340> with<00:01:38.340> extended<00:01:38.970> order<00:01:39.210> wires

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
and use them with extended order wires

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.109 
and use them with extended order wires
now<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.430> put<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.729> all<00:01:41.850> together<00:01:43.250> lot<00:01:44.250> together

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.219 

ready<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> test<00:01:48.720> flight<00:01:50.690> well<00:01:51.690> we<00:01:51.990> may<00:01:52.200> have

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
ready for a test flight well we may have

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.219 
ready for a test flight well we may have
a<00:01:52.350> problem<00:01:55.820> I've<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.060> done<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> power<00:01:57.509> test<00:01:57.960> on

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
a problem I've just done a power test on

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.680 
a problem I've just done a power test on
it<00:01:59.600> and<00:02:01.580> at<00:02:02.580> full<00:02:02.789> power<00:02:03.030> one<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.539> the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
it and at full power one of the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:16.520 
it and at full power one of the
propellers<00:02:04.140> came<00:02:04.380> off

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.780 

I've<00:02:17.530> stuck<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.950> back<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.250> again

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
I've stuck it back on again

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.220 
I've stuck it back on again
and<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:19.870> staying<00:02:20.230> there<00:02:20.560> at<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.800> moment<00:02:22.230> so

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
and it's staying there at the moment so

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.110 
and it's staying there at the moment so
we'll<00:02:23.739> give<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.040> little<00:02:24.160> test<00:02:24.519> fly<00:02:24.879> in<00:02:24.940> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
we'll give it a little test fly in the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.949 
we'll give it a little test fly in the
garden<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:25.569> see<00:02:25.930> what<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.170> glide<00:02:26.440> is<00:02:26.709> like

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
garden just see what the glide is like

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.009 
garden just see what the glide is like
this<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.140> just<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.440> glide<00:02:29.739> test<00:02:30.750> see<00:02:31.750> what<00:02:31.900> the

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
this is just a glide test see what the

00:02:32.019 --> 00:04:16.030 
this is just a glide test see what the
trim<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.410> like

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.280 

looks<00:04:16.639> like<00:04:16.790> it<00:04:16.910> could<00:04:17.060> do<00:04:17.180> with<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.389> tiny<00:04:18.169> bit

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
looks like it could do with a tiny bit

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.610 
looks like it could do with a tiny bit
more<00:04:18.590> down<00:04:18.980> elevator<00:04:19.850> or<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:20.870> little<00:04:21.260> bit<00:04:21.380> more

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
more down elevator or a little bit more

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.730 
more down elevator or a little bit more
weight<00:04:21.829> on<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:22.130> front<00:04:23.470> but<00:04:24.470> I'm<00:04:24.560> actually

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
weight on the front but I'm actually

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.490 
weight on the front but I'm actually
quite<00:04:25.160> happy<00:04:25.220> with<00:04:25.700> that<00:04:26.050> because<00:04:27.050> it's<00:04:27.320> not

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
quite happy with that because it's not

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.420 
quite happy with that because it's not
going<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.740> fly<00:04:27.980> away<00:04:28.130> too<00:04:28.340> far<00:04:29.919> because<00:04:30.919> it<00:04:31.280> did

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
going to fly away too far because it did

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
going to fly away too far because it did
occur<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:31.760> me<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.389> when<00:04:32.930> I<00:04:32.960> cut<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.410> engines

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
occur to me that when I cut the engines

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.370 
occur to me that when I cut the engines
there's<00:04:35.450> nothing<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.900> stop<00:04:36.169> it

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
there's nothing to stop it

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.550 
there's nothing to stop it
catching<00:04:36.919> a<00:04:37.010> thermal<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.610> just<00:04:37.760> flying<00:04:38.120> away

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
catching a thermal and just flying away

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.460 
catching a thermal and just flying away
so<00:04:39.560> I'd<00:04:39.680> rather<00:04:40.010> that<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:40.780> came<00:04:41.780> down

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.290 

relatively<00:04:45.470> quickly<00:04:45.710> at<00:04:46.220> least<00:04:46.490> for<00:04:46.790> initial

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
relatively quickly at least for initial

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.390 
relatively quickly at least for initial
tests<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.580> next<00:04:49.760> question<00:04:50.180> is<00:04:50.360> do<00:04:50.810> we<00:04:50.930> dare

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
tests so the next question is do we dare

00:04:51.400 --> 00:05:33.780 
tests so the next question is do we dare
try<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.430> powered<00:04:52.940> flight<00:04:53.560> in<00:04:54.560> my<00:04:54.889> garden

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:54.520 

that<00:05:34.790> looks<00:05:34.970> promising<00:05:53.290> anything<00:05:54.290> that

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
that looks promising anything that

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.020 
that looks promising anything that
worries<00:05:54.830> me<00:05:54.860> a<00:05:55.040> bit<00:05:55.220> is<00:05:55.340> it<00:05:55.460> doesn't<00:05:55.790> stop
