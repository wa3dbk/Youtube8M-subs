back to this gun it is a hybrid is in

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.569 
back to this gun it is a hybrid is in
between<00:01:01.210> in<00:01:01.660> SMG<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.559> an<00:01:02.649> AR<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.160> I<00:01:03.190> would<00:01:03.340> say

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
between in SMG and an AR and I would say

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.360 
between in SMG and an AR and I would say
that's<00:01:04.030> exactly<00:01:04.750> how<00:01:04.990> it<00:01:05.140> plays<00:01:05.380> when<00:01:06.160> you<00:01:06.250> use

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
that's exactly how it plays when you use

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.130 
that's exactly how it plays when you use
the<00:01:06.520> gun<00:01:06.700> it's<00:01:06.940> very<00:01:07.210> good<00:01:07.420> mid-range<00:01:07.690> it's

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
the gun it's very good mid-range it's

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.140 
the gun it's very good mid-range it's
very<00:01:08.350> good<00:01:08.530> long-range<00:01:08.740> not<00:01:09.460> that<00:01:09.700> great<00:01:09.940> up

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
very good long-range not that great up

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.940 
very good long-range not that great up
close<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:10.870> definitely<00:01:11.380> pales<00:01:11.710> in<00:01:11.920> comparison

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
close it definitely pales in comparison

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.340 
close it definitely pales in comparison
to<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.430> other<00:01:12.610> SMGs<00:01:13.150> up<00:01:13.270> close<00:01:13.510> which<00:01:13.750> for<00:01:14.200> me

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
to the other SMGs up close which for me

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.840 
to the other SMGs up close which for me
is<00:01:14.380> kind<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.770> bad<00:01:14.920> thing<00:01:14.950> I<00:01:15.250> like<00:01:15.460> a<00:01:15.490> lot<00:01:15.820> of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
is kind of a bad thing I like a lot of

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.730 
is kind of a bad thing I like a lot of
close<00:01:16.300> combat<00:01:16.600> I<00:01:16.840> like<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.020> Russian<00:01:17.440> enemy

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
close combat I like to Russian enemy

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.560 
close combat I like to Russian enemy
spawns<00:01:18.040> and<00:01:18.340> take<00:01:18.790> on<00:01:18.910> a<00:01:18.940> lot<00:01:19.120> of<00:01:19.180> intense

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
spawns and take on a lot of intense

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.420 
spawns and take on a lot of intense
battles<00:01:19.960> you<00:01:20.080> know<00:01:20.140> face<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.380> face<00:01:20.710> this<00:01:21.220> gun

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
battles you know face to face this gun

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.120 
battles you know face to face this gun
is<00:01:21.580> not<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.120> best<00:01:22.270> for<00:01:22.510> that<00:01:22.600> however<00:01:23.130> made

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
is not the best for that however made

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.040 
is not the best for that however made
the<00:01:24.220> long<00:01:24.400> range<00:01:24.640> it's<00:01:24.880> clearly<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.480> best<00:01:25.660> SMG

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
the long range it's clearly the best SMG

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.560 
the long range it's clearly the best SMG
how<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.530> would<00:01:26.860> describe<00:01:27.010> this<00:01:27.430> gun<00:01:27.700> it's<00:01:27.970> the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
how I would describe this gun it's the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.660 
how I would describe this gun it's the
best<00:01:28.780> AR<00:01:29.110> for<00:01:29.560> me<00:01:29.650> for<00:01:29.950> my<00:01:30.070> style<00:01:30.310> it's<00:01:30.550> the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
best AR for me for my style it's the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.400 
best AR for me for my style it's the
best<00:01:30.880> assault<00:01:31.360> rifle<00:01:31.720> in<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.810> game<00:01:31.990> it's<00:01:32.170> very

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
best assault rifle in the game it's very

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.570 
best assault rifle in the game it's very
good<00:01:32.560> mid-range<00:01:32.770> very<00:01:33.220> good<00:01:33.400> long-range

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
good mid-range very good long-range

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.910 
good mid-range very good long-range
decent<00:01:34.480> up<00:01:34.600> close<00:01:34.870> but<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:35.650> have<00:01:35.770> that

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
decent up close but you have that

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.680 
decent up close but you have that
mobility<00:01:36.220> you<00:01:36.520> get<00:01:36.700> from<00:01:36.850> SMG<00:01:37.360> which<00:01:37.540> is

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
mobility you get from SMG which is

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.660 
mobility you get from SMG which is
really<00:01:37.990> really<00:01:38.230> nice<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.830> for<00:01:39.370> a<00:01:39.400> guy<00:01:39.490> like<00:01:39.520> me

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
really really nice and for a guy like me

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.800 
really really nice and for a guy like me
who<00:01:39.850> likes<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.120> move<00:01:40.240> around<00:01:40.300> that's<00:01:40.630> one

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
who likes to move around that's one

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.000

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
extended mags definitely an option but I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.720 
extended mags definitely an option but I
really<00:02:23.500> liked<00:02:23.650> staying<00:02:23.860> off<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.040> radar<00:02:24.220> but
