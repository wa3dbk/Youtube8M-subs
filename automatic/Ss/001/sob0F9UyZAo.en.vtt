00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
moment greatest thing about this weapon

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.690 
moment greatest thing about this weapon
though<00:01:24.319> is<00:01:24.560> there's<00:01:24.800> quite<00:01:25.069> a<00:01:25.100> lot<00:01:25.310> of<00:01:25.399> Splash

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
set up my Gatling piece somewhere where

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.559 
set up my Gatling piece somewhere where
they're<00:02:41.980> all<00:02:42.129> gonna<00:02:42.280> run<00:02:42.459> into<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.879> but<00:02:43.239> I

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
can't guarantee that they were always

gonna run into it so we'll get him
instead<00:02:50.340> we're<00:02:51.340> doing<00:02:51.519> quite<00:02:51.670> well<00:02:51.730> here

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
instead we're doing quite well here

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.819 
instead we're doing quite well here
we're<00:02:52.360> defending<00:02:52.870> relatively<00:02:53.410> well<00:02:53.590> this

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
we're defending relatively well this

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.009 
we're defending relatively well this
time<00:02:54.069> I<00:02:56.579> think<00:02:57.579> there's<00:02:57.879> only<00:02:57.970> 16<00:02:58.540> seconds

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
time I think there's only 16 seconds

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.949 
time I think there's only 16 seconds
left<00:02:59.079> and<00:02:59.500> then<00:02:59.980> we<00:03:00.459> win<00:03:00.730> basically<00:03:03.840> here<00:03:04.840> we

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
left and then we win basically here we

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:05.490 
left and then we win basically here we
go

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
go

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:15.270 
go
nice<00:03:05.980> assist<00:03:08.940> yeah<00:03:09.940> we<00:03:10.450> won<00:03:11.549> brilliant<00:03:14.280> so

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
nice assist yeah we won brilliant so

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.280 
nice assist yeah we won brilliant so
every<00:03:15.519> time<00:03:15.670> you<00:03:15.880> lose<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.090> base<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.930> just<00:03:17.109> fall

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
every time you lose a base you just fall

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.140 
every time you lose a base you just fall
that<00:03:17.470> just<00:03:17.799> like<00:03:17.920> rushing<00:03:18.340> battlefield<00:03:18.880> and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
that just like rushing battlefield and

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.390 
that just like rushing battlefield and
it's<00:03:19.930> actually<00:03:20.230> quite<00:03:20.470> hard<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.950> defend<00:03:21.190> them

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
it's actually quite hard to defend them

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.860 
it's actually quite hard to defend them
because<00:03:21.519> they<00:03:21.760> are<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:21.910> little<00:03:22.060> bit<00:03:22.239> more<00:03:22.269> open

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
because they are a little bit more open

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.949 
because they are a little bit more open
than<00:03:23.380> some<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.130> uncommon<00:03:24.549> rush<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:25.299> does

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
than some of the uncommon rush but does

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.339 
than some of the uncommon rush but does
make<00:03:26.109> for<00:03:26.349> a<00:03:26.380> very<00:03:26.440> enjoyable<00:03:26.919> game<00:03:27.489> mode<00:03:27.760> oh

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
make for a very enjoyable game mode oh

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.479 
make for a very enjoyable game mode oh
bloody<00:03:29.349> hell<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:32.620> didn't<00:03:33.040> realize<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:33.280> we're

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
at the zombies for me which is quite

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:55.199 
at the zombies for me which is quite
cool<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:48.690> thought<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.810> was<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.930> zombie<00:03:50.109> oh<00:03:54.209> it

heals you automatically back up to like
60%<00:03:57.970> so<00:03:58.599> you're<00:03:59.049> never<00:03:59.139> going<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.440> drop<00:03:59.650> down

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
60% so you're never going to drop down

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.690 
60% so you're never going to drop down
to<00:04:00.160> life<00:04:00.489> when<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.299> comes<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:03.250> see<00:04:03.519> that

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
to life when it comes to that see that

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.459 
to life when it comes to that see that
they'll<00:04:04.060> shoot<00:04:04.299> at<00:04:04.510> them<00:04:04.689> for<00:04:04.930> me<00:04:05.110> which<00:04:05.349> is

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:05.469

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
another one at the other maps I think

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.310 
another one at the other maps I think
this<00:04:19.239> is<00:04:19.329> the<00:04:19.419> one<00:04:19.539> that<00:04:19.599> I<00:04:19.659> put<00:04:19.840> in<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.019> intro
