00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.990 
making them because it's difficult I
mean<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.129> takes<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.400> long<00:02:53.519> time<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.730> put<00:02:53.910> them

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
mean it takes a long time to put them

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.670 
mean it takes a long time to put them
together<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.510> actually<00:02:54.690> spent<00:02:55.170> like<00:02:55.379> literally

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
together I actually spent like literally

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.199 
together I actually spent like literally
like<00:02:55.950> eight<00:02:56.220> hours<00:02:56.250> or<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:56.849> putting<00:02:57.060> together

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
like eight hours or so putting together

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.000 
like eight hours or so putting together
that<00:02:57.510> top<00:02:57.750> ten<00:02:57.930> maps<00:02:58.140> video<00:02:58.470> takes<00:02:58.709> took<00:02:58.920> a

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
that top ten maps video takes took a

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.259 
that top ten maps video takes took a
long<00:02:59.159> time<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.400> put<00:02:59.579> that<00:02:59.700> together<00:02:59.819> by<00:03:00.060> think

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
long time to put that together by think

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.119 
long time to put that together by think
it<00:03:00.329> turned<00:03:00.540> out<00:03:00.659> really<00:03:00.720> well<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.530> my

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
it turned out really well and my

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.729 
it turned out really well and my
question<00:03:02.190> for<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.760> guys<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:03.180> man<00:03:03.500> what<00:03:04.500> do<00:03:04.650> I

maps<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.769> call<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:07.950> duty<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.310> top<00:03:08.519> 10<00:03:08.730> guns<00:03:08.970> in

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
maps in call of duty and top 10 guns in

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.789 
maps in call of duty and top 10 guns in
call<00:03:09.299> of<00:03:09.329> duty<00:03:09.450> there's<00:03:10.140> not<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.349> whole<00:03:10.739> lot

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
call of duty there's not a whole lot

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.589 
call of duty there's not a whole lot
more<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.549> think<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.269> brain

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
more that I can think of in this brain

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.080 
more that I can think of in this brain
of<00:03:12.629> mine<00:03:12.810> right<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.500> top<00:03:14.129> 10<00:03:14.310> killstreak<00:03:14.879> so

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
of mine right so top 10 killstreak so

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.970 
of mine right so top 10 killstreak so
probably<00:03:15.569> be<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.930> next<00:03:16.230> one<00:03:16.409> I<00:03:16.560> think<00:03:16.769> there's

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
probably be the next one I think there's

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.979 
probably be the next one I think there's
been<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:17.489> many<00:03:17.760> different<00:03:18.120> killstreaks<00:03:18.780> all

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
been so many different killstreaks all

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.750 
been so many different killstreaks all
throughout<00:03:19.260> call<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.620> duty<00:03:19.859> I<00:03:20.010> could<00:03:20.579> do<00:03:20.730> that

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
throughout call of duty I could do that

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.210 
throughout call of duty I could do that
top<00:03:21.419> 10<00:03:21.599> perks<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.319> could<00:03:22.560> probably<00:03:22.709> do<00:03:22.919> that<00:03:22.950> as

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
top 10 perks I could probably do that as

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.670
