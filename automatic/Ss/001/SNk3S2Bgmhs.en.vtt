back the program and a little space gun

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.790 
back the program and a little space gun
that<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.020> pull<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> trigger<00:00:37.560> on<00:00:37.680> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
about it and for several years my dad

always took vacation that februari and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.260 
always took vacation that februari and
the<00:01:04.019> plan<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.460> would<00:01:05.700> go<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the plan was that we would go to the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.410 
the plan was that we would go to the
Daytona<00:01:06.630> 500<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.829> always<00:01:08.550> came<00:01:08.820> down<00:01:09.090> sick

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

with<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.630> flu<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.320> don't<00:01:10.530> think<00:01:10.770> mother

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
with the flu and I don't think mother

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.950 
with the flu and I don't think mother
would<00:01:11.159> afforded<00:01:11.580> me<00:01:11.730> to<00:01:11.790> miss<00:01:12.120> school<00:01:12.390> anyway
