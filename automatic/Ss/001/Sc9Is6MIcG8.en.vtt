00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
lightened this should be the handle

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.139 
lightened this should be the handle
should<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.950> nice<00:02:08.129> even<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.700> power<00:02:08.849> cord

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
