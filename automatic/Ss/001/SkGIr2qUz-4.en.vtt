after changing out this 10-inch saw
blade<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.270> wondered<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:21.900> could<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.170> done<00:00:22.380> with

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
blade I wondered what could be done with

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.529 
blade I wondered what could be done with
the<00:00:22.710> old<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:23.100> then<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> answer<00:00:24.240> became

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the old one then the answer became

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.070 
the old one then the answer became
obvious<00:00:24.800> make<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> custom<00:00:26.310> shuriken<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:27.930> get

blades securely to a table making sure
there's<00:00:41.700> something<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.120> protect<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
there's something to protect the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.389 
there's something to protect the
tabletop<00:00:43.079> from<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> saw<00:00:43.590> blade<00:00:43.890> because

tabletop from the saw blade because
we'll<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.640> cutting<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.030> pattern<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
we'll be cutting this pattern with a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.229 
we'll be cutting this pattern with a
jigsaw<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.309> these<00:00:47.489> jigsaw<00:00:47.940> blades

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
jigsaw you can see these jigsaw blades

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.299 
jigsaw you can see these jigsaw blades
have<00:00:48.480> 30<00:00:48.809> teeth<00:00:49.079> per<00:00:49.289> inch<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:49.920> made<00:00:50.070> for

have 30 teeth per inch and are made for
cutting<00:00:50.610> metal<00:00:50.750> let's<00:00:51.750> start<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> blade<00:00:52.320> in

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
cutting metal let's start the blade in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.049 
cutting metal let's start the blade in
the<00:00:52.530> groove<00:00:52.710> between<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.250> teeth<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.670> begin

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the groove between the teeth and begin

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.420 
the groove between the teeth and begin
cutting<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.480> straight<00:00:54.750> lines<00:00:54.960> first<00:00:55.350> now<00:00:56.309> I'm

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
cutting the straight lines first now I'm

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.160 
cutting the straight lines first now I'm
cutting<00:00:56.610> very<00:00:56.910> slowly<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.870> don't<00:00:58.020> have

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
cutting very slowly because I don't have

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.080 
cutting very slowly because I don't have
any<00:00:58.320> oil<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> dissipate<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.190> heat<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.820> going

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
any oil to dissipate the heat and going

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.849 
any oil to dissipate the heat and going
too<00:01:00.270> fast<00:01:00.510> could<00:01:00.899> ruin<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.320> blade<00:01:01.440> within

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
too fast could ruin the blade within

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
too fast could ruin the blade within
minutes<00:01:02.090> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> continued<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
minutes you can see I continued a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.299 
minutes you can see I continued a
straight<00:01:04.260> line<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> way<00:01:04.769> across<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.280> top

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
straight line all the way across the top

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
straight line all the way across the top
giving<00:01:05.790> easy<00:01:06.119> access<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> more<00:01:07.020> intricate

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
giving easy access to the more intricate

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.710 
giving easy access to the more intricate
cuts<00:01:07.710> inside<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.939> tight<00:01:09.180> curves<00:01:09.390> are<00:01:09.600> gonna

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
cuts inside the tight curves are gonna

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.840 
cuts inside the tight curves are gonna
take<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> lot<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.290> time<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> patience<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.729> with

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
take a lot of time and patience but with

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.370 
take a lot of time and patience but with
some<00:01:12.030> persistence<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.840> should<00:01:13.049> end<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.320> with

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
some persistence you should end up with

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170 
some persistence you should end up with
something<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.340> although<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.030> does

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
something like this although it does

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.240 
something like this although it does
look<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.570> rough<00:01:15.840> around<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.259> edges<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
look a little rough around the edges to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.859 
look a little rough around the edges to
fix<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.670> let's<00:01:18.030> gather<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.479> couple<00:01:18.689> of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
fix that let's gather up a couple of

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.380 
fix that let's gather up a couple of
half<00:01:19.080> round<00:01:19.409> metal<00:01:19.650> files<00:01:20.040> I'm<00:01:20.850> gonna<00:01:21.060> use<00:01:21.240> my

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
half round metal files I'm gonna use my

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.999 
half round metal files I'm gonna use my
bench<00:01:21.600> vise<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.900> hold<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.350> Batarang<00:01:22.770> for

bench vise to hold the Batarang for
better<00:01:23.159> leverage<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
better leverage here you can see it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.660 
better leverage here you can see it
definitely<00:01:24.930> looks<00:01:25.409> terrible<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.369> let's<00:01:26.549> go

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
definitely looks terrible but let's go

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.429 
definitely looks terrible but let's go
ahead<00:01:26.700> anyway<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.360> use<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> flat<00:01:28.049> side<00:01:28.080> of
