00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.490
 in casting metal welds in cold as well 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.260
 as before to get the joints of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 the metals it was necessary to weld the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.430
 each other screw the rivet or 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.619
 nowadays you can join many of them 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.740
 using adhesives also called 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.509
 cold welds in this article will 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.119
 explains everything that can be done and there 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.980
 to take into account to achieve it 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.050
 adhesives or putties with which 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.180
 they achieve perfect joints between metals and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.890
 even with other materials are 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.660
 generally composed of resins 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.570
 synthetic 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.300
 once hardened catalyzed no longer 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.219
 can be solved by diluents the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.769
 metal putties based on metals 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.149
 hard ones have a special relevance 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.359
 especially for its relatively price 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.190
 under its main characteristic is the 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.530
 of achieving perfect adherence with the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.559
 support whose property should be the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.120
 strong adhesion of its molecules 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.430
 resist temperatures of up to 300 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.170
 degrees so they can be employed 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.850
 to repair machines and engines 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.140
 combustion and even in the blocks of 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.180
 the cylinders 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.620
 to achieve good strength and 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.420
 adhesion of the joints must 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.280
 proceed with a previous treatment of 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.560
 the elements that need to be joined 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.260
 they will clean oils and fats water and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.659
 dirt is very important to have this in 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.100
 account since a good part of the metals 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.200
 usually receive a treatment 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.640
 Superficial protector of fatty character 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.550
 to preserve them from oxidation 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.990
 during storage this protector 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.509
 fat has to be eliminated or 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.670
 counteract using a solvent 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.280
 such as trichlorethylene acetone or 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.259
 benzene as the vapors of these 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.570
 products are highly flammable and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.430
 poisonous should be applied in one place 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.580
 ventilated and away from any fire 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.289
 or element that can cause a spark 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.090
 If the surfaces to be joined are chosen or 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.869
 scrape you get a greater power of 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.220
 grip of the adhesives by heat 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.429
 provided by a welding lamp or 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.320
 an electric welder a stove 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.030
 etc. a hardening is achieved 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.030
 fast and you get at the same time 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.519
 Greater resistance of adhesion one 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.370
 case with various types of resins for 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.209
 cases of emergency 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.489
 putty with hardener apart 3 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.970

 resin with metallic powder and hardener 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.269
 Built-in 10 polyester resin with 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.040
 fiberglass fabric with these 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.040
 substances unions are made between 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.950
 different metals the resin is mixed 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.489
 with metallic powder and a hardener is 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.140
 Used in aluminum, copper and white metals 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.480
 in the two-component tails and the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.480
 putty you have to mix hardener the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.160
 which is colored to facilitate the work 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.769
 the necessary amount is used in each 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.659
 operation the metal pipes can 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.730
 join with more fill chairs like the 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.640
 represented here fluid and two 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.370
 applied components are allowed to act 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.920
 totally the catalyst once 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.540
 catalyzed the resin is sanded or polished with 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.390
 an abrasive disc to eliminate the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.510
 excess material in the ducts of 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.280
 water the pipes must be well dried 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.379
 to achieve good adhesion is 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.840
 decisive a surface perfectly 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.549
 clean of metals in some 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.159
 repairs it is best to use a 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.019
 Special prepared in the pieces of 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.879
 casting enlarges the fissures for 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.610
 Accept more putty and get good 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.519
 Resistance two-component tails 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.349
 they are applied without excess in the elements 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.079
 broken that they want to glue must 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.180
 fit both sides for a good 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.849
 stability without separations between them 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.680
 a bandage is applied putties 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.890
 hard metal tough emperaure 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.680
 up to 300 degrees so these are repaired 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.280
 rings of a hearth after catalyzing the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.720
 Putty removes the excess material 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.579
 with the liquid metal of a tube it 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.450
 will recompose a container fund 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.359
 tin 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.950
 beltre or a vessel is added to act 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.620
 with alacrity to keep it from arriving 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.049
 soon the material with the aluminum in 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.510
 many repairs are made but 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.680
 you have to act diligently 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.530
 choice of material to be used 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.419
 will depend on the type of repair 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.979
 even two so different materials 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.290
 like metal and glass come together 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.420
 using two-component tails 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.660
 before the parts that 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.430
 should join in comments you have the 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.480
 address of the written article and with 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.250
 photos we end the article 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.310
 if you need to hear me again give it 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.310
 to play as many times as you want 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.310
 Thank you
