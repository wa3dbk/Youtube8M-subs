00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.210 
set for 10 pieces it'll fold 10 pieces
and<00:06:16.760> then<00:06:16.940> it's<00:06:17.090> gonna<00:06:17.270> stop<00:06:17.740> let<00:06:18.740> me<00:06:18.770> show<00:06:19.160> you

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
that's how your base counter works on

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.540 
that's how your base counter works on
your<00:06:57.340> de<00:06:57.520> 28<00:06:58.180> for
