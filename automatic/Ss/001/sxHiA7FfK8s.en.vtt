to do the thing that happens here is

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.380 
to do the thing that happens here is
that<00:02:18.630> if<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.380> run<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.590> simulator<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:21.180> make

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
that if you run a simulator and you make

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.870 
that if you run a simulator and you make
a<00:02:21.420> mistake<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:22.560> don't<00:02:22.740> have<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.250> go<00:02:23.580> into<00:02:23.760> a
