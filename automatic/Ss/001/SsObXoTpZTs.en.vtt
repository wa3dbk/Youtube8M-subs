another<00:06:16.500> $130<00:06:17.500> to<00:06:17.740> the<00:06:17.830> price<00:06:18.099> so<00:06:18.400> now<00:06:18.610> you're

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
another $130 to the price so now you're

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.230 
another $130 to the price so now you're

in the 930 dollar range or so and that's

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.089 
in the 930 dollar range or so and that's
actually<00:06:22.509> more<00:06:22.870> expensive<00:06:23.169> than<00:06:23.560> the

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
actually more expensive than the

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.390 
actually more expensive than the
entry-level<00:06:24.780> MacBook<00:06:25.780> Air<00:06:26.289> now<00:06:26.889> a<00:06:26.949> few<00:06:27.280> other

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
entry-level MacBook Air now a few other

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.999 
entry-level MacBook Air now a few other
things<00:06:27.490> to<00:06:27.819> keep<00:06:27.940> in<00:06:28.120> mind<00:06:28.169> storage<00:06:29.169> with<00:06:29.860> the

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
things to keep in mind storage with the

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.279 
things to keep in mind storage with the
entry-level<00:06:30.690> Microsoft<00:06:31.690> machine<00:06:32.080> you're

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
entry-level Microsoft machine you're

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.730 
entry-level Microsoft machine you're
getting<00:06:32.590> 64<00:06:33.280> gigabytes<00:06:33.849> of<00:06:34.000> storage<00:06:34.380> on<00:06:35.380> the

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
getting 64 gigabytes of storage on the

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.180 
getting 64 gigabytes of storage on the
macbook<00:06:36.610> you're<00:06:37.150> getting<00:06:37.479> double<00:06:38.080> that<00:06:38.190> 128

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
macbook you're getting double that 128

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.920 
macbook you're getting double that 128
gigabytes<00:06:39.669> now<00:06:39.909> yeah<00:06:40.180> there's<00:06:40.539> online

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
gigabytes now yeah there's online

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.740 
gigabytes now yeah there's online
storage<00:06:41.289> options<00:06:41.860> there<00:06:42.190> are<00:06:42.370> ways<00:06:43.060> to<00:06:43.090> expand

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
storage options there are ways to expand

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.959 
storage options there are ways to expand
with<00:06:44.110> memory<00:06:44.500> cards<00:06:44.889> but<00:06:45.039> basically<00:06:45.639> you<00:06:45.819> are

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:45.969 
with memory cards but basically you are

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:48.209 
with memory cards but basically you are
doubling<00:06:46.479> the<00:06:46.539> storage<00:06:47.050> on<00:06:47.650> the<00:06:47.889> Apple

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:48.219 
doubling the storage on the Apple

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:51.360 
doubling the storage on the Apple
machine<00:06:48.659> versus<00:06:49.659> the<00:06:50.139> Microsoft<00:06:50.710> machine<00:06:51.099> now

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
machine versus the Microsoft machine now

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.540 
machine versus the Microsoft machine now
again<00:06:52.150> we<00:06:52.810> can<00:06:52.990> take<00:06:53.169> this<00:06:53.409> there's<00:06:54.219> a<00:06:54.340> long

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
again we can take this there's a long

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.249 
again we can take this there's a long
list<00:06:54.880> of<00:06:55.090> but<00:06:55.300> they<00:06:55.479> have<00:06:55.630> this<00:06:55.810> they<00:06:56.110> have

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:56.259 
list of but they have this they have

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:57.899 
list of but they have this they have
that<00:06:56.440> here<00:06:56.770> we<00:06:56.919> have<00:06:57.009> a<00:06:57.039> touch<00:06:57.280> screen<00:06:57.310> here<00:06:57.789> we

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909 
that here we have a touch screen here we

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:59.520 
that here we have a touch screen here we
have<00:06:58.060> a<00:06:58.090> pen<00:06:58.419> here<00:06:58.900> we<00:06:59.080> have<00:06:59.259> a<00:06:59.289> more

got some choices to make these are both

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:08.219 
got some choices to make these are both
good-looking<00:07:06.729> machines<00:07:07.360> it's<00:07:07.870> light

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:08.229 
good-looking machines it's light
