which is about I don't know a hundred
yards<00:03:23.000> from<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.239> mind<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.980> it's<00:03:24.980> actually

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
yards from the mind and it's actually

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.820 
yards from the mind and it's actually
really<00:03:25.849> perfect<00:03:26.390> for<00:03:26.420> everybody<00:03:26.930> because<00:03:27.590> you

hang<00:03:29.870> out<00:03:30.019> here<00:03:30.349> on<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.709> ground<00:03:30.950> with<00:03:31.099> the

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
hang out here on the ground with the

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.789 
hang out here on the ground with the
pine<00:03:31.370> cones<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.849> aunts<00:03:32.180> or<00:03:32.590> if<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:33.709> don't

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
pine cones and aunts or if you don't

want to do that you could sit up here on
these<00:03:39.500> concrete<00:03:40.069> things<00:03:40.629> which<00:03:41.629> I<00:03:41.780> guess<00:03:41.930> the

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
these concrete things which I guess the

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:49.780 
these concrete things which I guess the
miners<00:03:42.410> left<00:03:42.620> us<00:03:48.099> all<00:03:49.099> right<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:49.459> if<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:49.610> take

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
miners left us all right so if you take

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.970 
miners left us all right so if you take
a<00:03:49.849> look<00:03:50.030> over<00:03:50.180> here<00:03:50.690> you'll<00:03:50.989> see<00:03:51.079> what<00:03:51.650> appear

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
a look over here you'll see what appear

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.280 
a look over here you'll see what appear
to<00:03:52.010> be<00:03:52.099> drill<00:03:52.549> holes<00:03:52.819> in<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.239> rock<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.840> a

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
to be drill holes in the rock and a

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.900 
to be drill holes in the rock and a
little<00:03:54.530> bit<00:03:54.650> later<00:03:54.859> on<00:03:54.980> our<00:03:55.280> hike<00:03:55.519> i'll<00:03:55.700> show

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
something pretty cool earlier we saw the

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.690 
something pretty cool earlier we saw the
holes<00:04:19.230> that<00:04:19.410> were<00:04:19.500> drilled<00:04:19.770> in<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:19.950> rock<00:04:19.980> up

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
holes that were drilled in the rock up

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.610 
holes that were drilled in the rock up
on<00:04:20.910> top<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.300> the<00:04:21.360> mine<00:04:21.570> well<00:04:22.080> this<00:04:22.290> is<00:04:22.320> what

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
on top of the mine well this is what

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.470 
on top of the mine well this is what
comes<00:04:22.800> out<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.610> core<00:04:23.820> sample<00:04:24.300> and

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
comes out this is the core sample and

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.840 
comes out this is the core sample and
the<00:04:24.960> miners<00:04:25.410> look<00:04:25.680> at<00:04:25.830> these<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:26.340> they<00:04:26.610> use

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
the miners look at these and they use

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.050 
the miners look at these and they use
these<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.690> determine<00:04:28.260> where<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.620> gold<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:29.060> so

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
these to determine where the gold is so

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.550 
these to determine where the gold is so
this<00:04:30.180> is<00:04:30.330> pretty<00:04:30.480> cool<00:04:30.600> it's<00:04:30.990> really<00:04:31.140> smooth

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
this is pretty cool it's really smooth

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.290 
this is pretty cool it's really smooth
and<00:04:31.830> shiny<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:35.310> when<00:04:35.730> you<00:04:35.820> see<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.090> old

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
and shiny so when you see this old

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.000 
and shiny so when you see this old
stamping<00:04:36.780> metal<00:04:37.080> in<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.230> distance<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:37.980> know

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
stamping metal in the distance you know

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.040 
stamping metal in the distance you know
you've<00:04:38.280> made<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.700> Big<00:04:38.850> Horn<00:04:39.000> line<00:04:39.270> just

at the entrance to the big fine I'm
going<00:04:48.270> inside<00:04:48.540> but<00:04:49.320> it's<00:04:49.620> very

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
going inside but it's very

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.130 
going inside but it's very
understandable<00:04:50.460> if<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.540> want<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.840> call<00:04:51.990> this

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
you got a cave in on the left and a

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.300 
you got a cave in on the left and a
little<00:05:36.690> bit<00:05:36.750> of<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.900> path<00:05:37.080> on<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.260> right<00:05:37.320> I'm

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
little bit of a path on the right I'm

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.700 
little bit of a path on the right I'm
going<00:05:38.580> now<00:05:41.180> that<00:05:42.180> was<00:05:43.050> a<00:05:43.080> cool<00:05:43.350> hike<00:05:43.560> through

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
going now that was a cool hike through

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.580 
going now that was a cool hike through
the<00:05:43.740> mind<00:05:44.040> what<00:05:44.850> is<00:05:44.940> also<00:05:45.300> cool<00:05:45.540> is<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:46.020> stamping

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
the mind what is also cool is a stamping

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.290 
the mind what is also cool is a stamping
know<00:05:46.710> behind<00:05:46.890> me<00:05:47.220> that's<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.670> same<00:05:47.880> structure

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
know behind me that's the same structure

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.050 
know behind me that's the same structure
that<00:05:48.390> we<00:05:48.540> saw<00:05:48.720> on<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.110> way<00:05:49.260> to<00:05:49.320> the<00:05:49.590> mine<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:50.060> I

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
that we saw on the way to the mine and I

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.430 
that we saw on the way to the mine and I
guess<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.240> long<00:05:51.450> time<00:05:51.660> ago<00:05:51.810> they<00:05:52.020> used<00:05:52.050> it<00:05:52.350> to

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
guess a long time ago they used it to

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.930 
guess a long time ago they used it to
pulverize<00:05:52.650> the<00:05:53.070> war<00:05:53.220> that<00:05:53.460> came<00:05:53.640> out<00:05:53.790> of<00:05:53.880> the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
pulverize the war that came out of the

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.880 
pulverize the war that came out of the
mind<00:05:54.180> they<00:05:54.720> would<00:05:54.900> load<00:05:55.020> up<00:05:55.080> their<00:05:55.350> wagons<00:05:55.740> and

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
mind they would load up their wagons and

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.310 
mind they would load up their wagons and
they<00:05:55.980> take<00:05:56.310> it<00:05:56.460> down<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.760> main<00:05:56.940> trail

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.560 

pretty<00:06:01.320> cool
