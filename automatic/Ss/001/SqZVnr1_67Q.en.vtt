00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.360 

well<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.110> figured<00:00:01.589> I'd<00:00:01.680> come<00:00:01.860> on<00:00:01.979> here<00:00:02.159> and<00:00:02.280> do

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
well I figured I'd come on here and do

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.530 
well I figured I'd come on here and do
something<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:02.669> haven't<00:00:02.790> done<00:00:02.909> for<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.210> while<00:00:03.360> and

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
something I haven't done for a while and

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.570 
something I haven't done for a while and
that's<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.959> cold<00:00:04.529> start<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.130> know<00:00:05.339> it<00:00:05.430> doesn't

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
that's a cold start I know it doesn't

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.010 
that's a cold start I know it doesn't
look<00:00:05.700> cold<00:00:06.029> because<00:00:06.240> there's<00:00:06.450> no<00:00:06.569> snow<00:00:06.720> on<00:00:06.930> the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
look cold because there's no snow on the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.730 
look cold because there's no snow on the
ground<00:00:07.049> but<00:00:07.429> it<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.960> probably<00:00:09.960> below<00:00:10.500> freezing

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
ground but it is probably below freezing

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.129 
ground but it is probably below freezing
feels<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.670> anyway

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
feels like it anyway

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.629 
feels like it anyway
I'll<00:00:13.500> move<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.830> out<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.190> about<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> month

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I'll move this out here about a month

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.470 
I'll move this out here about a month
ago<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:15.089> month<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.170> half<00:00:16.199> maybe<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:18.240> I

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
ago a month and a half maybe and I

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.460 
ago a month and a half maybe and I
suppose<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> better<00:00:19.020> put<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.260> back

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
suppose I better put it back

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.170 
suppose I better put it back
I've<00:00:19.740> already<00:00:19.890> aired<00:00:20.130> up<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> tires<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.119> I

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
I've already aired up on the tires and I

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.960 
I've already aired up on the tires and I
pop<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.570> hood<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:22.220> put<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> battery<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.789> but

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
pop the hood I put a battery in it but

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.310 
pop the hood I put a battery in it but
it<00:00:24.150> looks<00:00:24.300> like<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.539> left<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> battery<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.230> it

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it looks like I left the battery in it

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.009 
it looks like I left the battery in it
and<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.099> left<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> gas<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> back<00:00:27.750> there

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
and I left the gas can in the back there

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.269 
and I left the gas can in the back there
hooked<00:00:28.230> up<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.939> we're<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.090> gonna<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.420> if

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
hooked up so we're just gonna see if

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.819 
hooked up so we're just gonna see if
batteries<00:00:32.279> got<00:00:32.460> any<00:00:32.669> juice<00:00:33.530> see<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.649> she'll

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
batteries got any juice see if she'll

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.530 
batteries got any juice see if she'll
start<00:00:40.670> yeah<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.730> see<00:00:42.059> there<00:00:42.210> doesn't<00:00:42.450> have

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
start yeah I see there doesn't have

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.060 
start yeah I see there doesn't have
enough<00:00:42.750> juice<00:00:42.930> or<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.290> cables<00:00:43.890> aren't

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
enough juice or that cables aren't

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.760 
enough juice or that cables aren't
hooked<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.820> real<00:00:45.030> well<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.450> I'll<00:00:46.379> go<00:00:46.500> fiddle

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
hooked up real well so I'll go fiddle

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
hooked up real well so I'll go fiddle
around<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.579> see<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:48.510> we'll<00:00:48.660> crank

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
around with that and see if we'll crank

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.560 
around with that and see if we'll crank
or<00:00:49.550> well<00:00:50.550> I've<00:00:50.760> gone<00:00:50.879> ahead<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.120> I've<00:00:51.270> swapped

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
or well I've gone ahead and I've swapped

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.450 
or well I've gone ahead and I've swapped
batteries<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.500> know<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.890> charged

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
batteries to one that I know is charged

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.670 
batteries to one that I know is charged
um<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.510> probably<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> issue<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.559> other

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
um it was probably the issue the other

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
um it was probably the issue the other
ones<00:00:55.860> been<00:00:56.039> sitting<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:56.719> for<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> month

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
ones been sitting in there for a month

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.029 
ones been sitting in there for a month
and<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.109> half<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.410> ain't<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> best

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and a half and ain't really the best

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.450 
and a half and ain't really the best
battery<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:00.949> cables<00:01:01.949> aren't<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.340> great

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
battery and cables aren't really great

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.320 
battery and cables aren't really great
in<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.760> car<00:01:02.969> either<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:04.589> happens

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.060 

well<00:01:09.330> now<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:10.020> got<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.320> gas<00:01:10.530> back<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
well now we got to get gas back up to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.630 
well now we got to get gas back up to
the<00:01:11.189> carburetor

my hand long I can get out I'm kind of

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.150 
my hand long I can get out I'm kind of
surprised<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:11.020> runs<00:02:11.200> as<00:02:11.380> well<00:02:11.560> as<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.770> does<00:02:11.920> I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
surprised it runs as well as it does I

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.810 
surprised it runs as well as it does I
mean<00:02:12.370> I've<00:02:12.490> had<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.790> for<00:02:13.980> 11<00:02:14.980> years<00:02:15.190> that's<00:02:15.580> fat

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
mean I've had it for 11 years that's fat

mean I've had it for 11 years that's fat
from<00:02:16.150> all<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.630> time<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.370> haven't<00:02:18.370> done<00:02:18.460> a

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.840 
from all that time I haven't done a
whole<00:02:18.700> lot<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.150> really<00:02:19.420> well<00:02:20.280> yeah<00:02:21.280> like<00:02:21.790> a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
whole lot to it really well yeah like a

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.780 
whole lot to it really well yeah like a
little<00:02:22.120> sewing<00:02:22.270> machine<00:02:22.770> guess<00:02:23.770> all<00:02:24.010> close

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
little sewing machine guess all close

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:37.730 
little sewing machine guess all close
the<00:02:25.000> hood<00:02:25.150> here<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:26.490> get<00:02:27.490> it<00:02:27.610> going

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.760 

take<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.460> up<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.840> check<00:02:39.840> some<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.170> tires<00:02:40.380> I

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
take it up and check some of the tires I

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.840 
take it up and check some of the tires I
think<00:02:41.490> there<00:02:41.640> might<00:02:41.730> be<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.940> bit<00:02:42.150> lower<00:02:42.330> I

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.190 

should<00:02:47.850> be<00:02:48.000> able<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.210> fit<00:02:48.420> between<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.900> truck

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
should be able to fit between that truck

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.860 
should be able to fit between that truck
and<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:50.060> other<00:02:51.060> thing<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:52.310> think

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:11.430 

yeah<00:02:58.680> still<00:02:58.890> stops<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.910> we're<00:03:00.060> good<00:03:00.209> there

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.350 

alright<00:03:12.440> I'll<00:03:12.890> air<00:03:13.100> up<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.340> tires<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.880> take

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
alright I'll air up the tires and take

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.650 
alright I'll air up the tires and take
it<00:03:14.480> for<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.630> little<00:03:14.660> spin

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
it for a little spin

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.050 
it for a little spin
well<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.690> don't<00:03:17.960> think<00:03:18.200> I<00:03:18.260> want<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.500> put<00:03:19.060> too

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
well I don't think I want to put too

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.470 
well I don't think I want to put too
much<00:03:20.240> air<00:03:20.480> in<00:03:20.600> this<00:03:20.720> tire<00:03:21.910> but<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.030> still<00:03:23.210> holds

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
much air in this tire but it still holds

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.690 
much air in this tire but it still holds
here<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:24.500> crazy<00:03:24.770> thing<00:03:25.070> is<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.220> actually<00:03:25.430> drove

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
here the crazy thing is I actually drove

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.000 
here the crazy thing is I actually drove
this<00:03:25.820> around<00:03:26.120> exactly<00:03:26.960> the<00:03:27.200> way<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.380> is<00:03:27.440> same

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
this around exactly the way it is same

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.400 
this around exactly the way it is same
tires<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.460> everything<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.760> couple<00:03:29.030> years<00:03:29.180> ago

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
tires and everything a couple years ago

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.600 
tires and everything a couple years ago
didn't<00:03:30.410> go<00:03:30.500> far<00:03:30.740> probably<00:03:31.190> not<00:03:31.400> more<00:03:31.550> than

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
didn't go far probably not more than

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.960 
didn't go far probably not more than
twenty<00:03:32.210> miles<00:03:32.360> round<00:03:32.690> trip<00:03:32.780> but<00:03:33.730> yeah<00:03:34.730> right

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
twenty miles round trip but yeah right

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.050 
twenty miles round trip but yeah right

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
here on the road just like this bad

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.380 
here on the road just like this bad
tires<00:03:38.390> in<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> gas<00:03:39.830> can<00:03:40.100> gas<00:03:40.430> tank<00:03:40.730> and

everything seats not bolted on I'm kind

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.310 
everything seats not bolted on I'm kind
of<00:03:45.470> crazy<00:03:45.709> though<00:03:46.750> all<00:03:47.750> right<00:03:47.870> let's<00:03:48.080> take<00:03:48.260> it

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
of crazy though all right let's take it

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.590 
of crazy though all right let's take it
for<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.590> little<00:03:48.740> spin<00:03:48.910> I'm<00:03:49.910> also<00:03:50.060> trying<00:03:50.360> out<00:03:50.570> I

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
for a little spin I'm also trying out I

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.510 
for a little spin I'm also trying out I
got<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:50.900> couple<00:03:51.140> little<00:03:51.350> keychain<00:03:51.680> cameras<00:03:52.340> for

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
got a couple little keychain cameras for

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.520 
got a couple little keychain cameras for
like<00:03:52.610> 10<00:03:53.090> bucks<00:03:53.300> apiece<00:03:53.450> or<00:03:53.810> whatever<00:03:54.020> it<00:03:54.140> was

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
like 10 bucks apiece or whatever it was

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.110 
like 10 bucks apiece or whatever it was
so<00:03:55.100> I've<00:03:55.160> got<00:03:55.310> one<00:03:55.459> mounted<00:03:55.760> there<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.000> one

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
so I've got one mounted there and one

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.750 
so I've got one mounted there and one
under<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.420> hood<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:56.810> figured<00:03:57.590> I'd<00:03:57.709> just<00:03:58.640> go

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
under the hood and figured I'd just go

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.210 
under the hood and figured I'd just go
ahead<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.000> see<00:03:59.150> what<00:03:59.650> what<00:04:00.650> we<00:04:00.770> get<00:04:00.920> out<00:04:01.100> of

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
ahead and see what what we get out of

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.890 
ahead and see what what we get out of
them<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:01.580> know<00:04:01.670> might<00:04:02.090> be<00:04:02.270> interesting<00:04:02.780> I

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
them you know might be interesting I

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:45.310 
them you know might be interesting I
don't<00:04:03.110> know

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:05:05.780 

and<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.440> brakes<00:04:46.650> still<00:04:46.950> stop<00:04:47.310> it's<00:04:47.760> good

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.060 

used<00:05:06.000> to<00:05:06.150> driving<00:05:06.420> us<00:05:06.690> went<00:05:06.930> too<00:05:07.050> much

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.660 

RUP<00:05:11.280> probably<00:05:11.850> a<00:05:11.880> little<00:05:12.120> too

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
RUP probably a little too

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:20.060 
RUP probably a little too
when<00:05:14.670> I<00:05:14.840> go<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:15.870> start<00:05:16.020> off<00:05:17.390> water<00:05:18.390> come
