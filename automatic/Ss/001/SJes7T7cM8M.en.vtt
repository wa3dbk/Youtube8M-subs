00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.069
 let's ask the analyst 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.020
 international javier farc who is in 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.110
 london what is happening in the 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.119
 world order of things javier te 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.289
 He listened carefully what is your reading 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:16.039
 of what is happening at this moment 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.599
 go to white house washington and obama 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.099
 roberto very good afternoon good in 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.960
 first place obama president has 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.699
 a great dilemma at this time the 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.279
 al-Maliki government has been asked to 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.169
 intervene with aerial bombings but the 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.539
 President Obama has not decided on 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.539
 several reasons one of them is because he 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.489
 wants to prevent the us symbol of the USA 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.020
 involve directly in irak as 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.719
 happened in the past taking into account 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.129
 that he has withdrawn and opposed the 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.199
 war in Iraq and has withdrawn the 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.820
 troops from that country so that its the 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.350
 US participation is going to have to 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.239
 make a pretty participation 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.530
 limited the problem that has also 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.539
 the president obama that is running out 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.859
 the time the terrorist groups are 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.350
 advancing has been validated and they are 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.210
 starting to attack cities where there 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.910
 oil fields now 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.440
 in the first place he was talking about a 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.199
 sort of approach towards Iran 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.820
 taking into account the need or the 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.890
 strategic importance that will go 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.659
 in the region the problem that has another 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.369
 President Obama's time is that he is not going to 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.880
 want to resent neither to Saudi Arabia nor to 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.009
 Israel 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.810
 adopting a more independent attitude 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.330
 and working more in collaboration with 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.399
 they will go what is left to the president obama 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.860
 at this moment it is to pressure the Maliki 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.020
 to make changes first 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.640
 politicians to avoid the 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.399
 political attention created in this 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.580
 second situation is to wait 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.140
 that the army and the volunteers 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.450
 Iraqis are in the capacity of 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.950
 stop the advances let's say these 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.570
 terrorist groups the big problem that 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.429
 has had until this moment is that 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.770
 These groups are extremely violent 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.750
 extremely cruel they execute so in 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.130
 cold blood cold blood people to the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.229
 that they capture and that has been time 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.030
 fear and certain panic in some 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.830
 sectors of the army of the forces 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.780
 Iraqi armed then the president 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.210
 now he has to make several decisions 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.319
 up to a certain point brave one has 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.509
 to adopt a more 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.460
 independent with respect to its policy 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.920
 and middle east and it's nora 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.530
 apocalyptic calls for forgiveness wrath 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.630
 from israel they are talking about if it is 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.310
 who works with the world look at peace 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.340
 of the world in danger I was listening 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.630
 tomorrow an analysis of a government 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.700
 Israeli that seems a bit absurd 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.930
 because that's not the problem and adopt 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.239
 a more independent attitude and 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.770
 dare to work with irÃ¡n that is 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.720
 in this situation because if not the 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.400
 situation is worth the redundancy is going to 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.489
 aggravate much more than it is to be able to 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.680
 javier and do not go wait for me there 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.569
 moment I'm going to put images we're going to 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.880
 put pictures of what is happening in 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.410
 this moment in the white house - these 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.380
 are live images of the living room 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.850
 press sessions in the house 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.530
 white, in fact we're going to have a 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.780
 link with our correspondent marcelo 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.450
 Sanchez who is ready to translate the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.310
 obama's words in a few minutes he 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.320
 wait around there for that door where 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.080
 you see where the journalists are already 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.120
 international of all the chains 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.580
 come out the president obama back 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.610
 javier you that a few days ago 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.710
 obama had said no I'm not going to attack without 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.340
 But at that time I was 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.460
 shifting a powerful ship through 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.850
 of the Persian Gulf which is the reading of 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.350
 that was already foreseeing this when the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.450
 reading is that you want to be prepared 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.830
 for any eventuality that is to say 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.480
 announce effectively that there will not be 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.880
 First of all there will not be infantry 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.290
 in that infantryman in the 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.390
 territory here is something that 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.000
 discarded the president has sent a 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.160
 detachment of soldiers to protect 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.800
 the american embassy in baghdad 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.560
 but participation is not planned 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.810
 of the US infantry inside the arc 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.880
 it would return to a country which already 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.080
 has withdrawn what might be 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.790
 doing the president let's go with this 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.709
 displacements first treat 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.360
 to send a message to terrorists 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.200
 saying usa is not going to stay 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.570
 quiet 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.790
 that would be the first signal the second 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.950
 sign reassuring the government of baghdad 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.530
 Maliki's government has asked 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.209
 us bombard him to support as part 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.230
 or is it a way to calm and tell them 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.620
 we are prepared to 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.970
 any 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.640
 eventuality but at the same time 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.200
 shows certain doubts within the 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.549
 international strategy that has the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.769
 president obama that has been a 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.599
 constant in all their governments I 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.280
 it seems clear what the 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.870
 president in this situation if 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.250
 intervenes if it does not intervene if not 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.019
 intervenes know that terrorists 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.850
 can move forward because there is a certain 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.460
 inefficiency on the part of the government of 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.830
 baghdad to stop it if it intervenes 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.690
 can we say create some resentment 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.580
 in its allies of the region when thinking 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.800
 that is supporting countries like Iran 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.419
 then that can create resentment 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.250
 between Saudi Arabia and Royal cancel the 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.660
 informal coalition kind plan 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.580
 that although they can not be seen or 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.800
 paint seem to match some 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.810
 way in this attitude so that you do not 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.190
 has a clear position and what gives the 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.580
 impression that is happening with this 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.440
 displacement of this ship is to command 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.300
 a message to all of the government of Baghdad 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.350
 tell them we are prepared to 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.850
 any eventuality and 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.770
 terrorists to tell us in 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.380
 any time we can intervene not 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.240
 continue with your campaign worth there is a know 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.639
 if this is going to have any effect on both 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.979
 sides many friends sentences have been 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.930
 historical statements like those of 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.840
 red president ni 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.720
 be even willing to have a 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.949
 cooperation with the us army for 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.530
 help irak 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.120
 javier effectively the president of 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.310
 lohan and attended this olive branch and has 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.620
 offered to obama president this help 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.539
 but the big problem that obama has is 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.190
 his lack of decision or is missing in that 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:32.120
 lack of capacity to make decisions 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.520
 internationally this this offer 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.259
 I suspect that what the 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.210
 president obama is a speculation already 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.310
 that at this moment we can not do 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.630
 another thing that Robert himself speculates is 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.669
 that maybe there can be a kind of 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.410
 intelligence exchange e 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.050
 intelligence information that allows 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.210
 Usa work with Iran without there being a 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.509
 Total and absolutely open position 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.620
 of support what worries us and what 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.599
 I repeat again because I think 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.280
 extremely important is that he does not want 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.169
 appear the president under like that 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.240
 is openly working combine 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.650
 to avoid the resentment of their 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.599
 major allies in the region that are 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.099
 Saudi Arabia Israel is one of the 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.139
 things that concern him although in the 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.570
 past and has adopted a more 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.669
 independent by getting involved in the 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.169
 negotiation about the nuclear program 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.749
 peaceful of that 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.550
 a good start and this could help the 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:21.740
 obama president say good I've already 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.029
 started working with Iran I do not see by 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.249
 what can not I continue working on 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:28.009
 everything if what we are talking about has the 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:30.259
 Iraq's stability and the danger to the 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.759
 national security of the USA on the other 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:33.770
 side should not forget the role of the king 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.029
 nor of all this great fear that exists 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.460
 in the government here in london 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:39.469
 Roberto is that those elements of 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.969
 terrorists who are in these militias 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:43.159
 who want to investigate are going to enter 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:45.830
 Baghdad some could return to the USA 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:46.879
 to the United Kingdom and by instructions from 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.560
 the leaders of these bands 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:50.120
 terrorists could attack the kingdom 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.639
 united so there has to be a 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.469
 firm decision to stop the advance of 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.779
 these groups that is the big dilemma and the 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:58.610
 which one is still seems once 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:01.719
 they seem to have decided how they are going 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.719
 to face this situation
