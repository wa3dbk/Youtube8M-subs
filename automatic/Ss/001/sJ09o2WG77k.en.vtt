seconds ago so you know at the registry
cleaner<00:01:59.409> it's<00:02:00.409> easy<00:02:00.740> generalizing<00:02:01.700> or<00:02:01.880> that

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
cleaner it's easy generalizing or that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.230 
cleaner it's easy generalizing or that
might<00:02:02.209> be<00:02:02.360> helpful<00:02:03.259> for<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:03.740> many<00:02:04.090> she<00:02:05.090> where

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
you got disk cleaner now this is like a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.140 
you got disk cleaner now this is like a
little<00:02:11.959> bit<00:02:12.110> personally<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.280> think<00:02:13.579> this<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.090> a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
little bit personally I think this is a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.680 
little bit personally I think this is a
little<00:02:14.420> bit<00:02:14.510> better<00:02:14.660> than<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:16.430> just<00:02:16.790> clean

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
little bit better than this just clean

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.270 
little bit better than this just clean
up<00:02:17.780> right<00:02:17.989> here<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.290> comes<00:02:18.560> with<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.829> system

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
up right here that comes with the system

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.479 
up right here that comes with the system
so<00:02:19.549> you<00:02:20.420> might<00:02:20.570> want<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.959> run<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.310> if<00:02:22.310> you

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
so you might want to run that if you

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.160 
so you might want to run that if you
wanna<00:02:22.730> know<00:02:23.030> cripple<00:02:23.570> this<00:02:23.750> space<00:02:24.019> of<00:02:24.200> that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
wanna know cripple this space of that
