00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello, I want to tell you about 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.529
 unregulated crosswalk alone 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.330
 of the most common accidents by 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.179
 the city is unregulated pedestrian 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.500
 transition and suffers on him in 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.089
 mostly the person who wants 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.250
 give way to a pedestrian 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.859
 why suffer because it's late 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.619
 sees a pedestrian dramatically brakes from behind not 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.900
 I have time to react and hit behind 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.029
 Of course it's to blame 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.310
 not easier 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.380
 we drive up a pedestrian crossing and we 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.719
 don't see if they are suitable for pedestrian 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.300
 transition people or not overlaps us 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.550
 machine review we have to do speed 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.680
 such that if we see a person we 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.460
 stop smoothly and 12 won't 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.469
 by surprise 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.000
 we start to brake directly 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.010
 before the crosswalk when we 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.600
 we will see people and in advance while we even 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.700
 not yet see in by decreasing in advance 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.800
 speed and rear cars that do 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.930
 behind us we also slow down they 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.550
 also do not know the test people or not we 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.410
 slow down in advance so that there is no 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.109
 then surprises and so nobody 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.750
 drove back on ready already to the people who 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.960
 will come out if we see that they are not 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.729
 we just add speed let's go further 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.979
 here is almost the same situation we are 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.439
 drive up far right i'm busy 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.930
 cars have a pedestrian crossing we are not 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.159
 see there are people there or not extreme 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.630
 the left row we see well 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.820
 I looked there I go there someone 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.710
 will go we will have time to react but 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.840
 from the extreme right someone will be 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.479
 straight to us under the wheels straight to ours i 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.490
 because we must have been prepared for the fact that 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.900
 you go people and we can stop 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.920
 car and it won't be for us 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.930
 by surprise 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.759
 when we drive up unregulated 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.470
 crosswalk and we don't 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.810
 viewed at least one side 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.729
 right and hurt we should do 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.409
 the speed is as if we are approaching 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.360
 lying policeman that is we have to 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.399
 be prepared for the fact that to be someone 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.619
 in this case, we are lying 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.659
 the policeman who is like us 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.549
 forcing 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.369
 little soon not to beat the chassis 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.259
 cars slow down and it helps us 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.579
 is that if someone comes out 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.560
 the speed of your movement will already be 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.540
 small usually install them 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.049
 in front of schools and kindergartens 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.940
 closed turns where the driver 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.709
 required 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.970
 in advance and speed reduction to 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.220
 he could drive up a pedestrian crossing 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.140
 respond correctly to a sudden 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.690
 appeared pedestrian to him it 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.430
 was not a surprise 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.060
 There are of course such situations when we 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.980
 drove up 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.690
 crosswalk and we don't see 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.060
 pedestrians say stand like this 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.170
 case after the post and he can step us 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.150
 just under the wheels 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.680
 but whenever possible you should try 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.320
 avoid such situations 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.660
 need to look for pedestrians who are not 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.520
 already go to the road and we react to them 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.900
 but only fit the road that is, we 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.180
 see a pedestrian crossing 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.800
 see a person who approaches him 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.300
 that is, we theoretically should already 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.190
 understand that a person is likely 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.070
 going through the crosswalk 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.930
 and he goes through it has no one 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.180
 known or he will come and see 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.250
 cars are there or not and let's say let's say 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.930
 you if you are fast rides and can go up 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.880
 and immediately take a step that is, you do not 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.280
 you know therefore you need as soon as you 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.560
 man is already walking crosswalk you 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.860
 you see it already reduce the speed in advance 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.290
 what then would avoid sudden braking 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.240
 Here is the same situation if from under the minibus 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.400
 someone will come out he will step right under us 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.650
 wheels so you need speed 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.580
 that he have time to react, and then for us 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.580
 will not be a surprise 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.510
 when we were approaching a pedestrian crossing 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.790
 and we see pedestrians on it and we want 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.890
 give way to our braking 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.020
 should look so for pedestrians to 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.760
 they felt seen what we want 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.790
 give way to them to understand 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.500
 what can be found and the passage is safe 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.970
 that is not so you fly fly 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.340
 just before the pedestrian start 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.140
 brake and pedestrians square eyes 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.850
 don't look at you and can't understand you 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.860
 embark on the road or not ie they 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.080
 must clearly understand that you are inferior 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.360
 the road and your braking should be 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.560
 in such a way that you stop up 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.270
 pedestrian crossing is not on it by 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.720
 opportunities need to slow down 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.150
 way that your stopping distance was 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.740
 smooth and long to the back of the car 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.640
 who are behind you, too, did not hurt 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.650
 slowed down 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.170
 you have such cars lit up 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.330
 reacted here and ideally drive 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.190
 so that of course not completely 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.840
 stop but if it is one pedestrian 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.239
 there or two go there together 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.100
 then ideally of course make the brake 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.320
 way this way to slow down 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.690
 not even completely stopped left 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.160
 minimum pedestrian 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.110
 video that you miss it that 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.180
 give way to him and after him 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.390
 go further but this is of course ideally and 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.430
 when few pedestrians very often 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.220
 situation when you are subject to pedestrian 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.110
 crossing and it is already standing pedestrian and he 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.390
 how I would doubt it or not here 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.190
 hesitates whether to go to him whether the thread and 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.260
 you also think whether he will go under 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.390
 whether wheels will not go whether to pass 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.890
 Tallinn pass like on a driveway 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.200
 part and need not entered you clearly 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.390
 understand that now there is such a thing 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.270
 concept as a decision for pedestrian 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.760
 you slow down and blink his headlights 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.600
 what could pass and pedestrian know for sure 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.300
 what I am releasing 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.480
 that they give way to pass safe 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.080
 he starts to walk or can could wave 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.570
 him by hand 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.980
 but the windshield often flashes and 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.870
 a pedestrian he does not see all the papers to him 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.310
 by hand therefore he does not always see your 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.130
 actions in the cabin to him a car 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.170
 to pass therefore it is better blinked headlights 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.600
 let's say to either hand already if he doesn't 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.370
 sees in his hand stick out the window of all 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.370
 but open waving to him is just a sacqua that 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.030
 we pass if you drive down the road and 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.770
 ahead of you 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.120
 on the right or left lane 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.610
 starts to slow down 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.560
 especially before the crosswalk you 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.600
 must respond to braking ahead 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.830
 going car you have to figure it out 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.260
 why does she slow down 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.940
 what reason in and and braking while you 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.440
 You can not understand why the brakes 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.890
 it is impossible to overtake 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.180
 most likely from the car ahead 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.970
 will come to you right now under the wheels 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.860
 pedestrian if there is no pedestrian crossing and 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.610
 car lowering soon you still need 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.440
 respond to it 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.320
 maybe some animal is running there 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.670
 It appears the road so look 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.010
 what if the car in front of you brakes 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.690
 do not respond to braking 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.700
 overtake and slow down and see 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.770
 the reason for his inhibition why he 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.260
 brakes most likely there will be some 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.600
 interference is not always of course possible 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.880
 predict where a person can come from and 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.430
 be ready for him sometimes you can see 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.650
 pedestrians such places that there even 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.120
 theoretically should not be natural 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.190
 it will entail an emergency 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.730
 inhibition because of what is happening and 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.130
 etc. 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.390
 in this case, no one expected to see 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.420
 in the second row 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.610
 oncoming girl with bike 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.550
 Naturally she most likely went to 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.010
 extreme right there drove a minibus she 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.540
 man bypass went into the second row but 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.950
 thank God that we had a little 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.800
 speed and we were driving on a little 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.080
 speeds saw and if we had 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.510
 the speed is big and it entailed 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.490
 emergency braking and unknown 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.740
 would the rear have time to stop or not and 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.020
 unknown got this girl or not 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.540
 so there are often such situations that 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.010
 the drivers are not quite ready he is not 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.770
 can count the amount of the second row 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:11.400
 there will be on an opposite these people therefore not 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.560
 you can always of course 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.690
 let's say a situation foresee a situation and 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.360
 smoothly becomes smoothly slow down 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:22.020
 sometimes sudden braking for what 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:24.270
 and occur accident will add more 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.490
 useful information if the video
