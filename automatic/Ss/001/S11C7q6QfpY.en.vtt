00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hi everyone! How are you? 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.899
 been on the lists for a long time 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
 time that he did not record but several that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.070
 today a new cool super is about 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.590
 pancake 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.460
 I'm going to do here and a sweet pancake 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.350
 a curd pancake is our type 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.449
 wants to know that very common mass 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.789
 So for those who do not know they're going to learn 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.160
 for those who already know, just recapitulating 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.970
 what will change even the river is the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.650
 filling 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.800
 so I always have a habit of eating 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.520
 here these things ground meat pancakes 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.040
 huh 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.420
 so now it has changed a bit and stuff 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.210
 with strawberry and it got dark and I have 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.980
 sure that it will be a beauty then 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.520
 Watch the video of the ingredients 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.960
 It's very simple, it 's a cup of 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.649
 wheat flour 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.660
 a cup of milk tea and an egg had 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.090
 these three ingredients place in the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.690
 blender until it turns to a mass 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.690
 homogeneous 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.010
 also mass traffic is you can use 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.480
 a whole sentence like it's normal 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.460

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.820
