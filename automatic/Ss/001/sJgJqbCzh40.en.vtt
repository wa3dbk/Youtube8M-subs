00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:08.730
 I come and I mean I Is Well after all apps feed 2 of think to 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.700
 It may be a multi-functional area, but it is a feature of that area, but 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.700
 Please visit vtr because I tried to ask people who are actually using 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:26.720
 Smartphone selection reason ranking No. 5 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.720

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.729
 Because the fourth price was affordable 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.729
 21.4% 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.810

 iphone, xperia and digital kamata brand 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:57.390
 It's also popular, such as Neguza and aquos 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.390
 Because the second good design was good 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.390
 35.9% 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:10.280
 And first place is feature-rich 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:18.300
 43.2% because there was a function that I wanted to use 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:21.140
 It is one of the attraction that can be made to your own specifications by the addition of the app More reasons for choosing a smartphone 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.069
 It was ranking 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.990
 That's why I got this result 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.830
 Is the second Well I'm such that an example feature-rich Madakarakoso smartphone 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.220
 design 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:38.570
 In Article 5 in the third is that the ground 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.160
 At 23rd place it's fashion or a little 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.030
 There is actually Also data even though I'm likely Speaking 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.870
 In fact , smartphones android iphone 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.430
 android 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:55.740
 There are two types, so it's true that the other items are generally the same 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.800
 Of course, with regard to these two in the smartphone , of course with regard to brand and design 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.150
 Other brands are also popular at that school though 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:07.870
 Especially for those who are buying iphone these two 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.709
 It changed much of that do You're the Apple of the charm that many people chose in reason 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.010
 It looks like 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.780
 Seeing one more thing, yes 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:19.230
 No. 4 or the price of Menoko was affordable This fact is not it a little surprising 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.620
 It functions of the smartphone There was an expensive image by the hand 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.400
 I think why it is a little interesting phenomenon, but then actually smart 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.650
 See because the phone because what is bought at any price I asked in that city 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.750
 Please give me 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.950
 It is said that the price has been lowered smartphones, but actually at what price 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.180
 Do you buy 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.200
 I asked the people of Matsu 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:46.690
 Continue not it about you much 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:52.000
 It is divided, but it does not cost 1,000 yen every month 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:55.690
 At first about 60,000 yen in a lump 60,000 yen a 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.680
 No matter how much your heart is fit 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.200
 It's free 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.940
 In what was bought when there was a campaign in old times 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.020
 But I kinda go Whoo 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.319
 I thought it did not hurt 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.140
 That old mobile phone 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:15.880
 That payment has not changed so much 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.880
 I feel a little easier 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:28.400
 It was a sandmanta if I did n't go there, but it was 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.400
 It's about half the price or less It's about 800 yen per month 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:42.069
 The whole text is 8 and I want to sing to the country . 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:46.659
 Base price is so much Nde guy and go pay in the cup that amount is high reduction in call charges 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:48.960
 There is no sense that you are releasing an order body price and there is no one that is so high 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.960
 I Do 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.060
 I checked the price of the online store of each company 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:06.139
 Overall, big discount campaigns have been applied to smartphones and conventional mobile phones 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:11.180
 It is sold cheaply compared with 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.460
 Such is the red traditional type of mobile phone you are but I Well above resulted in the fact that 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:18.259
 It is smartphone that is written in letter, but 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:22.969
 As you can see, yes it's a smart phone with a slightly higher price than a traditional mobile phone 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:26.129
 It's about the same as being cheap but it is true that this is of course the shop 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:29.639
 It depends on the model, but it is a bit high under this 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:35.159
 There is a woman's smartphone, but it is already the latest model at the end 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:39.719
 It 's the end of the shiny just coming out and it's about the same time it came out 123 last year 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:40.830
 Eight key than this iphone something it is with things and after all conventional telephone 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:46.150
 Easy 5th 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:49.720
 Yes , there is also a real 0 yen, so smart phones 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.680
 Cherry blossoms are cheaper, but there are still some reasons 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:57.640
 One thing is that after all, mobile phone operators 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:02.200
 If there are many members and the number of members is overwhelmingly high business 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:05.800
 Because the fee for use comes in every month, the merit is very strong 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.139
 Though that is why are so put the very forces now after all everyone smartphone 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.480
 I want 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:15.200
 Is going to do it after all do popular not it is reflected over there most in the fact that 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:21.050
 It is that it is double debt It is the reason that share competition is one big 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:23.380
 Then uh-this is so, the infarct heart is old in the business of such service 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.770
 From mechanism to new mechanism 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:29.830
 Do not unless both ceased yo I'm the most serious when the move 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:33.940
 It wiring is also 4 rooms likely in either 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:37.990
 Why is it so ? 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:40.030
 There are many ways to sell, but those things have shifted more and more soon 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.889
 It is that I can say if anyway person 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:47.419
 Well then this is already so great 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:49.819
 Although it is an imminent reason, smartphone users will use it much more than others 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:54.710
 Or do is that so it is if there is data that 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:07:01.340
 Well, that means that I want to move to new businesses more and more 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:02.180
 Lot issued a fairly cheap plan Speaking of mobile phone company Gojo key that say Yeah I'm 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.880
 The 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.140
 smartphone 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:11.940
 Well Kedomo I think that spring I not it Nankan I shall still cheap and phase 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:13.650
 After all there are merits as a student with a smart phone, so it's quite a few times 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:18.450
 It feels like 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:20.700
 Such village should hear white's hard to be large is whether this hit's a smartphone 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.870
 It is still missing 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:27.550
 This form of the letter of withdrawal and normal 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:31.300
 Oh the other course, smartphones and I mean this one ambition easy here is to use 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:35.040
 To but it is not do because necessary to forcibly change a little Sapp 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:37.380
 I think that's Vegas second place while I think 

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:42.060
 It is say not Konase machine 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:44.490
 That pilgrimage type mobile phone is not always bad and there is a smartphone 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:48.330
 There are people who have both on their smartphones 

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:53.490
 It was smart to see a lot of calls here and there but 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:56.960
 Special Yes through more than might be that good to go to find the because their use 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.960
 Tokyo ip was news
