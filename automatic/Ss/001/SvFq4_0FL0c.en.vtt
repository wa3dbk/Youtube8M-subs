00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.480
 part of the wall 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.330
 overlapping window or doorway 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.070
 is called a jumper if the load is from 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.859
 the ceiling is transferred to the wall 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.039
 directly above the opening apply 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.109
 load-bearing reinforced concrete lintels are not 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.400
 main walls overlap squared 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.699
 jumpers etc. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.179
 and you can save a little and block 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.540
 opening 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.850
 metal corners name is a vegetable on 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.280
 wall to install the window unit with 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.879
 side top of the window make a quarter 5 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.879
 centimeters 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.420
 in order to sustain a quarter 5 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.360
 centimeters on top of the edges overlap 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.800
 Colin white brick about the house and on top 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.800
 we put red . 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:36.440
 we apply level to the wall and we look 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.980
 tape measure to need a quarter 5 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.980
 centimeters 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.580
 then set the corner 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.140
 and fasten insulation in 2 layers 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.590
 I press it with a corner 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.230
 and 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.900
 and 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.980
 top of the corner put the block holes up 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.459
 in order for the window sill not to be 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.459
 holes 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.730
 we lay the solution on the wheelbarrow of the block and 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.730
 press down another block 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.430
 above the holes we pass a rolling pin from 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.210
 swaddling their facial bricks 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.210
 put it on the solution 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.820
 and on top we put points three fours 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.130
 red brick 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.130
 thereby aligning the ordering of blogs 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.199
 how to close a side hole 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.410
 already there is a video link will
