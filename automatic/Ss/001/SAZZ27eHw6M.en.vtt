00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hi friends today i would like to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.560
 to share information on how to 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:11.969
 change the calender sensor to 220 cd se 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:18.390
 engine 32 is actually in front of us 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.699
 sensor house is old this is new for many 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.619
 the question may arise why 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.869
 what's the reason for what's wrong with him 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.510
 what are the symptoms answering this question 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.920
 I can say that he has no symptoms 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.739
 completely working absolutely working 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.920
 me and and for the reason that this 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.350
 little detail is very cheap on 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.540
 Today, that's a problem can not 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.969
 be a lot since the front cottage 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.320
 Summer season so to speak 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.219
 far from Moscow 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.789
 and having experience is already coming out and strictly 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.489
 from the failure of such a sensor do not want to 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.160
 Moscow region and other region ride 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.140
 on the tow truck that's why changing 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.670
 and the old ones take with me the launch is 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.930
 trunk and suddenly come in handy that 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.380
 what actually needs our 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.000
 sensor 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.930
 our sensor is on the right side 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.390
 engine 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.380
 now if you see a hole for him 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.830
 Gadget delivered then we remove from 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.130
 him 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.090
 connector that 's easy everything is done here 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.250
 such a bolt here we have such a means 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 we need such a small extension cord 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.009
 The head of our e-8 is like 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.860
 asterisk on the contrary e-8 well actually 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:46.470
 It's not tricky to take a new one. 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:50.460
 volume sensor is absolutely absolutely 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.170
 new and now try it so 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:59.700
 say to touch if we have 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.930
 of course it will turn out great from the first 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.510
 times to touch the guys entered 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.470
 here look installed new sensor 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.810
 we can see it now we are now 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.500
 twist the bolt 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.090
 we pull it up and put on the connector 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.390
 start see what happens 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.840
 so if you had such a misfortune 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.430
 see for yourself is almost the same 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.290
 the left 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:32.590
 Well, someone may be comfortable right 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.590
 good luck to all
