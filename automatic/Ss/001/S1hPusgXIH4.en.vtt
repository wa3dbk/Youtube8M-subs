run-of-the-mill<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.539> think<00:00:30.599> I

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
run-of-the-mill one I in I think I

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.569 
run-of-the-mill one I in I think I
talked<00:00:31.230> about<00:00:31.320> him<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.619> my<00:00:31.740> empties<00:00:32.009> videos<00:00:32.340> it

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
talked about him on my empties videos it

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.400 
talked about him on my empties videos it
didn't<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.390> do<00:00:33.540> much<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.719> anything<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.290> me

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
didn't really do much of anything for me

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.590 
didn't really do much of anything for me
but<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.670> love<00:00:36.000> by<00:00:36.210> them<00:00:36.450> is

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
but the one that I do love by them is

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.450 
but the one that I do love by them is
the<00:00:36.809> blemish<00:00:37.200> control<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.680> has<00:00:37.829> salicylic

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the blemish control it has salicylic

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.510 
the blemish control it has salicylic
acid<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.210> really<00:00:39.360> helps<00:00:39.600> dry<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:39.989> any

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
acid so it really helps dry out any

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
acid so it really helps dry out any
spots<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:41.940> come<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
spots that have just come up I have a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.700 
spots that have just come up I have a
whole<00:00:42.690> review<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.200> guy<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> will

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
whole review on that guy that I will

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.279 
whole review on that guy that I will
link<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> down<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.360> new<00:00:45.570> pore

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
link it down and so this is the new pore

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.830 
link it down and so this is the new pore
minimizing<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.920> which<00:00:47.520> based<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.600> what

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
minimizing one which based on what

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.209 
minimizing one which based on what
people<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.289> been<00:00:49.320> saying<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.890> my<00:00:50.100> own

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
people have been saying and my own

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.010 
people have been saying and my own
experience<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.820> i<00:00:50.850> think<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.329> set<00:00:51.629> out<00:00:51.660> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
experience with it i think is set out to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.670 
experience with it i think is set out to
rival<00:00:52.850> benefits<00:00:53.850> Porefessional<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.350> this

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
rival benefits Porefessional and so this

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.310 
rival benefits Porefessional and so this
one<00:00:55.860> runs<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.520> fifty<00:00:56.820> dollars<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
one runs for fifty dollars on for the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
one runs for fifty dollars on for the
one<00:00:58.469> ounce<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.010> think<00:00:59.309> benefits<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.480> not

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
one ounce and I think benefits is not

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720 
one ounce and I think benefits is not
quite<00:01:00.989> an<00:01:01.170> ounce<00:01:01.289> i<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.710> point<00:01:02.460> eight

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
quite an ounce i think it's point eight

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.399 
quite an ounce i think it's point eight
ounces<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.329> runs<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:03.690> about<00:01:03.750> thirty-six

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
ounces and runs for about thirty-six

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.539 
ounces and runs for about thirty-six
dollars<00:01:04.830> um<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:07.010> even<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.220> did<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
dollars um so even if you did the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.280 
dollars um so even if you did the
rounded<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> math<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.750> benefits<00:01:10.170> as

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
rounded up for the math with benefits as

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.390 
rounded up for the math with benefits as
one<00:01:10.439> still<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:10.860> bit<00:01:11.010> more<00:01:11.159> expensive

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
one still a little bit more expensive

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.080 
one still a little bit more expensive
but<00:01:11.640> that's<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> price<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.049> they're

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
but that's just the price that they're

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.240 
but that's just the price that they're
primers<00:01:15.090> run<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.830> want<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.040> say<00:01:17.159> about

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
primers run so what I want to say about

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.429 
primers run so what I want to say about
this<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:18.119> tried<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.540> Porefessional<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
this I have tried the Porefessional and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.380 
this I have tried the Porefessional and
I<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.590> doesn't<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.549> anything<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.030> me

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
I it doesn't really do anything for me

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
I it doesn't really do anything for me
and<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:22.680> think<00:01:23.250> initially<00:01:23.490> when<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.880> used<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and I think initially when I used to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.550 
and I think initially when I used to
wear<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.630> used<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.900> enjoy<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.380> I

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
wear it I used to enjoy it because I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
wear it I used to enjoy it because I
sort<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.920> bought<00:01:26.130> into<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> hype<00:01:26.580> oh<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.150> spent

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
sort of bought into the hype oh I spent

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.370 
sort of bought into the hype oh I spent
more<00:01:27.900> time<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.560> um<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.750> don't<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:30.869> looking

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
more time really um I don't know looking

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.490 
more time really um I don't know looking
at<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.450> like<00:01:33.450> researching<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
at it and and like researching it you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.719 
at it and and like researching it you
know<00:01:34.590> looking<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.070> more<00:01:35.100> critically<00:01:35.579> i

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
know looking at it more critically i

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
know looking at it more critically i
found<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.270> didn't<00:01:36.509> really<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.960> very<00:01:37.140> much<00:01:37.320> of

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
found that didn't really do very much of

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
new setup so we're going to see if my

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.580 
new setup so we're going to see if my
angles<00:01:59.880> I've<00:01:59.969> worked<00:02:00.180> out<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.899> basically<00:02:01.320> it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
angles I've worked out but basically it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.069 
angles I've worked out but basically it
comes<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.159> same<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:03.149> not<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> clear<00:02:03.840> it's

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
comes in the same it's not a clear it's

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.469 
comes in the same it's not a clear it's
like<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.490> little<00:02:05.700> busy<00:02:08.000> in<00:02:09.000> color

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
like a it's like a little busy in color

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.110 
like a it's like a little busy in color
and<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.020> what<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.560> will<00:02:10.679> say<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.459> if<00:02:11.730> hopefully

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and so what I will say and if hopefully

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
and so what I will say and if hopefully
that<00:02:12.239> done<00:02:12.450> will<00:02:12.599> work

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
that done will work

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.690 
that done will work
and<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.319> can<00:02:13.500> see<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.010> action<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.580> it

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
and you can see it in action is that it

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.430 
and you can see it in action is that it
blends<00:02:14.970> into<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.300> skin<00:02:15.630> really<00:02:15.990> really

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
blends into the skin really really

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.620 
blends into the skin really really
quickly<00:02:16.740> it's<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.760> little<00:02:18.000> bit<00:02:18.180> greasy<00:02:18.390> like

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
quickly it's a little bit greasy like

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.180 
quickly it's a little bit greasy like
the<00:02:18.720> professional<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:19.380> not<00:02:19.530> quite<00:02:19.770> as<00:02:19.830> Gracie

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
the professional but not quite as Gracie

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.040 
the professional but not quite as Gracie
and<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.790> terms<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.150> application<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.810> really

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and so in terms of application I really

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.170 
and so in terms of application I really
did<00:02:22.200> enjoy<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.560> now<00:02:23.310> whether<00:02:23.490> or<00:02:23.760> not<00:02:23.880> it

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
did enjoy it now whether or not it

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.990 
did enjoy it now whether or not it
actually<00:02:24.709> sealed<00:02:25.709> up<00:02:25.950> or<00:02:26.160> covered<00:02:26.790> those

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
actually sealed up or covered those

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.090 
actually sealed up or covered those
pores<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:28.080> did<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.350> better<00:02:28.560> job<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:29.010> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.890 
pores it did a better job in the
professional<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:29.850> still<00:02:30.150> like<00:02:30.360> my<00:02:30.600> Dior

dr one down below the dr one I felt like

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.970

not only sort of cover them up it gave
that<00:02:38.160> airbrushed<00:02:38.580> look<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.060> face<00:02:39.239> this

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
that airbrushed look to the face this

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
one covers them up a little if it

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.580 
one covers them up a little if it
doesn't<00:02:41.700> do<00:02:42.120> quite<00:02:42.420> as<00:02:42.660> well<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.989> job<00:02:43.230> at<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590

doesn't do quite as well the job at the
airbrushing<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.880> speak<00:02:45.090> over<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.600> image<00:02:45.810> I

airbrushing so to speak over you image I

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.510 
airbrushing so to speak over you image I
hope<00:02:46.260> I'm<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.530> focus<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:46.920> these<00:02:47.130> lights<00:02:47.370> are

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
hope I'm in focus and these lights are

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.370 
hope I'm in focus and these lights are
probably<00:02:47.910> making<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.630> see<00:02:49.080> more<00:02:49.290> air

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
probably making it see more air

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.350 
probably making it see more air
percentages<00:02:49.890> but<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.430> sort<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.760> put<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.150> here

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
percentages but I sort of put in here

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.440 
percentages but I sort of put in here
I've<00:02:51.540> had<00:02:51.570> some<00:02:51.930> pores<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.320> my<00:02:52.440> nose<00:02:52.650> show<00:02:52.920> up

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
I've had some pores of my nose show up

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.270 
I've had some pores of my nose show up
more<00:02:54.450> apparent<00:02:54.930> than<00:02:54.989> usual<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:55.950> don't

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
more apparent than usual and so I don't

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.970 
more apparent than usual and so I don't
know<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:57.420> doesn't<00:02:57.810> okay<00:02:58.200> job<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:58.500> for

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
know I just it doesn't okay job but for

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.520 
know I just it doesn't okay job but for
fifty<00:02:59.280> dollars<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.790> probably<00:03:00.470> wouldn't<00:03:01.470> like

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
fifty dollars I probably wouldn't like

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.050 
fifty dollars I probably wouldn't like
take<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:01.950> plunge<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.610> would<00:03:02.730> say<00:03:02.760> for
