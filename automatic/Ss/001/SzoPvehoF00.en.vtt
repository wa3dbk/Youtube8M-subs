the best kept secret in the industry to

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.200 
the best kept secret in the industry to
a<00:00:25.390> huge<00:00:26.220> sense<00:00:27.220> of<00:00:27.279> awareness<00:00:27.399> and<00:00:27.970> height

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
a huge sense of awareness and height

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.779 
a huge sense of awareness and height
partially<00:00:29.079> hype<00:00:29.319> around<00:00:29.499> it<00:00:29.859> what<00:00:30.399> can<00:00:30.579> 3d

partially hype around it what can 3d
printing<00:00:31.239> do<00:00:31.359> and<00:00:31.509> what<00:00:31.599> it<00:00:31.720> can't<00:00:31.960> do<00:00:32.200> I<00:00:32.800> think

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:33.609 
printing do and what it can't do I think

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.009 
printing do and what it can't do I think
it's<00:00:33.730> going<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:33.879> be<00:00:34.000> three<00:00:34.149> major<00:00:34.480> sectors

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
it's going to be three major sectors

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.930 
it's going to be three major sectors
that<00:00:35.199> are<00:00:35.289> going<00:00:35.440> to<00:00:35.530> grow<00:00:35.769> looking<00:00:36.699> forward

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
that are going to grow looking forward

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.439 
that are going to grow looking forward
one<00:00:37.660> is<00:00:37.899> the<00:00:38.170> consumer<00:00:38.920> sector<00:00:39.309> which<00:00:40.239> is

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
one is the consumer sector which is

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.419 
one is the consumer sector which is
already<00:00:40.629> now<00:00:41.050> a<00:00:41.079> 3<00:00:41.410> 400<00:00:41.949> million<00:00:42.160> dollar

business which is going to grow you know
in<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:44.620> next<00:00:44.739> five<00:00:45.309> six<00:00:45.579> years<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:47.050> going<00:00:47.199> to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
in the next five six years it's going to

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.229 
in the next five six years it's going to
go<00:00:47.410> at<00:00:47.769> least<00:00:47.920> thirty<00:00:48.250> forty<00:00:48.579> percent<00:00:48.879> maybe

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
go at least thirty forty percent maybe

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.950 
go at least thirty forty percent maybe
50<00:00:49.600> per<00:00:49.780> year<00:00:50.109> that's<00:00:50.620> one<00:00:50.859> area<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.309> consumer

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
50 per year that's one area the consumer

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.529 
50 per year that's one area the consumer
the<00:00:52.960> second<00:00:53.350> area<00:00:53.559> is<00:00:53.980> going<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.489> be<00:00:54.550> an

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
the second area is going to be an

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.090 
the second area is going to be an
accelerated<00:00:56.260> growth<00:00:56.410> in<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.769> rapid

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
accelerated growth in the rapid

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.489 
accelerated growth in the rapid
prototyping<00:00:57.820> so<00:00:58.570> when<00:00:58.749> the<00:00:58.870> 3d<00:00:59.170> printers

00:00:59.489 --> 00:00:59.499 
prototyping so when the 3d printers

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:02.790 
prototyping so when the 3d printers
actually<00:00:59.920> used<00:01:00.249> to<00:01:00.550> prototype<00:01:01.359> a<00:01:01.870> product

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
actually used to prototype a product

actually used to prototype a product
design<00:01:03.510> which<00:01:04.510> eighty<00:01:05.020> percent<00:01:05.230> of<00:01:05.560> customers

design which eighty percent of customers
are<00:01:06.340> using<00:01:06.430> today<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.720> I<00:01:07.750> think<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.020> most

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
are using today but I think the most

are using today but I think the most
interesting<00:01:08.380> sector<00:01:09.310> for<00:01:09.460> growth<00:01:09.640> is<00:01:09.820> going

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
interesting sector for growth is going

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.820 
interesting sector for growth is going
to<00:01:10.090> be<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.420> additive<00:01:10.870> manufacturing<00:01:11.020> space

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
to be the additive manufacturing space

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.050 
to be the additive manufacturing space

where not only printing one part or one
product<00:01:16.570> for<00:01:17.170> prototyping<00:01:17.860> but<00:01:18.340> multiple

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
in the coming years I would say we will

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.070 
in the coming years I would say we will
be<00:01:29.800> in<00:01:30.160> 10<00:01:30.520> years<00:01:30.550> we<00:01:31.120> will<00:01:31.330> be<00:01:31.600> seeing<00:01:31.870> the

manufacturing and distribution we will

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.969 
manufacturing and distribution we will
have<00:02:01.450> centralized<00:02:01.990> product<00:02:02.350> development<00:02:02.860> and

distributed manufacturing this is

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.699 
distributed manufacturing this is
definitely<00:02:05.920> something<00:02:05.979> we're<00:02:06.369> going<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.640> see

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
definitely something we're going to see

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.169 
definitely something we're going to see
what<00:02:08.709> we<00:02:08.860> will<00:02:09.009> also<00:02:09.160> see<00:02:09.550> is<00:02:09.700> an<00:02:09.819> increased

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
what we will also see is an increased

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.220 
what we will also see is an increased
adoption<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.250> prosumer<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.330> maybe<00:02:13.870> then

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
adoption in the prosumer and maybe then

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.190 
adoption in the prosumer and maybe then
maybe<00:02:14.770> within<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.220> 10<00:02:15.430> year<00:02:15.670> time<00:02:16.060> frame<00:02:16.270> you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
maybe within the 10 year time frame you

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.570 
maybe within the 10 year time frame you
will<00:02:17.410> see<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:18.130> consumer<00:02:20.040> part<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.250> 3d

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
will see the consumer part of the 3d

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.360 
will see the consumer part of the 3d
business<00:02:21.820> pretty<00:02:22.720> much<00:02:22.959> exploding<00:02:23.739> in<00:02:24.280> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
business pretty much exploding in the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.520 
business pretty much exploding in the
next<00:02:24.610> five<00:02:24.790> years<00:02:25.030> i<00:02:25.239> would<00:02:25.420> say<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:26.200> will<00:02:26.380> have

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
next five years i would say it will have

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.370 
next five years i would say it will have
moderate<00:02:26.980> growth<00:02:27.660> what's<00:02:28.660> going<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.930> drive<00:02:29.050> it

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
moderate growth what's going to drive it

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.860 
moderate growth what's going to drive it
it's<00:02:30.130> going<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.430> be<00:02:30.550> driven<00:02:30.760> by<00:02:31.030> ease<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.660> use

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
it's going to be driven by ease of use

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.280 
it's going to be driven by ease of use
of<00:02:32.050> product<00:02:32.500> design<00:02:32.860> software<00:02:33.300> right<00:02:34.300> if<00:02:34.540> you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
of product design software right if you

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.690 
of product design software right if you
and<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.560> can<00:02:35.920> simply<00:02:36.340> design<00:02:36.790> or<00:02:37.269> modify<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.780> 3d

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
and I can simply design or modify a 3d

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.180 
and I can simply design or modify a 3d
file<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.030> print<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:40.989> then<00:02:41.800> it's<00:02:41.950> going<00:02:42.100> to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
file and print it then it's going to

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.220 
file and print it then it's going to
take<00:02:42.400> off<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.150> simplification<00:02:44.019> of<00:02:44.110> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
software in the design is going to

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.890 
software in the design is going to
really<00:02:47.459> help<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.940> consumer<00:02:49.150> part<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
really help the consumer part of the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.320 
really help the consumer part of the
business<00:02:50.050> flourish<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.310> don't<00:02:51.790> be<00:02:51.910> misled

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
business flourish and don't be misled

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.350 
business flourish and don't be misled
the<00:02:52.540> MakerBot<00:02:52.989> business<00:02:53.850> seventy<00:02:54.850> percent<00:02:54.970> of

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
the MakerBot business seventy percent of

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.840 
the MakerBot business seventy percent of
their<00:02:55.480> sales<00:02:55.750> go<00:02:55.989> into<00:02:56.290> companies<00:02:56.860> not<00:02:57.549> into

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
their sales go into companies not into

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.789 
their sales go into companies not into
the<00:02:57.970> consumer<00:02:58.510> yeah<00:02:59.170> they're<00:02:59.410> going<00:02:59.620> into

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
the consumer yeah they're going into

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.190 
the consumer yeah they're going into
industry<00:03:00.100> same<00:03:00.519> customers<00:03:01.060> as<00:03:01.180> ours<00:03:01.390> even<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
industry same customers as ours even the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.710 
industry same customers as ours even the
small<00:03:02.440> ones<00:03:02.470> yeah<00:03:03.280> for<00:03:03.880> initial<00:03:04.360> product

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
small ones yeah for initial product

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.340 
small ones yeah for initial product
design<00:03:05.560> verification<00:03:06.000> it's<00:03:07.000> fast<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:07.660> cheap

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
design verification it's fast it's cheap

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.030 
design verification it's fast it's cheap
and<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.890> gives<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.280> initial<00:03:09.970> look<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.360> feel<00:03:10.660> and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
and it gives a initial look and feel and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.740 
and it gives a initial look and feel and
then<00:03:12.040> for<00:03:12.730> further<00:03:12.970> develop<00:03:13.480> prototypes

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
then for further develop prototypes

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.039 
then for further develop prototypes
it'll<00:03:14.320> go<00:03:14.440> into<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.709> more<00:03:14.950> high<00:03:15.400> quality<00:03:16.049> system

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
it'll go into a more high quality system

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.930 
it'll go into a more high quality system
like<00:03:17.230> like<00:03:17.500> some<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.799> our<00:03:17.920> Stratasys<00:03:18.430> products

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
like like some of our Stratasys products

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.830 
like like some of our Stratasys products
so<00:03:19.780> consumer<00:03:20.549> is<00:03:21.549> maybe<00:03:21.970> thirty<00:03:22.299> percent<00:03:22.660> of

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
so consumer is maybe thirty percent of

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.780 
so consumer is maybe thirty percent of
the<00:03:22.959> business<00:03:23.320> seventy<00:03:24.070> percent<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.489> still<00:03:24.700> in

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
the business seventy percent is still in

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.569 
the business seventy percent is still in
the<00:03:24.910> industry<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:26.160> consumer<00:03:27.160> segments

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
the industry and that consumer segments

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.000 
the industry and that consumer segments
are<00:03:27.700> what<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:27.910> call<00:03:28.120> that<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.750> prosumer<00:03:29.290> you

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
are what I call that the prosumer you

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.800 
are what I call that the prosumer you
know<00:03:30.130> these<00:03:30.280> are<00:03:30.489> professional<00:03:31.209> consumers

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
know these are professional consumers

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.470 
know these are professional consumers
because<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.739> knowledge<00:03:33.160> skills<00:03:33.640> or<00:03:34.000> level<00:03:34.390> of

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
because of knowledge skills or level of

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.770 
because of knowledge skills or level of
interest<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.590> we<00:03:36.040> see<00:03:36.220> developing<00:03:36.820> very

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
interest this we see developing very

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.400 
interest this we see developing very
fast<00:03:37.900> but<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.530> average<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.880> know<00:03:40.030> guy<00:03:40.780> at

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
fast but the average you know guy at

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.810 
fast but the average you know guy at
home<00:03:41.680> with<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:41.980> family<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.370> think<00:03:42.640> that's

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
home with the family I think that's

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.460 
home with the family I think that's
going<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.359> take<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:44.109> lot<00:03:44.739> longer<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:45.450> think<00:03:46.470> what

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
going to take a lot longer I think what

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.170 
going to take a lot longer I think what
we've<00:03:47.709> learnt<00:03:48.100> was<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.640> know<00:03:48.760> with<00:03:48.940> many

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
we've learnt was you know with many

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.699 
we've learnt was you know with many
other<00:03:49.390> companies<00:03:49.630> over<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.140> last<00:03:50.350> couple<00:03:50.530> of

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
other companies over the last couple of

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.660 
other companies over the last couple of
years<00:03:51.060> we<00:03:52.060> didn't<00:03:52.390> really

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
years we didn't really

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.610 
years we didn't really
see<00:03:54.670> or<00:03:54.910> grasp<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.810> manufacturing

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
see or grasp the manufacturing

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.000 
see or grasp the manufacturing
opportunity<00:03:57.340> but<00:03:58.270> the<00:03:58.800> development<00:03:59.800> in<00:03:59.920> the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
opportunity but the development in the

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.010 
opportunity but the development in the
materials<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.880> material<00:04:01.330> properties<00:04:01.810> which

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
materials the material properties which

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.340 
materials the material properties which
we<00:04:02.230> can<00:04:02.380> actually<00:04:02.530> print<00:04:02.950> are<00:04:03.190> now<00:04:04.150> such<00:04:04.990> that

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
we can actually print are now such that

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.110 
we can actually print are now such that
we<00:04:05.500> can<00:04:05.650> actually<00:04:05.770> manufacture<00:04:06.550> final<00:04:06.970> end

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
we can actually manufacture final end

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.860 
we can actually manufacture final end
user<00:04:07.360> parts<00:04:07.870> three<00:04:08.680> or<00:04:08.800> four<00:04:08.830> years<00:04:09.130> ago<00:04:09.870> we

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
user parts three or four years ago we

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.020 
user parts three or four years ago we
didn't<00:04:11.170> really<00:04:11.380> you<00:04:11.830> know<00:04:11.980> believe<00:04:12.610> that<00:04:12.880> we

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
didn't really you know believe that we

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.560 
didn't really you know believe that we
would<00:04:13.209> accelerate<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:14.050> development<00:04:14.200> so<00:04:14.770> fast

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
would accelerate the development so fast

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.289 
would accelerate the development so fast
so<00:04:16.570> that's<00:04:16.750> one<00:04:17.079> thing<00:04:17.320> but<00:04:17.380> also<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:19.180> know

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
so that's one thing but also you know

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.360 
so that's one thing but also you know
for<00:04:19.600> 20<00:04:19.930> years<00:04:20.170> 3d<00:04:20.500> buildings<00:04:20.920> been<00:04:21.070> around

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
for 20 years 3d buildings been around

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.980 
for 20 years 3d buildings been around
right<00:04:21.700> but<00:04:21.940> only<00:04:22.210> in<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.330> last<00:04:22.450> three<00:04:22.750> four

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
right but only in the last three four

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.970 
right but only in the last three four
years<00:04:23.050> has<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.560> got<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.890> media<00:04:24.310> attention<00:04:24.670> why

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
years has it got the media attention why

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.159 
years has it got the media attention why
because<00:04:26.980> the<00:04:27.100> price<00:04:27.310> points<00:04:27.790> of<00:04:28.450> 3d<00:04:28.840> printers

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
because the price points of 3d printers

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.830 
because the price points of 3d printers
have<00:04:29.260> come<00:04:29.500> down<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.890> such<00:04:30.040> a<00:04:30.070> level<00:04:30.340> it's<00:04:31.240> now

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
have come down to such a level it's now

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.750 
have come down to such a level it's now
become<00:04:32.110> accessible<00:04:32.620> for<00:04:32.980> not<00:04:33.520> only<00:04:33.669> the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
become accessible for not only the
