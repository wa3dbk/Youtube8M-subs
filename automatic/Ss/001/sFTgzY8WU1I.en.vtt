you

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.270 

the<00:00:25.820> v70<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:26.540> new<00:00:26.690> car<00:00:26.900> isn't<00:00:27.230> actually

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
the v70 the new car isn't actually

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.010 
the v70 the new car isn't actually
is<00:00:28.610> more<00:00:28.760> of<00:00:28.820> an<00:00:28.910> evolution<00:00:29.420> of<00:00:29.510> the<00:00:29.600> character

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
is more of an evolution of the character

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.080 
is more of an evolution of the character
of<00:00:30.080> existing<00:00:30.560> car<00:00:30.740> today<00:00:30.890> but<00:00:31.280> obviously<00:00:31.970> the

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
of existing car today but obviously the

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.210 
of existing car today but obviously the
most<00:00:32.210> unique<00:00:32.570> part<00:00:32.720> is<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:33.050> rear<00:00:33.230> end<00:00:33.440> where

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
most unique part is the rear end where

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.590 
most unique part is the rear end where
we've<00:00:34.340> put<00:00:34.490> a<00:00:34.520> lot<00:00:34.700> more<00:00:34.760> emphasis<00:00:35.240> we<00:00:35.390> still

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
we've put a lot more emphasis we still

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.790 
we've put a lot more emphasis we still
obviously<00:00:35.840> have<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.050> high<00:00:36.260> mounted<00:00:36.620> tail

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
obviously have the high mounted tail

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.320 
obviously have the high mounted tail
lamps<00:00:37.130> which<00:00:37.340> are<00:00:37.460> very<00:00:37.580> iconic<00:00:37.790> for<00:00:38.240> this

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
lamps which are very iconic for this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.060 
lamps which are very iconic for this
type<00:00:38.480> of<00:00:38.510> vehicle<00:00:38.930> but<00:00:39.740> you'll<00:00:39.920> notice

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
type of vehicle but you'll notice

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.340 
type of vehicle but you'll notice
there's<00:00:40.430> a<00:00:40.520> wrap<00:00:40.850> over<00:00:41.210> tailgate<00:00:41.840> solution

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
there's a wrap over tailgate solution

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.870 
there's a wrap over tailgate solution
with<00:00:42.650> a<00:00:42.680> split<00:00:43.070> line<00:00:43.250> running<00:00:43.490> through<00:00:43.580> the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
with a split line running through the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.960 
with a split line running through the
tail<00:00:44.600> lamp<00:00:44.809> itself<00:00:45.010> that<00:00:46.010> actually<00:00:46.430> gives<00:00:46.700> us

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
tail lamp itself that actually gives us

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.610 
tail lamp itself that actually gives us
more<00:00:47.210> functionality<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:48.110> we<00:00:48.230> get<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.380> bigger

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
more functionality so we get a bigger

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.860 
more functionality so we get a bigger
opening<00:00:48.820> allows<00:00:49.820> us<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.180> incorporate<00:00:50.690> them

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
opening allows us to incorporate them

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.290 
opening allows us to incorporate them
better<00:00:51.080> this<00:00:51.320> tower<00:00:51.860> liftgate<00:00:52.190> operation<00:00:53.120> and

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
better this tower liftgate operation and

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.960 
better this tower liftgate operation and
and<00:00:54.260> gives<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.559> unique<00:00:54.800> shot<00:00:55.340> line<00:00:55.489> solution

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
and gives a unique shot line solution

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.810 
and gives a unique shot line solution
then<00:00:56.120> for<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.450> rear<00:00:56.629> end<00:00:57.129> adds<00:00:58.129> more<00:00:58.340> volume<00:00:58.670> I

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
then for the rear end adds more volume I

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.660 
then for the rear end adds more volume I
mean<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.059> actual<00:00:59.500> v70<00:01:00.500> now<00:01:00.680> I<00:01:00.710> think<00:01:01.010> has<00:01:01.129> 55

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
mean the actual v70 now I think has 55

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.520 
mean the actual v70 now I think has 55
litres<00:01:02.059> more<00:01:02.390> internal<00:01:03.019> volume<00:01:03.110> than<00:01:03.410> before

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
litres more internal volume than before

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.130 
litres more internal volume than before
so<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.760> rear<00:01:04.970> end<00:01:05.180> is<00:01:05.330> obviously<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.750> focal

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
so the rear end is obviously the focal

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.200 
so the rear end is obviously the focal
point<00:01:06.170> for<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.500> piece<00:01:06.650> empty<00:01:06.980> we<00:01:07.790> would<00:01:07.970> like

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
point for the piece empty we would like

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.540 
point for the piece empty we would like
to<00:01:08.240> do<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.750> more<00:01:09.110> dynamic<00:01:09.290> than<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.159> previous

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
to do it more dynamic than the previous

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.930 
to do it more dynamic than the previous
one<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.000> more<00:01:11.780> modern<00:01:12.290> we<00:01:13.010> also<00:01:13.220> have<00:01:13.670> done<00:01:13.909> a

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
one and more modern we also have done a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.140 
one and more modern we also have done a
completely<00:01:14.810> new<00:01:15.200> rear<00:01:15.590> end<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:16.730> is<00:01:16.880> very

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
completely new rear end that is very

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.410 
completely new rear end that is very
important<00:01:17.659> for<00:01:17.840> us<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.230> give<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.310> new<00:01:19.610> rear<00:01:20.150> end

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
important for us to give a new rear end

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.410 
important for us to give a new rear end
to<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.750> customer<00:01:21.229> because<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:22.700> wanted<00:01:23.150> to

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
to the customer because we wanted to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.950 
to the customer because we wanted to
make<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.050> a<00:01:24.200> little<00:01:24.440> bit<00:01:24.680> sport<00:01:24.979> here<00:01:25.310> without

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
make it a little bit sport here without

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.010 
make it a little bit sport here without
compromising<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:28.720> flexibility<00:01:29.720> in<00:01:29.870> the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
compromising the flexibility in the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:43.120 
compromising the flexibility in the
corner

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.529 

the<00:01:44.130> V<00:01:44.250> range<00:01:44.490> has<00:01:44.670> always<00:01:44.909> been<00:01:45.060> let's<00:01:45.390> say

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
the V range has always been let's say

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.200 
the V range has always been let's say
the<00:01:45.659> icon<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> brand<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.210> probably

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the icon of the brand and probably

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.620 
the icon of the brand and probably
always<00:01:48.360> will<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.979> and<00:01:50.479> through<00:01:51.479> this

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
always will be and through this

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.770 
always will be and through this
continuous<00:01:52.200> development<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.210> practical

continuous development and the practical

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.929 
continuous development and the practical
side<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.110> things<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.649> vehicle<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.789> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
side of things of this vehicle it's the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.139 
side of things of this vehicle it's the
best<00:01:57.179> V<00:01:57.770> we've<00:01:58.770> produced<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.310> until<00:01:59.549> now<00:01:59.579> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
best V we've produced up until now the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.840 
best V we've produced up until now the
most<00:02:00.329> flexible<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.020> most<00:02:01.200> luxurious<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.700> it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
most flexible the most luxurious so it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:13.490 
most flexible the most luxurious so it
offers<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.390> customer<00:02:03.750> what<00:02:03.899> he<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.140> wants

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:40.050 

you

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.950 

obviously<00:02:41.060> every<00:02:41.270> time<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.600> do<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> new

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
obviously every time you do a new

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.450 
obviously every time you do a new
vehicle<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.470> want<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.710> be<00:02:42.830> more<00:02:43.190> successful

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
vehicle you want to be more successful

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.090 
vehicle you want to be more successful
than<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.540> predecessor<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.830> with<00:02:45.980> all

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
than the the predecessor and with all

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.190 
than the the predecessor and with all
this<00:02:46.250> added<00:02:46.580> refinement<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.990> better

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
this added refinement and the better

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.100 
this added refinement and the better
driving<00:02:48.680> dynamics<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:50.600> everything<00:02:50.960> that

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
driving dynamics and everything that

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.480 
driving dynamics and everything that
I've<00:02:51.230> mentioned<00:02:51.440> incorporated<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.310> one

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
I've mentioned incorporated in this one

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.950 
I've mentioned incorporated in this one
unique<00:02:52.790> package<00:02:53.210> it<00:02:53.420> should<00:02:53.450> be<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.750> lot<00:02:53.900> more

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
unique package it should be a lot more

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.280 
unique package it should be a lot more
successful<00:02:54.530> than<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.740> pre<00:02:54.890> decision
