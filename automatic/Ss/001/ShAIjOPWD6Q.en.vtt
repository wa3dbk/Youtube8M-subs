00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello and welcome to a 1 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.569
 button tutorial we noticed dependent 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.540
 not the trainer or kratos but 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.160
 i am words pro gamer i would like you 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.210
 actually useful back show now 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.100
 the thing as much as possible for example 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.960
 market blocks like me now in this one 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.590
 It was easy in the hand 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.269
 because you need redstone torch sm5 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.449
 redstone two around the two repeaters too 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.669
 connect 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.410
 the peter must also be completely 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.420
 be set short otherwise that works 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.890
 namely not 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.190
 and of course what duplicate here volt 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.890
 and in this village blog times anticipated that 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.660
 it is not a motto I have it no mods 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.649
 and that is the normal version 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.300
 so that now no 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.940
 go crazy or so I can do the same 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.129
 four times the smartbook does not need more 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.559
 the sweat now so so alba that 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.150
 to connect that 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:11.640
 then it must flash like that so now 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.420
 It moves very fast like you 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.600
 See how it is sometimes so fast 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:24.869
 that the job is still there but the slopes 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.920
 Being in a zoo so so 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.900
 sometimes not as fast as now 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.939
 back in the second floor playboy like 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.210
 not funny at the moment 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.610
 normally probably not enough to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.460
 right time pressed because otherwise it works 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.830
 So it's against me that way 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:50.230
 once again 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.230
 Now say the best and best 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.180
 because like so I try it this way 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.159
 to explain through how to do that yet 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:08.009
 even so the slopes looks quite 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:12.080
 Quick here the smartbook to the mark 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.569
 block is pushed back 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.360
 But the piston is already behind and 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.970
 is going again and again forward 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.260
 that means that such a gap sees there 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.880
 but there are the greens with the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.620
 stick slopes and you have to be right 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.330
 moment runs book press because then with 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.060
 are laptop purely pressed Aldi 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.470
 but as the gentleman go in there pressed away 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:50.730
 all back and minecraft check that 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.620
 not quite and then get out later 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.690
 the smart blog because still thinks that there 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.609
 What does that actually do? 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.989
 forever carry so much space 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.190
 had to try 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.600
 Well, now many were just entering 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.040
 bit yes there had been correct 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:13.319
 New time has seen we have 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:16.859
 from a block 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:25.019
 we did more you need one 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:26.730
 and redstone into office for redstone d5 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:32.969
 redstone to join that too 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:35.900
 five redstone a redstone torch for 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:38.939
 best you need two repeaters the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.280
 on the smallest again 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:46.680
 set are two only then get 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:49.379
 her flashes take it like that 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.159
 of course you have to go here once 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.159
 place and then 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.880
 No 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.380
 there I have to go to the right time 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.800
 if that does not ring there you'll get it 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.300
 I relatively much as you relatively fast 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.370
 you also succeeded 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.780
 there are not really that hard somehow 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.700
 there by chance in the desert that is then 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.810
 really a bit natural 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.609
 difficult conditions 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.040
 then just pick your mother up 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.900
 you somebody who that something 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.610
 actually already with my tutorial and 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.669
 if you still feel like space look 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.410
 on my other channel continue the 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.280
 link in the video description fits 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.280
 purely
