really<00:02:29.959> going<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.380> help<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.709> unless<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.100> know

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
really going to help you unless you know

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.479 
really going to help you unless you know
that<00:02:31.520> kanji<00:02:32.319> so<00:02:33.319> that's<00:02:33.709> why<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.860> say<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.160> learn

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
that kanji so that's why I say you learn

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.720 
that kanji so that's why I say you learn
here<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.700> learn<00:02:35.300> about<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.660> kind<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.870> first<00:02:36.020> um

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
here to learn about the kind of first um

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.680 
here to learn about the kind of first um
the<00:02:37.730> other<00:02:37.760> thing<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:38.180> think<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.420> should<00:02:38.600> learn

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
the other thing I think you should learn

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.820 
the other thing I think you should learn
is<00:02:38.989> numbers<00:02:39.970> like<00:02:40.970> one<00:02:41.270> through<00:02:41.630> ten<00:02:42.410> thousand

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
is numbers like one through ten thousand

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.890 
is numbers like one through ten thousand
or<00:02:42.950> something<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:44.540> so<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.810> can

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
or something like that just so you can

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.570 
or something like that just so you can
deal<00:02:45.140> with<00:02:45.290> Japanese<00:02:45.709> money<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.250> know<00:02:46.400> how<00:02:46.550> to

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
deal with Japanese money and know how to

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.910 
deal with Japanese money and know how to
tell<00:02:46.790> time<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:48.080> then<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.290> other<00:02:48.470> thing<00:02:48.530> I

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
tell time and then the other thing I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.920 
tell time and then the other thing I
think<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.340> should<00:02:49.519> learn<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:50.000> have<00:02:50.690> this<00:02:50.870> be

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
think you should learn and have this be

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.020 
think you should learn and have this be
like<00:02:51.800> after<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.370> learn<00:02:52.519> katakana<00:02:53.000> and

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
like after you learn katakana and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.330 
like after you learn katakana and
numbers<00:02:53.570> then<00:02:54.319> if<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.830> want<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.069> get<00:02:55.160> started

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
numbers then if you want to get started

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.670 
numbers then if you want to get started
on<00:02:55.550> grammar<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:56.120> say<00:02:56.330> learn<00:02:56.630> grammar<00:02:56.930> while<00:02:57.470> you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
on grammar I say learn grammar while you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.960 
on grammar I say learn grammar while you
learn<00:02:57.980> how<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.400> give<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.230> receive<00:03:00.230> directions

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
learn how to give and receive directions

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.580 
learn how to give and receive directions
because<00:03:01.970> that's<00:03:02.390> probably<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.470> most

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
because that's probably the most

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.960 
because that's probably the most
practical<00:03:03.800> thing<00:03:04.190> you're<00:03:04.459> going<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.640> learn<00:03:04.760> in

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
practical thing you're going to learn in

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.370 
practical thing you're going to learn in
any<00:03:05.180> foreign<00:03:05.569> language<00:03:05.870> is<00:03:05.989> how<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.200> give

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
any foreign language is how to give

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.050 
any foreign language is how to give
directions<00:03:06.680> like<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.400> first<00:03:07.580> thing<00:03:07.819> you<00:03:07.910> need

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
directions like the first thing you need

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.520 
directions like the first thing you need
to<00:03:08.120> know<00:03:08.209> how<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.510> do<00:03:08.690> because<00:03:09.290> you're<00:03:09.410> just

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
to know how to do because you're just

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.690 
to know how to do because you're just
going<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.769> be<00:03:09.890> wandering<00:03:10.280> around<00:03:10.310> and

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
going to be wandering around and

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.630 
going to be wandering around and
traveling<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.300> stuff<00:03:11.450> like<00:03:11.600> that<00:03:11.660> and

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
traveling and stuff like that and

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.880 
traveling and stuff like that and
grammar<00:03:13.840> directions<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:14.989> really<00:03:15.739> really

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
grammar directions is really really

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.150 
grammar directions is really really
complicated<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:17.630> any<00:03:18.170> language<00:03:18.380> just<00:03:18.890> because

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
complicated in any language just because

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.750 
complicated in any language just because
there's<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:20.030> many<00:03:20.120> different<00:03:20.390> grammatical

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
there's so many different grammatical

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.310 
there's so many different grammatical
patterns<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.060> can<00:03:23.239> use<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.570> give

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
patterns that you can use to give

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.350 
patterns that you can use to give
someone<00:03:24.590> directions<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:25.880> it's<00:03:26.120> going<00:03:26.299> to

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
someone directions and so it's going to

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.110 
someone directions and so it's going to
give<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.720> like<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.680> really<00:03:28.100> really<00:03:28.280> good<00:03:28.579> place
