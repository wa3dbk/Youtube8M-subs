00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.220 
just get rid off with these mac wets and
they<00:03:33.640> might<00:03:33.850> be<00:03:34.270> a<00:03:34.300> little<00:03:34.360> bit<00:03:34.690> more<00:03:34.810> money<00:03:35.050> or

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
they might be a little bit more money or

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.930 
they might be a little bit more money or
eighteen<00:03:35.680> dollars<00:03:35.890> but<00:03:36.250> they<00:03:36.370> working<00:03:36.790> really

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
eighteen dollars but they working really

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.690 
eighteen dollars but they working really
really<00:03:37.030> great<00:03:37.390> also<00:03:37.990> this<00:03:38.170> is<00:03:38.440> um<00:03:38.770> twenty

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
really great also this is um twenty

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.240 
really great also this is um twenty
dollars<00:03:40.000> i<00:03:40.120> think<00:03:40.390> but<00:03:41.080> this<00:03:41.230> lacks<00:03:41.530> like<00:03:41.830> such

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
dollars i think but this lacks like such

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.120 
dollars i think but this lacks like such
a<00:03:42.459> long<00:03:42.760> time<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:44.080> these<00:03:44.230> do<00:03:44.560> last<00:03:44.800> a<00:03:44.980> long<00:03:45.070> time

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
a long time so these do last a long time

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.980 
a long time so these do last a long time
if<00:03:45.430> you<00:03:45.520> rinse<00:03:45.670> on<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.880> half<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.270> get<00:03:46.420> like<00:03:46.600> 45

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
if you rinse on the half you get like 45

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.870 
if you rinse on the half you get like 45
in<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.230> pack<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.650> then<00:03:47.920> if<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.490> ever<00:03:48.550> come<00:03:48.730> in

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.550 
in a pack and then if you ever come in
half<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:49.209> end<00:03:49.330> up<00:03:49.420> getting<00:03:49.570> like<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:50.110> hundred

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
half you end up getting like a hundred

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.560 
half you end up getting like a hundred
in<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:50.920> pack<00:03:51.100> so<00:03:51.640> it's<00:03:51.790> really<00:03:52.030> great<00:03:52.330> if<00:03:52.540> you

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310
