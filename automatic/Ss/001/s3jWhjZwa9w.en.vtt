00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.460
 I can not say where he bit him but 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.970
 it was in the neck or in the face in the hand 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.490

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.430

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.540
 lift from fear cried cried and 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.420
 good 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.190
 an aspect a big person could 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:37.730
 recognize it I never saw it my life was 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:41.760

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:45.270
 long hair crumbles morocho straight up 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.920
 the waist had a scar on the side 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.930
 left of the face that's why I 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.210
 notice that you have a scar in case 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.900
 come with these features and is 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.750
 hurt bitten by a dog so 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.930
 Well, I try to find it if the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.270
 lead to find always open 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.610
 always always but now, well, I'm going to 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.130
 have to take certain measures and close 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.130
 the family 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.430
 I screamed and the only thing that nobody heard anything 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.010
 even medicine did not listen but 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.150
 the dog went and I thank the dog was 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.340
 the one who saved me saved us and told me 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.670
 increased production for him to find 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.040
 nest so that it does not come back, I do not 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.880

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.370

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.950
