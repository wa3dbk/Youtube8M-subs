00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.049
 the friends and welcome 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.820
 today a little new release story 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.289
 but as the very first little ones take in 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.210
 against the background blessed in the collective 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.760
 The big player plays free for everyone 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.039
 30 34 2 white no longer had exactly 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.990
 a 20s streak then have a preface 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.760
 gets this fucking field order or 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.529
 a can strike gladly true but there has 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.680
 somebody has got up with it, too 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.300
 still used to get so how 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.550
 I'm writing a new release story today 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.050
 a little something else but worth it 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.340
 heard myself hear so I start 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.530
 Just a casual fluffy lawyer 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.079
 claim I went to school 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.969
 and I have 17 18h 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.840
 school certificate imitation on one 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.079
 private school 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.640
 that was in stade that is so 30 kilometers 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.160
 It always has to speak from the sea 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.570
 driving back and forth with the train and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.329
 it was friday just like normal day 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.129
 always can remember it well 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.119
 and I had been there for hours and hours 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.830
 Actually, Mr. bock on it I have to 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.390
 honestly, no role model to say 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.010
 but modest, I do have a 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.659
 Bit laughed after celebrated 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.020
 pulled through with my colleague dennis 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.509
 who lived in dollern that is so 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.310
 if you are from start up book school 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.900
 So she went with charging stations 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.600
 then we had to get out if we completely 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.710
 normal to the station took care of 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.450
 The train has been serviced and have a train around 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.900
 just missed five minutes because you have to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.110
 to the next stop we wait waiting 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.850
 then the train and other direction 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.280
 homeland 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.720
 and we have to introduce myself again 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.780
 colleague dennis must be like before 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.579
 get off on the right side and the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.180
 colors in the train station and are 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.040
 totally chattering then willlessly and 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.950
 we wonder only so much short moment 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.049
 that the ground so let x 100 meter 150 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 meter is held before while in 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.659
 Station at the station of contrast to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.280
 get off 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.079
 but it has at the moment, he wondered 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.680
 but rather so correct because he has direct 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.030
 I have to deal with the ten correctly 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.750
 a few months 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.300
 undermined when he got out 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.900
 I wonder even back in 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.080
 a compartment and she at once like me 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.400
 sat on the 1 place two places ago with 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.930
 against the fans, I celebrate and watch 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.530
 then suddenly many see as follows 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.930
 People in front of the train stand in front of the train 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.610
 stand and then under me at the window 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.790
 I watch out so I see her 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.790
 kill 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:44.760
 the train breaks up students here 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:48.150
 just do not get out of e-mails like that 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.030
 easy to walk I have under the legs 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.680
 short and very similar to 10 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.010
 and what did he pull on his arm? 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.220
 pulled and belonged to the poor 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:06.870
 seven-year-old child I say completely 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.750
 honestly the child was yes I would 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.650
 not that not pejorative inc 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.209
 Of course I can now go to details 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.400
 go in but the arm hung only one 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.890
 a few shreds want to say why 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.890
 and that was such a day for me guys 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.540
 I have to say pretty much exactly 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.730
 So number shortly as an explanation 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.560
 We entered the station 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.150
 two children wanted to join 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.659
 closed barriers overflowed 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.599
 the one child has done so 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:45.750
 another child did not make it anymore 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:48.659
 was overrun by the track and recorded 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.849
 operator is rolled over by the web 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.840
 either you lose a way or measure 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.849
 when is a pid 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.969
 Normally you put it immediately is yes 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.319
 clear as a ground yes and had to go back 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.579
 get out 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.230
 I can still remember it well 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.739
 that I always do not part-load them 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:10.090
 shocked and then the conductor on me 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.409
 to see the old gentleman in 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.840
 you have to look at your room too 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:17.259
 Of course, nobody can put that into perspective 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.019
 but it looked like it was the fault 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:22.570
 his life is not worth gladly there 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.320
 We had to feel like three hours 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.599
 wait to be seen as the train back 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.479
 where she's driven like she's been 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:33.900
 kid had all been natural 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.310
 so it totally shocked yeah 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.659
 had previously said I was like 17 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.250
 before that, I never knew how 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:43.810
 someone died before me or 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.250
 generally in my circle so i had 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.720
 I only briefly look where in Hamburg 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.070
 and that was, I must say 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.509
 the worst day ever in the 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.030
 live because that's something like that 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.880
 I still have to think about it 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.310
 you know that was a bad thing anyway 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.500
 the child died and that is me 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.370
 have seen how it is under the track 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.509
 but was the worst of a whole 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.090
 that was the situation after that 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.940
 one and a half hours for two hours 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.650
 then dare our side has arrived 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.099
 then you saw a woman all over 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.620
 went fast and I do not know 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.360
 how much do you want 100 meters kilometers 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.710
 that still heard the screaming that was 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:30.430
 the mother and the mother have her then 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:33.849
 child must see and how the 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.779
 I will always scream in my 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.189
 So head have 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:40.489
 I've heard so much but that has it 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:43.889
 the pain and everything that was 

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:46.169
 a terrible day so you have to 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.059
 yes I do not even know why I do that 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.379
 but so far that's just one 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:51.089
 the worst experience not 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:52.319
 of course, there was no 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:53.580
 tip how to deal with it me 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.580
 had everyone needs it for so 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.139
 but if I'm in the process then 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.550
 afterwards drove with the train and 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.019
 right now also on the spot I had to 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.659
 then continued to go to school 

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:04.889
 the next weeks and months always 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.539
 have passed the place again 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:10.769
 were clearly flowers et cetera but there 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:14.789
 it was a bit like that then 

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:16.080
 grumbling in the stomach has become what will 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.269
 I get out there or I have it 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.709
 I learned not to dance anymore because 

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:21.119
 I would not have the two hours earlier 

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:23.490
 I probably would have ended 

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:24.599
 nevertheless delayed track and indeed 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:30.389
 because the whole rail traffic 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:31.800
 failed but yes this has the abt 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.719
 i have to ask the most requested day in my life 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.759
 say honest and in that sense today times 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:39.050
 look a little quieter again 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.050
 and clean
