00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:12.860
 Now today I bring you a video of 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:16.039
 recycling reuse of these well 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.860
 so if you have a sweater that does not 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.869
 like or that you have tired of him or 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.480
 you already know what to do with it but not 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.789
 you want to put the bear I think this is 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.669
 your video you already have after seeing yourself there 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.540
 since I do not know how much boring 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.090
 in the closet until I've decided and 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.370
 what is I going to do then it is trick 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.920
 and explain how a long neck has 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.039
 that exercises and I will use the neck 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.380
 to make a chicken out of these scarf 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:48.560
 I will use the sleeves to expand 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.290
 some heaters and I'm going to use the 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.500
 rest of the body of the jersey to make 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.730
 some mittens a little and a band 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.670
 for the hair and for the ears 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.140
 so let's go to it 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.140
 how to make mittens 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.159
 jersey materials that we're going to 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.939
 reuse needle scissors and then machine 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.799
 of sewing and fleece if you want to do 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.700
 your mittens only with the fabric of 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.060
 jersey without the fleece id at minute 2 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.130
 30 on the fleece we measure the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.310
 outline of our hand you can 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.189
 mark with a chalk or with a pencil 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.819
 special for fabrics and we cut it here 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.630
 As you can see I have already cut 3 and this 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.630
 it is the fourth and last 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:48.399
 keep in mind that the size of the lining 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.399
 It must be greater than your hands 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.640
 and here we have the 4 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:01.380
 Now what we have to do is sew 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.650
 on the inside what would go through 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.000
 inside this area we leave that 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.880
 without catching 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.220
 here we have it sewn as you see 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.840
 I have sewn this last part if I wanted 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.840
 jce stay with the mittens only 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.180
 made of the fleece so it would be finished 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.519
 sewing the end 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.879
 this would be the final result if only 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.879
 the infidels 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.530
 but as in this case we're going to 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.930
 use to put them inside the fabric 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.860
 Jersey we are going to stop this 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.569
 Now we measure the fabric of the jersey 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.700
 measured so that you on a large piece 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.550
 not tight 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.200
 here we have the four parts that go to 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.450
 conform our two mittens and 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.040
 cut back now we have to put the two 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.709
 faces that are going to go outside 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.750
 external one against the other leaving 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.760
 by the two extremes the ones that are going to go 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.349
 inside 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:05.580
 and what we have to do is sew this 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:10.710
 part by the external zone 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.200
 we already have it sewn and we will cut the 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.090
 part of the outside that we have left 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.250
 where we have taken the form os 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.350
 I recommend leaving plenty of fabric because 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.200
 if you can not fray this fabric 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.140
 jersey for mittens only with the 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.680
 Jersey fabric would already be made 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.030
 you turn around and they can be put 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.580
 but as in this case I have 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.250
 decided to put the fleece lining 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.680
 we left inverted and now what 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.340
 we have to do is sew the lining 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.629
 fly 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.959
 to the mitten for the part of 20 leaving 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:50.680
 this external part to be able to put the 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.970
 hand and be able to sew it to the other side of 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.680
 the mitten 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.890
 what we have to do at this moment 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.950
 is to flip the mitten when 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.920
 we have already turned around we will have 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.770
 sew the top part that has 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.240
 left loose 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.240
 this part of here 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.639
 here you can see how I sewed it 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.069
 Be careful not to see 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:23.109
 by neither side then 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:23.109
 will try to make a few small stitches 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.740
 Now you have to repeat the same 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.590
 procedure on the other hand pla and already 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.500
 we have our two mittens with lining 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.030
 polar or without fleece if you prefer 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.570
 if you are also interested in doing 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.720
 a cap a warmers a band by 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.460
 The hair and a scarf collar is at 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.840
 so much because you are going to see them in the next 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.860
 videos until then 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.860
 see you
