00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
other script this other thing is a lot

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.189 
other script this other thing is a lot
of<00:00:28.380> hot<00:00:28.560> key<00:00:28.800> script<00:00:29.220> called<00:00:29.429> moving<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:30.779> what

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
of hot key script called moving and what

of hot key script called moving and what
this<00:00:31.320> script<00:00:31.619> allows<00:00:31.800> me<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.940> i<00:00:32.969> have

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
this script allows me to do when i have

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.160 
this script allows me to do when i have
a<00:00:33.180> table<00:00:33.360> open<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.460> move<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.809> four

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
a table open is move it to the four

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.080 
a table open is move it to the four
corners<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.590> my<00:00:37.680> screen<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:40.670> what<00:00:41.670> i<00:00:41.700> do<00:00:41.820> that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
corners of my screen so what i do that

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.270 
corners of my screen so what i do that
most<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> times<00:00:43.379> my<00:00:43.649> tables<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.219> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
most of the times my tables are going to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.700 
most of the times my tables are going to
be<00:00:44.370> tiled<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> upper<00:00:45.180> left<00:00:45.360> hand<00:00:45.450> corner

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
be tiled in the upper left hand corner

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.860 
be tiled in the upper left hand corner
but<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.950> there's<00:00:47.700> action<00:00:48.090> happening<00:00:48.480> i<00:00:48.690> can

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
but if there's action happening i can

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.479 
but if there's action happening i can
move<00:00:49.020> them<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.879> different<00:00:51.149> locations<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
move them to the different locations and

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.970 
move them to the different locations and
have<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> better<00:00:54.379> than<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.559> follow<00:00:55.710> hands

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
have a better than just follow hands

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.810 
have a better than just follow hands
individually<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.930> all<00:00:57.930> right<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.789> let<00:00:59.789> me

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
individually so all right now let me

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.279 
individually so all right now let me
talk<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> little<00:01:00.239> bit<00:01:00.420> about<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.899> software

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
talk a little bit about the software

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.149 
talk a little bit about the software
called<00:01:01.440> table<00:01:01.770> ninja<00:01:02.010> table<00:01:02.309> ninjer<00:01:02.550> just

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
called table ninja table ninjer just

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.670 
called table ninja table ninjer just
allows<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.760> program<00:01:06.570> different<00:01:07.260> keys<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
allows you to program different keys and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.330 
allows you to program different keys and
different<00:01:08.540> mouse<00:01:09.540> buttons<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.890> two<00:01:11.189> different

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
different mouse buttons to two different

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.630 
different mouse buttons to two different
settings<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.439> allows<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.890> navigate<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
settings and allows you to navigate the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.399 
settings and allows you to navigate the
tables<00:01:14.970> much<00:01:15.750> easier<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.630> set<00:01:18.900> you

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
tables much easier so you can set you

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.770 
tables much easier so you can set you
can<00:01:19.500> put<00:01:19.710> buttons<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.220> bed<00:01:20.430> call<00:01:20.820> check<00:01:21.450> fold

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
can put buttons for bed call check fold

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.590 
can put buttons for bed call check fold
etc<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:23.360> for<00:01:24.360> me<00:01:25.460> in<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.970> table<00:01:27.150> control

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
etc but for me in the table control

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.210 
etc but for me in the table control
setting<00:01:28.759> one<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.939> things<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:32.180> use<00:01:33.180> is

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
setting one of the things that I use is

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.499 
setting one of the things that I use is
cycle<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.369> first<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.820> line<00:01:35.970> table<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.450> is

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
cycle to first in line table this is

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.170 
cycle to first in line table this is
really<00:01:36.780> useful<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.350> basically<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.460> there's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
really useful so basically when there's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.870 
really useful so basically when there's
a<00:01:39.240> bunch<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.600> things<00:01:39.979> happening<00:01:40.979> let's<00:01:41.729> say<00:01:41.850> I

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
a bunch of things happening let's say I

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.370 
a bunch of things happening let's say I
have<00:01:41.939> actions<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.659> four<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.049> five<00:01:43.200> different

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
have actions on four or five different

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.010 
have actions on four or five different
tables<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.399> whenever<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.759> hit<00:01:44.880> our<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.720> brings

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
tables then whenever I hit our it brings

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.580 
tables then whenever I hit our it brings
up<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> table<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.890> has<00:01:47.189> waited<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> longest

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
up the table that has waited the longest

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.990 
up the table that has waited the longest
so<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:49.740> you're<00:01:49.890> playing<00:01:50.040> eight<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.670> ten<00:01:50.820> tables

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so if you're playing eight to ten tables

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.789 
so if you're playing eight to ten tables
or<00:01:51.299> more<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.590> useful

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
or more this is really really useful

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.670 
or more this is really really useful
because<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.509> just<00:01:54.509> allows<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
because it just allows you to go to to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.249 
because it just allows you to go to to
where<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.920> action<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.969> pod<00:01:57.149> betting<00:01:57.450> my

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
where the action is for pod betting my

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.859 
where the action is for pod betting my
by<00:01:58.920> default<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.520> open<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.060> two-and-a-half<00:02:00.360> big

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
by default I open to two-and-a-half big

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.950 
by default I open to two-and-a-half big
blinds<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.100> set<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
blinds and I can just set that and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.690 
blinds and I can just set that and
you'll<00:02:03.960> see<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.259> by<00:02:05.009> default<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
you'll see that by default is going to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.830 
you'll see that by default is going to
open<00:02:05.880> 25<00:02:06.360> cents<00:02:07.129> now<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.060> if<00:02:09.300> I

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
open 25 cents now I just so like if I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.950 
open 25 cents now I just so like if I
have<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.140> good<00:02:10.349> hand

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
have a good hand

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.630

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
on the seat as soon as you open the

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.870

table it automatically sits you down but
I<00:06:31.590> the<00:06:32.590> reason<00:06:32.770> I<00:06:33.009> don't<00:06:33.070> have<00:06:33.310> that<00:06:33.340> setting

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
I the reason I don't have that setting

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.249 
I the reason I don't have that setting
is<00:06:34.650> because<00:06:35.910> sometimes<00:06:36.910> all<00:06:37.330> want<00:06:37.990> to<00:06:38.080> pick

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
is because sometimes all want to pick

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.450 
is because sometimes all want to pick
what<00:06:38.410> see<00:06:38.590> don't<00:06:38.740> want<00:06:38.860> to<00:06:38.919> be<00:06:38.979> on<00:06:40.259> all<00:06:41.259> right

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:01.590 
it might seem a little confusing at

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.940 
it might seem a little confusing at
first<00:08:01.650> when<00:08:02.160> the<00:08:02.700> action<00:08:03.090> is<00:08:03.360> just<00:08:04.140> popping<00:08:04.860> up

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:04.950 
first when the action is just popping up

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.750 
first when the action is just popping up
here<00:08:05.160> and<00:08:05.250> there<00:08:05.370> but<00:08:06.770> it<00:08:07.770> does<00:08:08.280> like<00:08:08.520> I<00:08:08.610> said

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:08.760 
here and there but it does like I said

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.730 
here and there but it does like I said
it<00:08:09.030> does<00:08:09.390> make<00:08:09.570> multi<00:08:09.900> tabling<00:08:10.140> a<00:08:10.380> lot<00:08:10.590> easier

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:10.740 
it does make multi tabling a lot easier

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.210 
it does make multi tabling a lot easier
and<00:08:12.080> once<00:08:13.080> you<00:08:13.200> get<00:08:13.320> used<00:08:13.500> to<00:08:13.590> it<00:08:13.650> it's<00:08:14.070> pretty

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 
and once you get used to it it's pretty

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.430 
and once you get used to it it's pretty
easy
