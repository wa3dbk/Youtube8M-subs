00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.460
 gameplay my name is yuri aksyonov and 1 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.589
 game we have today this game is under 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.059
 called boulder dash let's see 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.469
 what is she like in the game 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.900
 there is a fairly large number 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.219
 parks with levels in which you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.740
 have to play each of them 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.570
 opens as you collect 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.340
 a certain number of stars 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.960
 Well, let's go to the game 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.810
 continue with the mission that I 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.670
 stopped and look at this 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.980
 creation pear in principle interesting 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.960
 like quite enough here 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.180
 There are two types of control 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.860
 as I have and you can say with 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.590
 using such a joystick which 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.020
 appears anywhere that is where you are 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.180
 and then go out there it can also appears 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.090
 enable standard joystick 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.980
 have an ipad and use it to drive in 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.110
 general who is comfortable but I still 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.360
 The control method seemed like this 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.340
 here is the most effective you need 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.010
 explore these underground mines 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.680
 it is desirable to collect all the crystal checks and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.379
 survive so god forbid you don't kill a 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.960
 here are such horrible stones otherwise 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.990
 all it will be very sad and hurt and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.670
 also here what is here besides 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.369
 stones present also also 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.400
 various enemy units that 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.200
 strive to kill you but you yourself can 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.850
 cope with them basically you with them 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.670
 can handle because 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.439
 drop a stone on top of them let's 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.020
 let's see what is there still here is 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.970
 another choice of heroes you can 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.960
 unlock various heroes by gathering 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.820
 certain resources that are here 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.610
 probably not quite in plain sight 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.380
 hidden and in general but thanks to this you 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.229
 can unlock other characters 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.750
 and play already for them an interesting toy 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.909
 may delay for long enough than 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.240
 then you will play those missions 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.970
 getting harder is unbearable and already 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.460
 probably so easy to win will not work 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.409
 in general, who liked the toy swing 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.719
 Well, we turn to the second tarot game 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.990
 called transmission connector commune 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.939
 Kate and that is to connect and communication 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.320
 i.e 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.939
 make some connection let's 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.680
 let's just play the toy 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.530
 divinely you start with what 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.270
 you start the graph style there everything is very 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.700
 just then play or 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.920
 in phone mode there is already a little bit 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.200
 harder on, so I stopped now 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.140
 on the computer and then there will be something else 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.150
 mega cool and heavy let's go 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.800
 in the mission of the month you try and and about 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.340
 I will try to explain you the essence 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.530
 games 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.500
 the toy is made in such a stylish 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.960
 me about the new species as you now see and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.290
 what do we have here do we have a source 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.290
 signal this here is this box 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.980
 which is now the volume and we still have 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.210
 others are circles and squares in general 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.190
 this central square is this 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.410
 the end point that is of the square and 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.500
 the signal can not transmit and there 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.320
 we need to signal double let's 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.030
 let's try to go like something let's say 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.070
 give a signal here further a signal here 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.970
 We can't give a husband a signal 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:09.030
 here there is so from this circles 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.800
 another circle signal and transmit the signal 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.690
 here and we have to do what to power 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.430
 chain again but as you see it is not 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.160
 absolutely can get to tear 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.360
 chains need to tap on them and 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.700
 then the chain will break and you can 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.860
 accordingly, that's how to go through it 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.620
 let's see what we did 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.750
 the chain we restored and connected and 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.550
 see the result in each mission 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.760
 you can get a definite amount 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.140
 stars to specifically in this mission can 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.700
 get 3 stars 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.950
 it says here that you can 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.560
 get every time it's perfect 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.990
 different criterion natural criteria you 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.150
 can be repeated but mostly they 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.610
 quite diverse and interesting 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.560
 further missions will be even more difficult 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.720
 so everything will just be done like this 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.959
 was at the very beginning as you see here 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.709
 there are no cubes, but we donâ€™t care 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.930
 have to 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.940
 in general, who loves such stylish and 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.370
 unusual puzzles definitely you 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.470
 I advise the game and I think in general the game 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.170
 like quite a lot of it by the way 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.440
 free and high quality made 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.780
 the third game is called daboll match i don't 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.970
 I know it seems the French game can 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.720
 be of course spanish is not very good 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.850
 I understand these here all the hole 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.900
 whose but I still thought it was that 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.120
 then something french choose one of 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.370
 characters more precisely from the colors of teams from 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.070
 red or blue let's choose 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.050
 red and try now to play us 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.730
 offer to show learning but I him 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.890
 already seen and now I will explain to you the essence 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.720
 the game is a kind of some 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.390
 football that happens here on such 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.190
 here arenas and there are enough involved 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.680
 severe men stoppers 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.470
 and they are here to play here so here I drum 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.480
 the core goes to the arena like this 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.400
 the way that is sufficiently high quality 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.530
 sea cartoon paste in the game 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.630
 present and here are our players with us 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.630
 there are two arrows in the left corner 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.150
 Now they will appear in the Dr. which we 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.450
 we can rotate ours like this 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.150
 hero dodge the enemy and our 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:20.540
 the most important task to bypass the enemy 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.980
 goalkeeper and score him a goal periodically 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.410
 other members will appear here 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.040
 your team and thanks to what you 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.330
 you can and actually easier and faster 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.610
 score goals 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.040
 If you get into a mess, it will be 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.810
 there will be a fight that will take away 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.229
 you have a little time but at the same time 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.760
 it will and neutralize your 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.790
 rivals and thanks to that you can 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.000
 break through to your rival's goal and 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.590
 score goals and with the help of such 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.900
 in general, a toy is enough blows 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.720
 unusually high quality made to possess 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.350
 just great 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.680
 animated here is such a schedule 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.780
 and great inserts but i think 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.240
 toy for a long time you will not delay because 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.800
 that it is very much monotonous nothing 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.740
 new in the game does not appear 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.960
 and this of course is very sad and 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.540
 the last game for today is the runner under 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.419
 the name of the soccer ran in this game you 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.479
 play for the Japanese soccer player who 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:20.860
 He played football in his yard pencil sword 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:23.270
 on the wall and his evil neighbor could not stand it and 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.130
 chased him in general such a picture 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.530
 you can watch people in many countries 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.630
 peace toy its atmosphere a little bit 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.060
 scare the very surfer but still she 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.120
 quite distinctively here we play for 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.000
 such a young football player who 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.150
 learn to play myself play in the yard 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.030
 kicks on the wall and what is his task a 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.770
 his task is to escape from his pursuer so 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.020
 let you become just want you 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.389
 show what happens next in the end 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.960
 our footballer runs out to the stadium and 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:56.060
 Here it is waiting for a whole bunch of different already 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.720
 professional football players whom he 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.510
 is coming 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.370
 circle what they can do and could not 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.919
 do tackles and so on but here it is 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.449
 finest hour he reached the goalkeeper and him 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.030
 you need to do such here 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:09.650
 combinations in general do svaypy in that 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.900
 direction which points us 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.360
 arrow and score goals for it we get 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.490
 extra bonus points after that 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.620
 we continue to run again and run already 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.600
 until the next stadium but run already 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.789
 will be harder on the way more 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.199
 number of obstacles 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:27.430
 appear sometimes on the way maybe 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:29.990
 wall to be present to overcome 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:33.350
 walls must be taped like this 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:35.150
 screens your character apina is a ball forward 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.010
 and thanks to this can this wall 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.950
 demolish here there are various upgrades 

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:42.650
 all this can be improved by the collected 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.570
 you earlier while playing coins 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.760
 runner principle is pretty good to me 

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.960
 like who likes football who likes 

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.060
 Japanese theme 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.860
 I definitely advise you to read 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.750
 this game because really 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.240
 interesting to play despite the fact that 

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.729
 very much still it reminds me 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.750
 with a surfer with everything even in 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:01.370
 your bonuses 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.440
 Well , thank you all very much for 

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:08.380
 attention subscribe to the channel put 

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.380
 thumbs up all bye and until new meetings
