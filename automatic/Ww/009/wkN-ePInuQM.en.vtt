really liked as I was reading about the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.520 
really liked as I was reading about the
system<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.150> once<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.900> fire<00:01:31.200> these

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
system is that once you fire these

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.670 
system is that once you fire these
they're<00:01:31.829> gone<00:01:32.060> there's<00:01:33.060> no<00:01:33.210> cooldown<00:01:34.049> reload

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.499 
they're gone there's no cooldown reload
time<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.130> none<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.759> these<00:01:36.299> are<00:01:36.420> an

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
time or none of that this these are an

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.630 
time or none of that this these are an
actual<00:01:36.840> form<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.170> currency<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.770> star<00:01:38.369> citizen

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
actual form of currency in star citizen

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.600 
actual form of currency in star citizen
universe<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.740> you'll<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> either<00:01:41.189> carry

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
universe so you'll have to either carry

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.450 
universe so you'll have to either carry
them<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.180> ship<00:01:42.710> extras<00:01:43.710> which<00:01:44.189> will<00:01:44.340> take

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
them on your ship extras which will take

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.190 
them on your ship extras which will take
up<00:01:44.640> cargo<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:45.210> you're<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.049> go

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
up cargo or you're going to have to go

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.609 
up cargo or you're going to have to go
and<00:01:46.439> rearm<00:01:46.920> yourself<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:48.320> different<00:01:49.320> points

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and rearm yourself at different points

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.340 
and rearm yourself at different points
like<00:01:49.799> landing<00:01:50.189> points<00:01:51.020> asteroids<00:01:52.020> space

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
like landing points asteroids space

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.800 
like landing points asteroids space
stations<00:01:52.759> Lana<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.119> sort<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.420> thing<00:01:54.479> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
stations Lana it's that sort of thing so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.649 
stations Lana it's that sort of thing so
that's<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> add<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> much<00:01:56.670> different<00:01:56.939> it

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
that's going to add a much different it

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.600 
that's going to add a much different it
gives<00:01:57.899> me<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.110> much<00:01:58.500> different<00:01:58.770> perspective<00:01:59.549> on

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
gives me a much different perspective on

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.880 
gives me a much different perspective on
this<00:01:59.790> ship<00:02:00.000> its<00:02:00.180> those<00:02:00.450> our<00:02:00.659> last<00:02:01.200> resort<00:02:01.469> kind

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
this ship its those our last resort kind

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.959 
this ship its those our last resort kind
of<00:02:01.950> things<00:02:02.159> I'm<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.729> trying<00:02:02.880> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
of things I'm not going to be trying to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.539 
of things I'm not going to be trying to
hunt<00:02:03.180> people<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.320> shoot<00:02:05.280> those

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
hunt people with this and shoot those

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.219 
hunt people with this and shoot those
because<00:02:05.790> after<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.540> shoot<00:02:06.689> those<00:02:06.899> that's<00:02:07.140> all

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
because after you shoot those that's all

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.600 
because after you shoot those that's all
you<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.160> otherwise

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
cool but you're still gonna have to fly

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.059 
cool but you're still gonna have to fly
this<00:02:13.319> massive

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
this massive

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.280

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
and yeah this I mean this is the only

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.470 
and yeah this I mean this is the only
ship<00:02:44.969> with<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.299> tailgate<00:02:45.599> oh<00:02:47.480> absolutely

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
ship with this tailgate oh absolutely

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.589 
ship with this tailgate oh absolutely
it's<00:02:49.079> a<00:02:49.169> cargo<00:02:49.500> runner<00:02:49.709> i<00:02:49.980> I'm<00:02:50.969> really<00:02:51.389> curious

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
it's a cargo runner i I'm really curious

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.699 
it's a cargo runner i I'm really curious
to<00:02:51.780> see<00:02:51.989> how<00:02:52.139> they're<00:02:52.290> going<00:02:52.379> to<00:02:52.439> implement

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
to see how they're going to implement

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.509 
to see how they're going to implement
this<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.310> mean<00:02:54.319> considering<00:02:55.319> now<00:02:55.469> all<00:02:55.859> he<00:02:56.280> said

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
this I mean considering now all he said

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.429 
this I mean considering now all he said
all<00:02:56.760> they<00:02:56.909> say<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.480> once<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.139> enter<00:02:58.409> a

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
all they say is that once you enter a

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.959 
all they say is that once you enter a
planet<00:02:58.859> it's<00:02:58.980> going<00:02:59.129> to<00:02:59.189> be<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> cinematic

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
planet it's going to be a cinematic

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.819 
planet it's going to be a cinematic
cutscene<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.569> then<00:03:00.689> you're<00:03:01.469> just<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.739> the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
cutscene and then you're just on the

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.110 
cutscene and then you're just on the
ground<00:03:02.069> well<00:03:02.340> what's<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.609> point<00:03:02.909> of<00:03:02.969> this

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
ground well what's the point of this

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.270 
ground well what's the point of this
there<00:03:03.750> has<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.290> be<00:03:04.349> some<00:03:04.590> sort<00:03:04.739> of<00:03:04.859> loading

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
there has to be some sort of loading

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.149 
there has to be some sort of loading
system<00:03:05.669> I<00:03:05.790> would<00:03:05.849> think<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.599> you<00:03:07.379> either<00:03:07.889> you

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
system I would think that you either you

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.550 
system I would think that you either you
pay<00:03:08.370> somebody<00:03:08.849> or<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.599> do<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.989> physically

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
pay somebody or you do it physically

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.140 
pay somebody or you do it physically
loading<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.159> in<00:03:11.280> here<00:03:11.549> because<00:03:11.909> otherwise

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
loading it in here because otherwise

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.589 
loading it in here because otherwise
what<00:03:12.359> would<00:03:12.480> be<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:13.159> advantage<00:03:14.159> to<00:03:14.579> this

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.569 

going<00:03:18.599> back<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.979> know<00:03:20.069> defensive

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
going back to you know defensive

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.759 
going back to you know defensive
capabilities<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.299> got<00:03:21.449> a<00:03:21.479> cool<00:03:22.349> double

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
capabilities it's got a cool double

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.909 
capabilities it's got a cool double
turret<00:03:23.099> here<00:03:24.109> which<00:03:25.109> we<00:03:25.229> could<00:03:25.349> get<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:25.650> that

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
turret here which we could get in that

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:31.490 
turret here which we could get in that
won't<00:03:26.099> do<00:03:26.280> anything<00:03:26.489> yet<00:03:28.220> but<00:03:30.079> this<00:03:31.079> isn't<00:03:31.409> a

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
won't do anything yet but this isn't a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.229 
won't do anything yet but this isn't a
this<00:03:31.889> isn't<00:03:32.189> a<00:03:32.220> dog<00:03:32.400> fighter<00:03:32.669> and<00:03:32.849> everyone

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
this isn't a dog fighter and everyone

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.990 
this isn't a dog fighter and everyone
knows<00:03:33.419> that<00:03:33.449> this<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:34.340> pretty<00:03:35.340> much<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.549> cargo

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
knows that this is a pretty much a cargo

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.589 
knows that this is a pretty much a cargo
hauler<00:03:36.239> but<00:03:36.720> what<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.560> think<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:38.129> is<00:03:38.419> will<00:03:39.419> do

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
hauler but what I think it is will do

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.289 
hauler but what I think it is will do
the<00:03:39.930> best<00:03:40.109> is<00:03:40.470> long<00:03:40.709> is<00:03:41.689> exploration<00:03:42.689> or

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
the best is long is exploration or

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.240 
the best is long is exploration or
long-range<00:03:45.299> scouting<00:03:46.259> that<00:03:46.799> sort<00:03:47.129> of<00:03:47.189> thing

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
long-range scouting that sort of thing

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.030 
long-range scouting that sort of thing
anything<00:03:48.060> that's<00:03:48.269> far<00:03:48.629> and<00:03:49.019> with<00:03:49.620> speed<00:03:50.009> and

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
anything that's far and with speed and

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.629 
anything that's far and with speed and
i'll<00:03:50.250> tell<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.459> why<00:03:50.840> these<00:03:51.840> thrusters<00:03:52.639> one

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
i'll tell you why these thrusters one

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.490 
i'll tell you why these thrusters one
it's<00:03:53.939> made<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.479> main<00:03:54.629> point<00:03:54.900> obviously<00:03:55.109> is

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
it's made the main point obviously is

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.849 
it's made the main point obviously is
speed<00:03:56.629> these<00:03:57.629> things<00:03:57.840> have<00:03:58.049> class<00:03:58.290> 52

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
speed these things have class 52

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.469 
speed these things have class 52
thrusters<00:03:59.669> on<00:03:59.849> them<00:04:00.439> this<00:04:01.439> is<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.650> same<00:04:02.479> they

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
thrusters on them this is the same they

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.349 
thrusters on them this is the same they
have<00:04:03.629> two<00:04:04.079> classes<00:04:04.290> I've<00:04:04.590> structures

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
have two classes I've structures

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.780 
have two classes I've structures
thrusters<00:04:06.359> sorry<00:04:07.069> that's<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.280> same<00:04:08.519> as<00:04:08.549> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
thrusters sorry that's the same as the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.240 
thrusters sorry that's the same as the
Hornet<00:04:09.150> now<00:04:09.299> this<00:04:09.509> thing<00:04:09.540> when<00:04:10.469> you<00:04:10.530> compared

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
Hornet now this thing when you compared

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.969 
Hornet now this thing when you compared
to<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.209> bigger<00:04:12.449> ships<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.469> thing<00:04:13.680> will<00:04:13.799> haul

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
to the bigger ships this thing will haul

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:19.449 
to the bigger ships this thing will haul
ass<00:04:16.070> now<00:04:17.070> we<00:04:18.060> don't<00:04:18.180> know<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.810> assume

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
ass now we don't know but I assume

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.620 
ass now we don't know but I assume
depending<00:04:20.459> on<00:04:20.459> what<00:04:20.699> you<00:04:20.849> have<00:04:20.969> loaded<00:04:21.329> will

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
depending on what you have loaded will

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.769 
depending on what you have loaded will
change<00:04:21.989> like<00:04:22.560> say<00:04:23.520> if<00:04:23.789> I<00:04:23.969> have<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.330> full<00:04:24.570> 20

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:24.779 
change like say if I have the full 20

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:27.080 
change like say if I have the full 20
tons<00:04:25.199> which<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.590> cargo<00:04:25.919> whole<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.219> hold<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.760> have

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
tons which is cargo whole to hold I have

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.890 
tons which is cargo whole to hold I have
that<00:04:27.270> full

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
that full

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.620 
that full
you<00:04:28.320> think<00:04:28.740> maybe<00:04:28.979> the<00:04:29.160> mass<00:04:29.370> would<00:04:29.639> be<00:04:29.850> higher

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
you think maybe the mass would be higher

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.170 
you think maybe the mass would be higher
and<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.020> would<00:04:31.139> be<00:04:31.290> slower<00:04:31.790> well<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:32.910> haven't

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
and it would be slower well I haven't

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.820 
and it would be slower well I haven't
found<00:04:33.360> anything<00:04:33.570> yet<00:04:33.720> on<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:33.960> if<00:04:34.290> anyone<00:04:34.800> can

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
found anything yet on that if anyone can

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.920 
found anything yet on that if anyone can
correct<00:04:35.400> me<00:04:35.580> in<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.300> comments<00:04:36.539> that<00:04:36.840> be<00:04:36.930> great

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
correct me in the comments that be great

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.529 
correct me in the comments that be great
but<00:04:39.930> just<00:04:39.990> outfitting<00:04:40.710> this<00:04:40.889> it<00:04:41.220> has<00:04:41.910> 10

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
but just outfitting this it has 10

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.330 
but just outfitting this it has 10
different<00:04:42.930> ways<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.410> can<00:04:43.710> 10<00:04:44.160> different

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
different ways you can 10 different

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.150 
different ways you can 10 different
hardpoints<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.389> should<00:04:45.720> say<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:46.070> updating<00:04:47.070> the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
hardpoints I should say of updating the

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.020 
hardpoints I should say of updating the
soap<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.960> can<00:04:48.960> see<00:04:49.169> this<00:04:49.350> being<00:04:49.759> much<00:04:50.759> better

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
soap I can see this being much better

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.290 
soap I can see this being much better

ship that's very maneuverable that's the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.510 
ship that's very maneuverable that's the
next<00:04:57.539> point<00:04:57.889> look<00:04:58.889> at<00:04:59.009> all<00:04:59.100> these<00:04:59.250> thrusters

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
next point look at all these thrusters

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.980 
next point look at all these thrusters
it<00:04:59.820> has<00:04:59.940> 8<00:05:00.410> maneuverability<00:05:01.410> thrusters<00:05:01.860> on<00:05:02.010> it

it has 8 maneuverability thrusters on it

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.550 
it has 8 maneuverability thrusters on it
to<00:05:03.990> hear<00:05:04.350> like<00:05:04.830> they're<00:05:05.490> everywhere<00:05:06.560> this

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
to hear like they're everywhere this

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.469 
to hear like they're everywhere this
thing<00:05:07.770> is<00:05:07.979> I<00:05:08.220> think<00:05:08.639> I<00:05:08.760> think<00:05:09.150> these<00:05:09.360> are

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
thing is I think I think these are

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.520 
thing is I think I think these are
reverse<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:10.250> assume<00:05:11.870> just<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:12.960> fact<00:05:13.199> that<00:05:13.320> it's

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
reverse I assume just the fact that it's

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.129 
reverse I assume just the fact that it's
you<00:05:13.820> know<00:05:14.820> it's<00:05:14.850> got<00:05:15.180> these<00:05:15.330> maneuverability

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
you know it's got these maneuverability

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.360 
you know it's got these maneuverability
thrusters<00:05:16.530> it's<00:05:16.770> got<00:05:16.979> giant<00:05:17.760> thrusters

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
thrusters it's got giant thrusters

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.310 
thrusters it's got giant thrusters
long-range<00:05:20.370> exploration<00:05:20.760> is<00:05:21.570> what<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.020> think

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
long-range exploration is what I think

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.170 
long-range exploration is what I think
this<00:05:22.440> will<00:05:22.560> be<00:05:22.650> great<00:05:22.830> for<00:05:22.949> and<00:05:23.520> that's<00:05:24.060> what

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
this will be great for and that's what

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.050 
this will be great for and that's what
I'll<00:05:24.330> probably<00:05:24.599> try<00:05:24.840> to<00:05:24.930> use<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.229> for

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
I'll probably try to use it for

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.689 
I'll probably try to use it for
secondary<00:05:27.060> as<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:28.199> hauling<00:05:28.740> you<00:05:29.160> know<00:05:29.280> cargo

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
secondary as a hauling you know cargo

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.570 
secondary as a hauling you know cargo
running<00:05:30.000> but<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:31.710> put<00:05:31.889> into<00:05:32.010> perspective<00:05:32.160> and

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
running but to put into perspective and

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.879 
running but to put into perspective and
why<00:05:32.760> I<00:05:32.870> realize<00:05:33.870> this<00:05:34.080> is<00:05:34.229> because<00:05:34.530> the

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
why I realize this is because the

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.939 
why I realize this is because the
Starfarer<00:05:35.610> has<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.510> class<00:05:36.780> 5s<00:05:37.289> and<00:05:37.440> a<00:05:37.470> class<00:05:37.680> 6

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
Starfarer has to class 5s and a class 6

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.510 
Starfarer has to class 5s and a class 6
s3<00:05:38.430> but<00:05:38.970> look<00:05:39.449> at<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.690> difference<00:05:39.840> in<00:05:40.229> size<00:05:40.520> so

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
s3 but look at the difference in size so

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.089 
s3 but look at the difference in size so
it's<00:05:41.669> all<00:05:41.789> got<00:05:42.180> one<00:05:42.419> more<00:05:42.630> engine<00:05:43.590> thruster

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
it's all got one more engine thruster

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.540 
it's all got one more engine thruster
than<00:05:44.940> this<00:05:45.650> look<00:05:46.650> at<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.860> size<00:05:47.039> difference<00:05:47.310> on

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
than this look at the size difference on

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.890 
than this look at the size difference on
what<00:05:47.699> you're<00:05:47.909> carrying<00:05:48.090> so<00:05:48.270> this<00:05:48.539> will<00:05:48.750> be

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
what you're carrying so this will be

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.540 
what you're carrying so this will be
where<00:05:49.470> it's<00:05:49.620> at<00:05:49.770> this<00:05:49.979> is<00:05:50.130> your<00:05:50.280> bread<00:05:50.520> and

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
where it's at this is your bread and

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.520 
where it's at this is your bread and
butter<00:05:50.699> moneymaker<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:52.860> exploration<00:05:53.610> ship
