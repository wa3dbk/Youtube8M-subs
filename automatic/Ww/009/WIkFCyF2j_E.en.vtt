00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.720
 How about androids, how are you waiting? 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.880
 very welcome to this your channel my 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.740
 and ribs today we are going to 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.550
 present you with a video where we are going to 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.169
 explain the function of the android beam 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.289
 this function that is already integrated in 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.650
 some new phones such as the 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.260
 galaxy nexus or the nexus 7 also that already 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.600
 has this technology included many of 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.269
 you may have already heard it mentioned 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.059
 and they do not know exactly what it is 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:46.059
 refers or how it works and in this 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.920
 video we are going to teach them to put 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.979
 A lot of attention is very simple 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.519
 let's talk a little about what it is 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:56.350
 the android beam or the nfc this technology 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.250
 which in its acronym in English is near 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:04.659
 field communication I talk to you 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.430
 This technology is basically a 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.369
 short wireless communication 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.280
 range between devices or between 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.439
 phones or between tablets we do not know if 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.210
 later the nfc is going to be implemented 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.320
 in other types of devices like 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.710
 cameras 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.830
 we do not know yet now this 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.220
 we present this between tablet and phone 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.440
 and it works I imagine it's going to work 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.350
 same for all the devices 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.050
 that come to include in the future the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.000
 nfc and well then let's start with 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.100
 this show I'm going to first 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.960
 instruct how is it that we can activate or 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:51.890
 deactivate our nfc comes in 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.159
 adjustments in more here comes the box for 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:02.659
 nfc there we can activate or 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:04.789
 turn it off as we indicated let's go 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.929
 on the phone that is in settings and 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:11.090
 they come back more and the nfc box is 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.420
 activated then this means that 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.910
 Our devices are ready to 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.349
 transmit data and the first thing that 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.129
 let's make them we will transmit a 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.290
 video from the phone to the tablet to 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.629
 that can give you an idea of how it is that 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.580
 this works we are going to choose some 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.290
 some video that they have that we have for 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.400
 here now 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.400
 from us 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:46.240
 that we have there in a moment 11 flip 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.240
 our tablet 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.830
 although the video started there we are going to 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.450
 cause it 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.730
 What do we have to do? 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.680
 place the antennas that make 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.840
 communication on top 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.780
 a legend appears that says touch to 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.629
 share and that's what we're going to do 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.629
 there is the sound 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.629
 here 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.069
 and here already 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.410
 and I'm going to start the video 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.980
 is a bit slow because it is 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.980
 loading this 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.950
 and that's how it is transmitted back 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.950
 video 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.520
 what are we going to put a break on and we're going to 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.090
 to return 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.090
 up to this point 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.670
 although you have already seen what it is 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.910
 nfc on video 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.920
 but we are going to apply it on the web 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.920
 let's go to the browser 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.570
 let's give it here we are seeing a 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.960
 page we want to transmit it to our 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.330
 device our tablet we go back to 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.470
 do the same we communicate 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.470
 the antennas 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.510
 and we passed the information 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.470
 here we have the same web page 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.060
 that we have here and so it applies in the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.950
 Web 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.470
 now let's do it with some 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.320
 application let's do it with some 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.440
 game is worth mentioning that the games 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.040
 when you use this you do not pass 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.610
 all he does is 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.610
 it gives you 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.320
 have the option to download it in the 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.320
 play store let's flip again 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.870
 make them communicate 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.820
 we give it back and 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.820
 we retired up here 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:12.889
 here yes it opened because the same game 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.330
 I already have it installed on my tablet 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.219
 but I'm going to show you 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.460
 with an application that the tablet does not 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:24.280
 include let's do it with the bayern 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.759
 although there is the oscillation we are going to flip 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.759
 this 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.810
 she made the transmission 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.780
 and it opens us the google apps the play store 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.840
 giving us the indication of where we can 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.460
 download our our application that 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.069
 we have here and we have it for this side 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.430
 and well that's the way it is this function of the 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:06:00.640
 Android pin or the nfc 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:04.000
 this technology is already applied in the usa 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.610
 with the google wallet the nfc can be 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.210
 make payments carrying only your 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:13.210
 phone and putting it in on the sensor 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.450
 the nfc and there you make your payment you can 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.370
 shopping you can go to the metro and this 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.580
 pay your ticket you can go to some 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.050
 Wi-Fi hotspot and you pass your phone and 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.750
 you do not have the need to type 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:29.230
 absolutely nothing just happening 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:33.640
 your phone you do 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:36.880
 the payment or you take the information you have 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.930
 that sensor and hopefully already in the 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.630
 Latin America starts to give more more 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.340
 these kinds of issues always start 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.770
 to the USA as always 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.970
 Now it has passed to Europe and Spain is 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.060
 applying what we hope that soon 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.950
 be in Mexico and throughout Latin America 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.300
 It would be very comfortable but it also fits 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.490
 mention that this is a double weapon 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.810
 edge because then if we have the 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.510
 information on our cards 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.130
 credit on our phone because if not 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.940
 steal it, we're going to be there 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.370
 in a little problem 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.730
 but I was also reading that it is not 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.920
 very very very serious that if you get to 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.420
 happen this you talk on the phone and in 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.880
 then cancel all 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.370
 cards and good lords I say goodbye 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:25.480
 this was a video for my android apps 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:27.130
 was the function of the android beam or the nfc 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.510
 and remember to subscribe to our 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.800
 channels give you a like the video only 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.640
 taste and share it in your networks 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.110
 social 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.120
 also find us on facebook and 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.120
 give us a mind up thank you
