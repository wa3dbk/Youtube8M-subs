same time I use them so I can't bitch
too<00:02:42.790> much<00:02:44.400> when<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.910> think<00:02:46.240> I'm<00:02:46.360> building<00:02:46.720> up<00:02:46.810> my

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
too much when I think I'm building up my

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.600 
too much when I think I'm building up my
dogs<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.440> think<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.710> wanted<00:02:47.980> more<00:02:48.130> killstreaks

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
dogs I think I wanted more killstreaks

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.510 
dogs I think I wanted more killstreaks
before<00:02:48.880> i<00:02:48.940> called<00:02:49.180> them<00:02:49.300> in<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:50.500> have<00:02:50.650> be<00:02:51.280> right

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
before i called them in we have be right

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.790 
before i called them in we have be right
now<00:02:51.700> we<00:02:51.760> don't<00:02:52.150> have<00:02:52.270> any<00:02:52.570> NC<00:02:52.960> what<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.590> lot<00:02:53.770> of

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
now we don't have any NC what a lot of

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.590 
now we don't have any NC what a lot of
people<00:02:53.950> fail<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.400> do<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.820> this<00:02:55.000> map<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.510> it's

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
people fail to do on this map and it's

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.660 
people fail to do on this map and it's
something<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:55.870> drives<00:02:56.170> me<00:02:56.410> nuts<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.890> back<00:02:57.460> in

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
something that drives me nuts is back in

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.310 
something that drives me nuts is back in
modern<00:02:57.910> warfare<00:02:58.030> two<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.480> could<00:02:58.690> double<00:02:59.170> cap

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
modern warfare two you could double cap

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.980 
modern warfare two you could double cap
and<00:02:59.560> you'd<00:03:00.400> basically<00:03:00.610> have<00:03:00.820> two<00:03:01.150> flags<00:03:01.540> and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
and you'd basically have two flags and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.410 
and you'd basically have two flags and
you<00:03:02.980> could<00:03:03.130> pretty<00:03:03.250> much<00:03:03.340> spawn<00:03:03.670> trap<00:03:03.940> them<00:03:04.180> at

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
you could pretty much spawn trap them at

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.630 
you could pretty much spawn trap them at
let's<00:03:04.720> say<00:03:04.870> see<00:03:04.930> now<00:03:05.380> but<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.310> problem<00:03:06.580> with

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
let's say see now but the problem with

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.430 
let's say see now but the problem with
that<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:07.330> when<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.630> get<00:03:07.780> too<00:03:07.930> close<00:03:07.960> as<00:03:08.320> I

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
that is is when you get too close as I

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.810 
that is is when you get too close as I
don't<00:03:08.560> know<00:03:08.620> why<00:03:08.740> I<00:03:08.770> switch<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.280> third<00:03:09.460> person

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
don't know why I switch the third person

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.560 
don't know why I switch the third person
