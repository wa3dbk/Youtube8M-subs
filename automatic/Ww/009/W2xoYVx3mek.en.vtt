00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
out of bloom and you can see some of the

out of bloom and you can see some of the
dead<00:01:56.340> heads<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.969> there<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.570> let's<00:01:58.140> talk<00:01:58.320> about

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
dead heads on there so let's talk about

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.910 
dead heads on there so let's talk about
maintenance<00:01:59.130> when<00:01:59.610> these<00:01:59.790> are<00:02:00.000> done<00:02:00.030> blooming

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
maintenance when these are done blooming

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.039 
maintenance when these are done blooming
the<00:02:01.920> thing<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.090> stems<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:03.840> not

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the thing is is that the stems do not

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.800 
the thing is is that the stems do not
fall<00:02:04.380> off<00:02:04.610> it's<00:02:05.610> not<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:06.119> I'd<00:02:06.240> call<00:02:06.479> it's

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
fall off it's not what I'd call it's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.680 
fall off it's not what I'd call it's
partially<00:02:07.530> self-cleaning<00:02:08.360> meaning<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
partially self-cleaning meaning that the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.170 
partially self-cleaning meaning that the
petals<00:02:10.110> themselves<00:02:10.379> fall<00:02:11.220> off<00:02:11.459> but<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.940> leaves

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
petals themselves fall off but it leaves

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.640

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
stem that does not fall off in it for me

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.640 
stem that does not fall off in it for me
it<00:02:16.799> looks<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.099> little<00:02:17.220> dirty<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:18.650> for

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
it looks a little dirty so for

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.530 
it looks a little dirty so for
maintenance<00:02:19.950> what<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.909> do<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.239> come

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
maintenance what I like to do is come

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.300 
maintenance what I like to do is come
back<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.319> when<00:02:22.470> these<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:22.860> totally

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
back in and when these have totally

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.149 
back in and when these have totally
cleaned<00:02:23.610> themselves<00:02:23.819> off<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.799> petals<00:02:25.799> then

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
cleaned themselves off of petals then

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.199 
cleaned themselves off of petals then
take<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> light<00:02:27.690> shearing<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.739> just<00:02:29.730> clean<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
take a light shearing and just clean the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.899 
take a light shearing and just clean the
tops<00:02:30.450> off<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:31.079> remove<00:02:31.470> those<00:02:31.739> dead<00:02:32.099> stems<00:02:32.549> and

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
tops off to remove those dead stems and

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.890 
tops off to remove those dead stems and
then<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.019> have<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> nice<00:02:34.560> clean<00:02:35.010> evergreen<00:02:35.900> mat

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
then you have a nice clean evergreen mat

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.990 
then you have a nice clean evergreen mat
there<00:02:37.260> until<00:02:37.709> next<00:02:37.980> season<00:02:38.310> when<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.760> blooms

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
there until next season when it blooms

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.089 
there until next season when it blooms
again<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.980> let's<00:02:41.909> see<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.209> terms<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.750> water

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
again and let's see in terms of water

this is card kind of regular garden

this is card kind of regular garden
waters<00:02:46.980> what<00:02:47.220> I'd<00:02:47.370> recommend<00:02:47.609> that<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.390> I

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
waters what I'd recommend that the I

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.140 
waters what I'd recommend that the I
don't<00:02:48.690> consider<00:02:49.319> these<00:02:49.680> drought<00:02:50.340> tolerant<00:02:50.970> by

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
don't consider these drought tolerant by

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.170 
don't consider these drought tolerant by
any<00:02:51.390> stretch<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.799> other<00:02:52.829> hand<00:02:53.340> they<00:02:54.030> don't

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
any stretch on the other hand they don't

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.349 
any stretch on the other hand they don't
need<00:02:54.739> large<00:02:55.739> amounts<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.400> water<00:02:56.609> either<00:02:57.030> so

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
need large amounts of water either so

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.750 
need large amounts of water either so
I'd<00:02:57.480> call<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:57.989> water<00:02:58.620> need<00:02:58.920> moderate<00:02:59.549> and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
I'd call that water need moderate and

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.619 
I'd call that water need moderate and
also<00:03:00.629> we've<00:03:00.959> used<00:03:01.230> these<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.709> deer<00:03:01.980> areas

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
also we've used these in deer areas

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.410 
also we've used these in deer areas
successfully<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:05.040> I'd<00:03:05.250> say<00:03:05.549> it's<00:03:05.700> worth<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.120> try

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
successfully so I'd say it's worth a try

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.720 
successfully so I'd say it's worth a try
and<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:06.810> deer<00:03:07.019> area<00:03:07.379> I<00:03:07.650> can't<00:03:08.040> tell<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.489> it's<00:03:08.579> a

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
and in deer area I can't tell you it's a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.520 
and in deer area I can't tell you it's a
hundred<00:03:09.030> percent<00:03:09.120> but<00:03:09.720> we<00:03:09.870> have<00:03:10.079> used<00:03:10.349> these

hundred percent but we have used these

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.080 
hundred percent but we have used these
in<00:03:10.769> deer<00:03:11.010> areas<00:03:11.400> successfully<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:13.670> in<00:03:14.670> terms

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
in deer areas successfully and in terms

sun exposure these like full Sun you're

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.039 
sun exposure these like full Sun you're
not<00:03:47.370> going<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.579> get<00:03:47.760> as<00:03:47.910> strong<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.389> a<00:03:48.510> bloom<00:03:48.810> if

not going to get as strong of a bloom if

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.110 
not going to get as strong of a bloom if
you<00:03:49.169> put<00:03:49.410> them<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:49.709> shade<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.400> recommend

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
you put them in shade so I recommend

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.319 
you put them in shade so I recommend
full<00:03:51.389> Sun<00:03:51.750> even<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:52.739> hot<00:03:52.980> conditions<00:03:53.220> we<00:03:54.060> grow

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
full Sun even in hot conditions we grow

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.150 
full Sun even in hot conditions we grow
this<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.750> full<00:03:54.989> Sun<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.680> can<00:03:55.889> definitely

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
this in full Sun so it can definitely

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.280 
this in full Sun so it can definitely
tolerate<00:03:57.230> full<00:03:58.230> Sun<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.699> exposure<00:03:59.699> and<00:04:00.290> I

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
tolerate full Sun and exposure and I

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.170 
tolerate full Sun and exposure and I
think<00:04:01.650> that's<00:04:01.829> about<00:04:02.010> it<00:04:02.190> for<00:04:02.430> Ibis

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
think that's about it for Ibis

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.609 
think that's about it for Ibis
