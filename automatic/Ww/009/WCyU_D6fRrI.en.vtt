00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
how big of a role could spider-man

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
possibly have in the film when they've

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.250 
possibly have in the film when they've
already<00:01:08.820> been<00:01:09.000> making<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.479> film<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.750> months

already been making this film for months

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.820 
already been making this film for months
I<00:01:10.580> think<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.470> what<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> call<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
I think it's going to be what I call a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.140 
I think it's going to be what I call a
present<00:01:14.430> role<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
present role it's not going to be a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.480 
present role it's not going to be a
cameo<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.930> think<00:01:16.619> it'll<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.830> more<00:01:16.950> along<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
cameo I think it'll be more along the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.350 
cameo I think it'll be more along the
lines<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.750> Don<00:01:19.080> Cheadle<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.890> Avengers<00:01:20.340> 2<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
lines of a Don Cheadle in Avengers 2 so

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.359 
lines of a Don Cheadle in Avengers 2 so
I<00:01:21.390> think<00:01:21.509> it'll<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.869> substantive<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.250> know

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
I think it'll be substantive you know

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.890 
I think it'll be substantive you know
he'll<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
he'll be there but it will not be one of

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.600 
he'll be there but it will not be one of
the<00:01:24.960> five<00:01:25.170> or<00:01:25.439> six<00:01:25.650> main<00:01:25.890> characters<00:01:26.430> or

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the five or six main characters or

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.219 
the five or six main characters or
anything<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.600> he<00:01:27.780> will<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
anything like that but he will have a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.350 
anything like that but he will have a
presence<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> film<00:01:29.310> much<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:30.119> war

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360

machine had in Avengers 2 I don't think
it's<00:01:32.430> gonna<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.700> quick<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.030> cameo<00:01:33.540> or

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
it's gonna be a quick little cameo or

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780 
it's gonna be a quick little cameo or
anything<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:35.040> once<00:01:35.400> again<00:01:35.520> it's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
anything like that but once again it's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.520 
anything like that but once again it's
not<00:01:35.970> gonna<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.240> major<00:01:36.450> because<00:01:36.630> they've<00:01:36.900> been

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
not gonna be major because they've been

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.890 
not gonna be major because they've been
making<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.979> movie<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.549> long<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.509> that's

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
making the movie for so long so that's

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.300 
making the movie for so long so that's
just<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> way<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.920> would<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.100> cool

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
just the way I see it it would be cool

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.830 
just the way I see it it would be cool
they<00:01:41.490> see<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.090> was<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> little<00:01:42.689> bit

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
they see if they it was a little bit

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.240 
they see if they it was a little bit
bigger<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.560> don't<00:01:43.649> see<00:01:43.799> how<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.159> at

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
bigger I just don't see how you do it at

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
bigger I just don't see how you do it at
this<00:01:44.340> point<00:01:44.579> when<00:01:44.820> you've<00:01:44.939> already<00:01:45.180> been

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
this point when you've already been

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.550 
this point when you've already been
rolling<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.630> lenses<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.229> long<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.500> do

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
rolling the lenses for this long what do

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.380 
rolling the lenses for this long what do
you<00:01:46.619> think<00:01:46.799> yeah<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.340> think<00:01:47.579> even<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.210> they

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you think yeah I think even if they

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.450 
you think yeah I think even if they
hadn't<00:01:48.780> been<00:01:48.930> filming<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:50.040> long<00:01:50.250> I

tugging<00:02:50.020> on<00:02:50.200> his<00:02:50.350> arm<00:02:50.560> clearly<00:02:51.100> he's<00:02:51.340> going<00:02:51.610> to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
tugging on his arm clearly he's going to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.760 
tugging on his arm clearly he's going to
be<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.970> focal<00:02:52.420> point<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:53.350> this<00:02:53.530> new

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
be that focal point and in this new

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.290 
be that focal point and in this new
movie<00:02:54.070> version<00:02:54.100> we<00:02:54.400> know<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.760> issue<00:02:54.940> is<00:02:55.180> not

movie version we know the issue is not

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.699 
movie version we know the issue is not
secret<00:02:55.660> identity<00:02:56.110> so<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:56.410> not<00:02:56.500> going<00:02:56.650> to

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
secret identity so it's not going to

like when we all SAT back one of these
guys<00:05:54.590> well<00:05:55.370> apparently<00:05:55.550> they<00:05:55.790> have<00:05:55.880> a<00:05:55.940> great

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
guys well apparently they have a great

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.430 
guys well apparently they have a great
eye<00:05:56.150> because<00:05:56.570> that<00:05:56.720> worked<00:05:56.870> out<00:05:57.050> this<00:05:57.290> is

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
eye because that worked out this is

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.500 
eye because that worked out this is
clearly<00:05:57.770> a<00:05:57.890> Sony<00:05:58.190> higher<00:05:58.460> than<00:05:58.940> we<00:05:59.210> looked<00:05:59.420> at

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
clearly a Sony higher than we looked at

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.700 
clearly a Sony higher than we looked at
this<00:05:59.600> remember<00:06:00.050> we<00:06:00.110> were<00:06:00.230> sitting<00:06:00.410> where<00:06:00.650> we

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
this remember we were sitting where we

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.410 
this remember we were sitting where we
saw<00:06:00.830> this<00:06:00.980> we<00:06:01.250> both<00:06:01.430> SAT<00:06:01.610> back<00:06:01.730> those<00:06:01.940> well

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
saw this we both SAT back those well

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.060 
saw this we both SAT back those well
this<00:06:02.570> is<00:06:02.720> clearly<00:06:02.870> a<00:06:03.140> Sony<00:06:03.410> kind<00:06:03.740> of<00:06:03.830> a<00:06:03.890> higher

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
this is clearly a Sony kind of a higher

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.370 
this is clearly a Sony kind of a higher
but<00:06:04.640> maybe<00:06:04.880> it'll<00:06:05.150> work<00:06:05.180> out<00:06:05.510> so<00:06:05.870> I<00:06:05.900> feel

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
but maybe it'll work out so I feel

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.010 
but maybe it'll work out so I feel
pretty<00:06:06.530> good<00:06:06.650> about<00:06:06.710> it
