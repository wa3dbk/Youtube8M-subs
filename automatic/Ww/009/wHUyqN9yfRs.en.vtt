we're<00:01:31.819> after<00:01:32.119> that<00:01:32.359> they<00:01:32.630> start<00:01:32.899> getting

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
we're after that they start getting

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.289 
we're after that they start getting
longer<00:01:33.229> January<00:01:33.920> I<00:01:34.009> think<00:01:34.060> we're<00:01:35.060> going<00:01:35.240> to

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
longer January I think we're going to

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.690 
longer January I think we're going to
start<00:01:35.479> seeing<00:01:35.689> a<00:01:35.780> lot<00:01:35.929> more<00:01:35.990> action<00:01:36.649> here

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
start seeing a lot more action here

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.459 
start seeing a lot more action here
January<00:01:37.700> February<00:01:37.850> because<00:01:38.299> of<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.929> liver

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
January February because of the liver

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.270 
January February because of the liver
gets<00:01:39.770> really<00:01:40.219> bright<00:01:40.369> in<00:01:41.299> January<00:01:41.749> February

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
gets really bright in January February

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.249 
gets really bright in January February
because<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.520> day<00:01:43.639> is<00:01:43.700> getting<00:01:43.789> longer<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.299> I

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
because the day is getting longer and I

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.899 
because the day is getting longer and I
think<00:01:45.859> this<00:01:45.950> plan<00:01:46.159> is<00:01:46.189> going<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.429> really<00:01:46.609> start

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
think this plan is going to really start

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.550 
think this plan is going to really start
producing<00:01:47.209> being<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:47.810> January<00:01:48.229> but<00:01:48.409> it's

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
producing being in January but it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.190 
producing being in January but it's
grown<00:01:48.829> good<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:50.060> know<00:01:50.179> it's<00:01:50.389> a

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
grown good you know it's a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.319 
grown good you know it's a
I'm<00:01:51.619> happy<00:01:52.009> I'm<00:01:52.159> going<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.670> be<00:01:52.759> hoppier<00:01:53.119> here

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
I'm happy I'm going to be hoppier here
