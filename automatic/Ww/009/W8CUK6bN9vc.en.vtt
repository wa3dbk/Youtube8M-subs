already
it's<00:00:44.040> unstuffed<00:00:44.940> everything<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
it's unstuffed everything just as is and

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.400 
it's unstuffed everything just as is and
the<00:00:48.059> tough<00:00:48.329> part<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> couldn't<00:00:49.170> get<00:00:49.260> out

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the tough part that I couldn't get out

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.400 
the tough part that I couldn't get out
was<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.860> part<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.370> part<00:00:50.489> right<00:00:50.850> there

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
was this part and that part right there

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.479 
was this part and that part right there
because<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.620> right<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.010> edge<00:00:53.250> over

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
because it was right at the edge over

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.910 
because it was right at the edge over
there<00:00:53.760> generally<00:00:54.690> your<00:00:54.809> crease<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.230> all<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.800> in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
there generally your crease is all up in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.799 
there generally your crease is all up in
front<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.000> ones<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.570> kind<00:00:57.780> of

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
front but with the ones it kind of

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:58.849 
front but with the ones it kind of
crease<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.559> kind<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> hard

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
crease right there and it's kind of hard

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.939 
crease right there and it's kind of hard
too<00:00:59.129> hard<00:00:59.340> for<00:01:00.120> me<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> surface<00:01:01.500> flat

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
too hard for me to get the surface flat

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.780 
too hard for me to get the surface flat
where<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> needs<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:04.189> one<00:01:05.189> first<00:01:05.610> thing

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
where it needs to be one first thing

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.910 
where it needs to be one first thing
first<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.630> need<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.930> equipment<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.740> as

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
you guys can tell I've got this right

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.780 
you guys can tell I've got this right
here<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:12.920> generates<00:01:13.920> quite<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> bit<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.549> steam

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
here and generates quite a bit of steam

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.179 
here and generates quite a bit of steam
on<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:16.200> working<00:01:16.650> out<00:01:16.740> pretty<00:01:17.070> well

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
on it so it's working out pretty well

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.710 
on it so it's working out pretty well
for<00:01:17.369> me<00:01:17.580> somebody<00:01:17.970> said<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.390> little<00:01:18.509> bit

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
for me somebody said it's a little bit

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.390 
for me somebody said it's a little bit
too<00:01:18.930> big<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.650> doesn't<00:01:19.920> work<00:01:20.040> out<00:01:20.130> too<00:01:20.369> well

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
too big and it doesn't work out too well

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.320 
too big and it doesn't work out too well
so<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.820> don't<00:01:20.909> know<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.380> key<00:01:22.560> steps<00:01:23.330> pretty

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
so I don't know but the key steps pretty

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.460 
so I don't know but the key steps pretty
