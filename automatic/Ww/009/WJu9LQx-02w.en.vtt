 accident caused by gases 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.400
 pollutants that cause 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.190
 global warming 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.219
 from that moment your life will change for

 charles arturo energy resources 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.470
 of the earth are rapidly depleting and 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.439
 the planet is chaos its mission 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.629
 It will increase energy efficiency 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:36.270
 from now on you will be your dog recharged on 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:36.270

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.030
 the cholo to seafood lunches 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.100
 all the money that we have won yet 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.250
 this we can expand our chain 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.300
 of restaurants file all the seafood 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.300
 will conquer the silveria world 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 to 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.189
 quiet, nothing has happened, relax and

 the problems never stop silveria 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.899
 turn on the screen 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.860
 and without maintenance of contaminants the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.460
 planet is right silveria this is a 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.840
 mission for the teacher exceeded recharged 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.840
 and the napkin 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.650
 promptly to paragliding but to fight 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.650
 for energy efficiency 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.520
 alcoy what happens how many pairs are three 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.800
 flies that answer does not but what 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.930
 what I do know is that you are polluting 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.300
 the atmosphere with your vehicle sir 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.340
 biker eat if you explain to my black 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.620
 You will see Mr. Driver the use of 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.760
 automotive generates gases that pollute 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.100
 the atmosphere like carbon oxides 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.130
 nitrogen oxides in chromium and when 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.050
 tomo dar is in poor condition 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.030
 pollutes much more imagine that the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.970
 gases division of the industries 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.950
 represents only 22 percent of the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.410
 air pollution of a city and 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.870
 the remaining percentage corresponds to the 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.570
 automotive when we breathe the air 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.660
 contaminated easily irritates us 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.230
 mucous we do not think well and we feel 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.640
 exhausted generating problems 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.140
 respiratory what I do if I have to 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.420
 work every day of my car 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.400
 benjamín ask are we to see if he 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.410
 collaborate with some solution forward 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.510
 jámilson dislike is found and the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.790
 Chinese admin is not found but from 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.319
 I love you a thousand loves I see much pleasure 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.599
 ron oberto 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.659
 to serve you I have the solution to your 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.760
 problem driver driver compression or 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.439
 950 million automatic milestones with all 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.139
 the payment facilities all the luxuries 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.329
 chewing gum mani candy that says no me 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.219
 Black is very bad if I do not have money 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.469
 to give him a frenillo to bus roger 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:05.109
 from where I'm going to take out for that ship 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:07.659
 tuqui figured to continue polluting me 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.540
 I understand sir, first there is the family 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:13.389
 although a new gadget is a good 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.609
 solution so now the designs so that 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:18.280
 have greater efficiency and do not generate 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:21.160
 so many gases but calm that jámison 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.110
 must have some clue forgive me is that 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.880
 I had a urinary urgency and I had to 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.070
 I had a bathroom borrowed in this 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.840
 dealer hear the seller is with 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.030
 the whole problem and talking to a friend 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.419
 find a good alternative that is 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.940
 for being in 321 was a lot but that 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.009
 my father's card mediated more sir 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.919
 it's very different from yours but my dad does not 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.750
 pollutes so much and that as you can see 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.699
 very easy sister make a good 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.009
 maintaining the carriage control 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.320
 oil condition brake fluid 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.810
 Refrigeration and all fluids 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.030
 have the tires inflated and in good 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.260
 state and periodically review the 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.420
 emission of gases 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.420
 also respect the speed limits 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.770
 spend more fuel and especially 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.560
 change the fuel pass the 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.540
 gasoline to natural gas go to the cart 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.580
 loses a little power but 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.650
 consider that the gas contaminates a lot 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.050
 less and the tank gets cheaper 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.790
 colleague created by the councils if one 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.250
 The cart has been well preserved 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.200
 Silver lasts longer and pollutes less and 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.240
 same I'm going for the mechanic my fish 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.310
 but I'm going to spend the money 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.500
 my son's frenul so that he can help 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.690
 we can help each other, my friend 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.910
 you get the money for your son and 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.140
 me enough to recover from the 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.140
 holocaust of seafood 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.780
 two 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.490
 and what a miracle if I knew that the teacher 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.130
 is doing the second I handling of 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.610
 night and he manages life and that as a master 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.920
 I'm a girl, we're going to increase efficiency 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.380
 energy 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:58.840
 then we have met my black 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.840
 how I miss the teacher
