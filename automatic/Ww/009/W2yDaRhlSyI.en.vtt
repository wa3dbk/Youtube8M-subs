accident the lights goes on with a more
rapid<00:02:20.280> speed<00:02:20.580> as<00:02:20.850> well<00:02:21.060> as<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.300> occupants<00:02:22.110> are

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
rapid speed as well as the occupants are

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.820 
rapid speed as well as the occupants are
tightened<00:02:22.710> into<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.310> seats<00:02:24.350> it's<00:02:25.350> important

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
tightened into the seats it's important

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.590 
tightened into the seats it's important
to<00:02:25.920> protect<00:02:26.100> all<00:02:26.460> occupants<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.150> car<00:02:27.330> so

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
to protect all occupants in the car so

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.360 
to protect all occupants in the car so
of<00:02:27.720> course<00:02:27.930> we<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.290> pretensioners<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.220> all

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
of course we have pretensioners in all

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.500 
of course we have pretensioners in all
seats<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.910> car<00:02:30.090> even<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.750> third<00:02:30.960> row<00:02:32.510> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
seats in the car even the third row the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.000 
seats in the car even the third row the
new<00:02:33.660> model<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.350> stronger<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.280> every<00:02:35.850> sense<00:02:36.120> to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
new model is stronger in every sense to

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.980 
new model is stronger in every sense to
the<00:02:38.010> car<00:02:38.250> body<00:02:38.490> has<00:02:38.880> more<00:02:39.360> high-strength

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
the car body has more high-strength

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.130 
the car body has more high-strength
steel<00:02:40.260> than<00:02:40.530> ever<00:02:40.770> before<00:02:41.250> more<00:02:42.120> than<00:02:42.240> 40%<00:02:42.630> of

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
steel than ever before more than 40% of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.680 
steel than ever before more than 40% of
the<00:02:43.290> weight<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.220> car<00:02:44.460> body<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:45.000> boron

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
the weight of the car body is boron

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.010 
the weight of the car body is boron
steel<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:47.100> boris<00:02:47.550> steel<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> very<00:02:48.480> strong

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
steel and boris steel is a very strong

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.350 
steel and boris steel is a very strong
steel<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.950> also<00:02:50.280> low<00:02:50.459> weight<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.330> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
steel it's also low weight so this is a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.560 
steel it's also low weight so this is a
way<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.930> adding<00:02:52.770> safety<00:02:53.520> without<00:02:54.000> adding

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
way of adding safety without adding

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.750 
way of adding safety without adding
weight
