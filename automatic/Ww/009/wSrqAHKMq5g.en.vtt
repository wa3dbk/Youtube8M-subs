whole<00:02:29.530> area

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
whole area

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.490 
whole area
yeah<00:02:30.730> it's<00:02:30.940> actually<00:02:31.300> kind<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.600> clean<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.260> for

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
yeah it's actually kind of clean and for

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.380 
yeah it's actually kind of clean and for
having<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:33.010> lot<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.310> people<00:02:33.460> around<00:02:33.670> here<00:02:33.910> who

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
having a lot of people around here who

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.410 
having a lot of people around here who
are<00:02:34.510> very<00:02:34.660> friendly<00:02:34.959> by<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.319> way<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:37.000> haven't

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
are very friendly by the way we haven't

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.120 
are very friendly by the way we haven't
seen<00:02:37.600> any<00:02:37.780> litter<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.500> want<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.709> litter<00:02:38.890> later

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
seen any litter you want a litter later

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.660 
seen any litter you want a litter later
no<00:02:39.880> make<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.180> more<00:02:40.300> like<00:02:40.360> home<00:02:40.630> nope<00:02:41.250> okay<00:02:42.250> not

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
no make it more like home nope okay not

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.530 
no make it more like home nope okay not
gonna<00:02:42.850> be<00:02:42.940> one<00:02:43.090> socket<00:02:43.360> okay<00:02:44.080> good<00:02:48.540> name

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
gonna be one socket okay good name

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.910 
gonna be one socket okay good name
stream<00:02:50.080> freak<00:02:50.440> 79<00:02:51.300> is<00:02:52.300> that<00:02:52.690> compasses<00:02:53.560> can<00:02:53.709> be

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
stream freak 79 is that compasses can be

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.510 
stream freak 79 is that compasses can be
very<00:02:54.100> sensitive<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.730> electromagnetic<00:02:55.090> fields

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
very sensitive to electromagnetic fields

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.890 
very sensitive to electromagnetic fields
helps<00:02:57.520> out<00:02:57.640> with<00:02:57.730> ghost<00:02:57.970> hunting<00:02:58.360> now

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
helps out with ghost hunting now

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.720 
helps out with ghost hunting now
supposedly<00:02:59.560> once<00:02:59.830> we<00:02:59.980> get<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.310> Carnes

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
supposedly once we get to the Carnes

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.110 
supposedly once we get to the Carnes
that<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.630> rocks<00:03:01.900> are<00:03:02.050> going<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.290> actually<00:03:03.120> we

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
that the rocks are going to actually we

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.590 
that the rocks are going to actually we
imitate<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.730> electromatic<00:03:06.730> field<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.239> I<00:03:07.270> wanted

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
imitate a electromatic field so I wanted

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.570 
imitate a electromatic field so I wanted
to<00:03:07.660> check<00:03:07.900> with<00:03:08.200> normal<00:03:08.980> Rock<00:03:09.160> see<00:03:09.370> if<00:03:09.430> they

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
to check with normal Rock see if they

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.490 
to check with normal Rock see if they
just<00:03:09.790> naturally<00:03:09.910> do<00:03:10.300> that<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:10.720> this<00:03:11.260> ain't<00:03:11.440> the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
just naturally do that so this ain't the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.340 
just naturally do that so this ain't the
most<00:03:11.709> ideal<00:03:11.950> compass<00:03:12.760> but<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.660> does<00:03:13.959> kind<00:03:14.290> of

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
most ideal compass but it does kind of

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:22.830 
most ideal compass but it does kind of
work<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:19.000> I'm<00:03:19.870> moving<00:03:20.019> along<00:03:21.450> ain't<00:03:22.450> moving

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
work so I'm moving along ain't moving

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.320 
work so I'm moving along ain't moving
and<00:03:23.050> we<00:03:23.890> tested<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.400> already<00:03:24.760> with<00:03:25.030> both<00:03:25.209> the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
and we tested this already with both the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.840 
and we tested this already with both the
GPS<00:03:25.840> ins<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.260> cell<00:03:27.070> phone<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:27.519> it<00:03:27.640> does<00:03:27.820> work

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
GPS ins and cell phone so it does work

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.009 
GPS ins and cell phone so it does work
and<00:03:29.760> what<00:03:30.760> you're<00:03:30.940> looking<00:03:31.239> at<00:03:31.330> now<00:03:31.390> are<00:03:31.600> the

and what you're looking at now are the

use age as well as their cultural origin
the<00:03:48.790> explanations<00:03:49.480> range<00:03:49.780> from<00:03:49.989> the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
the explanations range from the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.560 
the explanations range from the
sensational<00:03:50.950> that<00:03:51.459> suggests<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:51.970> cars<00:03:52.360> were

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
sensational that suggests that cars were

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.690 
sensational that suggests that cars were
built<00:03:52.750> by<00:03:52.959> ancient<00:03:53.470> civilizations<00:03:54.250> like<00:03:54.519> the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
built by ancient civilizations like the

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.960 
built by ancient civilizations like the
Phoenicians<00:03:55.239> or<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.570> cells<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.489> mundane

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
Phoenicians or the cells to the mundane

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.880 
Phoenicians or the cells to the mundane
which<00:03:58.660> proposed<00:03:59.049> that<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.380> Carnes<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.829> the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
which proposed that the Carnes of the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.920 
which proposed that the Carnes of the
product<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:00.610> native<00:04:00.970> Indian<00:04:01.480> group<00:04:01.720> or

product of a native Indian group or
colonial<00:04:04.950> well<00:04:05.950> as<00:04:06.070> we<00:04:06.250> do<00:04:06.370> test<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.850> earlier

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
colonial well as we do test it earlier

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.940 
colonial well as we do test it earlier
one<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.019> things<00:04:08.260> is<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.470> supposedly

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
one of the things is that supposedly

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.400 
one of the things is that supposedly
these<00:04:09.190> cards<00:04:09.820> will<00:04:10.209> release<00:04:10.540> an<00:04:10.690> EMF<00:04:11.140> field

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
these cards will release an EMF field

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.729 
these cards will release an EMF field
and<00:04:11.620> we<00:04:11.680> wanted<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:11.980> test<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.370> on<00:04:12.459> rocks<00:04:12.790> so

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
and we wanted to test it on rocks so

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.990 
and we wanted to test it on rocks so
let's<00:04:14.739> test<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.070> see<00:04:15.250> if<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.459> affects<00:04:15.880> the

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
let's test to see if it affects the

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.150 
let's test to see if it affects the
compass

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:35.590 

so<00:04:27.160> far<00:04:27.490> it's<00:04:27.850> not<00:04:27.880> really<00:04:28.210> moving

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.170 

more<00:04:36.290> than<00:04:36.470> just<00:04:37.310> because<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.640> my<00:04:37.730> hand<00:04:37.970> you

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
more than just because of my hand you

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.430 
more than just because of my hand you
know<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.390> shaking<00:04:38.720> motion<00:04:39.020> but<00:04:39.140> it's<00:04:39.290> not

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
know the shaking motion but it's not

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.670 
know the shaking motion but it's not
it's<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:40.550> far<00:04:40.850> if<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:41.750> thing<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.170> releasing

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
it's so far if this thing is releasing

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.210 
it's so far if this thing is releasing
any<00:04:42.860> type<00:04:43.100> of<00:04:43.130> EMF<00:04:43.670> fields<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.240> not<00:04:44.570> it<00:04:45.380> is

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
any type of EMF fields it is not it is

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.770 
any type of EMF fields it is not it is
not<00:04:46.400> showing<00:04:46.910> on<00:04:47.150> this<00:04:47.330> compass<00:04:48.760> wow<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:50.750> is

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
not showing on this compass wow that is

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.440 
not showing on this compass wow that is
long<00:04:51.170> creepy<00:04:51.560> tree<00:04:51.860> looks<00:04:52.760> like<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:52.940> devil<00:04:53.210> is

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
long creepy tree looks like a devil is

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.930 
long creepy tree looks like a devil is
looking<00:04:53.780> at<00:04:53.930> us<00:04:53.960> right<00:04:54.590> Steve<00:04:54.890> I<00:04:55.160> actually
