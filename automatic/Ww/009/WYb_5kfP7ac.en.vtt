 made in japan 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.470
 she went wrong 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.820
 the company 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.859
 brewery 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.489
 in the segment 

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:12.569
 distributed in brazil 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:14.819
 by the press 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:17.029
 pisani 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.480
 the heater 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.550
 was approved 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.640
 in lemon tree 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.939
 achieving the highest rating 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.179
 air classification 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.529
 and for 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.800
 higher network efficiency 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.570
 he managed 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.880
 also 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.030
 the competent authority 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.840
 Where did you start? 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.130
 a product 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.960
 and low consumption due 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.910
 energy 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.630
 we have here 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.640
 the inside of the fan support 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.910
 which works fully computerized 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.910
 in all of them 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.540
 ef 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.160
 these vices or seven sectors 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.290
 a detail 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.710
 be incorporated 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 a device 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.780
 Perfect 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.160
 film 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.840
 which involves the combustion chamber 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.860
 if it is a desire to see 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.860
 with high temperature 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.680
 he will stay 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.530
 through this year of this movie 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.750
 the winner will completely disconnect 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.410
 so this is too much technology today 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 cheese made by pigeon 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.030
 in Japan 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.490
 it is commercialized 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.020
 Brazil 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.170
 winners of the market 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.470
 he cites for example the winner 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.190
 and 39 minutes and a half 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.460
 I was terrified of the mission of meeting up to 450 in the mind 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.050
 below him we have 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.170
 supplier for 35 books and will fully serve two bathrooms 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.970
 and the biggest winner of the two-bath category 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:11.549
 today's flow 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.809
 reaches 26 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.299
 books and a half 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.279
 twenty six and a half fingers 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.439
 he understands six and a half is the biggest winner 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.889
 in category 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.829
 39 meters and a half 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.829
 also the greatest asset of its category since 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.629
 simultaneously 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.889
 a kidney is an American company already established in Brazil 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.139
 in SÃ£o Paulo a unit in victory 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.009
 justice services 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:44.439
 all Brazil 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.909
 the product has been released 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.419
 two months ago 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.859
 with great success 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.889
 and most impressive in this sector 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.689
 is that you are practically absent from the year 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.139
 despite being a winner with forced exhaustion 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.179
 because it is a device 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.309
 fully enclosed 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.309
 the noise supposedly 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.469
 no no leaving when there was almost no 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.719
 Remote Control 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.239
 through wire 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:24.899
 which raises the temperature 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:25.829
 up to 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.349
 70 degrees 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.499
 the shameful 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.510
 this is lack of evidence but has seen the fans have 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.150
 through 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.299
 your control 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.999
 it is possible to do the service 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.159
 3 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.819
 at least twice 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:42.819
 there are no 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.579
 hence the need 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.729
 of adult life 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.909
 so we are showing here 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.909
 the heater beyond 39 minutes and a half 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.859
 logically behind this success we all have 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.939
 the burned country clothes said paulo 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.150
 the first company that I truly believe in this product is being 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
 far past success 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:18.379
 up to now the only air intake 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:19.029
 if the heater
