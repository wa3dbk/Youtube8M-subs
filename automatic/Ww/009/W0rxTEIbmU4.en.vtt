 to draw 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.380
 as they see when we go to draw 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.960
 shows a series of characters 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.670
 these are all the characters that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.850
 contains the application and which 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.829

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.060
 most animes 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.250
 popular or that most know good 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.570
 we will proceed to see in order to show a 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.010
 example of how to use the application 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.010
 We are going to use 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.159
 up girl to the renegade of light 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.070
 and as you see shows us in the part 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.560
 superior shows us this forward and 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.299
 back where we can follow this step to 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.659
 step to show us what we have 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.420
 to make a section of the size of the 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.300
 brush to erase the size of the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.410
 draft the type of effect that 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.020
 we want to give the drawing 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.820
 the opacity that we want to show 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.190
 a section 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.440
 if we want to save and a section of 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.080
 home to return to where they are 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.700
 all the drawings and below how do you see this 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.450
 the colors that we want to use 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.450
 to be able to paint 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.630
 and as you see there is that to be able 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.950
 erase now as we draw then 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.680
 just around the line to see 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.820
 this buoys isolate the brush around 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.680
 the line we do this or we surpass the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.350
 circle and the vertical line that are 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.260
 now we give in next and draw 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.790
 this all the lines that appear 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.790
 we appear more lines 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.670
 down and then we draw everything that we 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.550
 it seems clear that I think I think 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.069
 those who have for example one and 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.330
 have their styles then they will be able to 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:19.160
 draw the drawing much better 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.160
 and why not so much 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.120
 good as you see that is a bit what 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.239
 we have to do and it is improving 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.970
 well more or less here this can not be 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.260
 do everything very well but as they see more or 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.450
 less so 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.530
 It was so good and this is what we have 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.360
 fact 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.220
 Well, if we want to keep it 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.600
 we simply give in to save a flow 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.480
 to keep because the truth is that not 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.790
 I want I do not want to keep this and good 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.370
 this is what is the drawing section 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.079
 with respect to the section of his is the 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.660
 which we can use as 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.710
 template or how 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.830
 this 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.720
 as an image to be able to draw us 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.170
 on a sheet of paper or on another side that 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.780
 is not our android and here if it is more 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.910
 simple 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.550
 because now we are going to draw the goat 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.250
 because they only show us three buttons 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.709
 back forward and home and there we can this 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.790
 go step by step and show us 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.120
 all the steps that you have to follow to 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.699
 be able to draw 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.230
 and well this is this is all it does 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:31.680
 the application 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.990
 I hope you liked it if it's like that and 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.240
