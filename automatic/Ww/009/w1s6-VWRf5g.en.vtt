I<00:01:56.670> took<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:57.380> replaced<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> coils<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.070> rear

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
I took I replaced the coils on the rear

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.870 
I took I replaced the coils on the rear
it<00:01:59.939> has<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> coil<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.259> has<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> shock<00:02:01.880> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
it has a coil and it has a shock and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.700 
it has a coil and it has a shock and
there's<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.119> coil<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> back<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.200> put<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
there's a coil in the back that we put a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.499 
there's a coil in the back that we put a
new<00:02:05.280> coil<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:05.969> put<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> two<00:02:06.390> inch

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
new coil and then we put a two inch

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.529 
new coil and then we put a two inch
block<00:02:06.810> or<00:02:07.049> 3<00:02:07.229> inch<00:02:07.350> block<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.799> top<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.539> so

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
block or 3 inch block on top of that so

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.210 
block or 3 inch block on top of that so
when<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:09.840> compressed<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.679> with<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.099> Jags

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
when we compressed it with the Jags

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.510 
when we compressed it with the Jags
it<00:02:12.730> took<00:02:13.090> four<00:02:13.960> of<00:02:13.990> us<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.320> lift<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:15.070> plus

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
it took four of us to lift that plus

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.760 
it took four of us to lift that plus
with<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.030> jacks<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.600> get<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.320> know<00:02:17.410> to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
with the jacks to get it you know to

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.980 
with the jacks to get it you know to
tighten<00:02:18.130> up<00:02:18.220> really<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:19.510> what<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.780> what<00:02:19.960> is

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
tighten up really and so what is what is

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.040 
tighten up really and so what is what is
a<00:02:20.080> typical<00:02:20.320> like<00:02:21.130> build<00:02:21.820> in<00:02:22.060> terms<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.420> hours

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
a typical like build in terms of hours

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.050 
a typical like build in terms of hours
like<00:02:23.290> what<00:02:23.470> do<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.590> spend<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:25.200> 30<00:02:26.200> hours<00:02:27.060> from

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
like what do you spend on 30 hours from

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.960 
like what do you spend on 30 hours from
start<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.420> finish<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.750> start<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.050> finish<00:02:29.200> so

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
start to finish you start to finish so

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.050 
start to finish you start to finish so
in<00:02:30.970> terms<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.840> lift<00:02:32.080> or<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.440> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
in terms of the lift or the the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.150 
in terms of the lift or the the
components<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.210> used<00:02:34.540> what

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
components that you used what

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.350 
components that you used what
specifically<00:02:36.160> what<00:02:36.430> composers<00:02:36.880> use<00:02:36.910> for<00:02:37.300> the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
specifically what composers use for the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.340 
specifically what composers use for the
suspension<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.240> important<00:02:40.810> because<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
suspension this is important because the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.650 
suspension this is important because the
lift<00:02:41.530> kit<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.890> we<00:02:42.040> use<00:02:42.340> was<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:43.210> three<00:02:43.540> inch

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
lift kit that we use was a three inch

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.770 
lift kit that we use was a three inch
lift<00:02:44.970> basically<00:02:45.970> it's<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.210> three<00:02:46.450> inch<00:02:46.570> lift

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
lift basically it's a three inch lift

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.560 
lift basically it's a three inch lift
kit<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.590> we<00:02:47.770> turned<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.280> into<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.610> five<00:02:49.270> and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
kit but we turned it into a five and

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.240 
kit but we turned it into a five and
three-quarters<00:02:50.200> almost<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.590> six<00:02:50.830> inch<00:02:51.010> lift

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250

three-quarters almost a six inch lift
kit<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.840> what<00:02:52.840> we<00:02:52.960> did<00:02:53.140> was<00:02:53.350> we<00:02:53.620> took<00:02:53.800> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
kit and what we did was we took the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.590 
kit and what we did was we took the
three-inch<00:02:54.280> we<00:02:54.820> took<00:02:55.030> three-inch<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.510> the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
three-inch we took three-inch to the

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.020 
three-inch we took three-inch to the
front<00:02:55.900> three<00:02:56.350> inch<00:02:56.470> on<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.680> rear<00:02:56.890> two<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.000> a

half inches on the coil two inches on
the<00:03:02.560> strut<00:03:02.890> so<00:03:03.220> raise<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.610> up<00:03:03.700> like<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.000> said<00:03:04.210> six

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
the strut so raise it up like I said six

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.750 
the strut so raise it up like I said six
inches<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:05.110> terms<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:05.740> brands<00:03:06.250> what<00:03:06.670> did

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
inches in terms of like brands what did

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.270 
inches in terms of like brands what did
you<00:03:06.910> box<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.810> program<00:03:08.260> program<00:03:08.950> for<00:03:09.130> this

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
you box in the program program for this

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.070 
you box in the program program for this
is<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.430> lifetime<00:03:09.610> warranty<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:10.240> Fox<00:03:10.660> because

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
is the lifetime warranty and Fox because

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.610 
is the lifetime warranty and Fox because
of<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.610> performance<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.870> can't<00:03:14.200> beat<00:03:14.350> Fox

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
of the performance you can't beat Fox

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.280 
of the performance you can't beat Fox
and<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:15.610> what<00:03:15.970> parts<00:03:16.300> did<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.630> use<00:03:16.780> Fox<00:03:17.050> core

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
and so what parts did you use Fox core

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.949 
and so what parts did you use Fox core
we<00:03:18.190> use<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.850> rear<00:03:19.330> shocks<00:03:19.600> with<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
we use the rear shocks with the

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.800 
we use the rear shocks with the
reservoir<00:03:20.580> separate<00:03:21.580> reservoir<00:03:22.000> which<00:03:22.630> are

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
reservoir separate reservoir which are

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.620 
reservoir separate reservoir which are
filled<00:03:23.020> with<00:03:23.230> nitrogen<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:25.300> front

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
filled with nitrogen and the front

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.080 
filled with nitrogen and the front
struts<00:03:26.320> with<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> new<00:03:26.890> coil<00:03:27.160> filled<00:03:27.880> with

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
struts with a new coil filled with

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.900 
struts with a new coil filled with
nitrogen<00:03:28.420> as<00:03:28.630> well<00:03:28.920> before<00:03:29.920> they<00:03:30.430> used<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.730> be

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
nitrogen as well before they used to be

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.660 
nitrogen as well before they used to be
grease<00:03:31.300> now<00:03:31.780> it's<00:03:32.050> filled<00:03:32.530> with<00:03:32.620> nitrogen<00:03:32.890> you

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
grease now it's filled with nitrogen you

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.240 
grease now it's filled with nitrogen you
can<00:03:33.790> just<00:03:34.090> fill<00:03:34.360> it<00:03:34.480> up<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:34.870> be<00:03:35.560> done<00:03:35.740> with<00:03:35.800> it

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
can just fill it up and be done with it

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.650 
can just fill it up and be done with it
why<00:03:36.550> is<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.700> better<00:03:37.560> maintenance<00:03:39.660> usually

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
why is that better maintenance usually

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.860 
why is that better maintenance usually
over<00:03:41.560> time<00:03:41.830> after<00:03:42.100> abuse<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:43.480> know<00:03:43.510> start

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
over time after abuse you know start

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.590 
over time after abuse you know start
having<00:03:44.170> leakage<00:03:44.560> with<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.459> with<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.330> grease

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
having leakage with the with the grease

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.930 
having leakage with the with the grease
start<00:03:47.380> seeping<00:03:47.739> out<00:03:47.920> then<00:03:48.610> you<00:03:48.700> had<00:03:48.820> to

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
start seeping out then you had to

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.590 
start seeping out then you had to
replace<00:03:49.209> it

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
replace it

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.040 
replace it
well<00:03:50.140> why<00:03:50.560> have<00:03:50.739> a<00:03:50.770> nitrogen<00:03:51.070> stays<00:03:51.700> clean<00:03:52.050> it

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
well why have a nitrogen stays clean it

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.260 
well why have a nitrogen stays clean it
doesn't<00:03:53.350> leak<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.800> you<00:03:54.670> don't<00:03:54.970> have<00:03:55.150> to

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
doesn't leak and you don't have to

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.140 
doesn't leak and you don't have to
replace<00:03:55.540> them<00:03:55.890> broke<00:03:56.890> on<00:03:57.010> was<00:03:57.130> just<00:03:57.190> a<00:03:57.370> box<00:03:57.580> of

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
replace them broke on was just a box of

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.120 
replace them broke on was just a box of
nothing<00:03:58.989> special<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.620> mean<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.890> only<00:04:00.010> thing

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
nothing special I mean the only thing

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.830 
nothing special I mean the only thing
that<00:04:00.400> really<00:04:00.700> changed<00:04:01.150> on<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:01.330> rear<00:04:01.510> was<00:04:01.690> the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
that really changed on the rear was the

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.080 
that really changed on the rear was the
springs<00:04:02.230> that's<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.770> which<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.610> gave<00:04:03.760> her<00:04:03.940> to

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
springs that's it which you gave her to

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.340 
springs that's it which you gave her to
gave<00:04:04.360> it<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.540> stiffer<00:04:04.810> ride<00:04:05.050> on<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.320> rear<00:04:05.640> the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
gave it a stiffer ride on the rear the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.500 
gave it a stiffer ride on the rear the
other<00:04:08.350> thing<00:04:08.530> with<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.830> Fox<00:04:09.100> is<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.550> if<00:04:09.850> they

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
other thing with the Fox is that if they

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.690 
other thing with the Fox is that if they
do<00:04:10.810> need<00:04:11.020> to<00:04:11.140> get<00:04:11.320> if<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:11.890> do<00:04:12.100> get<00:04:12.520> to<00:04:12.640> the

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
do need to get if you do get to the

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.150 
do need to get if you do get to the
point<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.120> where<00:04:13.300> it<00:04:13.750> gets<00:04:14.050> a<00:04:14.140> little<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:15.100> know

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
point to where it gets a little you know

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.520 
point to where it gets a little you know
rugged<00:04:15.580> over<00:04:15.790> time<00:04:16.000> they<00:04:16.840> can<00:04:16.900> be<00:04:17.290> rebuilt

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
rugged over time they can be rebuilt

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.500 
rugged over time they can be rebuilt
they<00:04:18.280> don't<00:04:18.459> have<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:18.730> be<00:04:18.910> replaced

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
they don't have to be replaced

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.170 
they don't have to be replaced
so<00:04:20.770> that's<00:04:21.770> the<00:04:21.980> other<00:04:22.070> thing<00:04:22.400> all<00:04:22.760> the

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
so that's the other thing all the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.910 
so that's the other thing all the
o-rings<00:04:23.720> that<00:04:23.900> are<00:04:23.990> inside<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.530> thing<00:04:24.710> that

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
o-rings that are inside that thing that

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.530 
o-rings that are inside that thing that
compress<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:25.490> area<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:25.880> hold<00:04:26.060> that<00:04:26.210> air<00:04:26.360> in

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
compress that area and hold that air in

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.510 
compress that area and hold that air in
there<00:04:26.720> that's<00:04:27.590> some<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.830> them<00:04:27.950> you<00:04:28.070> just<00:04:28.340> take

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
there that's some of them you just take

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.860 
there that's some of them you just take
it<00:04:28.610> apart<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:28.970> replace<00:04:29.090> all<00:04:29.390> that<00:04:29.480> overhangs

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
it apart and replace all that overhangs

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.440 
it apart and replace all that overhangs
should<00:04:30.830> instead<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.190> instead<00:04:31.940> of<00:04:32.030> buying<00:04:32.240> a

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
should instead of instead of buying a

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.910 
should instead of instead of buying a
whole<00:04:32.600> new<00:04:32.780> part<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.170> can<00:04:33.320> just<00:04:33.470> rebuild<00:04:33.650> the

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
whole new part you can just rebuild the

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.280 
whole new part you can just rebuild the
part<00:04:34.100> you<00:04:34.160> have<00:04:34.690> interesting<00:04:35.690> instead<00:04:36.170> of

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
part you have interesting instead of

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.770 
part you have interesting instead of
bank<00:04:36.470> instead<00:04:36.740> of<00:04:36.860> paid<00:04:37.270> $1,700<00:04:38.270> for<00:04:38.300> front

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
bank instead of paid $1,700 for front

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.620 
bank instead of paid $1,700 for front
coils<00:04:39.140> and<00:04:39.260> shocks<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:40.520> can<00:04:40.700> pay<00:04:40.850> you<00:04:40.910> $200<00:04:41.570> to

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
coils and shocks you can pay you $200 to

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.010 
coils and shocks you can pay you $200 to
get<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:41.810> repaired<00:04:42.190> so<00:04:43.190> that's<00:04:43.760> it<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:44.870> how

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
get it repaired so that's it and so how

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.380 
get it repaired so that's it and so how
does<00:04:45.080> how<00:04:45.470> does<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.860> lift<00:04:46.160> kit<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.790> how

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
does how does the lift kit and the how

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.840 
does how does the lift kit and the how
does<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.630> lift<00:04:47.840> kit<00:04:47.960> in<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.200> suspension

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
does the lift kit in the suspension

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.650 
does the lift kit in the suspension
improve<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:51.110> capability<00:04:52.010> of<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:53.150> one<00:04:53.330> that

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
improve the capability of the one that

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.940 
improve the capability of the one that
you<00:04:53.780> build<00:04:54.020> it<00:04:54.170> actually<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.470> cruiser<00:04:54.680> that<00:04:54.800> you

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
you build it actually a cruiser that you

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.510 
you build it actually a cruiser that you
built<00:04:55.190> as<00:04:55.400> I<00:04:55.670> posted<00:04:56.150> like<00:04:56.300> a<00:04:56.360> factory<00:04:56.960> one

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
built as I posted like a factory one

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.780 
built as I posted like a factory one
well<00:04:58.520> with<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.890> one<00:05:00.890> thing<00:05:01.100> about<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.460> fj's

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
well with the one thing about the fj's

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.900 
well with the one thing about the fj's
it<00:05:02.030> has<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.180> crawl<00:05:02.510> mode<00:05:03.100> so<00:05:04.100> what<00:05:04.310> has<00:05:04.580> crawl

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
it has a crawl mode so what has crawl

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.900 
it has a crawl mode so what has crawl
mode<00:05:05.090> crawl<00:05:05.570> mode<00:05:05.780> yes<00:05:06.110> what<00:05:06.470> is<00:05:06.560> that

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
mode crawl mode yes what is that

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.190 
mode crawl mode yes what is that
basically<00:05:07.910> have<00:05:08.480> you<00:05:08.570> seen<00:05:08.750> these<00:05:08.900> trucks

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
basically have you seen these trucks

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.680 
basically have you seen these trucks
like<00:05:09.560> trophy<00:05:09.890> trucks<00:05:10.190> go<00:05:10.310> on<00:05:10.490> rock<00:05:11.180> climbing

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
like trophy trucks go on rock climbing

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.410 
like trophy trucks go on rock climbing
expeditions<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:12.800> all<00:05:12.890> that<00:05:13.070> what<00:05:13.760> helps<00:05:14.270> it

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
expeditions and all that what helps it

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.570 
expeditions and all that what helps it
and<00:05:15.170> it<00:05:15.290> has<00:05:15.440> that<00:05:15.650> feature<00:05:15.950> to<00:05:16.400> where<00:05:16.550> I

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
and it has that feature to where I

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.850 
and it has that feature to where I
loosen<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.090> suspension<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:18.380> when<00:05:18.560> you<00:05:18.620> have

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
loosen the suspension so when you have

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.370 
loosen the suspension so when you have
that<00:05:18.890> and<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:19.520> have<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:20.360> Fox<00:05:20.630> suspension<00:05:21.200> on

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
that and you have the Fox suspension on

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.860 
that and you have the Fox suspension on
there<00:05:21.850> it's<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:23.000> lie<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.240> makes<00:05:23.510> it<00:05:23.630> a<00:05:23.720> lot

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
there it's a lie it makes it a lot

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.870 
there it's a lie it makes it a lot
easier<00:05:23.930> for<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.710> driver<00:05:24.950> to<00:05:25.070> up<00:05:25.280> a<00:05:25.490> new<00:05:25.670> to

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
easier for the driver to up a new to

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.250 
easier for the driver to up a new to
maneuver<00:05:26.510> in<00:05:26.840> areas<00:05:27.650> that<00:05:27.680> needs<00:05:27.980> to<00:05:28.070> go<00:05:28.220> into

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
maneuver in areas that needs to go into

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.750 
maneuver in areas that needs to go into
the<00:05:30.260> stiffness<00:05:30.830> of<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.010> ride<00:05:31.220> it's<00:05:31.490> it's

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
the stiffness of the ride it's it's

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.400 
the stiffness of the ride it's it's
smoother<00:05:32.270> you<00:05:32.390> can<00:05:32.540> adjust<00:05:32.930> it<00:05:33.080> you<00:05:33.260> can

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
smoother you can adjust it you can

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.890 
smoother you can adjust it you can
adjust<00:05:33.650> it<00:05:33.950> from<00:05:34.040> from<00:05:34.280> 50<00:05:34.610> psi<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.090> 20<00:05:35.450> psi<00:05:35.660> if

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
adjust it from from 50 psi to 20 psi if

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.920 
adjust it from from 50 psi to 20 psi if
you<00:05:36.020> wanted<00:05:36.260> to<00:05:36.910> there's<00:05:37.910> many<00:05:38.750> different

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
you wanted to there's many different

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.660 
you wanted to there's many different
avenues<00:05:39.260> you<00:05:39.500> can<00:05:39.740> go<00:05:39.860> with<00:05:40.040> those<00:05:40.160> shocks<00:05:40.430> but

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
avenues you can go with those shocks but

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.060
