00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 a new attempt by ariel ortega in the 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.670
 football in this case in defenders of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.929
 belgrano was debut with goal of ariel that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.690
 good had a good participation 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.309
 taking into account the commitment before 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.269
 ball that we are reviewing was for 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.029
 the metropolitan b 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.740
 Defenders of Belgrano has only one 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.039
 unit or whenever they want we see what it was 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 the commitment with Ortega already on the court 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.810
 cold night but good now that I can 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.029
 Over there 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.579
 being in another division I can come to 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:40.590
 see and here I will be whenever I am 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:41.860
 free to come and play football more 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.260
 there of 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.510
 of the shirt and that people soccer 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.900
 he loves it beyond the shirt of the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.730
 which are fans and between a field 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.040
 it may be right or wrong or it may be 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.350
 better than others physically but look 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.530
 that in a week already was tuned was 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.600
 the 90 minutes made the goal and has those 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.600
 things that a different player does 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.580
 well well the truth that I saw this with 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.930
 many trips this when it has 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.660
 the ball always has a touch 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.100
 different and good that's what is going to 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.590
 keep going 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.900
 we did not think he was going to play less but 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.480
 in this he said that it felt good that 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.670
 It was good and good luckily because 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.110
 truly this 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.790
 and played much more minutes what 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.159
 we thought at first that I could 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.430
 play and make goals I think that gives you 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.080
 he gives encouragement makes you well but the most 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.430
 important to me is the game I think that 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.980
 the game 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.070
 in contact with the ball can get 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.810
 can have situations and good but 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.270
 good with the result out there a little 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.160
 sad is just done by people 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.590
 I also imagine that they did 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.080
 spirit everything adds up those things I think that 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.350
 they do well to make you happy and 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.080
 good today is going to be the agent of 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.740
 defenders her my companions that I 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.740
 they felt good
