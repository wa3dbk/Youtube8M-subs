00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.549 
free and they're not all going to cancer
patients<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.609> they<00:01:00.570> throw<00:01:00.840> away<00:01:00.930> most<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
patients and they throw away most of the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.930 
patients and they throw away most of the
hair<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.859> they<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.609> receive

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
hair that they get because they receive

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.509 
hair that they get because they receive
so<00:01:03.149> much<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.930> better<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> go<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> smaller

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so much so it's better to go to smaller

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.789 
so much so it's better to go to smaller
organizations<00:01:06.330> even<00:01:06.540> though<00:01:06.659> Pantene<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.290> now

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
organizations even though Pantene is now

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.020 
organizations even though Pantene is now
getting<00:01:08.100> their<00:01:08.250> word<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:08.820> they're

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
getting their word out there they're

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.210 
getting their word out there they're
probably<00:01:09.270> much<00:01:10.110> smaller<00:01:10.500> than<00:01:10.770> Locks<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.159> Love

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.059 
mean it's more awkward trying to get it
in<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.660> towel<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.770> it's<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.239> easy

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
in a towel but it's so easy

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.369 
in a towel but it's so easy
like<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.459> so<00:02:13.700> quick<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:14.329> dry<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.810> short

like it's so quick to just dry the short
hairdo<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:17.500> another<00:02:18.500> thing<00:02:18.829> is<00:02:19.099> like<00:02:19.909> I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230

okay<00:02:26.569> but<00:02:27.379> I<00:02:27.650> mean<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.250> all<00:02:28.400> depends<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:28.849> if

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
okay but I mean that all depends on if

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.699 
okay but I mean that all depends on if
you<00:02:29.120> have<00:02:29.269> like<00:02:29.450> naturally<00:02:29.900> straight<00:02:30.260> wavy<00:02:30.680> or

you have like naturally straight wavy or
curly<00:02:30.829> hair<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.840> just<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.799> to<00:02:33.829> straighten

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
curly hair but I just have to straighten

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.460 
curly hair but I just have to straighten
the<00:02:34.640> ends<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.390> way<00:02:35.569> because<00:02:35.870> they<00:02:36.290> like

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
the ends this way because they like

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.229 
the ends this way because they like
stick<00:02:36.739> out<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:38.750> other<00:02:38.900> way<00:02:39.139> so<00:02:40.090> that's<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
stick out the other way so that's the

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.520 
stick out the other way so that's the
only<00:02:41.389> thing<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.599> have<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.810> do<00:02:41.930> but<00:02:42.139> I<00:02:42.230> only<00:02:42.349> have
