00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.050 
use but if you have a 16-bit sound card
you<00:01:04.350> should<00:01:04.379> still<00:01:04.769> try<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.070> use<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.430> least<00:01:05.460> 96

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
you should still try to use at least 96

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
thousand Hertz and 16-bit that'll still

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.270 
thousand Hertz and 16-bit that'll still
give<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.580> some<00:01:08.820> kind<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:10.220> improvement<00:01:11.220> in

give you some kind of improvement in
audio<00:01:11.549> quality<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:13.369> you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.400> even<00:01:14.670> try<00:01:15.020> 192

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
audio quality and you can even try 192

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.899 
audio quality and you can even try 192
thousand<00:01:16.439> Hertz<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> 16-bit<00:01:17.610> card

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
thousand Hertz if you have a 16-bit card

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.270 
thousand Hertz if you have a 16-bit card
but<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.180> doubt<00:01:18.299> that'd<00:01:18.659> work<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.409> if

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
but I doubt that'd work for you and if

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.100 
but I doubt that'd work for you and if
you<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.549> 24-bit<00:01:21.030> card<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.750> right<00:01:21.960> now

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
you have a 24-bit card like right now

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.640 
you have a 24-bit card like right now
I'm<00:01:22.259> using<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.830> creative<00:01:23.220> x-fi<00:01:24.140> I'm<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.290> lot<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
I'm using a creative x-fi I'm a lot of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.270 
I'm using a creative x-fi I'm a lot of
on<00:01:26.130> board<00:01:26.729> newer<00:01:27.560> onboard<00:01:28.560> cards<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:29.130> now

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
on board newer onboard cards are now

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.100 
on board newer onboard cards are now
24-bit<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> might<00:01:30.810> want<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> try<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.909> I

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
24-bit so you might want to try it I

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.469 
24-bit so you might want to try it I
would<00:01:34.110> try<00:01:34.320> 96<00:01:35.009> thousand<00:01:35.400> Hertz<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.850> 24-bit

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
would try 96 thousand Hertz and 24-bit

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.080 
would try 96 thousand Hertz and 24-bit
if<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.900> 24-bit<00:01:37.350> card<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.939> that

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
if you have a 24-bit card and if that

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.340 
if you have a 24-bit card and if that
doesn't<00:01:39.360> work<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.110> don't<00:01:40.259> get

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
doesn't work for you like you don't get

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.899 
doesn't work for you like you don't get
any<00:01:40.560> audio<00:01:40.710> when<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.189> set<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.729> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
any audio when you set it to like that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.999 
any audio when you set it to like that
then<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.960> would<00:01:43.110> try<00:01:43.259> 48<00:01:46.130> 48<00:01:47.130> thousand<00:01:47.520> Hertz

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
then I would try 48 48 thousand Hertz

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.940 
then I would try 48 48 thousand Hertz
but<00:01:50.570> 96<00:01:51.570> thousand<00:01:51.930> Hertz<00:01:52.110> should<00:01:52.320> work<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:52.920> you

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
but 96 thousand Hertz should work if you

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.719 
but 96 thousand Hertz should work if you
have<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> 24-bit<00:01:53.549> card<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.720> will<00:01:54.780> give<00:01:54.960> you

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
have a 24-bit card and it will give you

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.490 
have a 24-bit card and it will give you
the<00:01:56.729> best<00:01:56.880> audio<00:01:57.270> quality<00:01:57.479> possible<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.380> your

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the best audio quality possible for your

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.480 
the best audio quality possible for your
card<00:02:00.560> after<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.920> set<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> setting<00:02:02.460> you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
card after you set the setting you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.639 
card after you set the setting you
should<00:02:02.729> notice<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.060> your<00:02:03.990> base<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> little

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
should notice that your base is a little

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.789 
should notice that your base is a little
bit<00:02:04.770> louder<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.490> more<00:02:05.850> clear<00:02:06.180> everything's

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
bit louder it's more clear everything's

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.130 
bit louder it's more clear everything's
more<00:02:07.799> clear<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.280> crisped<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.869> sounds

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
more clear and crisped and just sounds

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.600 
more clear and crisped and just sounds
better<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.470> general

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
better in general

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.450 
better in general
so<00:02:12.180> I'm<00:02:12.780> going<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.170> set<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.470> 96<00:02:14.070> thousand

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
so I'm going to set it to 96 thousand

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.720 
so I'm going to set it to 96 thousand
Hertz<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.820> 24-bit<00:02:15.420> which<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.870> studio<00:02:16.170> quali

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
Hertz in 24-bit which is studio quali

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.440 
Hertz in 24-bit which is studio quali
