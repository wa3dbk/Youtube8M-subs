Today we are downtown Los Angeles
and currently we are working on 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
a print ad for the Ford Fusion.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We've got an amazing artist, 
Liu Bolin, from China.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My works are called Hiding in the City.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.600
We are blending the cars into the background 
creating these invisible cars.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.000
He is painting these vehicles to blend in 
but then we want to have the Fusion stand out 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so we have Jeff Ludes and his talents 
for shooting beautiful sheet metal

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.800
to do that part of it.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.000
It looks good!

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The combination of their two talents 
is really going to make these ads 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
something amazing and special.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.800
So, this is a little different 
than what we usually do. 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.500
What we do is, we get our camera angle, 
we put everything in place, plot out the hero car, 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.000
we will shoot a blank frame, put the cars back in 
and then superimpose those on each other.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We set up our grid work, 
they paint those in matching textures.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
For example, the colors need to be accurate.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.300
All the painters we have 
are trained as studio painters. 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.000
There are certain techniques they use.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But what is different is 
that it needs to be painted 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.500
on a three dimensional object.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.000
It is kind of like camouflage on a tank; 
you have to hide the outline shape

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which is far more complex.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500
Everything needs to look uniform 
from one perspective, so there is 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.000
a degree of difficulty involved.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
These guys are professional 
Hollywood background painters 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and when their background paintings look real 
is when they are thrown out of focus and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
they are deep in the distance 
but for us we need to see all 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
those brush strokes and we 
need them to be very sharp.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
For our hero shots we are using 
the Phase IQ160 and the IQ180.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We have got this digital back 
that is incredibly precise, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.300
incredibly sharp detail, and I think 
it is only going to enhance the effect.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Today we brought Liu into the retouching room 
to show him our first two images completed.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.500
We have really sought out this very heroic, 
beautiful lighting and I think that is only 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.000
enhanced the separation between the 
perfect car and the very human painting.
