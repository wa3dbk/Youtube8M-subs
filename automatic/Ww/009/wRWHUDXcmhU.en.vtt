that song that's reverse the switch is
in<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.640> reverse<00:01:27.330> position<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.220> like<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
in the reverse position I like that to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.800 
in the reverse position I like that to
change<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> channel<00:01:30.990> three<00:01:32.060> move<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
change that to channel three move on to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.530 
change that to channel three move on to
the<00:01:34.220> amount<00:01:35.720> select<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:38.000> change<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.299> to

the amount select that change that to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.749 
the amount select that change that to
minus<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> hundred<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> switches<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
minus a hundred so it switches the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.730 
minus a hundred so it switches the
throttle<00:01:45.210> off<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> safety<00:01:46.710> switches<00:01:47.159> on

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
throttle off and the safety switches on

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:57.570 
throttle off and the safety switches on
move<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> tick<00:01:50.549> box<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.570> tick<00:01:52.350> that

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.670 

exit<00:01:58.580> we<00:01:59.480> now<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.900> no<00:02:00.080> throttle<00:02:01.900> we<00:02:02.900> switch

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
exit we now have no throttle we switch

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.650 
exit we now have no throttle we switch
the<00:02:03.860> safety<00:02:04.250> switch<00:02:04.520> on<00:02:04.760> and<00:02:05.030> we<00:02:05.270> have<00:02:05.390> not
