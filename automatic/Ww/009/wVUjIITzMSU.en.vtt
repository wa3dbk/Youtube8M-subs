use sky uppercut because I don't have
high<00:02:23.739> jump<00:02:23.980> kick<00:02:24.040> because<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:25.030> blaze<00:02:25.269> can't

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
high jump kick because this blaze can't

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.750 
high jump kick because this blaze can't
fails<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.110> yeah<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.069> doesn't<00:02:27.310> really<00:02:27.549> do<00:02:27.730> much

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.150 
and yeah so like the thing is is that
you<00:05:37.390> can't<00:05:37.660> like<00:05:37.840> transfer<00:05:38.560> berries<00:05:38.950> from

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
you can't like transfer berries from

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.700 
you can't like transfer berries from
your<00:05:39.340> 4th<00:05:39.550> gen<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.960> your<00:05:41.080> 5th<00:05:41.260> gen<00:05:41.500> and

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
your 4th gen to your 5th gen and

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.320 
your 4th gen to your 5th gen and
apparently<00:05:42.070> no<00:05:42.370> where<00:05:42.580> in<00:05:42.730> 5th<00:05:42.970> gen<00:05:43.180> you're

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
apparently no where in 5th gen you're

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.820 
apparently no where in 5th gen you're
allowed<00:05:43.510> to<00:05:43.630> get<00:05:43.750> any<00:05:43.780> of<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.140> pinch<00:05:44.410> berries

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
allowed to get any of the pinch berries

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.170 
allowed to get any of the pinch berries
so<00:05:45.220> apparently<00:05:45.910> it

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
so apparently it

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.570 
so apparently it
illegal<00:05:46.750> as<00:05:46.930> of<00:05:47.620> right<00:05:47.650> now<00:05:47.830> until<00:05:48.220> they<00:05:48.400> make

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
illegal as of right now until they make

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.249 
illegal as of right now until they make
an<00:05:48.669> event<00:05:48.910> that<00:05:49.060> gives<00:05:49.449> you<00:05:49.570> the<00:05:49.600> berry<00:05:49.870> but

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
an event that gives you the berry but

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.219 
an event that gives you the berry but
whatever<00:05:50.919> you're<00:05:51.759> using<00:05:51.789> Garchomp<00:05:52.539> so<00:05:52.840> don't

was praying for the day I'm a flinch

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.790 
was praying for the day I'm a flinch
which<00:06:09.039> is<00:06:09.600> would<00:06:10.600> have<00:06:10.690> been<00:06:10.780> awesome<00:06:10.930> but<00:06:11.199> he

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
which is would have been awesome but he

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.740 
which is would have been awesome but he
didn't<00:06:12.100> did<00:06:12.190> he<00:06:12.250> use<00:06:12.430> his<00:06:12.460> close<00:06:12.729> combat<00:06:12.970> which

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
didn't did he use his close combat which

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.469 
didn't did he use his close combat which
is<00:06:13.930> quite<00:06:14.199> weird<00:06:14.470> because<00:06:14.800> I'm<00:06:15.039> four<00:06:15.400> times

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
is quite weird because I'm four times

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.400 
is quite weird because I'm four times
strong<00:06:16.479> stance<00:06:16.810> it<00:06:16.930> but<00:06:17.020> as<00:06:17.110> though<00:06:17.199> it<00:06:17.289> kills

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
strong stance it but as though it kills

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.550 
strong stance it but as though it kills
me<00:06:17.620> I<00:06:18.270> guess<00:06:19.270> he<00:06:19.360> used<00:06:19.539> it<00:06:19.720> to<00:06:21.240> not<00:06:22.240> miss<00:06:22.960> stone

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
me I guess he used it to not miss stone

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.620 
me I guess he used it to not miss stone
edge<00:06:23.710> or<00:06:23.919> something<00:06:24.220> so<00:06:24.460> yeah<00:06:24.759> I<00:06:25.030> guess<00:06:25.479> is
