00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.210
 rabbit apart from those he showed yesterday and 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.070
 is a murderous rabbit inside the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.239
 probability of 1000 rabbits there is one that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.699
 I can make him go like a rabbit 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.129
 murderer and said white rabbit with the 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.589
 reddish mouth like blood as it has 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.929
 bitten a lot watching TV screen and 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.210
 when this rabbit theme is on screen 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.999
 appears to have been killed has 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.339
 killed at the hands of a killer rabbit 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:03.929
 to fall vanoc and good this of the rabbit 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.850
 corpse killer in vain is about a 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.409
 film movie king arthur the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.330
 king Arthur and the knights of the table 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.650
 round and there's a scene where it appears 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.240
 a rabbit is a pretty movie 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.159
 strange 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.950
 and a rabbit starts to kill the 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.079
 warriors if a rabbit and then the joke 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.210
 to put the title said rabbit good 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.649
 the name is the corpse van assassin 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.570
 leaves with the killers to drop the ball 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.340
 taken out said movie is a joke that 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.869
 said the angels king but equally what 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.700
 safer is that you rabbit simply 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.560
 one hundred percent since he has put images 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.420
 and others are working on it and I guess 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.460
 that if they will implement it equally 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.990
 tomorrow day Wednesday there will be snapshot 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.850
 you know now the session is going to be 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.049
 on Wednesday of Thursday and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.580
 let's hope that this implement of the 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.850
 rabbits just like this killer rabbit 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.740
 to see what it does is that it gives 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.200
 feeling that it's going to be pretty 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.940
 dangerous I do not know to know with your 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.619
 Remove hearts from a bite or a 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.250
 know how it attacks you is that it does not hit you 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.959
 kicks when jumping anything and good 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.090
