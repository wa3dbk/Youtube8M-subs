00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
between them roughly 5 to 8 reps it's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.319 
between them roughly 5 to 8 reps it's
low<00:00:59.010> enough<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.489> results<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.000> gaining

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
low enough to see results in gaining

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.270 
low enough to see results in gaining
strength<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.780> also<00:01:01.109> high<00:01:01.530> enough<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.100> see

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
strength and also high enough to see

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
strength and also high enough to see
enough<00:01:02.460> hypertrophy<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.449> building<00:01:03.780> muscle

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
enough hypertrophy to be building muscle

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.750 
enough hypertrophy to be building muscle
so<00:01:04.379> here's<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> great<00:01:04.979> dirty<00:01:05.280> rule<00:01:05.580> you'll

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
so here's the great dirty rule you'll

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760 
so here's the great dirty rule you'll
pick<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.150> exercise<00:01:06.450> let's<00:01:07.020> say<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> deadlift

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
pick an exercise let's say the deadlift

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.050 
pick an exercise let's say the deadlift
you're<00:01:08.070> gonna<00:01:08.189> have<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.460> rep<00:01:08.640> range<00:01:08.880> of

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
you're gonna have your rep range of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.210 
you're gonna have your rep range of
roughly<00:01:09.360> 5<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.930> 8<00:01:10.080> reps<00:01:10.380> which<00:01:10.650> means<00:01:10.860> every

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
roughly 5 to 8 reps which means every

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.550 
roughly 5 to 8 reps which means every
single<00:01:11.250> set<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.060> shoot<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.420> 5<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.869> 8<00:01:12.960> reps<00:01:13.200> now

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
single set you shoot for 5 to 8 reps now

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.969 
single set you shoot for 5 to 8 reps now
now<00:01:14.340> never<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.240> tough<00:01:15.930> now<00:01:16.320> I'm<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.560> joking

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
now never get tough now I'm just joking

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.920 
now never get tough now I'm just joking
it's<00:01:17.130> very<00:01:17.369> simple<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.509> what<00:01:18.780> you're

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
it's very simple actually so what you're

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.510 
it's very simple actually so what you're
gonna<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.530> select<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.070> weight<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.369> could

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
gonna do is select the weight you could

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.390 
gonna do is select the weight you could
dominate<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.509> set<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.259> those<00:01:22.409> 8<00:01:22.650> reps<00:01:23.070> right

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
dominate the set for those 8 reps right

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.710 
dominate the set for those 8 reps right
so<00:01:23.580> let's<00:01:23.759> say<00:01:23.909> you're<00:01:24.090> doing<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> tail<00:01:24.570> if

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
so let's say you're doing the tail if

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.140 
so let's say you're doing the tail if
you<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.170> started<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.920> about<00:01:26.150> 225

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
you just get started and you about 225

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.690 
you just get started and you about 225
pounds<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.049> eight<00:01:28.259> solid<00:01:28.920> reps<00:01:29.340> let's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
pounds and you do eight solid reps let's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
pounds and you do eight solid reps let's
say<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.880> got<00:01:30.060> three<00:01:30.360> more<00:01:30.600> sets<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.320> your

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
say you got three more sets now in your

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.289 
say you got three more sets now in your
overall<00:01:31.799> workout<00:01:32.100> you're<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.460> 4<00:01:32.759> sets<00:01:32.970> intro

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
overall workout you're do 4 sets intro

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.940 
overall workout you're do 4 sets intro
to<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> deadlift<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.079> want<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.439> now<00:01:34.560> increase

the weight ever so slightly grab a pair
of<00:01:36.930> two<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> half<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:38.130> small

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
of two and a half so it's really small

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.640 
of two and a half so it's really small
place<00:01:38.610> slap<00:01:39.210> them<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.750> either<00:01:39.900> side<00:01:40.259> now

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
place slap them on on either side now

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.170 
place slap them on on either side now
your<00:01:40.860> total<00:01:41.280> weight<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> deadlift<00:01:42.030> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
your total weight for the deadlift is

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
your total weight for the deadlift is
230<00:01:42.990> pounds<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.500> will<00:01:43.590> try<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.070> many

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
230 pounds you will try and do as many

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.710 
230 pounds you will try and do as many
reps<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.670> possible<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> maximum<00:01:45.600> would

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
reps as possible the maximum would

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.719 
reps as possible the maximum would
obviously<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.170> 8<00:01:46.500> you're<00:01:47.040> trying<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> keep<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
obviously be 8 you're trying to keep the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.340 
obviously be 8 you're trying to keep the
form<00:01:47.939> nice<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.329> straight<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.659> then<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.200> get

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
form nice and straight and then you get

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.980 
form nice and straight and then you get
230<00:01:50.130> pounds<00:01:50.520> times<00:01:50.790> 8<00:01:51.090> you'd<00:01:51.479> increase<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
230 pounds times 8 you'd increase the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.780 
230 pounds times 8 you'd increase the
weight<00:01:52.140> again<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.710> keep<00:01:53.009> increasing<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
weight again you keep increasing the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.219 
weight again you keep increasing the
weight<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.060> let's<00:01:54.210> say<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> third<00:01:54.869> set<00:01:55.079> you

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
weight so let's say on the third set you

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.620 
weight so let's say on the third set you
do<00:01:55.350> 235<00:01:56.310> pounds<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:56.759> 5<00:01:56.969> more<00:01:57.180> pounds<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
do 235 pounds that's 5 more pounds and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.539 
do 235 pounds that's 5 more pounds and
you<00:01:57.840> only<00:01:58.079> get<00:01:58.350> about<00:01:58.590> 6<00:01:59.070> reps

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
you only get about 6 reps

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.190 
you only get about 6 reps
over<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> next<00:02:00.329> coming<00:02:00.630> weeks<00:02:00.840> where<00:02:01.049> you're

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
over the next coming weeks where you're

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.319 
over the next coming weeks where you're
gonna<00:02:01.290> try<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> 235<00:02:03.149> pounds

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
gonna try and do with the 235 pounds

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.389 
gonna try and do with the 235 pounds
let's<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.930> one<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> two<00:02:04.409> more<00:02:04.770> reps<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
let's get one to two more reps so you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.580 
let's get one to two more reps so you
get<00:02:05.579> once<00:02:05.790> again<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.360> upper<00:02:06.840> rep<00:02:07.110> limit

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
get once again to that upper rep limit

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.199 
get once again to that upper rep limit
so<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.860> keep<00:02:08.009> progressing<00:02:08.190> by<00:02:08.759> increasing

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
so you keep progressing by increasing

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:09.600 
so you keep progressing by increasing
the<00:02:09.300> red

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
the red

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.610 
the red
until<00:02:09.880> your<00:02:10.180> maximum<00:02:10.690> rep<00:02:10.900> range<00:02:11.170> which<00:02:11.380> for

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
until your maximum rep range which for

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.280 
until your maximum rep range which for
you<00:02:11.740> is<00:02:11.770> 8<00:02:12.250> reps<00:02:12.640> once<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.390> get<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.780> 8<00:02:13.930> reps

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
you is 8 reps once you get to the 8 reps

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.140 
you is 8 reps once you get to the 8 reps
you<00:02:14.470> increase<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.040> weight<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.460> sounds<00:02:15.880> too

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
you increase the weight it sounds too

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.360 
you increase the weight it sounds too
simple<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.570> be<00:02:16.690> true<00:02:16.720> but<00:02:17.260> from<00:02:17.500> any<00:02:17.800> veteran
