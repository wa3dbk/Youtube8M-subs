00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello people welcome to a smartphone or 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.060
 for all of these us here in 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.970
 our friend recording studio and 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.490
 we are appearing another super experience 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.519
 super easy if it's called the egg 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.049
 jumping and we will need 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.520
 easy material tools 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.890
 get home in a row and it's not going to 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.210
 be able to say here where to buy material 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.039
 where to hire other material 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.990
 because they are 100 in any 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.280
 supermarket so now we're going to 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.030
 our work table 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.030
 i 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.050
 and 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.950
 ah 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.810
 i 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.360
 of people once here at our table 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.130
 work we will notice that they are the 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.120
 materials we need to use 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:04.030
 first vinegar a jar where we are going to 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.550
 put the vinegar and let's use an egg 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.500
 and it's very easy to do it but we 're not going 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.450
 to have to make them take our 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.799
 coordinators 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.799
 take a little vinegar 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.350
 let's put an air inside what 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.350
 enough to cover the egg 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.470
 Now we are going to have to put the egg 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.409
 inside the vinegar very carefully 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.450
 so that it does not break 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.170
 and this here we are going to have to leave 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.240
 for three days to make sure 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.880
 can be two days can sometimes be 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.380
 can be less if they can see now with 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.170
 the attention will look like vinegar 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.459
 is acting on the egg shell 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.950
 and it is generating gas bubbles 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.500
 carbonic this we're going to have to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.880
 leave room where nobody touches it if not 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.880
 you have to do every one does not have to break 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.970
 once you have spent the day it 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.980
 let's check out the vinegar they will see 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.690
 that the vinegar is whiter and now 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.880
 let's explain why and let's see 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.170
 what is the result of egg with a lot 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.170
 we are going to take care 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.750
 and the result of the whole race would 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.470
 a good 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.900
 jump and as you can see 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.910
 not only is jumping, but as you can 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.180
 see the shell was soft as if 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.080
 it was made of jelly and it was transparent and 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.220
 we can even see the yolk of the egg 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.120
 in 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.120
 they can not see 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.080
 well I think it's worth saying that 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.930
 be very careful because the shell 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.840
 it is very soft and with any blow 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.490
 brusque you can burst well what 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.160
 have these are two explanations 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.170
 interesting one is that this works 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.500
 just like when we made the bone when 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.450
 we made the soft bone so much bone 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.310
 as the shell contain calcium and what 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.980
 what vinegar does is run all the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.010
 calcium phosphate all that calcium is left 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.260
 here in the vinegar we will not take 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.850
 vinegar but it is a good source of 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.640
 calcium 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.190
 another interesting thing that I would not know 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.530
 say if it is well proven because it is 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.990
 a home remedy and as you know 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.430
 the home remedies do not work 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.130
 as they say and not everything is 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.440
 scientifically proven but if one 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.710
 manages to replace for example the vinegar 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.160
 with lemon, which is another acid , which is 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.920
 more pleasant to take and we put the shell 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.570
 of the egg what the lemon acid does 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.910
 is to remove or run all that calcium 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.160
 that has the egg shell and it's going to 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.200
 stay in the juice of the lemon in the glass 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.850
 if we leave it for 12 hours until it 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.210
 soften the skin we will have everything 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.310
 the calcium and according to say the grandmothers and 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.830
 the old home remedies and the 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.900
 old recipe is a good source of 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.950
 calcium for those who have problems in 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.340
 eye bones 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.190
 I'm clarifying I do not know if it's proven 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.230
 It is a home remedy but as 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.750
 I consider it harmless then 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.519
 I think it's good to say it and good 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.919
 the last thing I wanted to clarify before 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.139
 that start to spend to put me 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.600
 negative comment or to tell me that I am 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.860
 a dirty that I do not bathe I mean that 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.620
 this experience I already had 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.880
 prepared three days before and this 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.430
 sure I had put my ship in it 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.620
 first and the jumping I changed it to 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.389
 to be able to do the experience today and not 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.800
 you have to do it within three days and 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.200
 If you want to see more videos like these, 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.200
 go to one page for all 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.530
 to continue with this experience 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.720
 then we are going to visit the game of 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.000
 booty is stitched hard-boiled egg is a take off 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.660
 when they do not put it to huelva 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.660
 all right 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.970
 another thing
