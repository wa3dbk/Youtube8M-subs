00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.700
 do you know cooking cooking 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:08.980
 forgiveness low temperature 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.630
 it's the trendy kitchen at under 100 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.640
 degrees the foods are more juicy 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.349
 tastier they cook more 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.689
 long time but keep all their 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.929
 nutritional qualities adriano sow the 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.980
 nifa wholesale and ingrid square expert bio 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.509
 and healthy cooking 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.640
 anne-charlotte taudière no longer cooks 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.199
 that at low temperatures and for that she 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.239
 had to equip a little with 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.589
 specific utensils there is on a 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.140
 thermometer that indicates the temperature 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.329
 that there is inside the container and 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.610
 so it helps to stop the fire 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.350
 when exceeded 60 degrees as soon as 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.010
 goes to the 60 degrees one enters the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.870
 Red zone 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.570
 that is to say, we will start 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.040
 risk losing nutrients a good 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.410
 index because in the kitchens in the world 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.360
 often at 200 ° far too much for 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.100
 foods that lose their vitamins and 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.810
 then another advantage is that we do not have 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.970
 need to add or fat 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.530
 nor salt because with low cooking 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.390
 temperature it's a whole world 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.460
 opens to you the chef david toutain in 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.410
 has also made his specialty is 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.880
 to avoid greasing the products 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.159
 just tell the tunes for the 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.810
 sublimate for laurent to avoid the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.429
 hurry up that's the low temperature no 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.890
 uses it for them by the kitchens 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:14.319
 wheels that will take more time 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.880
 but at least that allows us to 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.380
 control the flesh a lot more 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.759
 easily the particular dogs of this 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.039
 back of cod that we will dive 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.359
 in a bath of olive oil or % star 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.369
 a yellow card that will allow us 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.079
 to regulate the temperature of the water 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.899
 serves that all the water is going to be at 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.439
 around 60 4 degrees so the 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.299
 oil bath either at 69 61 degrees during 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.429
 two minutes to one side two minutes to 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.020
 the other and four minutes of rest because 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.189
 to cook at low temperatures 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.170
 take your time 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.270
 as for this carrot that will confirm 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.229
 in his bed of salted butter gently to 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.060
 corner of the furnace 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.140
 for two to three hours it will take 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.909
 less time when to taste it 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.190
 a little word a cod that is not 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.900
 at all not at all it's really very 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.159
 good god for these answers from 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.780
 new flavors finally weddings 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.490
 are more daring in the restoration 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.799
 traditional 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.070
 a little to the ex ambassador balèze allows 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.620
 to better respect 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.620
 and so rooney the original flavor
