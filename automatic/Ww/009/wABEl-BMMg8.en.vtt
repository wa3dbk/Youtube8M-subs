00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.590 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:03.179> embed<00:00:03.680> multiple<00:00:04.680> foscam<00:00:05.370> camera<00:00:06.330> feeds

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
to embed multiple foscam camera feeds

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.140 
to embed multiple foscam camera feeds
into<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.109> single<00:00:07.589> webpage<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:08.370> get<00:00:09.030> that

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
into a single webpage I get that

people have you know different comfort
levels<00:00:16.170> when<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.740> comes<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.070> programming<00:00:17.730> and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
levels when it comes to programming and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.090 
levels when it comes to programming and
different<00:00:18.150> experiences<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.930> such<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:20.070> I

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
different experiences and such so what I

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.910 
different experiences and such so what I
did<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.490> created<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.970> website<00:00:21.710> that<00:00:22.710> will

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
did is I created this website that will

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.000 
did is I created this website that will
auto-generate<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:24.119> code<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.810> it's<00:00:25.619> pretty

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
auto-generate the code and it's pretty

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.589 
auto-generate the code and it's pretty
straightforward<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:27.150> if<00:00:27.240> you're<00:00:27.359> still

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
camera so in this case I'm gonna put the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.460 
camera so in this case I'm gonna put the
fi8<00:02:51.330> 918<00:02:52.050> W<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.560> actually<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.550> fi8<00:02:54.080> 918<00:02:55.080> W

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
fi8 918 W I actually have the fi8 918 W

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.730 
fi8 918 W I actually have the fi8 918 W
and<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.010> 982<00:02:56.820> one<00:02:57.000> W<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:58.140> know<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.530> works

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
and the 982 one W so I know this works

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.910 
and the 982 one W so I know this works
with<00:02:58.950> that<00:03:00.020> from<00:03:01.020> experience<00:03:01.170> I've<00:03:01.710> learned

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
with that from experience I've learned

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.430 
with that from experience I've learned
that<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.190> 10<00:03:02.400> W<00:03:02.820> behaves<00:03:03.240> like<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.630> 18<00:03:04.050> W<00:03:04.350> the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
that the 10 W behaves like the 18 W the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.130 
that the 10 W behaves like the 18 W the
API<00:03:04.710> is<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.250> same<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:05.910> that's<00:03:06.720> why<00:03:06.840> we<00:03:07.020> can

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
API is the same so that's why we can

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.930 
API is the same so that's why we can
support<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.710> well<00:03:07.890> for<00:03:08.190> other<00:03:08.340> cameras<00:03:08.790> I

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
support that as well for other cameras I

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.400 
support that as well for other cameras I
don't<00:03:09.210> know<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.390> haven't<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.840> don't<00:03:09.990> have<00:03:10.170> them

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
don't know I haven't I don't have them

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.400 
don't know I haven't I don't have them
haven't<00:03:11.130> played<00:03:11.310> with<00:03:11.490> them<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:13.260> know

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
haven't played with them but you know

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.080 
haven't played with them but you know
these<00:03:13.770> three<00:03:14.040> cameras<00:03:14.340> are<00:03:14.490> supported<00:03:14.970> so

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
these three cameras are supported so

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.180 
these three cameras are supported so
you're<00:03:15.300> going<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:16.470> are<00:03:16.500> going<00:03:16.950> to

you're going to do that you are going to

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:25.360 
you're going to do that you are going to
put<00:03:17.610> your<00:03:17.760> other<00:03:18.090> camera<00:03:19.400> in<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:21.240> second<00:03:21.630> URL

the FI 981 W and if I had a third and
fourth<00:03:33.180> camera<00:03:33.600> I'd<00:03:33.720> do<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.990> same<00:03:34.190> now<00:03:35.190> what's

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
fourth camera I'd do the same now what's

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.470 
fourth camera I'd do the same now what's
important<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.790> note<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:35.940> I'm<00:03:36.120> using<00:03:36.240> my

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
important to note is I'm using my

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.110 
important to note is I'm using my
internal<00:03:36.930> network<00:03:37.320> IP<00:03:37.800> address<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.940> have

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
internal network IP address if you have

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.970 
internal network IP address if you have
done<00:03:39.300> all<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.630> port<00:03:39.960> forwarding<00:03:40.350> stuff<00:03:40.650> and

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
done all this port forwarding stuff and

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.370 
done all this port forwarding stuff and
your<00:03:41.460> camera<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:42.000> accessible<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.020> outside

your camera is accessible to the outside

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.490 
your camera is accessible to the outside
world<00:03:43.700> then<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.940> would<00:03:45.060> be<00:03:45.180> putting<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.900> you

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.120 
world then you would be putting that you
know<00:03:46.650> IP<00:03:47.430> address<00:03:47.850> there<00:03:48.090> well<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.750> would<00:03:48.870> be<00:03:48.990> a

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
seem to be working they look different

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.930 
seem to be working they look different
and<00:04:09.990> I'm<00:04:10.620> gonna<00:04:10.709> scroll<00:04:11.040> down<00:04:11.220> further<00:04:11.580> and

and I'm gonna scroll down further and
I'm<00:04:12.930> just<00:04:13.050> gonna<00:04:13.170> copy<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:14.070> this<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:14.880> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
I'm just gonna copy this and this is the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.699 
I'm just gonna copy this and this is the
code<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:15.570> is<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.959> code<00:04:16.170> that<00:04:16.200> you're

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
code so I this is the code that you're

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.800 
code so I this is the code that you're
seeing<00:04:16.980> well<00:04:17.250> you're<00:04:17.850> seeing<00:04:18.120> something<00:04:18.480> I'm

stringing it down in this screen but
essentially<00:04:21.030> this<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.480> code<00:04:21.630> you're

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
essentially this is the code you're

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.460

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
what you can do for test for a test

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.059 
what you can do for test for a test
we'll<00:04:27.449> do<00:04:27.539> that<00:04:27.569> here<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:28.470> I'm<00:04:28.650> gonna<00:04:28.800> paste

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:37.209 
we'll do that here is I'm gonna paste
that<00:04:29.280> code<00:04:29.550> in<00:04:29.789> here<00:04:29.819> and<00:04:30.740> I'm<00:04:31.740> gonna<00:04:31.860> save<00:04:32.159> it
