these<00:01:47.719> are<00:01:47.810> applications<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:48.439> are<00:01:48.530> built

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
these are applications that are built

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.380 
these are applications that are built
according<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.280> all<00:01:49.460> of<00:01:49.609> the<00:01:49.729> rules<00:01:49.939> that<00:01:50.210> have

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
using flash platform tooling so the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.589 
using flash platform tooling so the
opportunities<00:02:19.170> are<00:02:19.250> almost<00:02:20.250> endless<00:02:20.599> you

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
opportunities are almost endless you

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.880 
opportunities are almost endless you
could<00:02:21.780> start<00:02:22.049> with<00:02:22.140> content<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.769> you've

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
could start with content that you've

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.430 
could start with content that you've
built<00:02:23.129> for<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.549> web<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.480> deliver<00:02:25.379> that

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
built for the web and deliver that

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.259 
built for the web and deliver that
specifically<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.519> iphone<00:02:26.879> making

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
specifically to the iphone making

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.930 
specifically to the iphone making
modifications<00:02:27.659> and<00:02:28.260> optimizing<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.040> or<00:02:29.250> maybe

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
modifications and optimizing it or maybe

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.520 
modifications and optimizing it or maybe
you<00:02:30.239> want<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.510> do<00:02:30.599> something<00:02:30.810> that's<00:02:30.959> specific

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
you want to do something that's specific

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.869 
you want to do something that's specific
to<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.709> iphone<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.190> want<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.400> take<00:02:32.519> advantage

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
to the iphone you want to take advantage

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.460 
to the iphone you want to take advantage
of<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.090> accelerometer<00:02:33.840> or<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.049> multi-touch

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
of the accelerometer or the multi-touch

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.990 
of the accelerometer or the multi-touch
so<00:02:35.310> those<00:02:35.400> are<00:02:35.489> some<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.790> capabilities

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
so those are some of the capabilities

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.390 
so those are some of the capabilities
that<00:02:36.420> we've<00:02:36.660> exposed<00:02:37.080> inside<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.799> these

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
that we've exposed inside of these

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.890 
that we've exposed inside of these
applications<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.299> you<00:02:39.360> can<00:02:39.599> take<00:02:39.750> advantage

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
applications so you can take advantage

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.740 
applications so you can take advantage
of<00:02:40.200> them<00:02:40.319> as<00:02:40.470> well<00:02:40.650> as<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.890> user<00:02:41.580> what's<00:02:42.480> really

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
of them as well as a user what's really

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.789 
of them as well as a user what's really
exciting<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.349> there<00:02:43.560> are<00:02:43.590> over<00:02:43.739> a
