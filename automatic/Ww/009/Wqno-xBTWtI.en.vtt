00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
taller this was almost a deal-breaker

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.400 
taller this was almost a deal-breaker
but<00:01:01.460> then<00:01:01.699> it<00:01:01.820> started<00:01:02.059> wearing<00:01:02.270> in<00:01:02.480> or<00:01:02.989> maybe

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
but then it started wearing in or maybe

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.749 
but then it started wearing in or maybe
I<00:01:03.500> lost<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.920> feeling<00:01:04.039> to<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:04.369> part<00:01:04.580> of<00:01:04.670> my

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
I lost the feeling to that part of my

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.770 
I lost the feeling to that part of my
spine<00:01:05.000> who<00:01:05.479> knows

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.140 

let's<00:01:10.410> get<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.650> why<00:01:10.770> we're<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
let's get to why we're here this is the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.580 
let's get to why we're here this is the
power<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:12.540> volume<00:01:12.720> control<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
power and volume control for the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.740 
power and volume control for the
speakers<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.880> our<00:01:14.970> biggest<00:01:15.180> complaints

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
speakers one of our biggest complaints

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.230 
speakers one of our biggest complaints
is<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> lack<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.200> internal<00:01:16.980> power<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:18.060> wish

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
is the lack of internal power the wish

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.460 
is the lack of internal power the wish
it<00:01:18.390> didn't<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.840> tethered<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.320> whole

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
it didn't have to be tethered the whole

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.290 
it didn't have to be tethered the whole
time<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> power<00:01:20.160> cord<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.000> bet

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
time with a power cord and you can bet

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.840 
time with a power cord and you can bet
it<00:01:21.540> will<00:01:21.660> get<00:01:21.810> run<00:01:22.020> over<00:01:22.050> by<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> wheels<00:01:22.850> the
