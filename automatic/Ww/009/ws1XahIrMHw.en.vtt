00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello, today I wanted to share 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.589
 I think a secret 4 years and already miss 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.360
 my hair make it a little more 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.420
 blonde because i don't like when 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.370
 i have dark hair i used lemon and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.619
 it honestly damaged my hair 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.840
 used very very simply 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.600
 the summer sun and this too of course 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.529
 lost weight on my hair it dries them 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.990
 but 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.789
 and of course I went straight surgeon low 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.279
 wear my loss now I have highlighted 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.869
 hair but I have long been nothing with them 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.880

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.380
 a week ago I decided to come back to this 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.149
 the way i used can 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.430
 be a whole year to cool my hair 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.239
 it was insanely good for mine 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.530
 my hair became smooth 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.180
 Now these little hairs were not 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 just everything was great they were me 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.579
 bright and just shot like i don't know 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.500
 what is most important is that it is not 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.620
 super expensive air conditioners it's not 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.480
 some serum there for 1000 rubles I 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.590
 I do not know this thing that everyone has 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.590
 there is a person 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.299
