00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.140
 hi guys i'm an ex and this one 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.760
 fashion physics item review 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.350
 let's start immediately describe what 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.629
 adds this fashion I want to clarify 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.489
 but that this fashion is very minimal 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.170
 in fact it adds only goes of 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.030
 animations to the objects that we will treat 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.980
 in fact there is something positive 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.900
 in fact the animations will differ 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.640
 always one from the other since they are 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.900
 dynamic but without getting lost in 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.699
 useless chatter we go to see 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.710
 how does this fashion work with 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.449
 previous animations when we were looking 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.250
 to throw an object on the ground 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.409
 this was simply launched 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.449
 following a predetermined trajectory e 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.580
 once on the ground he just turned 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.530
 on its own axis instead now thanks to 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.530
 this mode we will have dynamic animations 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.110
 we can notice this dynamic effect 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.610
 better when we destroy a basket the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.380
 fashion also offers us two more 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.939
 functions they will in fact be i 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.430
 liquid behavior to objects 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.350
 found to make you understand what I am 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.159
 speaking I will throw these one by one 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.159
 objects in the lava 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.329
 how could you see objects like the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.520
 wood wool will burn normally 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.920
 while others like the couple in the diamond 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.149
 they will not burn apart from this lava 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.159
 fashion adds features 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.899
 also to water and if they will float 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.500
 lighter objects such as 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.500
 Wood 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.560
 making the most ones deposit on the bottom 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.560
 I am just an example of such heavy things 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.790
 iron blocks and stone 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.590
 I want to clarify however that the objects 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.420
 which exceed this effect have been 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.910
 decided by the creator of fashion and therefore 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.560
 may not reflect reality ho 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.540
 personally wanted to start with one 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.220
 fashion so short just to see that 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.840
 what could come out of it if there is 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.760
 liked let me know with a like 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.470
 subscribing to the channel by doing so many 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.990
 many many many many comments a 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.190
 this video and I can't do that 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.870
 else if not leave you to this 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.860
 beautiful landscape and invite you to 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.860
 follow the next episode
