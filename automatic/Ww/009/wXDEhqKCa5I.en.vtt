00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.009
 today we are going to talk about the diet without salt 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.260
 the slogan less salt more health the 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.970
 perception and learning of salty 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.340
 is being formed over time in 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.020
 function of eating habits and 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.660
 concentration of salt in the 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.550
 foods that we consume in a way that 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.529
 the taste receptors are going 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.570
 habitating variable salt levels 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.699
 in each individual and that depending on 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.320
 the changes of these habits these 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.869
 flavor thresholds can go 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.550
 modifying probably we are not 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.920
 really aware of the salt that with 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.870
 we take in meals but the agency 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.090
 Spanish food safety and 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.699
 nutrition refers that we ingest a 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.010
 average of 10 grams of salt a day when 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.679
 the recommended is a maximum of 5 grams 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.170
 that's why he has launched the plan 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.380
 take care more than we do 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.710
 echo and we recommend its follow-up 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.570
 but why do we need to salt the salt 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.310
 Sodium chloride is composed 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.280
 approximately 40 percent of 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.320
 sodium and 60 percent chlorine salt 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.320
 is the largest source of sodium in 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.210
 our diet more than 90% but there is another 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.250
 small part of sodium that is ingested 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.080
 also through meals and it 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.870
 adds to the food in the processes of 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.150
 manufacturing are the additives 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.150
 flavors are enhancers of the 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.400
 flavor and preservatives salt is 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.200
 indispensable for life but our 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.840
 body only needs small amounts 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.760
 of salt so that it works and take it in 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.009
 large amounts can be disastrous 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.500
 for health needs 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.080
 physiological salt daily vary 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.880
 according to age , sex, weight, state 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.790
 physiological the level of physical activity 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.650
 the state of health salt is necessary 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.840
 so that our body is 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.240
 properly hydrated participate in 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.470
 multitude of cellular exchanges and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.330
 contributes to the balance of 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.160
 composition of blood 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.640
 of our whole body does not need 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.490
 consume high amounts of salt but 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.320
 because 5 grams the world organization 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.440
 of health and other institutions 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.360
 health after carrying out studies 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.670
 that demonstrate the relationship between 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.110
 sodium needs salt consumption 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.480
 in excess and diseases 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.060
 cardiovascular tests recommended for 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.190
 population in general with a healthy life and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.440
 without prolonged efforts the consumption 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.510
 average of 5 grams of salt per day what 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.390
 equals a spoonful of full salt 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.390
 size of coffee or 2 grams of salt 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.260
 daily and should be guaranteed to be 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.420
 nothing came out 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.299
 what are the risks of consumption of 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.430
 excess of salt consumption one of the 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.500
 most known consequences of excess 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.599
 of salt consumption is to favor the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.239
 development of hypertension in people 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.909
 predisposed or prevent an adequate 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.060
 control of it the excess consumption 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.860
 of salt also favors or precipitates 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.989
 development of other diseases that 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.970
 course with fluid retention as the 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.579
 cardiac experience insufficiency 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.680
 hepatic and kidney diseases the 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.720
 water retention that involves the abuse of 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.629
 salt produces weight gain 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.519
 and forces the heart to the liver and 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.400
 kidneys to work over their 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.739
 capabilities to eliminate conditions 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.810
 normal all the excess salt that 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.760
 we eat and that the organism does not need 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.859
 for its functions it is eliminated in the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.409
 urine and also carries the greatest 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.810
 elimination of calcium which favors 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.940
 in the formation of calcium stones 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.760
 in predisposed people 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.680
 in addition this greater elimination of calcium 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.540
 in urine can contribute to 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.610
 decrease the calcium in the bones and by 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.940
 both osteoporosis 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.320
 how can we reduce salt intake 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.990
 you should control your salt intake 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.060
 since childhood, the taste for 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.550
 salt is acquired from very small and is 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.740
 possible to educate him in such a way that if 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.990
 since childhood we favor the consumption 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.180
 of less salty foods the stage 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.940
 adult food choices will be made 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.160
 with less salt once used to a 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.709
 amount of salt determined is not easy 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.740
 adapt to eat with less salt for it 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.180
 the reduction must be progressive 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.220
 starting by reducing the food that 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.880
 with certainty we know that they contain a lot 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.580
 salt the snacks the canned snacks 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.170
 precooked and progressively 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.690
 you have to add less salt to the food 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.750
 it's a progressive adaptation for 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.030
 our different taste receptors 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.730
 health institutions worldwide 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.070
 European and national aware of the high 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.440
 salt content in the diet recommend 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.630
 the next salt salt intake by 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.230
 ages 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.910
 less than 5 grams a day for adults 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.330
 less than 3 grams a day in children 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.190
 under 7 years and 4 grams a day in 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.070
 children between 7 and 10 years old 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.440
 this at home to get what 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.570
 we have to do then we have to take with 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.640
 more often fresh foods like 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.210
 fruits and vegetables and avoid food 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.850
 pre-cooked and packaged do not add salt 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.120
 in the cooked unless the 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.400
 finished dish replace the salt by 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.610
 other species that flavor garlic 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.400
 oregano pepper the basil and avoid 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.070
 the potassium salts must be washed before 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.560
 of using canned vegetables and 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.320
 legumes and not add more salt to 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.020
 baby foods already prepared in 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.400
 the restaurants how can you get 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.190
 asking us to prepare the dish with 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.200
 less salt if we choose dishes with sauces 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.660
 we must ask that they take us part 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.550
 and just give us what we want from 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.320
 any way to eat with less salt 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.270
 they do not have to imply that the 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.880
 foods lose their appeal and leave 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.860
 to be tasty what types of salt can we 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.900
 say that there are there are fundamentally two 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.600
 types of salt the invisible salt that is 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.270
 the one they carry 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.910
 and the food products themselves is 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.550
 the natural salt and the visible salt that is 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.970
 the one that is added in its preparation and 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.860
 in its cooking the important thing is to know 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.230
 what are the healthiest foods 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.990
 and be aware that that salt 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.850
 invisible 'also exists in the case of 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.410
 bread for example the manufacturers with the 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.710
 have been decreasing the amount of 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.560
 come out and we have not noticed that 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.140
 it's because we can go accommodating the 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.870
 intake of salt and taste although the 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.460
 food is not necessary to stop eating 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.010
 foods with a high salt content 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.950
 only the important thing is to decrease your 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.650
 frequency 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.300
 the nutritional labeling that they have 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.900
 all the food when we 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.210
 we are going to buy in the supermarket 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.620
 provides the consumer with information 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.900
 important about the content of the 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.050
 energy the nutrient content that 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.580
 contains that food packed in the 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.160
 labeling and presentation of 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.440
 Food products may appear 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.820
 messages or graphic representations that 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.969
 indicate that a food has 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:51.669
 beneficial nutritional properties 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:53.849
 of these are known as being sedeco not 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:56.229
 they know as nutritional statements 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:58.389
 regarding the content of salt in the 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:07:01.209
 products we can find four types 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:03.999
 of nutritional claims content 

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:06.969
 reduced salt when its content is 

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:09.879
 below 25% relative to another 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:13.360
 product content with low content of 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:16.329
 sodium with very low sodium content or 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.939
 without sodium or without salt most of the 

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:20.369
 fresh foods do not contain salt this 

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:22.959
 is the case of fruits and vegetables 

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:25.149
 although some have sodium form 

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:27.669
 natural as shellfish and certain 

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:29.889
 viscera like the liver and kidneys the 

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:31.569
 most of the sodium we ingest is 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:34.479
 find precooked foods 

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:37.089
 for the specific edition of salt by the 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:39.999
 of additives that contain a lot of sodium is 

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:42.669
 important to read labels and be able to 

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:44.139
 know how much salt the 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:46.180
 Foods that we buy 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:49.479
 we can say that a food carries 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:52.150
 much salt if it carries more than 125 grams per 

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:54.699
 Each 100 grams of product and little salt 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:57.300
 if it leads to 0 25 grams per 100 

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:57.300
 grams of product
