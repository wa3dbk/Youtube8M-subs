pulling<00:00:11.759> these<00:00:12.000> out<00:00:12.440> these<00:00:13.440> are<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.830> original

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
pulling these out these are the original

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.010 
pulling these out these are the original
contractor<00:00:15.240> grade<00:00:15.360> ones<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.929> were

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
contractor grade ones that were

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.410 
contractor grade ones that were
installed<00:00:16.440> when<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.820> built<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:17.970> house<00:00:18.180> about

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
installed when we built this house about

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.260 
installed when we built this house about
10<00:00:18.690> years<00:00:18.900> ago<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.410> oh<00:00:19.820> they're<00:00:20.820> starting<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
10 years ago and oh they're starting to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.970 
10 years ago and oh they're starting to
rot<00:00:22.199> at<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> bottom<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.250> our<00:00:24.619> back<00:00:25.619> wall<00:00:25.949> here

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
rot at the bottom and our back wall here

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.240 
rot at the bottom and our back wall here
faces<00:00:26.760> north<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.779> whenever<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.230> get<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> that

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
faces north so whenever we get a that

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.160 
faces north so whenever we get a that
North<00:00:29.519> storm<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.240> comes<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:31.019> water

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
North storm that comes in we get water

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.530 
North storm that comes in we get water
that<00:00:31.590> gets<00:00:32.430> pushed<00:00:32.700> down<00:00:32.820> around<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> bottom

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
that gets pushed down around the bottom

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.080 
that gets pushed down around the bottom
of<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> door<00:00:33.840> out<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.440> floor<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.850> even

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
of the door out of the floor and it even

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.340 
of the door out of the floor and it even
leaks<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.420> little<00:00:36.510> bit<00:00:36.719> around<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> top<00:00:37.170> I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
leaks a little bit around the top I

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.810 
leaks a little bit around the top I
don't<00:00:37.410> think<00:00:37.710> he<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:37.950> cocked<00:00:38.309> around<00:00:38.610> very

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
don't think he got cocked around very

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.630 
don't think he got cocked around very
good<00:00:39.030> when<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:39.239> put<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:40.860> that's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
good when they put it in so that's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.479 
good when they put it in so that's

oh<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.520> got<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> door<00:01:23.880> done<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.770> look<00:01:25.770> I

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
oh so we got the door done and look I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.350 
oh so we got the door done and look I
think<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.540> figured<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.110> they<00:01:28.229> did<00:01:28.409> too

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
think I figured out what they did too

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.880 
think I figured out what they did too
and<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.450> didn't<00:01:30.720> dawn<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.869> me<00:01:31.049> until<00:01:31.229> after<00:01:31.829> we

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
and it didn't dawn on me until after we

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.890 
and it didn't dawn on me until after we
got<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:33.329> only<00:01:33.450> reason<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.869> put

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
got of that and the only reason I put

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.960 
got of that and the only reason I put
this<00:01:34.259> door<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.710> was<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.400> was<00:01:35.520> special

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
this door in was because it was special

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.630 
this door in was because it was special
order<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:37.259> needed<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.460> door

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
order and I needed to get this door

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.010 
order and I needed to get this door
replaced<00:01:38.970> otherwise<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.600> would<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.750> bitched

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
replaced otherwise I would have bitched

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.990 
replaced otherwise I would have bitched
about<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.770> went<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.549> got<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.790> right

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
about it and went and I got the right

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.030 
about it and went and I got the right
one<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.630> what<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:42.899> did<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.350> when

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
one but I think what they did is when

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.819 
one but I think what they did is when
they<00:01:44.189> ordered<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.350> think<00:01:46.350> they<00:01:46.470> took<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
they ordered it I think they took the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.289 
they ordered it I think they took the
dimensions<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.490> gave<00:01:47.700> them<00:01:47.909> thinking

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
dimensions that I gave them thinking

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.270 
dimensions that I gave them thinking
that<00:01:48.360> was<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.020> dimensions<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.649> my<00:01:49.799> opening

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that was the dimensions for my opening

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.719 
that was the dimensions for my opening
and<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:51.869> shrunk<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.259> down

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
and then so then they shrunk it down

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.050 
and then so then they shrunk it down
sliced<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.970> door<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.750> opening

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
sliced the door it's that opening

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.740 
sliced the door it's that opening
banking<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.210> gave<00:01:57.479> them<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.840> size<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
banking that I gave them the size of the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.139 
banking that I gave them the size of the
I<00:02:00.799> gave<00:02:01.799> him<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> size<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.369> door<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.969> they

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
I gave him the size of the door and they

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.639 
I gave him the size of the door and they
were<00:02:03.210> probably<00:02:03.420> thinking<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:04.079> gave<00:02:04.500> him<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
were probably thinking I gave him the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.249 
were probably thinking I gave him the
size<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.130> opening<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.899> that's

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
size of the opening so I think that's

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.469 
size of the opening so I think that's
where<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> confusion<00:02:07.829> was<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.330> got

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
where the confusion was but so I got

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.820 
where the confusion was but so I got
some<00:02:09.629> trim<00:02:09.869> work<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.289> I'm<00:02:10.470> going<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> just

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
some trim work to do I'm going to just

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.040 
some trim work to do I'm going to just
caulk<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.400> crap<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
caulk the crap out of it and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.840 
caulk the crap out of it and
get<00:02:13.710> it<00:02:13.800> all<00:02:13.890> trimmed<00:02:14.220> out<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.610> I'll<00:02:14.670> probably

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
get it all trimmed out and I'll probably

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.820 
get it all trimmed out and I'll probably
put<00:02:15.570> some<00:02:15.750> type<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.930> drip<00:02:16.230> edge<00:02:16.410> up<00:02:16.650> there

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
put some type of drip edge up there

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.910 
put some type of drip edge up there
something<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.990> other<00:02:18.990> than<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.470> I'm<00:02:19.620> happy

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
something so other than that I'm happy

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.220 
something so other than that I'm happy
with<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.280> door<00:02:20.520> oh<00:02:20.730> they<00:02:21.450> shorted<00:02:21.900> me<00:02:22.020> these

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
with the door oh they shorted me these

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.070 
with the door oh they shorted me these
things<00:02:22.410> too<00:02:23.300> there's<00:02:24.300> some<00:02:24.540> screws<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.020> go

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
things too there's some screws that go

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.630 
things too there's some screws that go
in<00:02:25.290> here<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:25.980> some<00:02:26.160> caps<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.580> are

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
in here and then some caps that are

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.300 
in here and then some caps that are
supposed<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:26.970> go<00:02:27.120> over<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:28.920> don't<00:02:29.070> have

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
supposed to go over it and I don't have

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.190 
supposed to go over it and I don't have
those<00:02:29.460> so<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.240> got<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.570> figure<00:02:30.780> out<00:02:30.810> where<00:02:31.050> those

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
those so I got to figure out where those

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.370 
those so I got to figure out where those
are<00:02:31.410> at<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:31.800> we<00:02:32.400> got<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.610> doors<00:02:32.820> with<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
are at but we got the doors with the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.530 
are at but we got the doors with the
it's<00:02:34.380> all<00:02:34.530> vinyl<00:02:34.770> clad<00:02:35.190> trim<00:02:36.180> work<00:02:36.360> and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
it's all vinyl clad trim work and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.300 
it's all vinyl clad trim work and
everything<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.710> there's<00:02:37.920> another<00:02:38.100> reason

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
everything so there's another reason

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.920 
everything so there's another reason
that<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.940> kind<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.210> not<00:02:39.360> happy<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.690> it

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
that it kind of not happy that it

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.240 
that it kind of not happy that it
doesn't<00:02:40.200> come<00:02:40.350> out<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.530> it's<00:02:40.890> supposed<00:02:41.160> to

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
doesn't come out like it's supposed to

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.040 
doesn't come out like it's supposed to
because<00:02:41.580> now<00:02:41.760> I'm<00:02:41.850> going<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.060> have<00:02:42.180> some<00:02:42.750> ugly

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
because now I'm going to have some ugly

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.980 
because now I'm going to have some ugly
trim<00:02:43.290> out<00:02:43.440> here<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:43.800> we<00:02:44.730> did<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.690> blinds

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
trim out here but we did the the blinds

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.990 
trim out here but we did the the blinds
inside<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.770> windows<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.370> stuff<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:47.850> that's

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
inside the windows and stuff so that's

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.560 
inside the windows and stuff so that's
nice<00:02:48.300> but<00:02:49.190> other<00:02:50.190> than<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.390> went

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
nice but other than that and went

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.630 
nice but other than that and went
together<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:53.960> don't<00:02:54.960> know<00:02:55.280> kind<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.370> a

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
together and I don't know kind of a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.970 
together and I don't know kind of a
little<00:02:57.480> perturbed<00:02:57.960> about<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.590> fact<00:02:58.830> that

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
little perturbed about the fact that

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.430 
little perturbed about the fact that
they<00:02:59.460> didn't<00:02:59.730> give<00:02:59.850> me<00:02:59.880> exactly<00:03:00.510> what<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.750> was

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
they didn't give me exactly what I was

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.160 
they didn't give me exactly what I was
expecting<00:03:01.650> when<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.220> ordered<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.670> but<00:03:02.930> on<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
expecting when I ordered it but on the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.840 
expecting when I ordered it but on the
size<00:03:04.380> but<00:03:04.770> there<00:03:05.310> we<00:03:05.460> go

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
size but there we go

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.420 
size but there we go
so<00:03:06.440> anyway<00:03:07.610> another<00:03:08.610> project<00:03:08.880> done<00:03:10.310> time<00:03:11.310> to

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
so anyway another project done time to

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.230 
so anyway another project done time to
move<00:03:11.580> on<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.760> another<00:03:11.850> one

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
move on to another one

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.320 
move on to another one
