00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello friends, this is Jorge de Ferrari 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.460
 I'm going to show this salt plate 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.190
 rose of the himalayas 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.380
 It is composed of sodium chloride and 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.809
 minerals has a measure of 32 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.900
 centimeters by 21 and a thickness of 3 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.029
 centimeters and a half has a weight 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.240
 approximate of almost 6 kilos what is the 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.960
 griddle 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.010
 we can use this salt iron 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.680
 directly in our kitchens 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.820
 portable gas cookers here I have 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.980
 present the kitchen bs 110 we can 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.960
 use it directly in the middle of the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.340
 table so that we go preparing in 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.460
 our dishes with people with 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.080
 our forceps or the forks as we 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.270
 we are preparing them directly in 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.240
 our food 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.610
 this plate of sant we can also 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.100
 use in the oven and also support 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.410
 freezing because if we want 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.790
 prepare cold products also what 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.280
 we can make 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.140
 in hot I recommend that the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.699
 temperature is always progressive 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.000
 less and more and we will use it in a 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.950
 portable kitchen or gas stove when 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.620
 let's have for example approximately 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.770
 about 10 or 15 minutes over low heat 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.820
 we can go another 20 or 25 minutes 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.010
 approximately having the 40 minutes 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.440
 we can have it off the kitchen 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.600
 20 or 25 minutes what is the iron 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.110
 salt since to be totally he says 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.150
 quite thick keeps the heat and we 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.620
 perfectly distributes the heat in 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.850
 all the iron to prepare our 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.380
 foods 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.330
 we can also put it in the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 freezer to prepare for example the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.390
 cold dishes that we can prepare from 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.390
 hot meat we can prepare 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.490
 meats fish vegetables skewers in 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.729
 cold we can prepare sushi inclusive 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.450
 desserts that they need in some kind of 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.140
 salt cleaning cleaning once 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.330
 cold are recommended with water water in a 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.549
 brush and we'll see that over time 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.830
 we are removing that film and we 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.830
 We are wearing the stone as you can 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.860
 see the stone cut into large 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.930
 blocks has a pink color pulling to 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.850
 white there are no two equal since these 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.530
 They are big plates and it's not all the same 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.750
 a color comes presenting from this 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.459
 Expertise a little if rough on the sides 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.590
 and to whom the finished songs do not come 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.299
 you have to be a little careful as not 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.880
 because all the songs with time 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.500
 is wearing the peaks is normal in the 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.230
 plant inclusive when I have preparing 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.810
 the food is moving crunches 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.150
 and it's fine has a life with time 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.549
 to prepare food 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.110
 who has what transmits the food 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.020
 then Carlos is wearing out of the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.900
 cleaning 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.610
 and has a progressive wear I hope 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.170
 that the information has served us 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.170
 help a greeting
