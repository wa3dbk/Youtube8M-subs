00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
here we are and I recommend about thirty

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.389 
here we are and I recommend about thirty
of<00:00:31.980> any<00:00:32.219> kind<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.880> wood<00:00:33.570> block<00:00:34.100> some<00:00:35.100> dirt

of any kind of wood block some dirt

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.910 
of any kind of wood block some dirt
about<00:00:35.760> twenty<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.360> those<00:00:36.480> could<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.230> grass<00:00:37.559> or

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
about twenty of those could be grass or

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.860 
about twenty of those could be grass or
dirt<00:00:37.980> doesn't<00:00:38.489> matter<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.210> you're

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
dirt doesn't matter and then you're

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.170 
dirt doesn't matter and then you're
gonna<00:00:39.960> need<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.260> few<00:00:40.410> water<00:00:40.649> buckets<00:00:41.160> any<00:00:41.879> type

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180

of<00:00:42.210> hoe<00:00:42.570> some<00:00:43.350> bone<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.950> bone<00:00:44.129> meal<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
of hoe some bone for bone meal and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.569 
of hoe some bone for bone meal and
you're<00:00:45.120> gonna<00:00:45.570> need<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:46.620> least<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
you're gonna need at least one of the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.900 
you're gonna need at least one of the
three<00:00:47.789> seeds<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.710> recommend<00:00:50.460> using<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
three seeds so I recommend using the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.029 
three seeds so I recommend using the
Oakwood<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.050> looks<00:00:52.079> nicer<00:00:52.770> than

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
Oakwood just because it looks nicer than

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.610 
Oakwood just because it looks nicer than
any<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> other<00:00:53.699> ones<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:55.170> also<00:00:55.289> use

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
any of the other ones you can also use

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.020 
any of the other ones you can also use
spruce<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> wouldn't<00:00:56.489> recommend<00:00:56.730> using

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
spruce but I wouldn't recommend using

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.549 
spruce but I wouldn't recommend using
birch<00:00:57.390> because<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.780> doesn't<00:00:58.050> look<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.199> nice

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
birch because it doesn't look that nice

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.700 
birch because it doesn't look that nice
so<00:00:59.430> we're<00:00:59.520> gonna<00:00:59.640> place<00:01:00.350> 7x9

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
so we're gonna place 7x9

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.460 
so we're gonna place 7x9
and<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.670> recommended<00:01:03.329> when<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> say<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
and that's the recommended when I say a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.880 
and that's the recommended when I say a
seven<00:01:05.070> by<00:01:05.189> 9<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> let<00:01:06.869> me<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.140> make<00:01:07.320> sure<00:01:07.350> have
