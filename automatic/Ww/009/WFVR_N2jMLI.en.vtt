00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.480
 good and welcome to the channel before 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.039
 every I think here we are a new 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.630
 news video in which we are going to 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.430
 talk about three important issues like 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.619
 for example the new ex squares of evil 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.300
 fai mechanical theaters we also solve 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.310
 the doubts of the invoker icons that 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.079
 We saw a few days ago on the channel and 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.939
 last in the last news we will see the 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.980
 visual effects of the fire layer 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.169
 solar that have been modified so 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.790
 without more begin by moving the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.530
 first splash that we are going to review is 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.120
 try atrox mechanics as we can see 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.410
 it's pretty cramped yes that's true 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.910
 that I'm not convinced about the subject of 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.710
 that is giant compared to the is 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.420
 which game intent we are also going to 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.829
 review different spoiler together with the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.750
 bad fight skin but good for now 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.370
 in general lines the move me 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.989
 like but it does not catch my attention 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.100
 the subject of it being giant yes that is 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.500
 true that I think they can give you a 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.630
 little resemblance to style movies 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.950
 like pacific rim etcetera etcetera and if 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.899
 we go to the next image we can 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.310
 observe different spoilers or details 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.989
 found in the square is also 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.850
 we'll go over the Malpais for example 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.890
 the first is that 5 that is surrounded by 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.570
 a little red circle as you can see and 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.070
 in which it seems to indicate the number of 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.290
 the bay or hangar in which it has 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.659
 created the champion of the corner in this 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.700
 yes, it is true that I think that 5 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.870
 would be the last champion created for this 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.430
 series of skins 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.380
 there are still two remaining taking 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.180
 mind that we also have amalfi picks 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.800
 so over time I think 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.690
 that they are taking out other two skins for 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.460
 other different champions so why 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.870
 the moment this is what we have 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.040
 I think that is going to mean that of all 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.660
 ways if you have any theory 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.250
 some information tell me and 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.290
 I can surely include it in the series 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.450
 of rumors and theories in the next 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.400
 annotation we can observe how in the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.990
 assembly of others we see a number 13 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.730
 I think they have nothing to do though 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.440
 will have to dig a lot and I think that 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.210
 Yes, soon we will have a 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.070
 chapter and investigating about the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.390
 mechanical skins and those of battle cash 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.980
 especially because I think they can have 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.930
 some relationship that other how can we 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.430
 see below we also have a rumble is 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.840
 Of course it is the same as it has the same 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.460
 pose that the last skin they took 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.840
 super galaxy or rumble and yes that 's true 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.550
 how good the ears and all the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.740
 appearance is similar or identical to that of 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.630
 rumble we also see the number 2 in the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.640
 tier in which the champion is up 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.230
 I do not know what this means but I think 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.910
 that the jordi has a lot to do 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.590
 with the creation of these corners more 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.390
 we will talk about them later and that a 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.820
 once said that let's see the splash 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.680
 mechanical balfate garden here we have a 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.450
 mechanical malpais the displace I like 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.430
 very much yes it is true that what happens 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.870
 same as with others too big in 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.500
 comparison with the champion within 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.970
 game 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.040
 too much quality from my point of 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.510
 view compared to the skin too 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.860
 within the game leaves quite a bit 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.630
 wish you have to be sincere you can 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.490
 like more or less but within the game 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.470
 it does not look anything compared to 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.690
 moving so good let's move on 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.220
 directly to see the spoilers in this 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.750
 we simply have two although we have 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.610
 another hidden in the background that can be seen 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.840
 we just see atrox and the only thing 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.370
 you can talk about this is that between 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.900
 others and bad faith there is a distance 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.090
 quite long in which there may be 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.770
 different gaits with other champions 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.150
 but well, I just think they are 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.530
 unimportant details but good 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.360
 you never know, let's start with the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.070
 spoilers we can see two champions in the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.959
 bottom part surrounded by a circle 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.180
 as always in which it appears 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.739
 heimerdinger and ticks a lot of people had 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.180
 doubts and he told me who was the one of the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.980
 left but well it's clear that 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.750
 Steel expands is a little bit and you have 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.890
 the image available if you can not enter 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.600
 on my twitter at kata that 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.220
 I wanted and you will have it, you can see that 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.020
 it's about saying without any kind of 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.290
 problem also the other spoiler is the 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.209
 number 6 in the assembly part of 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.459
 Malpais that will mean has relation 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.080
 with the 13 I do not know will try to investigate 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.880
 this number relationship also because 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.200
 the edges are creating these champions 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.090
 and maybe you have a pretty video 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.810
 interesting soon I said I'm 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.730
 reviewed the displacements 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.220
 the next good news for 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.230
 disappointment of many unfortunately the 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.390
 new icon is not about any new 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.280
 skin of no new re - election champion 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.739
 mechanic none of that is simply 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.270
 only what we can get for 250 rp 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.860
 it's inside the pp server and in the 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.630
 main server is maybe it will be 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.610
 available through the purchase of 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.230
 some mechanical skiing or some pack 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.760
 let it out river at the moment you know 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.530
 something I will tell you what is clear 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.880
 is that it will not be reelected a 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.769
 mechanical so they were the following 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.330
 icons we already saw in the previous video 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.250
 news and they are simply about a 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.140
 event called kan says is the when 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.970
 I have no information about it and 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.709
 in these icons good cake appears 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.410
 or magdalena de lulÃº and in the last one we see 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.610
 a bomb shaped like candy you say the 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.440
 truth is that many thought they were 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.910
 icons about a new champion a new 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.860
 skin and it seems that it is simply going 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.930
 to be in an event with icons and little 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.160
 more unfortunately at the time you know 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.049
 how can you get these three 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.120
 I will inform you as I have always 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.680
 that said let's move on to the latest news and 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.150
 in this latest news we are going to see the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.380
 visual effects of the fire layer 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.030
 solar as you can see have been 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.860
 modified I like it a lot more than the 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.930
 previous and through patches and patches 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.729
 have been changing the textures and 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.229
 visual effects of this layer of fire 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.770
 solar that seems to be not just 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.419
 to convince 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.310
 -Community I at least is 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.810
 listening and is modifying so no 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.550
 it's not bad that they are doing these 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.020
 changes as for example the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.120
 invoker spells that also go 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.830
 modifying little by little and saying this 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.180
 so far the news video I hope 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.620
 that you liked already you know you can
