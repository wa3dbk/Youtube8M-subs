hi<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.680> Leon<00:00:02.070> from<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.340> computer<00:00:02.909> room

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hi this is Leon from the computer room

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.480 
hi this is Leon from the computer room
now<00:00:03.780> I'm<00:00:04.140> gonna<00:00:04.319> shooting<00:00:05.220> this<00:00:05.310> movie

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
now I'm gonna shooting this movie

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.299 
now I'm gonna shooting this movie
obviously<00:00:06.170> I'm<00:00:07.170> just<00:00:07.230> looking<00:00:07.620> at<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.890> black

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
obviously I'm just looking at a black

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.209 
obviously I'm just looking at a black
mat<00:00:08.849> not<00:00:09.300> very<00:00:09.510> interesting<00:00:10.139> couple<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.920> marks

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
mat not very interesting couple of marks

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.700 
mat not very interesting couple of marks
on<00:00:11.340> there<00:00:11.719> the<00:00:12.719> interesting<00:00:13.500> thing<00:00:13.650> about

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
on there the interesting thing about

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.970 
on there the interesting thing about
this<00:00:13.980> map<00:00:14.160> though<00:00:15.440> making<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.590> movie<00:00:16.890> about

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
this map though making this movie about

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.790 
this map though making this movie about
something<00:00:17.430> called<00:00:17.580> ESD<00:00:18.539> which<00:00:19.380> stands<00:00:19.710> for

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
something called ESD which stands for

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.820 
something called ESD which stands for
electrostatic<00:00:20.539> discharge<00:00:21.539> I'll<00:00:22.350> move<00:00:22.590> back<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
electrostatic discharge I'll move back a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.269 
electrostatic discharge I'll move back a
bit

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
bit

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.960 
bit
that's<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> whole<00:00:24.210> mat<00:00:24.570> there<00:00:25.789> if<00:00:26.789> you've

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
that's the whole mat there if you've

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.300 
that's the whole mat there if you've
seen<00:00:27.689> up<00:00:27.900> some<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.199> my<00:00:28.230> movies<00:00:28.710> before<00:00:28.859> you'll

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
seen up some of my movies before you'll

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.319 
seen up some of my movies before you'll
have<00:00:29.609> seen<00:00:29.910> things<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.869> black<00:00:31.679> background

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
have seen things on the black background

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.840 
have seen things on the black background
let's<00:00:33.329> see<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.809> mat<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.610> some<00:00:35.610> other

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
let's see that this mat on some other

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.660 
let's see that this mat on some other
master<00:00:36.270> huh<00:00:36.590> but<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.680> anyway<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.190> main

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
master huh but so anyway the main

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.450 
master huh but so anyway the main
subjects<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> say<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.290> got<00:00:40.440> ESD<00:00:41.250> now

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
subjects and like I say it's got ESD now

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.549 
subjects and like I say it's got ESD now
that<00:00:41.640> stands<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.320> electrostatic<00:00:43.760> discharge

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
that stands for electrostatic discharge

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.459 
that stands for electrostatic discharge
one<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.680> these<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.539> when<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:48.870> moving

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
one of these is when you are moving

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.799 
one of these is when you are moving
around<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.100> moving<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.550> hand<00:00:50.820> now<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
around so I'm moving my hand now the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
around so I'm moving my hand now the
joints<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.289> my<00:00:52.320> hands<00:00:52.649> my<00:00:52.949> knuckles<00:00:53.460> they

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
joints in my hands my knuckles they

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.970 
joints in my hands my knuckles they
pretty<00:00:54.629> much<00:00:54.780> rubbing<00:00:55.140> together<00:00:55.320> between

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
pretty much rubbing together between

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.740 
pretty much rubbing together between
themselves<00:00:56.300> causing<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.629> friction<00:00:58.760> now<00:00:59.760> when

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
themselves causing the friction now when

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.980 
themselves causing the friction now when
it<00:01:00.870> comes<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.710> devices<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.300> repair

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.649 

such<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.020> main<00:01:07.290> bars<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.630> they<00:01:09.630> are

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
such as main bars like this they are

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.820 
such as main bars like this they are
very<00:01:10.080> very<00:01:10.740> delicate<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:13.140> reason<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.680> it

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
very very delicate and the reason for it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.880 
very very delicate and the reason for it
is<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.520> electrostatic<00:01:14.970> discharge

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
is because of electrostatic discharge

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.929 
is because of electrostatic discharge
they<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:17.040> very<00:01:17.280> susceptible<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.049> conduct<00:01:19.049> in

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
they are very susceptible to conduct in

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.450 
they are very susceptible to conduct in
electrostatic<00:01:20.939> discharge<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.830> causing

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
electrostatic discharge and causing

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.539 
electrostatic discharge and causing
damage<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.240> them<00:01:24.720> maybe<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.560> damage<00:01:26.430> that's

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
damage to them maybe not damage that's

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.310 
damage to them maybe not damage that's
going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.970> appear<00:01:27.240> right<00:01:27.659> now<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
going to appear right now but in the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.130 
going to appear right now but in the
future<00:01:28.490> could<00:01:29.490> cause<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.909> latent<00:01:30.450> damage<00:01:30.900> which

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
future could cause a latent damage which

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.609 
future could cause a latent damage which
can<00:01:31.710> cause<00:01:31.920> failure<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:33.090> any<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.259> these

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
can cause failure of any of these

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.090 
can cause failure of any of these
compounds<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.640> whole<00:01:35.820> thing<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.979> cost<00:01:37.979> a

now<00:01:49.229> another<00:01:49.530> sort<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:49.979> Aksum<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:51.710> just

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
now another sort of Aksum that is just

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.320 
now another sort of Aksum that is just
after<00:01:52.829> Balter<00:01:53.250> damage

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
after Balter damage

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.120 
after Balter damage
it's<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.390> processor<00:01:56.840> from<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.290> computer<00:01:57.620> that

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
it's a processor from a computer that

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.070 
it's a processor from a computer that
one<00:01:58.340> has<00:01:58.670> failed<00:01:59.270> so<00:01:59.570> that's<00:01:59.720> not<00:01:59.870> going<00:01:59.990> to

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
one has failed so that's not going to

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.290 
one has failed so that's not going to
work<00:02:00.200> anymore

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
work anymore

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.960 
work anymore
now<00:02:02.300> also<00:02:03.110> these<00:02:04.060> susceptible<00:02:05.060> like<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:05.360> say

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
now also these susceptible like I say

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.130 
now also these susceptible like I say
another<00:02:07.970> way<00:02:08.090> we<00:02:08.210> tackle<00:02:08.630> this<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.990> keep

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
another way we tackle this to keep

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.950 
another way we tackle this to keep
things<00:02:09.650> safe<00:02:12.310> what<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.460> show<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.390> an

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
things safe what the show this is an

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.190 
things safe what the show this is an
