00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello everyone , we have a new one 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.580
 girl bark and my name is we bought for 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.580
 afterwards to create a couple and 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.710
 feels good horse passes 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.769
 warranty period now she lives bye 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.789
 separately she had no shock 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:32.730
 very so active interesting girl 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.750
 economic such here that concerns 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.510
 of news 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.350
 our who are interested and we have a theme 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.809
 today will be about that well, just often 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.149
 very much asked question comes across think and 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.350
 probably he deserves a separate topic 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:54.510
 it's about the fact that if the female laid an egg without 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.660
 male or period when not planned 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.559
 no laying was planned more convenient 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.250
 it was convenient for me to stand this way 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.830
 if the female laid an egg then when 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.070
 does not lose because she is without a male 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.799
 Generally stanislav or there is a male but 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.740
 planned laying she did that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.030
 do well of course this topic is concerned in 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.360
 Mostly newbies and here's about heras like 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.450
 can you tell more about it 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 experienced breeders please do not be mad 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:35.250
 which is very long and very rational and therefore 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:39.750
 that newcomers need it and that means the situation 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.399
 Of course everyone is different but we have the same 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.579
 It turns out that Karela turns on 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.799
 irritation 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.520
 then the desire to breed and then there is 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.640
 volume when the appropriate power but 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.780
 because we have when a girl lives without a male 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.820
 the male is by the way not the main reason 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.180
 birth date for samp 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.080
 it is the presence of a house and food but 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.490
 when she lives in a cage and let's say 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.440
 cover the cage so cozy 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:19.130
 nice corner and ours some 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.110
 can take a trip or there when taking over 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.730
 house some special cozy corner in 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:31.110
 cell and here is not allowed many proteins in 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.530
 nutrition in food then even this 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.560
 process plus and when increased for 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.400
 light day well even if you then 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.790
 for example turning off the light by selling 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.410
 lives with tenants along with people 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.420
 in the client and people turn off the lights late 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.030
 so parrot guard and there 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.220
 light day increases and here on 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.760
 things and all that increase light 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.310
 day or increase ability 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.790
 protein foods can be their little 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.540
 more or here's some different 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.970
 food and whether she take over the house 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:17.100
 some kind of cozy little corner 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.100
 or even if you pat often now 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.530
 the back of the girl at the roots, too, it can 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.640
 be like one extra such 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.680
 factor plus let's say fat is often bathed 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.940
 this is all it can provoke on 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:37.829
 then to take down all carry and tea and if 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:40.590
 have been born a girl parrot laid an egg 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.190
 it means nothing it can 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.590
 throw out 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.940
 she's not fertilized but she needs 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.030
 will spend their ears lice their health 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.730
 on the fact that also demolish 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.720
 to sit out what could be 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.950
 it's a testicle 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.010
 she does not understand that she does not 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.910
 fertilized for her the process began 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:05.670
 masonry breeding process and of course 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.030
 although it is a pity this testicle is all very 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.180
 surprisingly very interesting and sorry for him 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.180
 toss out 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:19.639
 do you want yellow people need to throw an egg 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.130
 and you need to stop the laying process 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.590
 well, because what for why does she spend 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.500
 why did you have bird health to experience 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.750
 for strength when the egg is still not 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:37.340
 fertilized anyway baby bird there 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:39.210
 won't need to throw this toy out and 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.040
 reduce daylight hours 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.080
 either earlier higher than sending either 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.070
 put on a tight cape which is not 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:54.900
 transmits the light to the birds seemed 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:05:00.660
 of course stepped and also reduce proteins 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:04.110
 food protein protein rank if 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:08.010
 there is even a male and let's say a female 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:13.440
 laid an egg without a house without planning 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:16.050
 under plan breeding here she demolished 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.840
 testicle but we lived to mate 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.729
 about this we did not prepare birds for 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.120
 breeding is appropriate nutrition 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:29.550
 there mode yes then this is a dangerous situation 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:32.490
 everyone knows why there will be a bird 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.880
 be kept and hatch eggs when all 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.820
 equally 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.060
 due to the fact that there is no house egg 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.100
 to be either even if there is a germ we are not 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.740
 lived as they mated but he all 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.539
 equals the house will perish it will not be 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.169
 wrong temperature wrong 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:53.940
 humidity when cooking like 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:57.030
 nesting and from and when mating 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.070
 birds are they often do and man 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.870
 even that there half a day is on 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:05.130
 work and in the evening there is still possible 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.090
 notice when they do it and I'm looking for 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.250
 squeaks 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.380
 her in this period when you look back 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.950
 let's say you see they do it neither 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.310
 one birth maybe three there five 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.240
 once a day it can and even 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.790
 so often so i'm predatory 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.640
 bird owner is noticed when birds 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.860
 mate and if we don't see it from 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.050
 we are at home all day or a few days 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.450
 passed before we do not see them 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.880
 mating never mean this and not 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:38.120
 was most likely 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:41.120
 but even if there is a male and now she has demolished 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.150
 sludge anyway it's a dangerous situation what 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.610
 dangerous it is likely to come to nothing 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.130
 will lead to breed all to 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.780
 chick appeared because it will be in 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:55.220
 improper conditions of hatching and egg 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:07:00.110
 unprepared birds we will 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:04.250
 to cover their health is therefore better 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:07.460
 stop this process and transfer to 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.590
 another time when we are ready birds 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:14.030
 we will be ready when 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:18.590
 relevant knowledge is accumulated and then 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:19.510
 we are waiting for kenzie in general, that's actually 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.340
 and all 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:25.360
 Come on everyone until everyone a good mood 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.360
 bye Bye
