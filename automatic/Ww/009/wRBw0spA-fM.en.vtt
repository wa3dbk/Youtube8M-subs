00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
now it's a good photo to begin with I

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.889 
now it's a good photo to begin with I
like<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> black<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.120> white<00:00:39.450> there<00:00:39.629> were<00:00:39.690> two

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
like the black and white there were two

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.479 
like the black and white there were two
versions<00:00:40.110> there<00:00:40.500> was<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> color<00:00:40.890> there<00:00:41.370> was<00:00:41.460> a

black and white and I felt the black and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.080 
black and white and I felt the black and
white<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.290> better<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> background

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
white was better because the background

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.229 
white was better because the background
wasn't<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.200> distracting<00:00:47.190> excuse<00:00:47.730> me<00:00:47.910> text

message so what I saw in this photo is
that<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.239> could<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.690> been<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.800> really

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that this could have been really really

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.939 
that this could have been really really
good<00:00:53.370> if<00:00:54.000> two<00:00:54.660> things<00:00:54.899> would<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.379> happened

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
good if two things would have happened

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.389 
good if two things would have happened
one<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.360> kid<00:00:57.870> who<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.140> jumping<00:00:58.739> would<00:00:59.250> have

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
one if the kid who is jumping would have

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.540 
one if the kid who is jumping would have
been<00:00:59.609> frozen<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.539> his<00:01:00.750> tracks<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.350> two<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:02.100> he

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.870 
been frozen in his tracks and two if he
was<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:02.820> caught<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.539> midair<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.880> let's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
was actually caught in midair so let's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850 
was actually caught in midair so let's
figure<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.240> how<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.930> taken<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
figure out how this was taken first and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.950 
figure out how this was taken first and
then<00:01:08.100> tell<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> how<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.670> could<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.510> by

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
then tell you how you could do that by

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.870 
then tell you how you could do that by
anticipating<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.430> worrying<00:01:11.790> about

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
anticipating and not worrying about

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.539 
anticipating and not worrying about
spraying<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.570> praying<00:01:12.600> by<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.590> by<00:01:14.040> just

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
- let's see it's taken at 2.8 which is

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.819 
- let's see it's taken at 2.8 which is
fine<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> help<00:01:40.229> blow<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> background

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
fine to help blow out the background

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.550 
fine to help blow out the background
using<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> 50<00:01:41.700> millimeter<00:01:41.970> which<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.290> would

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
using a 50 millimeter which I would

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560 
using a 50 millimeter which I would
assume<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> 51<00:01:44.820> 4<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:45.420> something

too<00:01:54.119> much<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> think<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
too much more so I think it's just a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.450 
too much more so I think it's just a
fifty<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:57.810> point<00:01:58.229> four<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.979> equivalent

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
fifty one point four in the equivalent

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.450 
fifty one point four in the equivalent
or<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.180> equivalent<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:01.399> seventy<00:02:02.399> five

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
or the equivalent of a seventy five

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.459 
or the equivalent of a seventy five
millimeter<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.420> camera<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.200> key

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
millimeter on this camera so the key

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.499 
millimeter on this camera so the key
things<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.920> I'm<00:02:05.040> looking<00:02:05.159> at<00:02:05.399> here<00:02:05.579> 125th<00:02:06.420> of

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
things that I'm looking at here 125th of

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.410 
things that I'm looking at here 125th of
a<00:02:06.600> second<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.380> 2.8<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.160> fine<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.000> when<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.270> get

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
a second the 2.8 is fine but when we get

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.820 
a second the 2.8 is fine but when we get
to<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.690> 200<00:02:10.319> ISO<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.879> where<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.709> issue

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
to the 200 ISO that is where the issue

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.480 
to the 200 ISO that is where the issue
occurs

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
occurs

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.580 
occurs
you<00:02:14.970> don't<00:02:15.150> need<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.870> image<00:02:16.080> doesn't<00:02:16.440> need

you don't need this image doesn't need

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
to be shot at 200 ISO because it's

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.360 
to be shot at 200 ISO because it's
outside<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.960> lot<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.440> people<00:02:19.710> have<00:02:19.830> gotten<00:02:20.040> into

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
outside a lot of people have gotten into

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.700 
outside a lot of people have gotten into
they're<00:02:20.580> gotten<00:02:21.450> into<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.690> habit<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.170> keeping

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
they're gotten into the habit of keeping

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.310 
they're gotten into the habit of keeping
the<00:02:22.950> ISO<00:02:23.340> as<00:02:23.520> low<00:02:23.790> as<00:02:23.970> possible<00:02:24.000> if<00:02:24.930> you're

the ISO as low as possible if you're

outside with bright daylight but again

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.360 
outside with bright daylight but again
I'm<00:02:27.420> not<00:02:27.720> afraid<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.110> bump<00:02:28.290> my<00:02:28.410> ISO<00:02:28.830> but<00:02:29.070> even

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
I'm not afraid to bump my ISO but even

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.060 
I'm not afraid to bump my ISO but even
if<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.550> had<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.730> Nikon<00:02:30.150> d3100<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.320> would<00:02:31.830> probably

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
if I had a Nikon d3100 I would probably

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.890 
if I had a Nikon d3100 I would probably
shoot<00:02:32.610> probably<00:02:33.360> be<00:02:33.480> shooting<00:02:33.660> outside

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
shoot probably be shooting outside

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.550 
shoot probably be shooting outside
anywhere<00:02:34.530> between<00:02:34.680> 400<00:02:35.400> ISO<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.000> 800<00:02:36.960> ISO<00:02:37.350> and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
anywhere between 400 ISO and 800 ISO and

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.630 
anywhere between 400 ISO and 800 ISO and
I'm<00:02:37.860> gonna<00:02:38.070> explain<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.790> why<00:02:39.000> right<00:02:39.900> now

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
I'm gonna explain to you why right now

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.270 
I'm gonna explain to you why right now
so<00:02:41.640> we've<00:02:42.000> got<00:02:42.180> 125th<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:43.080> second<00:02:43.410> at<00:02:43.470> 2.8<00:02:44.160> so

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
so we've got 125th of a second at 2.8 so

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.220 
so we've got 125th of a second at 2.8 so
we're<00:02:44.400> gonna<00:02:44.490> keep<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.940> 2.8<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.660> same<00:02:45.870> we

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
we're gonna keep the 2.8 the same we

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.710 
we're gonna keep the 2.8 the same we
know<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.890> freeze<00:02:47.220> action<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:48.450> want<00:02:48.570> to

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
know that to freeze action you want to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.930 
know that to freeze action you want to
be<00:02:48.840> around<00:02:49.110> what<00:02:49.380> 125th<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.130> second<00:02:50.460> is<00:02:50.580> good

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
be around what 125th of a second is good

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.150 
be around what 125th of a second is good
but<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:51.540> there's<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.750> lot<00:02:51.960> of<00:02:52.020> light<00:02:52.440> for

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
but if there's a lot of light for

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.890 
but if there's a lot of light for
hundredths<00:02:53.490> of<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.670> second<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.150> above<00:02:54.570> is

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
hundredths of a second and above is

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.960 
hundredths of a second and above is
really<00:02:55.590> gonna<00:02:55.770> lock<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.370> motion<00:02:56.790> down

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
really gonna lock the motion down

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.570 
really gonna lock the motion down
especially<00:02:57.360> outside<00:02:57.930> or<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.710> any<00:02:58.920> situation

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
especially outside or in any situation

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.580 
especially outside or in any situation
well<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.660> depends<00:03:01.110> there's<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.320> lot<00:03:01.470> of

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
well it depends there's a lot of

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.050 
well it depends there's a lot of
different<00:03:01.860> situations<00:03:02.370> but<00:03:02.460> we'll<00:03:02.730> just<00:03:02.760> go

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
different situations but we'll just go

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.410 
different situations but we'll just go
from<00:03:03.690> here<00:03:04.020> 200<00:03:04.800> ISO<00:03:05.190> what<00:03:05.700> happens<00:03:06.090> if<00:03:06.270> we

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
from here 200 ISO what happens if we

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.020 
from here 200 ISO what happens if we
raise<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.720> ISO<00:03:07.280> we're<00:03:08.280> gonna<00:03:08.460> get<00:03:08.730> more

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
raise the ISO we're gonna get more

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.030 
raise the ISO we're gonna get more
shutter<00:03:09.390> speed<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:09.750> let's<00:03:09.990> think<00:03:10.620> about<00:03:10.800> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
shutter speed so let's think about the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.850 
shutter speed so let's think about the
exposure<00:03:11.370> triangle<00:03:11.670> here<00:03:12.000> real<00:03:12.180> quick<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:13.050> we

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
exposure triangle here real quick so we

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.230 
exposure triangle here real quick so we
know<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.220> we<00:03:14.310> need<00:03:14.460> more<00:03:14.640> shutter<00:03:14.910> speed

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
know that we need more shutter speed

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.330 
know that we need more shutter speed
what<00:03:15.720> are<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.050> options<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.650> we<00:03:16.800> could<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.160> to

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
what are the options that we could do to

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.820 
what are the options that we could do to
get<00:03:17.490> more<00:03:17.640> shutter<00:03:17.940> speed<00:03:18.270> we<00:03:18.660> could<00:03:18.960> open<00:03:19.320> the

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
get more shutter speed we could open the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.280 
get more shutter speed we could open the
aperture<00:03:20.100> up<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.640> from<00:03:21.000> 2.8<00:03:21.540> we<00:03:21.720> could<00:03:21.870> go<00:03:22.020> to<00:03:22.080> F

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
aperture up so from 2.8 we could go to F

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.780 
aperture up so from 2.8 we could go to F
2<00:03:22.830> 5<00:03:23.220> 2<00:03:23.880> 2<00:03:24.240> 2<00:03:25.080> 0<00:03:26.120> 1.8<00:03:27.290> 1.4<00:03:28.370> that's<00:03:29.370> gonna<00:03:29.580> let

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
2 5 2 2 2 0 1.8 1.4 that's gonna let

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.020 
2 5 2 2 2 0 1.8 1.4 that's gonna let
more<00:03:30.030> light<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.480> which<00:03:30.960> is<00:03:31.170> going<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.730> speed<00:03:32.730> up

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
more light in which is going to speed up

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.360 
more light in which is going to speed up
the<00:03:33.450> shutter<00:03:33.720> speed<00:03:33.930> because<00:03:34.830> that's<00:03:35.070> going

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the shutter speed because that's going

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.850 
the shutter speed because that's going
to<00:03:35.600> basically<00:03:36.600> let<00:03:36.870> in<00:03:37.080> more<00:03:37.260> light<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:37.740> the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
to basically let in more light so the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.300 
to basically let in more light so the
shutter<00:03:38.100> should<00:03:38.340> not<00:03:38.490> be<00:03:38.640> open<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.870> long<00:03:40.310> we've

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
shutter should not be open so long we've

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.800 
shutter should not be open so long we've
then<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.790> other<00:03:41.940> way<00:03:42.300> we<00:03:42.510> can<00:03:42.630> get<00:03:42.780> more

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
then the other way we can get more

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.380 
then the other way we can get more
shutter<00:03:43.230> speed<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.680> by<00:03:43.830> raising<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.400> ISO<00:03:44.910> so

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
shutter speed is by raising the ISO so

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.900 
shutter speed is by raising the ISO so
right<00:03:45.570> now<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:45.840> at<00:03:45.930> 200<00:03:46.530> if<00:03:46.680> we<00:03:46.800> went<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.100> 400

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
right now it's at 200 if we went to 400

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.910 
right now it's at 200 if we went to 400
we're<00:03:48.540> getting<00:03:48.870> more<00:03:49.230> letting<00:03:49.530> sort<00:03:49.800> of

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
we're getting more letting sort of

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.440 
we're getting more letting sort of
letting<00:03:50.130> more<00:03:50.340> light<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.730> there<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.300> your

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
letting more light in there so your

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.970 
letting more light in there so your
shutter<00:03:51.660> speed<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:52.080> compensate<00:03:52.290> for<00:03:52.860> that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
shutter speed to compensate for that

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.070 
shutter speed to compensate for that
will<00:03:53.190> have<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.610> go<00:03:53.760> higher<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.330> in<00:03:54.690> this<00:03:54.840> case

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
will have to go higher so in this case

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.680 
will have to go higher so in this case
I'd<00:03:55.290> like<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.860> get<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.280> 1<00:03:56.820> 4<00:03:57.090> hundredths<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.570> a

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
I'd like to get to 1 4 hundredths of a

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.260 
I'd like to get to 1 4 hundredths of a
second<00:03:58.170> or<00:03:58.260> let's<00:03:58.500> say<00:03:58.560> 1<00:03:58.920> 500th<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.850> second

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
second or let's say 1 500th of a second

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.750 
second or let's say 1 500th of a second
so<00:04:00.570> we<00:04:00.660> got<00:04:00.810> 125th<00:04:02.210> 250th<00:04:03.210> and<00:04:03.510> then<00:04:04.610> 250th<00:04:05.610> you

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
so we got 125th 250th and then 250th you

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.210 
so we got 125th 250th and then 250th you
multiply<00:04:06.210> you<00:04:06.270> double<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.020> you've<00:04:07.170> got<00:04:07.350> 500th

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
multiply you double it you've got 500th

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.730 
multiply you double it you've got 500th
of<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.820> second<00:04:09.150> that's<00:04:09.300> two<00:04:09.600> stops<00:04:09.990> so<00:04:10.530> we<00:04:10.620> go

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
of a second that's two stops so we go

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.170 
of a second that's two stops so we go
from<00:04:10.920> 200<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:12.000> 400<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:13.080> 800<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.980> there<00:04:14.880> we<00:04:15.030> go

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
from 200 to 400 to 800 and there we go

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.180 
from 200 to 400 to 800 and there we go
800<00:04:15.720> ISO<00:04:16.080> is<00:04:16.290> going<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.530> allow<00:04:16.770> us<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:17.040> have

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
800 ISO is going to allow us to have

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.610 
800 ISO is going to allow us to have
that<00:04:17.220> 500th<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.270> second<00:04:18.630> exposure<00:04:18.989> that

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
that 500th of a second exposure that

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.470 
that 500th of a second exposure that
we're<00:04:19.799> going<00:04:20.010> for<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.760> is<00:04:20.880> going<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.090> help<00:04:21.330> us

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
we're going for that is going to help us

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.080 
we're going for that is going to help us
freeze<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.470> motion<00:04:22.950> to<00:04:23.340> make<00:04:23.550> sure<00:04:23.790> that<00:04:23.970> this

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
freeze the motion to make sure that this

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.540 
freeze the motion to make sure that this
kid<00:04:24.390> is<00:04:24.540> solid<00:04:25.110> now<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.530> would<00:04:25.890> say<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.100> would<00:04:26.430> get

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
kid is solid now I would say I would get

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.890 
kid is solid now I would say I would get
the<00:04:26.669> anticipation<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.510> little

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
the anticipation a little

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.780 
the anticipation a little
that<00:04:28.139> I<00:04:28.320> wouldn't<00:04:28.770> have<00:04:28.860> shot<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.160> right<00:04:29.580> when

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
that I wouldn't have shot it right when

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.370 
that I wouldn't have shot it right when
he<00:04:29.880> was<00:04:30.000> about<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.360> jump<00:04:30.600> I<00:04:30.780> would<00:04:31.050> have<00:04:31.169> shot

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
he was about to jump I would have shot

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.370 
he was about to jump I would have shot
it<00:04:31.520> after<00:04:32.520> he<00:04:32.729> jumped<00:04:33.090> in<00:04:33.350> anticipating<00:04:34.350> that

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
it after he jumped in anticipating that

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.320 
it after he jumped in anticipating that
peak<00:04:34.830> action<00:04:35.340> where<00:04:35.490> he<00:04:35.610> was<00:04:35.729> frozen<00:04:36.210> at<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
peak action where he was frozen at the

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.480 
peak action where he was frozen at the
very<00:04:36.720> top<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.259> it<00:04:37.350> now<00:04:37.800> also<00:04:38.009> that's<00:04:38.280> going<00:04:38.430> to

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
very top of it now also that's going to

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.279 
very top of it now also that's going to
help<00:04:38.699> you<00:04:38.820> freeze<00:04:39.180> motion<00:04:39.449> even<00:04:39.960> at<00:04:40.050> slower

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
help you freeze motion even at slower

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.930 
help you freeze motion even at slower
shutter<00:04:40.380> speeds<00:04:40.949> because<00:04:41.550> if<00:04:41.669> they're<00:04:41.820> at<00:04:41.910> the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
shutter speeds because if they're at the

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.600 
shutter speeds because if they're at the
peak<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.259> pinnacle<00:04:43.740> of<00:04:43.919> their<00:04:44.220> jump

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
peak the the the pinnacle of their jump

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.790 
peak the the the pinnacle of their jump
that<00:04:45.120> means<00:04:45.330> they're<00:04:45.570> stopped<00:04:46.020> for<00:04:46.530> whatever

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
that means they're stopped for whatever

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.560 
that means they're stopped for whatever
split-second<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:47.639> is<00:04:47.759> they're<00:04:48.030> stopped<00:04:48.389> at

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
split-second it is they're stopped at

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.090 
split-second it is they're stopped at
the<00:04:48.630> very<00:04:48.810> top<00:04:48.990> right<00:04:49.590> before<00:04:49.919> they<00:04:50.070> start

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
the very top right before they start

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.730 
the very top right before they start
using<00:04:50.520> gravity<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.300> coming<00:04:51.840> back<00:04:51.990> down<00:04:52.199> to

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
using gravity and coming back down to

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.770 
using gravity and coming back down to
earth<00:04:53.009> so<00:04:53.580> I<00:04:53.610> threw<00:04:53.910> a<00:04:53.970> bunch<00:04:54.180> of<00:04:54.300> numbers<00:04:54.630> at

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
earth so I threw a bunch of numbers at

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.840 
earth so I threw a bunch of numbers at
you<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:54.960> threw<00:04:55.259> a<00:04:55.320> bunch<00:04:55.560> of<00:04:55.710> things<00:04:55.889> there<00:04:56.430> but

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
you I threw a bunch of things there but

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.779 
you I threw a bunch of things there but
the<00:04:57.300> moral<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.259> story<00:04:58.289> here<00:04:58.860> is<00:04:58.949> just<00:04:59.490> look

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
the moral of the story here is just look

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.000 
the moral of the story here is just look
at<00:04:59.910> your<00:05:00.030> ISO<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.810> if<00:05:01.199> you<00:05:01.320> need<00:05:01.530> more<00:05:01.710> shutter

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
at your ISO and if you need more shutter

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.950 
at your ISO and if you need more shutter
speed<00:05:02.310> think<00:05:02.820> about<00:05:03.060> what<00:05:03.240> you<00:05:03.360> can<00:05:03.510> do<00:05:03.720> using

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
speed think about what you can do using

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.189 
speed think about what you can do using
the<00:05:04.199> exposure<00:05:04.590> triangle<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.789> get<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.539> action

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
the exposure triangle to get the action

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.290 
the exposure triangle to get the action
frozen<00:05:07.949> if<00:05:08.130> that's<00:05:08.340> what<00:05:08.580> you're<00:05:08.729> going<00:05:08.880> for<00:05:09.000> I

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
frozen if that's what you're going for I

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.400 
frozen if that's what you're going for I
think<00:05:09.539> you<00:05:09.600> may<00:05:09.720> need<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:10.020> watch<00:05:10.169> this<00:05:10.350> a

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
think you may need to watch this a

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.140 
think you may need to watch this a
couple<00:05:10.770> times<00:05:10.800> but<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.520> just<00:05:11.580> wanted<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:11.940> throw

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
couple times but I just wanted to throw

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.760 
couple times but I just wanted to throw
those<00:05:12.389> numbers<00:05:12.750> out<00:05:12.870> there<00:05:13.139> and<00:05:13.320> and

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
those numbers out there and and

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.279 
those numbers out there and and
hopefully<00:05:14.400> get<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.180> there<00:05:15.449> get<00:05:15.960> it<00:05:16.080> through

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
hopefully get it there get it through

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.770 
hopefully get it there get it through
there<00:05:16.500> that<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:16.860> guys<00:05:16.889> can<00:05:17.370> see<00:05:17.639> what<00:05:18.630> we're

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
there that you guys can see what we're

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.250 
there that you guys can see what we're
going<00:05:18.930> for

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
going for
