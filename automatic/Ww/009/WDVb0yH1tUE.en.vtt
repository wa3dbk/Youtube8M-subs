while<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.300> was<00:01:03.510> looking<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:03.989> something<00:01:04.229> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
while I was looking for something that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.580 
while I was looking for something that
was<00:01:04.710> basically<00:01:05.189> very<00:01:05.640> similar<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.439> why<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> was

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
was basically very similar to why I was

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.700 
was basically very similar to why I was
already<00:01:07.979> having<00:01:08.520> made<00:01:09.299> by<00:01:09.960> custom<00:01:10.380> guitar

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
already having made by custom guitar

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.840 
already having made by custom guitar
builder<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.900> wasn't<00:01:13.110> really<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:14.040> hard<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
builder so it wasn't really that hard it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.429 
builder so it wasn't really that hard it
wasn't<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.330> had<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.720> start<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> brand

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
wasn't like had to start with a brand

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.130 
wasn't like had to start with a brand
new<00:01:16.530> concept<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.700> know<00:01:17.850> basically<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
new concept for it you know basically it

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.670 
new concept for it you know basically it
was<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.759> semi-hollow<00:01:20.759> guitar<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:24.409> that's<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
was a semi-hollow guitar and that's the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.380 
was a semi-hollow guitar and that's the
sound<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:26.970> very

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
sound that I like you know they very

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.929 
sound that I like you know they very
much<00:01:27.420> more<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:29.040> me<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> lot<00:01:29.759> more

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
much more to me they have a lot more

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.630 
much more to me they have a lot more
dynamic<00:01:30.509> range<00:01:31.350> than<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.520> know

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
dynamic range than the you know

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.160 
dynamic range than the you know
especially<00:01:32.790> if<00:01:33.180> you're<00:01:33.270> using<00:01:33.299> distortion

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
especially if you're using distortion

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:50.150 
especially if you're using distortion
than<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> guitar<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> solid<00:01:36.180> body

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
wanted them to the way I wanted it to be

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.830 
wanted them to the way I wanted it to be
built<00:01:56.500> in<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.040> first<00:01:57.250> place<00:01:57.520> but<00:01:58.420> because<00:01:58.720> it

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
built in the first place but because it

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.270 
built in the first place but because it
was<00:01:58.960> kind<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.230> a<00:01:59.320> learning<00:01:59.500> curve<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.190> an

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
was kind of a learning curve and an

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.940 
was kind of a learning curve and an
experiment<00:02:00.940> you<00:02:01.450> know<00:02:01.570> we<00:02:02.230> started<00:02:02.530> with<00:02:02.800> this

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
experiment you know we started with this

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.090 
experiment you know we started with this

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
hollowed out and then he has a top on it

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.290 
hollowed out and then he has a top on it
and<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:13.360> guitar<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:14.460> there's<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.610> top<00:02:16.000> Anna

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
and this guitar is there's a top Anna

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.990
