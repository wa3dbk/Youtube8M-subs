special about technique you use in your
distillation<00:01:11.939> well<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.439> nothing<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.310> any

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
distillation well it's nothing like any

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
distillation well it's nothing like any
vodka<00:01:15.150> distillery<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.869> would<00:01:16.200> find<00:01:16.470> anywhere

around<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.549> world<00:01:17.810> we<00:01:18.810> are<00:01:18.960> much<00:01:19.229> more

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
around the world we are much more

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.399 
around the world we are much more
inspired<00:01:19.830> by<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:21.150> people<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.630> cognac<00:01:22.259> in

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
inspired by the people in cognac in

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.280 
inspired by the people in cognac in
Normandy<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.250> Scotland<00:01:23.520> etc<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.720> our<00:01:24.869> basis

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
Normandy up in Scotland etc so our basis

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.090 
Normandy up in Scotland etc so our basis
is<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:26.119> traditional<00:01:27.119> cuddle<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.950> have

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
is a traditional cuddle and then we have

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.700 
is a traditional cuddle and then we have
invented<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.759> unique<00:01:30.689> method<00:01:30.930> where<00:01:31.680> we

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
invented a unique method where we

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.380 
invented a unique method where we
actually<00:01:32.040> distill<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.939> spirit<00:01:33.270> 34<00:01:33.930> times<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
actually distill the spirit 34 times and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.370 
actually distill the spirit 34 times and
normally<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.420> would<00:01:36.750> indicate<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.170> you

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
normally that would indicate that you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.050 
normally that would indicate that you
have<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.590> sell<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> hell<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.640> flavors

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
have to sell the hell out of all flavors

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.929
