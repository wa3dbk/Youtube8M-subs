00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
start to FIFA 40 and I think he'll

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.820 
start to FIFA 40 and I think he'll
really<00:00:21.330> still<00:00:21.689> work<00:00:21.869> at<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.109> start<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> FIFA

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
really still work at the start of FIFA

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.269

actually<00:00:39.030> quite<00:00:39.149> quick<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:40.140> here's<00:00:40.350> actually

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
actually quite quick but here's actually

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.500 
actually quite quick but here's actually
a<00:00:40.710> pretty<00:00:40.920> good<00:00:41.129> player<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:42.030> cuz<00:00:42.420> he<00:00:42.480> has

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
a pretty good player and just cuz he has

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.030 
a pretty good player and just cuz he has
that<00:00:42.690> basic<00:00:43.020> chemistry<00:00:43.260> though<00:00:43.530> he'll<00:00:43.739> go<00:00:43.770> for

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that basic chemistry though he'll go for

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.850 
that basic chemistry though he'll go for
disco<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.700> as<00:00:45.270> soon<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.260> put<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> shadow

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
disco but as soon as you put a shadow

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.279 
disco but as soon as you put a shadow
and<00:00:46.950> he'll<00:00:47.370> go<00:00:47.520> for<00:00:47.640> about<00:00:47.700> 34<00:00:48.390> k<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and he'll go for about 34 k now the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.690 
and he'll go for about 34 k now the
reason<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.250> because<00:00:50.579> they're

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
reason I know this is because they're

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.729 
reason I know this is because they're
only<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.180> about<00:00:51.420> five<00:00:51.780> pigs<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> market

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
only be about five pigs on the market

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.110 
only be about five pigs on the market
with<00:00:52.860> people<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.370> chemistry<00:00:53.760> styles

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
with people with chemistry styles

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.729 
with people with chemistry styles
whereas<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.930> look<00:00:55.079> at<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:55.440> they'll<00:00:55.680> be

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
whereas if you look at it now they'll be

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.799 
whereas if you look at it now they'll be
about<00:00:55.949> hun<00:00:56.190> i'll<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.610> hundreds<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.329> hundreds

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
about hun i'll be hundreds and hundreds

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.139 
about hun i'll be hundreds and hundreds
but<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> stars<00:00:58.590> fifa<00:00:59.100> everyone<00:00:59.850> will<00:01:00.000> just

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
but the stars fifa everyone will just

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.670 
but the stars fifa everyone will just
not<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.539> bothered<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.020> change<00:01:01.140> chemistries

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
not be bothered to change chemistries

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.709 
not be bothered to change chemistries
until<00:01:02.070> actually<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> actual<00:01:03.149> release<00:01:03.480> of

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
until actually the actual release of

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.719 
until actually the actual release of
fifa<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.739> therefore<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.220> could<00:01:05.339> sell<00:01:05.549> them<00:01:05.610> on
