00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
just in a different print so I would

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.229 
just in a different print so I would
definitely<00:00:31.619> check<00:00:32.009> your<00:00:32.369> target<00:00:32.730> especially

with the fall things coming in now

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.700

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
because it is fall it may be a little

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.770 
because it is fall it may be a little
bit<00:00:37.800> more<00:00:37.950> prone<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.910> your<00:00:39.180> target<00:00:39.420> in

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
bit more prone to be in your target in

bit more prone to be in your target in
the<00:00:40.170> plus-size<00:00:40.559> section<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.100> you're

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the plus-size section if you're

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.569 
the plus-size section if you're
interested<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:43.020> dress<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.890> want<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
reason I got that was so that it would

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.060 
reason I got that was so that it would
be<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.000> little<00:00:48.270> bit<00:00:48.390> longer<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:49.020> me<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.770> still

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
be a little bit longer on me it's still

not as long as I would like it to be but
it<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.379> longer<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.820> print<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it is longer so the print on it like I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.840

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.960 
boyfriend type shirt in a dress that the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
buttons don't go all the way down they
actually<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.509> go<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> right<00:01:28.049> here<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.680> right

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
actually just go to right here and right

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.090 
actually just go to right here and right
here<00:01:29.340> cinches<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> definitely<00:01:31.560> could

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
here cinches in so you definitely could

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.830 
here cinches in so you definitely could
wear<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> without<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> bell<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.509> feel<00:01:33.750> like

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
wear it without the bell but I feel like

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.149 
wear it without the bell but I feel like
the<00:01:33.990> belt<00:01:34.170> kind<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.500> breaks<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> monotony

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the belt kind of breaks up the monotony

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.850 
the belt kind of breaks up the monotony

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
of the birds and it's just all around a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.480 
of the birds and it's just all around a
better<00:01:37.939> overall<00:01:38.939> look<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:40.439> belt<00:01:40.619> does<00:01:41.070> have

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
better overall look the belt does have

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.060 
better overall look the belt does have
little<00:01:41.880> loops<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:42.600> here<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> side<00:01:43.530> of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
little loops right here on the side of

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.770 
little loops right here on the side of
the<00:01:44.399> dress<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.390> belt<00:01:45.570> doesn't

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780

fall<00:01:46.049> down<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.409> don't<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.770> worry<00:01:46.950> about

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
fall down you don't have to worry about

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.969

it<00:01:47.369> being<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:48.030> by<00:01:48.180> itself<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.740> on

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it being up here by itself and then on

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.830 
it being up here by itself and then on
the<00:01:50.130> front<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.060> has<00:01:51.240> two<00:01:51.630> pockets

the front of it here it has two pockets
that<00:01:52.170> are<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> thought<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:52.950> first<00:01:52.979> we're

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that are I thought at first we're

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.179 
that are I thought at first we're
actually<00:01:53.579> full<00:01:54.030> pockets<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.259> are<00:01:55.590> like

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
actually full pockets but there are like

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.730 
actually full pockets but there are like
legit<00:01:56.399> pockets<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.689> breast<00:01:57.930> area<00:01:58.229> here

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
legit pockets on the breast area here

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.770 
legit pockets on the breast area here
that<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.579> an<00:01:59.820> awkward<00:02:00.210> place<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.600> put

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
that that's an awkward place to put

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.330 
that that's an awkward place to put
anything<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.350> there<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.770> definitely

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
anything in there so I definitely

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.720 
anything in there so I definitely
wouldn't

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
wouldn't

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.280 
wouldn't
use<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:02.970> as<00:02:03.150> pockets<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> could<00:02:04.080> if<00:02:04.200> you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
use them as pockets but you could if you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.640 
use them as pockets but you could if you
like<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.920> guess<00:02:05.160> I'll<00:02:05.340> start<00:02:05.610> off<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:05.880> my

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
my legs because I'm kind of on the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150 
my legs because I'm kind of on the
shorter<00:05:20.480> side<00:05:20.510> but<00:05:21.350> it<00:05:21.470> also<00:05:21.650> gives<00:05:22.040> that

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
shorter side but it also gives that

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.220 
shorter side but it also gives that
appearance<00:05:22.370> that<00:05:22.850> it's<00:05:23.390> kind<00:05:23.660> of<00:05:23.750> just

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
appearance that it's kind of just

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.950 
appearance that it's kind of just
cohesive<00:05:24.980> the<00:05:25.430> color<00:05:25.669> all<00:05:25.940> around<00:05:25.970> matches

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
cohesive the color all around matches

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.680 
cohesive the color all around matches
the<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:28.100> nude<00:05:28.280> color<00:05:28.550> and<00:05:28.760> the<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.270> heels

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
the the nude color and the the heels

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.720 
the the nude color and the the heels
matches<00:05:30.290> the<00:05:30.470> dress<00:05:30.919> and<00:05:31.160> it<00:05:31.250> just<00:05:31.460> kind<00:05:31.669> of

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
matches the dress and it just kind of

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.580 
matches the dress and it just kind of
ties<00:05:31.970> everything<00:05:32.240> together<00:05:32.690> so<00:05:33.169> I<00:05:33.230> think<00:05:33.290> that

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
ties everything together so I think that

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.770 
ties everything together so I think that
that's<00:05:33.770> perfect<00:05:34.310> definitely<00:05:35.150> if<00:05:35.419> you<00:05:35.540> wanted

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
that's perfect definitely if you wanted

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.690 
that's perfect definitely if you wanted
to<00:05:35.960> wear<00:05:36.110> this<00:05:36.260> with<00:05:36.500> heels<00:05:36.800> I<00:05:37.100> mean<00:05:37.550> with

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
to wear this with heels I mean with

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.790 
to wear this with heels I mean with
flats<00:05:38.090> you<00:05:38.390> could<00:05:38.660> but<00:05:39.230> because<00:05:39.500> of<00:05:39.680> the

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
flats you could but because of the

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.350 
flats you could but because of the
length<00:05:40.040> of<00:05:40.190> the<00:05:40.340> skirt<00:05:40.580> I<00:05:40.700> really<00:05:41.000> feel<00:05:41.240> like

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
length of the skirt I really feel like

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.030

wearing<00:05:41.660> it<00:05:41.840> with<00:05:41.990> flats<00:05:42.290> would<00:05:42.470> cut<00:05:42.770> off<00:05:42.890> your

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
wearing it with flats would cut off your

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.130 
wearing it with flats would cut off your
legs<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:44.090> it<00:05:44.210> would<00:05:44.300> make<00:05:44.480> you<00:05:44.570> look<00:05:44.720> short
