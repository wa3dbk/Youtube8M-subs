instead<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.540> computer<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:16.960> created<00:01:17.260> an

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
instead of a computer you created an

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.410 
instead of a computer you created an
artificial<00:01:17.680> intelligence<00:01:18.369> but<00:01:18.939> he<00:01:19.030> fell<00:01:19.270> in

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
artificial intelligence but he fell in

that<00:01:21.100> he<00:01:21.250> called<00:01:21.520> sea<00:01:21.850> life<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.420> guess<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.080> so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
that he called sea life I guess and so

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.719 
that he called sea life I guess and so
he<00:01:24.220> wanted<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.820> be<00:01:25.119> with<00:01:25.270> her<00:01:25.420> so<00:01:25.630> he<00:01:25.960> digitized

digitized himself and made himself into

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.149 
digitized himself and made himself into
computer<00:01:30.520> program<00:01:30.850> then<00:01:31.390> he<00:01:31.600> connected<00:01:32.159> into

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
computer program then he connected into

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.260 
computer program then he connected into
the<00:01:33.250> computer<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:33.700> know<00:01:33.820> he<00:01:33.909> went<00:01:34.150> in<00:01:34.210> the

but<00:01:56.799> here's<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.399> thing<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:58.500> your<00:01:59.500> dad<00:01:59.829> went

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
but here's the thing is your dad went

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.030 
but here's the thing is your dad went
insane<00:02:01.090> from<00:02:01.450> being<00:02:01.630> in<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.840> computer<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.469> I

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
insane from being in the computer and I

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.039 
insane from being in the computer and I
would<00:02:03.219> say<00:02:03.430> if<00:02:03.549> you<00:02:03.579> digitize<00:02:04.060> yourself<00:02:04.509> into

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
would say if you digitize yourself into

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.899 
would say if you digitize yourself into
data<00:02:05.290> and<00:02:05.530> then<00:02:05.590> go<00:02:05.710> into<00:02:05.860> computer<00:02:06.340> that's

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
data and then go into computer that's

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:07.859 
data and then go into computer that's
probably<00:02:07.090> gonna<00:02:07.299> make<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.600> little<00:02:07.689> bit

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
probably gonna make it a little bit

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.830 
probably gonna make it a little bit
insane<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:08.860> here<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.519> your<00:02:09.549> father<00:02:10.299> coming<00:02:10.450> out

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
insane so here is your father coming out

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.300 
insane so here is your father coming out
of<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.959> computer<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.620> he's<00:02:11.920> turned<00:02:12.190> into

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
of the computer and he's turned into

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.699 
of the computer and he's turned into
some<00:02:12.610> crazy<00:02:12.820> dr.<00:02:13.629> wily<00:02:13.900> looking<00:02:14.379> dude<00:02:14.560> as

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
some crazy dr. wily looking dude as

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.850 
some crazy dr. wily looking dude as
you'll<00:02:14.860> see<00:02:15.040> here<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:16.530> that's<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.650> story

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
you'll see here and that's the story

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.750 
you'll see here and that's the story
line<00:02:17.950> actually<00:02:18.280> kind<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.459> looks<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:18.670> a

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
line actually kind of looks like a

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.290 
line actually kind of looks like a
strobe

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
strobe

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.840 
strobe
that's<00:02:19.600> probably<00:02:19.870> an<00:02:20.080> obvious<00:02:20.560> nod<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.070> but

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
that's probably an obvious nod to it but

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.880 
that's probably an obvious nod to it but
so<00:02:22.120> yeah<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.600> now<00:02:22.750> he's<00:02:22.990> bent<00:02:23.260> on<00:02:23.440> taking<00:02:23.620> over

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
so yeah so now he's bent on taking over

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.340 
so yeah so now he's bent on taking over
the<00:02:24.040> world<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.930> stop<00:02:26.170> your

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
the world and so you have to stop your

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.340 
the world and so you have to stop your
own<00:02:26.470> father<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.940> this<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.870> definitely<00:02:29.080> a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
own father and so this is definitely a

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.240 
own father and so this is definitely a
case<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:31.320> yeah<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.350> kinda<00:02:32.710> reminds<00:02:32.980> me<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.160> that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
case of yeah I kinda reminds me of that

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.460 
case of yeah I kinda reminds me of that
game<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.000> had<00:02:34.240> a<00:02:34.270> lease<00:02:34.540> play<00:02:34.810> called

game that I had a lease play called

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
move where you were completely

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.500 
move where you were completely
invincible<00:04:20.530> during<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.519> entire<00:04:21.880> duration<00:04:22.150> of

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
invincible during the entire duration of

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.210 
invincible during the entire duration of
the<00:04:22.630> move<00:04:22.780> from<00:04:22.960> start<00:04:23.230> to<00:04:23.320> finish<00:04:23.590> one

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
the move from start to finish one

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.040 
the move from start to finish one
hundred<00:04:24.460> percent<00:04:24.490> invincible<00:04:25.120> so<00:04:25.690> I'm

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
hundred percent invincible so I'm

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.719 
hundred percent invincible so I'm
guessing<00:04:26.410> it<00:04:26.680> didn't<00:04:26.890> advertise<00:04:27.280> this<00:04:27.580> too

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
guessing it didn't advertise this too

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.670 
guessing it didn't advertise this too
much<00:04:27.880> of<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.090> game<00:04:28.210> because<00:04:28.720> for<00:04:29.260> bosses<00:04:29.560> like

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
much of the game because for bosses like

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.469 
much of the game because for bosses like
this<00:04:29.890> it's<00:04:30.130> essentially<00:04:30.610> 100<00:04:31.000> sent<00:04:31.120> broken

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
this it's essentially 100 sent broken

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.970 
this it's essentially 100 sent broken
because<00:04:31.990> you<00:04:32.200> cannot

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
because you cannot

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.800 
because you cannot
horn<00:04:33.190> while<00:04:33.460> doing<00:04:33.640> this<00:04:33.880> buy<00:04:34.150> anything<00:04:34.330> and

horn while doing this buy anything and

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.990 
horn while doing this buy anything and
it's<00:04:35.320> really<00:04:35.650> broken<00:04:35.830> on<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.160> last<00:04:36.370> boss<00:04:36.610> by

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
direction to get an energy charge or you

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.870 
direction to get an energy charge or you
can<00:04:50.710> just<00:04:50.800> run<00:04:51.010> fast<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.460> can<00:04:51.580> just<00:04:51.700> continue

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
can just run fast you can just continue

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.490 
can just run fast you can just continue
to<00:04:52.120> run<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.450> you<00:04:52.510> build<00:04:52.720> up<00:04:52.870> an<00:04:53.050> electrical

to run and you build up an electrical

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.990 
to run and you build up an electrical
charge<00:04:53.530> or<00:04:53.950> maybe<00:04:54.100> it's<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.280> computer<00:04:54.520> charge<00:04:54.850> I

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
charge or maybe it's a computer charge I

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.850 
charge or maybe it's a computer charge I
don't<00:04:55.180> know<00:04:55.420> but<00:04:56.080> you<00:04:56.200> do<00:04:56.320> that<00:04:56.500> so<00:04:56.620> you<00:04:56.710> look

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
while doing the dash to you travel

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.780 
while doing the dash to you travel
through<00:05:10.450> any<00:05:11.080> enemies<00:05:11.440> nearby<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:11.980> if<00:05:12.490> you<00:05:12.610> do

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
through any enemies nearby and if you do

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.900 
through any enemies nearby and if you do
this<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.210> you<00:05:13.270> press<00:05:14.340> attack<00:05:15.340> now<00:05:15.370> you<00:05:15.580> shoot

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
this and you press attack now you shoot

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.450 
this and you press attack now you shoot
out<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.270> sort<00:05:16.990> of<00:05:17.020> like<00:05:17.140> a<00:05:17.170> bolt<00:05:17.500> thing<00:05:17.740> and<00:05:18.010> so

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
out a sort of like a bolt thing and so

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.100 
out a sort of like a bolt thing and so
that<00:05:18.640> obviously<00:05:18.730> there's<00:05:19.120> more<00:05:19.150> damage<00:05:19.630> but

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
that obviously there's more damage but

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.130 
that obviously there's more damage but
the<00:05:20.230> main<00:05:20.530> whole<00:05:21.130> signature<00:05:21.940> attack<00:05:22.480> of<00:05:22.780> volt

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
the main whole signature attack of volt

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.600 
the main whole signature attack of volt
man<00:05:23.350> which<00:05:23.590> some<00:05:23.770> of<00:05:23.800> you<00:05:23.980> who<00:05:24.100> play<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.310> smash

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
man which some of you who play the smash

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.550 
man which some of you who play the smash
with<00:05:24.820> her<00:05:24.910> series<00:05:25.210> i<00:05:25.240> personally<00:05:25.780> don't<00:05:25.960> but

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
with her series i personally don't but

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.110 
with her series i personally don't but
apparently<00:05:26.950> this<00:05:27.070> is<00:05:27.250> what<00:05:27.460> he<00:05:27.700> could<00:05:27.880> choose

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
apparently this is what he could choose

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.800 
apparently this is what he could choose
a<00:05:28.510> ultimate<00:05:29.440> attack<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:30.280> bolt<00:05:30.730> tackle<00:05:31.180> looks

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
a ultimate attack the bolt tackle looks

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.050 
a ultimate attack the bolt tackle looks
like<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.290> at<00:05:32.800> when<00:05:33.010> he<00:05:33.130> does<00:05:33.370> it<00:05:33.550> and<00:05:33.670> he<00:05:33.790> says

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
like and at when he does it and he says

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.390 
like and at when he does it and he says
it's<00:05:34.570> something<00:05:34.840> he<00:05:34.900> says<00:05:35.080> vulpix<00:05:35.530> to<00:05:35.650> me<00:05:35.800> but

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
it's something he says vulpix to me but

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.530 
it's something he says vulpix to me but
when<00:05:36.490> he<00:05:36.550> does<00:05:36.670> this<00:05:36.820> attack<00:05:37.120> I<00:05:37.270> guess<00:05:37.420> he's

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
when he does this attack I guess he's

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.330 
when he does this attack I guess he's
saying<00:05:37.750> volt<00:05:38.020> setter<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:38.620> I<00:05:39.040> guess<00:05:39.190> it's

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
saying volt setter and I guess it's

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.500 
saying volt setter and I guess it's
really<00:05:39.400> similar<00:05:39.760> to<00:05:39.880> volt<00:05:40.120> tackle<00:05:40.360> in

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
really similar to volt tackle in

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.030 
really similar to volt tackle in
Japanese<00:05:40.930> so<00:05:41.140> it's<00:05:41.290> kind<00:05:41.470> of<00:05:41.500> a<00:05:41.560> reference<00:05:41.920> to

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
Japanese so it's kind of a reference to

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.160 
Japanese so it's kind of a reference to
that<00:05:42.220> Pikachu's<00:05:42.820> ultimate<00:05:43.300> attack<00:05:43.960> is<00:05:44.140> a

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
that Pikachu's ultimate attack is a

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.720 
that Pikachu's ultimate attack is a
reference<00:05:44.380> to<00:05:44.590> that<00:05:44.770> alright<00:05:45.310> fuck<00:05:45.490> off

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
reference to that alright fuck off

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.790 
reference to that alright fuck off
already<00:05:45.970> see<00:05:46.630> you<00:05:46.720> press<00:05:46.930> it<00:05:46.960> here<00:05:47.200> but<00:05:47.650> she's

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
already see you press it here but she's

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.580 
already see you press it here but she's
all<00:05:47.890> getting<00:05:48.040> out<00:05:48.130> butter<00:05:48.310> I'm<00:05:48.490> waiting<00:05:49.590> but

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
all getting out butter I'm waiting but

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.630 
all getting out butter I'm waiting but
that's<00:05:50.800> that's<00:05:51.040> the<00:05:51.190> thing<00:05:51.340> right<00:05:51.430> there<00:05:51.550> he

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
that's that's the thing right there he

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.070 
that's that's the thing right there he
turns<00:05:51.820> into<00:05:51.970> ball<00:05:52.210> lightning<00:05:52.510> and<00:05:52.750> he<00:05:52.810> shoots

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
turns into ball lightning and he shoots

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.960 
turns into ball lightning and he shoots
up<00:05:53.380> words<00:05:53.590> like<00:05:53.680> that<00:05:54.010> which<00:05:54.490> kind<00:05:54.700> of<00:05:54.790> seems

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
up words like that which kind of seems

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.910 
up words like that which kind of seems
lame<00:05:55.240> until<00:05:55.930> you<00:05:56.080> get<00:05:56.230> into<00:05:56.320> an<00:05:56.500> area<00:05:56.680> with<00:05:56.890> a

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
lame until you get into an area with a

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.620 
lame until you get into an area with a
lot<00:05:56.980> of<00:05:57.100> walls<00:05:57.310> and<00:05:57.610> then<00:05:58.150> it<00:05:58.270> becomes<00:05:58.540> very

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
lot of walls and then it becomes very

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.600 
lot of walls and then it becomes very
obvious<00:05:58.930> that<00:05:59.350> it's<00:05:59.740> stupidly<00:06:00.100> powerful

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
obvious that it's stupidly powerful

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.770 
obvious that it's stupidly powerful
which<00:06:00.790> I'll<00:06:00.970> show<00:06:01.210> you<00:06:01.240> here<00:06:01.450> alone<00:06:01.600> so<00:06:01.720> I<00:06:01.750> can

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
which I'll show you here alone so I can

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.160 
which I'll show you here alone so I can
actually<00:06:02.020> get<00:06:02.200> to<00:06:02.260> a<00:06:02.380> place<00:06:02.470> like<00:06:02.740> that

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
actually get to a place like that

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.320 
actually get to a place like that
likessee<00:06:05.170> let's<00:06:05.320> try<00:06:05.500> it<00:06:05.560> here<00:06:06.120> see<00:06:07.120> it's<00:06:07.270> not

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
likessee let's try it here see it's not

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.940 
likessee let's try it here see it's not
to<00:06:07.510> give<00:06:07.630> an<00:06:07.780> example<00:06:07.960> but<00:06:08.200> yeah<00:06:08.380> bounces<00:06:08.830> off

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
to give an example but yeah bounces off

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.830 
to give an example but yeah bounces off
walls<00:06:08.980> so<00:06:09.850> they'll<00:06:10.060> be<00:06:10.180> areas<00:06:10.510> in<00:06:10.600> the<00:06:10.690> game

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
walls so they'll be areas in the game

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.480 
walls so they'll be areas in the game
they're<00:06:10.990> purposely<00:06:11.320> made<00:06:11.680> for<00:06:11.890> this<00:06:12.010> where

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
they're purposely made for this where

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.380 
they're purposely made for this where
you<00:06:12.580> can<00:06:12.700> basically<00:06:12.820> bounce<00:06:13.210> around

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
you can basically bounce around

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.000 
you can basically bounce around
indefinitely<00:06:13.660> and<00:06:14.050> the<00:06:14.170> attack<00:06:14.440> doesn't<00:06:14.680> quit

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
indefinitely and the attack doesn't quit

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.760 
indefinitely and the attack doesn't quit
until<00:06:15.880> you<00:06:16.150> have<00:06:16.420> stopped<00:06:17.200> hitting<00:06:17.440> something

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
until you have stopped hitting something

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.130 
until you have stopped hitting something
for<00:06:18.100> a<00:06:18.130> duration<00:06:18.910> of<00:06:19.210> time<00:06:19.360> like<00:06:19.660> until<00:06:20.020> you

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
for a duration of time like until you

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.120 
for a duration of time like until you
haven't<00:06:20.350> hit<00:06:20.440> a<00:06:20.470> wall<00:06:20.650> after<00:06:20.740> like<00:06:21.010> I<00:06:21.070> don't

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
haven't hit a wall after like I don't

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.860 
haven't hit a wall after like I don't
know<00:06:21.250> two<00:06:21.340> or<00:06:21.430> three<00:06:21.640> seconds<00:06:22.030> so<00:06:22.540> this<00:06:22.720> will

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
know two or three seconds so this will

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.780 
know two or three seconds so this will
keep<00:06:23.020> up<00:06:23.200> all<00:06:23.380> day<00:06:23.560> this<00:06:24.190> can<00:06:24.400> go<00:06:24.520> on<00:06:24.550> all<00:06:24.730> day

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
keep up all day this can go on all day

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.880 
keep up all day this can go on all day
so<00:06:24.970> this<00:06:25.270> is<00:06:25.390> why<00:06:25.510> it's<00:06:25.570> stupidly<00:06:26.170> powerful<00:06:26.710> in

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
so this is why it's stupidly powerful in

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.260 
so this is why it's stupidly powerful in
closed<00:06:27.460> rooms<00:06:27.610> with<00:06:27.880> a<00:06:27.940> bunch<00:06:28.090> of<00:06:28.120> enemies

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
closed rooms with a bunch of enemies

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.460 
closed rooms with a bunch of enemies
because<00:06:28.570> you<00:06:28.660> can<00:06:28.750> just<00:06:28.780> lay<00:06:28.960> waste<00:06:29.170> to<00:06:29.320> them

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
because you can just lay waste to them

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.050 
because you can just lay waste to them
and<00:06:29.620> the<00:06:30.130> only<00:06:30.250> way<00:06:30.370> to<00:06:30.430> get<00:06:30.580> rid<00:06:30.730> of<00:06:30.760> it<00:06:30.880> is<00:06:31.030> to

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
and the only way to get rid of it is to

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.870 
and the only way to get rid of it is to
press<00:06:31.870> the<00:06:32.020> a<00:06:32.080> button<00:06:32.110> again<00:06:32.530> so<00:06:33.490> here<00:06:33.670> I<00:06:33.700> got

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
press the a button again so here I got

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.820 
press the a button again so here I got
more<00:06:34.060> heart<00:06:34.540> thing<00:06:34.810> or<00:06:34.930> whatever<00:06:35.080> why<00:06:35.620> she

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
more heart thing or whatever why she
