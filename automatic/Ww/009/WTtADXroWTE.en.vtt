say
I've<00:00:56.450> got<00:00:56.690> two<00:00:56.930> different<00:00:57.110> bit<00:00:57.350> of<00:00:57.500> footage

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770

I've got two different bit of footage
I've<00:00:58.220> got<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.790> top<00:00:59.000> one

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:10.280 

backflip<00:01:02.620> value<00:01:02.950> way<00:01:03.310> and<00:01:03.700> what<00:01:04.540> one<00:01:04.839> needs

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.380 

another<00:01:10.920> backrub<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.460> decides<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.850> cut<00:01:12.270> out

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
another backrub it decides to cut out

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.620 
another backrub it decides to cut out
but<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.870> doesn't<00:01:13.200> matter<00:01:13.340> FY<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.480> can

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
but that doesn't matter FY so you can

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.740 
but that doesn't matter FY so you can
delete<00:01:15.870> your<00:01:16.020> audio<00:01:16.320> you're<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.610> to

track

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.319 

now<00:01:23.969> all<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.929> basically<00:01:25.289> do<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.880> come<00:01:26.880> over<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
now all we basically do is come over to

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.730 
now all we basically do is come over to
track<00:01:27.899> motion<00:01:28.429> because<00:01:29.429> on<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:30.469> then<00:01:31.469> what

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
track motion because on that then what

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.260 
track motion because on that then what
you'll<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.759> bottom<00:01:33.030> left-hand

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you'll have in the bottom left-hand

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.499 
you'll have in the bottom left-hand
corner<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:33.929> any<00:01:34.319> corner<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:35.149> is<00:01:36.149> a<00:01:36.210> little

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
corner or in any corner is is a little

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.389 
corner or in any corner is is a little
circle<00:01:36.929> the<00:01:37.259> little<00:01:37.530> circle<00:01:38.069> and<00:01:38.360> basically

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
circle the little circle and basically

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.699 
circle the little circle and basically
move<00:01:41.399> it<00:01:41.520> inwards<00:01:41.909> towards<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> circle<00:01:42.990> okay

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
move it inwards towards the circle okay

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:51.310 
move it inwards towards the circle okay
now<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.969> go<00:01:45.179> to<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.450> timeline

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.149 

you<00:01:51.740> can<00:01:51.890> see<00:01:52.190> in<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.400> preview<00:01:52.790> window<00:01:53.030> that

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
you can see in a preview window that

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.580 
you can see in a preview window that
that<00:01:55.159> backflip<00:01:55.850> bail<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.450> now<00:01:57.020> inside<00:01:57.530> the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
that backflip bail is now inside the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.130 
that backflip bail is now inside the
video<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.520> don't<00:01:58.790> really<00:01:58.850> want<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.270> so<00:01:59.840> all

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
video so I don't really want that so all

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.440 
video so I don't really want that so all
you<00:02:00.200> do<00:02:00.410> is<00:02:01.010> you<00:02:01.130> move<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.550> over<00:02:01.729> 20

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
you do is you move it to over 20

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.930 
you do is you move it to over 20
positioned<00:02:02.930> like<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.190> just<00:02:04.430> click<00:02:04.760> the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
positioned like so and just click the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.889 
positioned like so and just click the
little<00:02:05.180> red<00:02:05.479> X<00:02:06.070> now<00:02:07.070> you're<00:02:07.400> thinking<00:02:07.760> ah<00:02:07.940> but

is like her I'll show you I'm just going

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.970 
is like her I'll show you I'm just going
to<00:02:47.470> delete<00:02:47.530> this<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:48.489> could<00:02:49.560> if<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.620> insert

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
to delete this you could if you insert

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.620 
to delete this you could if you insert
another<00:02:51.310> video<00:02:51.700> track<00:02:52.620> then<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:54.489> top<00:02:54.760> insert

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.190 

hey<00:03:00.180> where<00:03:00.390> do<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.600> want

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.290 

find<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.239> texture<00:03:05.239> one<00:03:05.420> so

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.260 

then<00:03:10.930> all<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.590> basically<00:03:12.040> do<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.310> get<00:03:12.700> for

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
then all you basically do is get for

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.010 
then all you basically do is get for
each<00:03:13.420> again<00:03:13.800> put<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:14.950> wherever<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.520> want<00:03:15.580> it

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020

you<00:03:19.500> can<00:03:19.620> get<00:03:19.770> more<00:03:19.950> than<00:03:20.130> one<00:03:20.340> better<00:03:20.520> you<00:03:20.760> can

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
you can get more than one better you can

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.810 
you can get more than one better you can
get<00:03:21.030> four<00:03:21.300> bits<00:03:21.570> three<00:03:21.900> bits<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.470> date<00:03:22.820> i've

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
get four bits three bits to date i've

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.650 
get four bits three bits to date i've
cracked<00:03:24.240> a<00:03:24.420> little<00:03:24.450> bit

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.200 

I<00:03:27.750> did<00:03:28.470> with<00:03:28.620> four<00:03:29.400> bits<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.730> footage<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.410> have

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
introversion make it

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.250 
introversion make it
