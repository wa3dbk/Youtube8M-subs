00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.470
 This time at the beach 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:25.700
 We explain point when taking a picture 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:32.840
 The better the weather is sunny in short Well be better to say that because when you generally shoot 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:34.560
 The fact that it is often considered the wind does not mean that I if necessarily sunny that 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.050
 Is this video 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:42.059
 I think you understand 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.140
 Please take a look at this screen. This is an emmy coast in Kamogawa, Chiba Prefecture . 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.790
 It is usually in the sea so I can not approach 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:57.230
 I was able to approach and shoot because it was Hikkisou 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:59.390
 It is a situation, so the shape of this rock is quite interesting, so I put the state of this rock in the picture 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.100
 We are shooting by 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:09.000
 Here are 3 points 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:11.610
 There is a characteristic rock How to catch this rock and how it is most effective 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.470
 I will explain that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:21.390
 It is a first, we have focused somewhat 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:26.170
 You are the one who is here and the work taken with this focus is the next one 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.350
 It feels like this By long exposure 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:34.520
 I express the wave white 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:38.899
 I think it will be quite interesting atmosphere when shooting to this 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:44.960
 The way the clouds shake is a bit distinctive but it also 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:46.600
 The rocks are more emphasized The only thing that eliminates the splash of Rummy The rocks are very emphasized 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.430
 I think it will 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.790
 The shooting data is normal at 22 seconds and 30 seconds 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:01.730
 It is supposed to be almost standard lens 53 flight 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:05.390
 In order to achieve the shutter speed is about 52 funds are the next work we have 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:09.890
 Now let's look at a different perspective I just location is from here 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:15.380
 From here, this point is a bit of a brutal video with just this 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:20.480
 Here is the so little independent Shitaii I and to do You're point image is weak is 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.210
 I 'm going to entwining Here's a work I've got entwined here and here, and here 's two of these rocks . 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.040
 is 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.950
 It feels like this is standard It is slightly off the position from the previous position this 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.650
 It 's more like the one I just took 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.010
 It looks like you're approaching 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:41.900
 If it is this form, it will be a bit ordinary 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:46.300
 Because it is only that I made the rock like a bird's beak contrast 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:50.050
 Another point impact is said to be weak 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.200
 It will be because I put a purse wide-angle lens 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.820
 There is a way to try to aim 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:02.640
 Residents their So we here photos are taken with 243ds 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.670
 24mm aperture it is that 2030 seconds 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.260
 Is the next work 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.080
 I would like seeing a little while ago that Kikashi a little more path 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.110
 Iga town is good 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.340
 I'm expressing by taking a path at wide angle 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:25.660
 Clouds of the sky and an image of a rock that penetrates above 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.560
 And it is a work that I took as contrasting, so I put weight strongly on the right side of this 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.069
 doing 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:36.499
 And it has come out feeling selfishness that spend the texture of it it is by rock 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.999
 I 'm going to shoot this by exchanging this good so let 's see the next work 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:42.109
 I would like to ask 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:49.099
 Here's this Three these three 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:51.060
 This three-piece set is that you can not tangle it differently 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:56.790
 Is it to express it as a set? 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:04:01.410
 I thought about this &amp; here is moving the place to the left a little 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:04.090
 Is it young? It's here, but I can not see it now, but 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:09.170
 The two points are we're the earlier 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:12.170
 It will be the body here, so this city 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.650
 I'm shooting from above this rock 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.250
 This yo 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:21.840
 It will be in shape this than there is towards the black-and-white 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:27.419
 Although I am expressing in monochrome like this, I can shoot it because it is like this 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:33.320
 The texture of your east end is out and it's a high angle 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.320
 It is dotted in the sea so I think that the image of the rock is coming out very well 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.280
 I would like you to be a bit careful here a like this when there is light 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.900
 Certainly 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:49.870
 I use an umbrella like this to avoid the light entering the range 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.800
 Not blur it is so that it does not sell at the time of the so taken with the other one for a long time exposure wind 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.390
 Like 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.090
 I use an umbrella like this 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:04.530
 And the final work is here 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:09.690
 That say it is the whole of and has come out white of the more it is better here Why water 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:14.100
 The texture is also the overall feeling I think it has become calm 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.710
 This is one of the effects of long exposures . 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:21.840
 I think it will be useful if you can see it 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:25.320
 Here it is more that the fire in the state in which cloudy cloudy It is when Kage' little 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:30.960
 I'm taking a moment when the fire is in the sun 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.400
 Here is the state that correspondence is out, I can see the shadow here It is like this big sea 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.700
 I can see it but 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:41.210
 This shadow is an impression in the form of an impression of this rock 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:46.460
 Because I will see the form including this key that changes 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:54.680
 Like this , I think people who have no shadow feel more so-called texture 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:57.860
 Like this, it does not necessarily mean that people with light are good as photos 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.919
 Rather depending on the image of the photo 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.200
 Cloudy ones 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.150
 The 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.610
 It means that there is light in the sun, but this is the way it looks like 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.450
 It may be interesting 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:16.380
 When you take a picture, it is not necessarily 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:21.190
 When the weather is fine It's not good when it's sunny 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:25.060
 Depending on the image of the picture and the content of the picture you want to express 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:29.650
 Photos may live if there is no light 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:32.980
 Like this always when you take a picture 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.310
 State of light and image of work 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:39.210
 This image works fine 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:42.229
 I think a good Once you choose the combined beam 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.229
 Please try to reference
