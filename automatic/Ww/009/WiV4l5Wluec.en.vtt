00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
skin on but it's okay if you don't have

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.430 
skin on but it's okay if you don't have
the<00:00:53.489> skin<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.719> gives<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.110> little<00:00:55.230> bit

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the skin on it just gives a little bit

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.099 
the skin on it just gives a little bit
more<00:00:55.649> flavor<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:57.390> need<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:57.870> less<00:00:58.230> oil

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
more flavor and I need to use less oil

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.870 
more flavor and I need to use less oil
when<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.260> cooking<00:01:01.469> them<00:01:03.559> take<00:01:04.559> six<00:01:05.189> cloves<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
when I'm cooking them take six cloves of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.149 
when I'm cooking them take six cloves of
garlic<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.600> big<00:01:06.869> ones<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.290> small<00:01:07.350> ones<00:01:07.619> so

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
garlic I have big ones and small ones so

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.570 
garlic I have big ones and small ones so
I<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> round<00:01:09.630> 5<00:01:10.500> or<00:01:10.860> 6<00:01:11.189> normal

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
I think this is a round 5 or 6 normal

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.109 
I think this is a round 5 or 6 normal
one<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.880> cut<00:01:12.750> them<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:15.799> thinly<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:17.850> don't

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
one and cut them just thinly you don't

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.190 
one and cut them just thinly you don't
have<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:19.460> really<00:01:20.460> slice<00:01:20.909> them<00:01:21.210> very<00:01:21.240> much<00:01:21.840> or

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
have to really slice them very much or

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.140 
have to really slice them very much or
crush<00:01:22.770> them<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.729> cut<00:01:24.180> them<00:01:24.420> pretty<00:01:24.689> thin<00:01:26.150> do

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
crush them just cut them pretty thin do

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.289 
crush them just cut them pretty thin do
the<00:01:27.299> same<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.200> garlic<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:30.000> told

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the same to all the garlic as I told

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.950 
the same to all the garlic as I told
this<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:31.200> simple<00:01:31.890> flavored<00:01:32.549> chicken<00:01:33.000> but

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
this is very simple flavored chicken but

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.069 
this is very simple flavored chicken but
simplicity<00:01:34.680> makes<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.220> perfect<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.570> all<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
simplicity makes it's perfect so all the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.660 
simplicity makes it's perfect so all the
garlic<00:01:37.530> goes<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:39.049> white<00:01:40.049> pepper<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.860> much<00:01:41.280> more

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
garlic goes in white pepper is much more

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.780 
garlic goes in white pepper is much more
fragrant<00:01:42.509> than<00:01:42.750> black<00:01:43.649> pepper<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.310> less

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
fragrant than black pepper and less

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.910 
fragrant than black pepper and less
pungent<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:46.200> afford<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.649> put<00:01:46.860> a
