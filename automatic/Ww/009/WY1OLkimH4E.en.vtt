I found like this team is just so good
attacking<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.899> think<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.620> could<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.890> like

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
attacking that I think I could have like

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.319 
attacking that I think I could have like
an<00:00:41.219> average<00:00:41.460> defense<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> still<00:00:42.300> just

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
an average defense and I still just

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
an average defense and I still just
destroy<00:00:42.840> teams<00:00:43.110> because<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> attack<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.040> just

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
destroy teams because the attack is just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.600 
destroy teams because the attack is just
so<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.700> good<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:47.100> know<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.250> look<00:00:47.399> at<00:00:47.520> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
pretty much one of the best you can make

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.870 
pretty much one of the best you can make

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.640 
and I've seen these videos of people
like<00:02:27.209> oh<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.870> best<00:02:28.170> team<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.560> know

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
with the most 90 rolls I don't think

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.820 
with the most 90 rolls I don't think
that's<00:02:30.780> how<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:30.959> should<00:02:31.080> judge<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.650> best

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
that's how you should judge the best

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.250 
that's how you should judge the best
team<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.250> think<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.489> best<00:02:32.610> teams<00:02:32.819> would<00:02:32.970> be

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
team I think the best teams would be

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.360 
team I think the best teams would be
just<00:02:34.260> how<00:02:34.380> good<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.010> know<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.190> players

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
just how good it is you know the players

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.370 
just how good it is you know the players
