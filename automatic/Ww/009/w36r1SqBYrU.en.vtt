great I forget what their real

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.500 
great I forget what their real
maintenance<00:00:50.370> work<00:00:50.550> she's<00:00:50.940> got<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> router

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
maintenance work she's got the router

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.319

the<00:00:52.050> old<00:00:52.230> ones<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.010> browse<00:00:53.309> makes<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the old ones have a browse makes a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.520 
the old ones have a browse makes a
difference<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.870> don't<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.140> whether<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
difference I don't know whether the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.680 
difference I don't know whether the
weight<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.070> different<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.550> think<00:00:56.579> first<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.629> all

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
weight is different I think first of all

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.660 
weight is different I think first of all
definitely<00:00:58.020> cast<00:00:58.410> better<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.160> probably

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
definitely cast better and probably

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.569 
definitely cast better and probably
because<00:01:00.420> when<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.109> throw<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.890> rattles<00:01:02.340> go

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
because when you throw it the rattles go

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.759 
because when you throw it the rattles go
to<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> back<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.780> plug<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.470> may

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to the back of the plug and that may

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.600 
to the back of the plug and that may
affect<00:01:05.750> how<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.780> flies<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.920> definitely<00:01:08.310> cast

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
affect how it flies but definitely cast

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.300 
affect how it flies but definitely cast
better<00:01:09.470> put<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.590> way<00:01:10.740> since<00:01:10.950> they<00:01:11.040> came<00:01:11.189> out

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
better put this way since they came out

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.679 
better put this way since they came out
with<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> rounds<00:01:11.850> now<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.090> ones<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.479> have
