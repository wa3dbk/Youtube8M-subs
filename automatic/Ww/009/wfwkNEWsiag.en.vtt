 mar 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.130
 Yes, let's introduce today's shooting equipment 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:43.750
 All that day will be Big Raw Equipment today 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:52.500
 First of all, Kyoto is vid 70s 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:55.680
 Moss is a 70 mm telescope and perhaps the smallest among Bixen's currently sold telescopes 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:03.000
 I think apochromatic lens barrel 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:05.509
 Well, even if you put in a pro-mart , maybe it's probably the best except for the 50 360 telescopes for beginners. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.479
 I think that one small Nja no 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.570
 Older people are not guide mirrors 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.620
 It looks very large but this is the finder 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.470
 It is 7 times 50mm finder 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.680
 This is 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.500
 A lively baby race day to the flip mirror I got 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.930
 10mm above 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:34.640
 Nu npl of 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:39.700
 Now with an eyepiece that doubles the barrow and 10mm to 400mm telescope 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.700
 So you can observe it at 80 times 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:48.320
 A low magnification process as introduced here 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:53.450
 I am wearing a 26mm eyepiece 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:59.430
 This eyepiece may be very nostalgic 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.950
 Today's shooting camera I bought at the time of my child 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:08.610
 Actually it is a smartphone 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.000
 I'm thinking of pushing the lens of the smartphone to the berth line like this and shooting 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.130
 I will 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.130
 Perhaps 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.000
 But I think that one is not fished pattern 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:23.550
 I think I'm going to fish four large wooden satellites 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.110
 I do not understand this unless I go for a while and the task is always with me 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:31.970
 sxd 2 will be equatorial 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:38.540
 It now in Vixen equipment all Well it is today in the So 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:42.280
 I do not have separately to the baptism of Ms. Vixen but Well this 4 to that or feel free to shoot 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.280
 I want to do 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:53.430
 That's home first 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.430
 I would like to see the planet with my eyes and then shoot with my smartphone 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.840
 eb 70 ss is Miyaji 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:16.140
 The scene is only 70 mm with a very small telescope 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:19.010
 I'm very cheery and I can see clearly 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.690
 Of course there are those two lines 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:28.340
 Some of the muscle 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.340
 Well, I wonder if I say there is also Well of like a yo also something with another person that 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.920
 Achromatic confluence busty not sharp 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.410
 Yes I think that I want to shoot with this smartphone 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:50.280
 Yes, it's just past 10:20 but now Jupiter is just an adult 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:57.300
 I just turned up the telescope and it just disappeared 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:00.259
 I 'm going to go once because the inversion of the telescope will move if you make a big one here 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.259
 I will go 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.670
 me 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.670
 me 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.630
 Pre- cat impression is not changed
