00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.630
 hello everyone with you dess us mod 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.500
 which adds new visuals 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:20.440
 effects in the game it's hard to explain it on 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.630
 in words let's take a better look at everything 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.160
 features all the innovations of this mod 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.480
 let's start with the weather are added new 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.580
 effects when we are in 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.440
 specific biarmy 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.440
 let's fly some biome 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.410
 for example, see the beach, we see before 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.110
 a sand 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.540
 look we are inferior by run and on 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.330
 grains of sand appear on the screen 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.070
 the most real grains of sand but not cool 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.280
 Do it look like it does not appear directly 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.370
 It appears as we walk on the sand with 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.690
 by time they disappear it altogether 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.690
 deserve special praise when we 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.409
 press f1 all this is done let's 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.530
 crawled into the water and now we see different 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.920
 bubbles on our screen i.e. particles 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.290
 water is also present in this fashion too 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.520
 not over time are cleaned as well as 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:20.560
 sand is very cool on let's 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:26.229
 try to climb into the lava and so gravel 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.750
 we put it like this well and now we have 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.390
 ash particles appeared on our screen 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.710
 when we burn too pretty cool and 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.759
 and when we have little HP 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.460
 our screen starts flashing red 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.920
 put peaceful burned all the same 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.869
 but it does not matter here we have already appeared 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.390
 let's try again to fall into the lava 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:51.670
 only now until the end not die but 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.380
 it's better to provide lava in hand and so 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.210
 put lava 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.180
 climb not and leave immediately see again 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.530
 sit ashes on our screen set 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.570
 let's normal 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.229
 I'm back to lava because small 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.479
 dreamed and now see our screen 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.869
 blinking red when we have a little hp 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.540
 just takes and blinks see straight 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.239
 awesome truth sometimes happens over glitches 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.400
 such an example here is what a stain 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.239
 stupid was such a square 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.190
 was clearly visible but nevertheless this 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.570
 mod deserves special praise and he 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.170
 very cool was a similar mod on the same 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.350
 subject matter 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.230
 changed animations mobs remember were 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.670
 hidden that twisted their paws 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.400
 I remember that interman and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.799
 zombie skeletons that just moved 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.360
 hands that is, pull the string 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:51.880
 straight fist hit them in the face and so 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.090
 further but it adds new visuals 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.750
 effects are not animation but theme is similar 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.459
 by the way look we fell from a height and 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.730
 we have blood on the screen 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.130
 there is no need to fall it will hurt and 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.340
 we take damage and see before us 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.540
 blood the more damage the more 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.579
 blood we will see on my screen stayed 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.989
 only snow but I will not show you 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.549
 because I scrape 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:23.350
 look for the snow biome here for a long time but what 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.390
 he adds the same as lava 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.090
 only instead of black particles will be white 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.760
 here is a little variety after all 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.630
 present here but still not 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.989
 The version of the mod is clear but clear 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:41.680
 0.2.0 so I think it is clear we go further 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:45.370
 see a skeleton in front of you also take 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.450
 a sword to defend us and here it is in us 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.520
 shoots now we see blood and 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.709
 such a crack on the screen that is pretty 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.750
 cool it all looks and she 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.640
 shoots many times and cracks more 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.400
 and more it becomes in time 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.280
 disappear 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.680
 also considers blood and we attack the skeleton 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.269
 with the help of any weapon and we have on 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.670
 blood appears on the screen too 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.310
 cool as well if such a sheep 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.840
 there will be blood that means that we 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.329
 sprinkle ourselves with blood when 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.250
 and such a sheep somewhere to them with fists 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.270
 nothing happens as you see 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.150
 just with any weapon and that's pretty 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.040
 cool we are such a zombie we see before 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.960
 a blood and such new effects in the form of 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.050
 brains do not know what is really 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.790
 but such red spots appear in 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.860
 us on the screen 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.810
 when we are such it is exactly a zombie by the way 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.030
 please note that the texture of the swords 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.720
 changed and the stronger will be 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.180
 damage to swords will be worse 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.490
 texture that is, look now 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.620
 the texture is such that our ball is just 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.680
 a bit battered are such black 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.960
 you will see the specks on the sword 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.600
 we can spend it completely and from 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.820
 the sword is almost nothing left 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.210
 ok let's try to make 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.520
 enderman and look at him look and 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.770
 as in a slender 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.440
 pure as in a slender but I became absolutely 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.210
 a little bit let's take any way he 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.650
 that is, potions throw it under you and 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.539
 see what a cool effect we have 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.669
 were but not very cool but 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.330
 really cool look right 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:28.360
 the same effect just happened 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.760
 now green and see 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.010
 new particles appear on the screen then 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.510
 I don't know what it is without having any 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.010
 the slightest idea is that 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.180
 happens at an hour on the screen some 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:43.750
 green specks appear and here dates 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.270
 pretty cool too mod to me 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.100
 really liked and what remains but 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.580
 but nothing else can be included in 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.060
 config 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.000
 such a function that we will open 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.500
 hands and we will have such 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.770
 particles with blood particles being 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.210
 others are not as usual on the screen exactly 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.600
 when we will attack with a fist that is 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.470
 as if 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.590
 but let's fist hurt us blood all 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.270
