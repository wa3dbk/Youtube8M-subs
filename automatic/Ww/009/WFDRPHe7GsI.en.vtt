dripping in my my regular automatic
betters<00:02:37.420> because<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:38.290> don't<00:02:38.410> want<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.590> get

betters because you don't want to get

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.250 
betters because you don't want to get
that<00:02:38.860> switch<00:02:39.160> stock<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.730> know<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.930> stuck

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
that switch stock you know and be stuck

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.839 
that switch stock you know and be stuck
with<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> dead<00:02:41.770> battery<00:02:41.980> just<00:02:42.520> for<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.700> dumb

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
with a dead battery just for a dumb

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.030 
with a dead battery just for a dumb
reason<00:02:42.880> but<00:02:43.420> yeah<00:02:44.170> that's<00:02:44.530> why<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.709> like<00:02:44.769> these

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
reason but yeah that's why I like these

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.650 
reason but yeah that's why I like these
sealed<00:02:45.340> ones<00:02:45.580> especially<00:02:46.150> when<00:02:46.540> you're

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
sealed ones especially when you're

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.020 
sealed ones especially when you're
refilling<00:02:46.900> cartomizers<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.760> know<00:02:48.849> your

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
refilling cartomizers to you know your

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.449 
refilling cartomizers to you know your
fill<00:02:49.300> them<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.690> so<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.769> get<00:02:50.860> too<00:02:51.010> much<00:02:51.160> juice

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
fill them and so you get too much juice

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.470 
fill them and so you get too much juice
in<00:02:51.610> there<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.819> don't<00:02:51.970> have<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.150> worry<00:02:52.360> about

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
in there you don't have to worry about

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.880 
in there you don't have to worry about
it<00:02:52.690> as<00:02:52.810> much<00:02:52.840> with<00:02:53.230> these<00:02:53.410> ones<00:02:53.650> because

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
it as much with these ones because

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.780 
it as much with these ones because
you're<00:02:54.640> not<00:02:54.790> going<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.000> ruin<00:02:55.150> your<00:02:55.269> battery<00:02:55.690> so

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
you're not going to ruin your battery so

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.250 
you're not going to ruin your battery so
definitely<00:02:57.790> want<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.060> clean<00:02:58.300> cartomizer<00:02:58.900> but

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
definitely want to clean cartomizer but

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.460 
definitely want to clean cartomizer but
you<00:02:59.470> can't<00:02:59.709> always<00:02:59.920> be<00:03:00.370> saved<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.870> works

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
you can't always be saved so that works

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.949 
you can't always be saved so that works
