it's a little pat pattern to show you

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.609 
it's a little pat pattern to show you
here<00:01:05.980> is<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.340> when<00:01:06.820> we<00:01:07.000> do<00:01:07.210> this<00:01:07.480> what<00:01:08.260> we<00:01:08.440> can

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
here is that when we do this what we can

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.580 
here is that when we do this what we can
see<00:01:08.860> here<00:01:09.160> as<00:01:09.550> far<00:01:09.820> as<00:01:09.880> only<00:01:10.300> ultrasound<00:01:10.990> is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
see here as far as only ultrasound is

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.040 
see here as far as only ultrasound is
that<00:01:11.830> I<00:01:11.860> can<00:01:12.160> move<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:13.360> I<00:01:13.479> can<00:01:13.660> see<00:01:13.840> where

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
that I can move it and I can see where

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.230 
that I can move it and I can see where
the<00:01:14.229> bone<00:01:14.530> is<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.340> so<00:01:15.610> I<00:01:15.640> want<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:15.940> know<00:01:16.060> that

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
the bone is and so I want to know that

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.770 
the bone is and so I want to know that
I'm<00:01:16.360> staying<00:01:16.600> above<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:17.260> so<00:01:18.100> it<00:01:18.610> just<00:01:18.970> it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
I'm staying above that so it just it

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.840 
I'm staying above that so it just it
gives<00:01:20.170> us<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:20.560> depth<00:01:20.920> that<00:01:21.160> we<00:01:21.310> know<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:21.670> here

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
gives us a depth that we know that here

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.560 
gives us a depth that we know that here
in<00:01:22.240> what<00:01:22.510> we<00:01:22.660> want<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.990> be<00:01:23.140> okay<00:01:24.240> engine<00:01:25.240> starts

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
in what we want to be okay engine starts

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.390 
in what we want to be okay engine starts
to<00:01:25.690> fire<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:26.170> can<00:01:26.320> also<00:01:26.470> watch<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.890> screen

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
to fire you can also watch the screen

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.600 
to fire you can also watch the screen
here<00:01:27.729> but<00:01:28.600> now<00:01:29.560> what<00:01:29.740> we're<00:01:29.920> doing<00:01:29.950> as<00:01:30.250> far<00:01:30.280> as

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
here but now what we're doing as far as

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.550 
here but now what we're doing as far as
we've<00:01:30.820> applied<00:01:31.150> our<00:01:31.210> ultrasound<00:01:31.840> gel<00:01:32.140> so<00:01:32.470> we

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
we've applied our ultrasound gel so we

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:46.880 
we've applied our ultrasound gel so we
make<00:01:32.740> contact<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:33.580> then<00:01:34.360> we're<00:01:34.570> going<00:01:34.780> to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.790 

we're<00:01:47.310> looking<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.730> do<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.060> two<00:01:48.990> things<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.470> is

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
we're looking to do is two things one is

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.280 
we're looking to do is two things one is
to<00:01:49.830> contract<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.850> tissue<00:01:51.120> that<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.750> skin<00:01:52.140> is

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
to contract the tissue that the skin is

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.650 
to contract the tissue that the skin is
here's<00:01:52.530> two<00:01:52.800> if<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.400> give<00:01:53.580> us<00:01:53.730> lifting<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
here's two if you give us lifting and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.940 
here's two if you give us lifting and
that<00:01:54.810> wasn't<00:01:54.960> what<00:01:55.080> Mike<00:01:55.290> was<00:01:55.500> talking<00:01:55.680> about

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that wasn't what Mike was talking about

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.270 
that wasn't what Mike was talking about
that<00:01:56.280> quitting<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.480> this<00:01:57.750> lifts<00:01:58.230> up<00:01:58.470> then

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
that quitting and this lifts up then

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.400 
that quitting and this lifts up then
that<00:01:59.520> helps<00:01:59.760> to<00:01:59.850> open<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.660> here<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.260> that

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
that helps to open this up here and that

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.680 
that helps to open this up here and that
upper<00:02:01.770> eyelid<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.820> other<00:02:02.970> thing<00:02:03.270> though<00:02:03.480> is

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
upper eyelid the other thing though is

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.730 
upper eyelid the other thing though is
what<00:02:03.900> you're<00:02:04.080> doing<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.440> you're<00:02:04.590> actually

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
what you're doing is you're actually

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.120 
what you're doing is you're actually
remodeling<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.850> skin<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.900> as<00:02:07.350> you're<00:02:07.740> doing

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
remodeling the skin so as you're doing

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.390 
remodeling the skin so as you're doing
the<00:02:09.060> Altera<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.050> causing<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.619> heat<00:02:11.070> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the Altera it is causing that heat to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.790 
the Altera it is causing that heat to
the<00:02:11.520> tissue<00:02:11.790> which<00:02:12.630> will<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:13.170> cause<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the tissue which will then cause the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.250 
the tissue which will then cause the
skin<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.270> remodel<00:02:15.270> it'll<00:02:15.510> say<00:02:15.660> hey<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.840> need<00:02:16.140> to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
skin to remodel it'll say hey I need to

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.590 
skin to remodel it'll say hey I need to
rebuild<00:02:16.620> more<00:02:16.920> collagen<00:02:17.460> more<00:02:17.790> elastin<00:02:18.120> and

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
rebuild more collagen more elastin and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.900 
rebuild more collagen more elastin and
so<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.590> will<00:02:19.740> actually<00:02:19.920> help<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.610> tissue

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
so that will actually help that tissue

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.780 
so that will actually help that tissue
to<00:02:21.240> help<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.630> improve<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.770> you'll<00:02:23.070> get<00:02:23.280> less

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
to help to improve and you'll get less

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.180 
to help to improve and you'll get less
wrinkled<00:02:24.390> fine<00:02:24.570> lines<00:02:24.810> wrinkles<00:02:25.050> it'll<00:02:26.040> help

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
wrinkled fine lines wrinkles it'll help

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.610 
wrinkled fine lines wrinkles it'll help
to<00:02:26.370> improve<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.970> as<00:02:27.150> well<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.320> improves

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
to improve that as well so it improves
