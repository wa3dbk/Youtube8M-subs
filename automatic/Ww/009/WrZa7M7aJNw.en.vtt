00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
continued to go a little bit flat so

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.240 
continued to go a little bit flat so
your<00:02:57.140> ear<00:02:57.680> gets<00:02:57.920> better<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.940> even<00:02:59.180> want<00:02:59.360> to

guitar<00:03:08.350> there's<00:03:09.350> no<00:03:09.500> problem<00:03:09.890> it's<00:03:10.220> usually

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
guitar there's no problem it's usually

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.000 
guitar there's no problem it's usually
right<00:03:10.700> into<00:03:11.030> okay<00:03:11.990> a<00:03:12.200> something<00:03:12.680> comes<00:03:12.890> in

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
right into okay a something comes in

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.430 
right into okay a something comes in
with<00:03:13.100> a<00:03:13.160> high<00:03:13.340> G<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.000> would<00:03:14.240> be<00:03:14.390> G<00:03:15.290> on<00:03:15.680> the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
with a high G so that would be G on the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.870 
with a high G so that would be G on the
C<00:03:18.440> note<00:03:18.710> bending<00:03:19.100> up<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.400> D<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:21.670> guess<00:03:22.670> that's

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
C note bending up to D I guess that's

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.130 
C note bending up to D I guess that's
the<00:03:23.000> 17th<00:03:23.570> fret<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.090> B<00:03:26.240> strings<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.720> 15th

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
the 17th fret and the B strings of 15th

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.370 
the 17th fret and the B strings of 15th
fret<00:03:28.540> okay<00:03:29.540> we've<00:03:29.780> got<00:03:29.900> two<00:03:30.050> guitar<00:03:30.350> players

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
fret okay we've got two guitar players

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.590 
fret okay we've got two guitar players
to<00:03:30.920> play<00:03:31.070> like<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:31.430> play<00:03:31.670> if<00:03:32.270> you're<00:03:32.510> only

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
to play like this play if you're only

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.240 
to play like this play if you're only
one<00:03:32.870> person<00:03:33.380> then<00:03:33.590> my<00:03:34.340> my<00:03:34.970> guess<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.680> these<00:03:36.680> are

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
one person then my my guess is these are

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.350 
one person then my my guess is these are
doing<00:03:37.490> with<00:03:37.580> Les<00:03:37.730> Paul<00:03:37.940> which<00:03:38.120> all<00:03:38.270> the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
doing with Les Paul which all the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.940 
doing with Les Paul which all the
strings<00:03:38.570> are<00:03:38.690> broken<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.020> than<00:03:39.410> those<00:03:39.560> months

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950
