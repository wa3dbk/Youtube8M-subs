so<00:00:58.149> there's<00:00:58.360> our<00:00:58.539> foundation<00:00:59.320> chain<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:01.180> with

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
so there's our foundation chain now with

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.389 
so there's our foundation chain now with
the<00:01:01.780> first<00:01:02.019> row<00:01:02.350> when<00:01:02.620> you're<00:01:02.800> going<00:01:03.100> into<00:01:03.250> the

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.290 
those three chains that we've left
they're<00:01:41.560> basically<00:01:42.460> just<00:01:42.640> brings<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.119> work

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
they're basically just brings the work

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.149 
they're basically just brings the work
up<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.750> height<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.200> that<00:01:44.229> we<00:01:44.470> can<00:01:44.740> make<00:01:44.979> the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
up to the height so that we can make the

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.820 
up to the height so that we can make the
height<00:01:45.429> of<00:01:45.670> this<00:01:45.940> stitch<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.720> that<00:01:47.289> is<00:01:47.470> also

height of this stitch and that is also

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.850 
height of this stitch and that is also
counted<00:01:48.130> as<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.819> stitch<00:01:49.509> when<00:01:49.899> we<00:01:50.110> come<00:01:50.440> back<00:01:50.649> on
