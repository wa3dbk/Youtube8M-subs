to<00:01:35.610> get<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> 4<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.810> said<00:01:37.579> now<00:01:38.579> ammo<00:01:39.090> its

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
to get a 4 like I said now ammo its

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.740 
to get a 4 like I said now ammo its
standard<00:01:39.689> 30<00:01:40.350> out<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.680> 90<00:01:41.210> most<00:01:42.210> assault

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
standard 30 out of 90 most assault

standard 30 out of 90 most assault
rifles<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
rifles have this so it's going to get a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.240 
rifles have this so it's going to get a
3<00:01:44.549> an<00:01:44.640> average<00:01:45.090> since<00:01:45.420> most<00:01:46.140> assault<00:01:46.829> rifles

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
3 an average since most assault rifles

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.039 
3 an average since most assault rifles
how<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.640> ammo<00:01:48.439> that's<00:01:49.439> what<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:49.880> sayin<00:01:51.049> not

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
how this ammo that's what I'm sayin not

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.609 
how this ammo that's what I'm sayin not
taking<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.500> back<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.659> add<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.439> all<00:01:55.470> up

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
taking it back so if you add that all up

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.130 
taking it back so if you add that all up
in<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.250> head<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> 17<00:01:58.020> out
