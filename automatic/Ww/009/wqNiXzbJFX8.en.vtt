how<00:00:34.860> good<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.370> shader<00:00:35.579> actually<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.420> looks

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
how good the shader actually it looks

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.090 
how good the shader actually it looks
when<00:00:36.780> used<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.079> its<00:00:37.110> maximum<00:00:37.410> potential<00:00:37.860> as

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
when used to its maximum potential as

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.979 
when used to its maximum potential as
you<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.309> see<00:00:38.489> these<00:00:38.969> shadows<00:00:39.450> are<00:00:39.660> really

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
you can see these shadows are really

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.660 
you can see these shadows are really
nice<00:00:40.140> all<00:00:40.320> didn't<00:00:40.620> blocky<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.250> know<00:00:41.399> it's

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
nice all didn't blocky but you know it's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.709 
nice all didn't blocky but you know it's
pocket<00:00:42.030> issue<00:00:42.120> doesn't<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
pocket issue doesn't really have the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.619 
pocket issue doesn't really have the
best<00:00:43.050> um<00:00:43.260> shading<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.460> am<00:00:44.670> using<00:00:44.940> an<00:00:45.090> iPad<00:00:45.420> 2

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
best um shading and I am using an iPad 2

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
best um shading and I am using an iPad 2
so<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.989> will<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> little<00:00:46.710> bit<00:00:46.920> laggy<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.640> you

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
so it will be a little bit laggy but you

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.660 
so it will be a little bit laggy but you
know<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.960> newer<00:00:49.140> end<00:00:49.469> devices<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.280> anything

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
know for newer end devices of anything

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.010 
know for newer end devices of anything
above<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.090> iPad<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.510> think<00:00:51.600> should<00:00:51.960> be

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
above your iPad you I think should be

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.930 
above your iPad you I think should be
able<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> handle<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.710> quite<00:00:53.100> nicely<00:00:53.129> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
able to handle this quite nicely and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.270 
able to handle this quite nicely and
really<00:00:54.750> perfectly<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.190> just

recommend amusing this was actually see
how<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.229> sting<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> lowest

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
how the sting was like with the lowest

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.980 
how the sting was like with the lowest
brightest<00:01:08.970> settings<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.689> actually

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
brightest settings because it actually

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.840
