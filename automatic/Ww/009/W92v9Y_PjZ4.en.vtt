00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.500
 hi everyone is nice I 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.370
 come back very quickly to make a 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.340
 small hall 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.839
 because on tuesday I went to auchan to 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.490
 louvroil so in France 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.029
 I went to France for once 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.800
 to go to who co I offered a 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.660
 little hold really super fast I 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 mainly bought that polish and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.650
 I bought bathroom showers at 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.789
 therefore auhanhan the sides of because 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.410
 belgium we do not really find 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.579
 so I'll start without delay 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.579
 parship so I bought myself at 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:47.039
 3-6 6-7 nail polish from nikko because 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.879
 the promo moment is the varnish 2 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.520
 euros 50 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.780
 I am bought cadbury in the collection 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.690
 permed 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.030
 I bought this pink beige very 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.020
 pale really super pretty i love this 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.750
 color I was looking for a long time 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.820
 but this one I said to myself very euros 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.150
 for a banal varnish like that I did not 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.380
 not want and that the 372 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.119
 so here are two euros fifty as I 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.280
 wanted to say then I took a 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.420
 fuchsia pink like this weirdly 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.000
 it's the most banal color in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.590
 polish finally that I find and I do not 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.900
 had it over so I redeemed myself and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.189
 it's number 2 189 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.210
 I'm there I see really sure 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.369
 because of two feet to go in 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.420
 vacation and the last in the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.250
 permanent collection 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.770
 it's a duck blue like these but 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.540
 with some turquoise reflections 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.869
 frankly she is super nice ever 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.360
 seen that kind of colors and lives alone at 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.509
 387 so here's to know that varnishes that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.150
 like me I love and the last in the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.869
 permanent range so it's a 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.700
 Ultra long base are expensive here 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.009
 finally I needed a base or that 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.229
 I took advantage that this year 0 50 and 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.670
 she is like this 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.130
 so here are the days here enough a 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.729
 hardener actually and that's the nails 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.190
 longer 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.840
 and to finish 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.780
 and three other varnishes in the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.150
 schoder maths collection i arrived 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.710
 at the checkout and events done at the mount 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.850
 god they're just too good way of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.110
 colors really not pretty but 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.180
 frankly there I really cracked on 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.070
 this song there so first of all there is 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.840
 this beautiful glass of water really 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.510
 sublime to tell them will just be 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.100
 too pretty so that of 636 and this one 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.900
 it's the match I mean there is 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.420
 no glitter nor split and I'm 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.180
 really too eager to wear it so 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.740
 here and then two not really been 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.840
 sublime what are the favorites 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.510
 pastel orange cassette with 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.110
 golden glitter in it's just 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.060
 sublime 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.620
 so here I was really in a hurry to 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.700
 test this texture i'm hardly maths 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.560
 we'll see and this one these numbers 639 and 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.000
 to finish my favorite 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.620
 frankly my favorite is a 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.230
 black with silver glitter 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.630
 he looks just sublime and salim number 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.820
 646 so I think it's this one 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.960
 that I will try right after so 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.570
 here I am really very happy 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.070
 I did not buy much and I just 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:03.080
 bought a pencil beast for the eyes he 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.959
 was also two euros fifty he me 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.680
 seems and it's a pencil beast I know 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.300
 not what are these smart hype pencil etc 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.150
 this to two euros fifty and I beg them 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.080
 in size in size in shades wissant 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.250
 12 years is the reverse and for the swatch 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.360
 that's what it gives because these days 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.650
 I really like making a rat poison 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.200
 lower than this color there 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.850
 so here I said to myself 0.50 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.130
 it costs nothing and I'm done 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.530
 with the shower gels sides of the young 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.300
 man I bought at auchan including 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.580
 I bought myself 4 because the others 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.080
 by the way, never not so first 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.519
 am taking the strawberry and the 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.450
 mint 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.370
 frankly it just seems like romance 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.989
 had a bush 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.250
 I really love there really is super 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.750
 fresh and we really feel both 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.510
 authors in the shower so this one 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.150
 then I took the one at the corner and 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.140
 the basket makers so basically with pear and 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.240
 I love it I love it really smells like a bounce 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.790
 end all light soft side 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.580
 are super good so that's it for that one 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.320
 and two darlings and one that I had 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.120
 never tried in vain first of all the 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.160
 caramel that everyone knows for 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.350
 me it's their best sellers and it's 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.630
 the one I prefer 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.400
 he really feels just too good so 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.180
 this is the fourth one 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.800
 once the redeemer 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.450
 and finally it's a new 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.700
 belt I had never seen this is the 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.620
 liquorice milk so like these and 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.190
 they are really good 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.900
 really licorice is pretty special 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.130
 but I do not think that my dan and 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.750
 frankly I love it changes 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.090
 really all the beasts twenty two 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.330
 convoys in store and so here it is 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.470
 was around between 2 and 3 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.440
 euros but not more than three euros 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.820
 so that's for my small purchases in 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.410
 francs as I told you that 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.750
