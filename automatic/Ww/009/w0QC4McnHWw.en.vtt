the way that you want it okay so my
carrots<00:02:04.320> are<00:02:04.500> steaming<00:02:05.070> away<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:06.299> juice

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
carrots are steaming away the juice

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.469 
carrots are steaming away the juice
or<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.950> water<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.399> liquid<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.880> coming<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
or the water the liquid is coming to the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.960 
or the water the liquid is coming to the
bottom<00:02:09.810> now<00:02:10.259> with<00:02:10.619> carrots<00:02:11.100> you<00:02:11.400> do<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.700> want

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
bottom now with carrots you do not want

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.750 
bottom now with carrots you do not want
to<00:02:12.030> save<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.360> liquid<00:02:13.550> because<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
to save this liquid because of the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.660 
to save this liquid because of the
nitrates<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.480> when<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.170> mix<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.069> together<00:02:17.220> I'm

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
nitrates so when I mix it together I'm

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.990 
nitrates so when I mix it together I'm
just<00:02:17.730> gonna<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.090> using<00:02:18.209> formula<00:02:19.670> okay<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
just gonna be using formula okay so the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.640 
just gonna be using formula okay so the
indicator<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.540> went<00:02:22.020> off<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:22.319> I'm<00:02:22.380> gonna<00:02:22.470> go

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
indicator just went off so I'm gonna go

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.680 
indicator just went off so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.860> turn<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.190> off<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:24.270> let<00:02:24.390> me<00:02:24.480> open

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
ahead and turn that off and let me open

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.420 
ahead and turn that off and let me open
this<00:02:24.930> really<00:02:25.230> quick<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.770> check<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.070> see

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
this really quick just to check to see

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.430 
this really quick just to check to see
if<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.240> soft<00:02:29.300> careful<00:02:30.300> cuz<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:30.840> really

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
if it is soft careful cuz it's really

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.729 
if it is soft careful cuz it's really
high<00:02:31.650> when<00:02:32.010> you're<00:02:32.330> dealing<00:02:33.330> with<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.620> it

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
high when you're dealing with this so it

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.430 
high when you're dealing with this so it
is<00:02:34.860> really<00:02:35.640> really<00:02:35.850> soft<00:02:36.120> as<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.450> can<00:02:36.600> see<00:02:36.870> so

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
is really really soft as you can see so

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.809 
is really really soft as you can see so
I'm<00:02:37.530> gonna<00:02:37.650> go<00:02:37.860> ahead<00:02:37.980> take<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.430> out<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.640> steam

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
I'm gonna go ahead take it out of steam

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.630 
I'm gonna go ahead take it out of steam
basket<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.450> put<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.840> into<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:41.010> part<00:02:41.370> down

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
basket and put it into this part down

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.100 
basket and put it into this part down
here<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.150> I'm<00:02:42.239> gonna<00:02:42.360> take<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> liquid<00:02:42.870> out

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
here and I'm gonna take a liquid out

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.400

because like I've said that has full of

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.720 
because like I've said that has full of
nitrates<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:46.950> that's<00:02:47.130> not<00:02:47.310> good<00:02:47.519> for<00:02:47.640> your

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
nitrates and that's not good for your

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.410 
nitrates and that's not good for your
baby<00:02:48.209> so<00:02:49.050> I'm<00:02:49.110> gonna<00:02:49.200> go<00:02:49.320> ahead<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.530> do<00:02:49.920> that

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
okay so now it is in a food processor

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.070 
okay so now it is in a food processor
part<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.590> took<00:02:55.800> out<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.070> liquids<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:57.080> are

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
part and I took out the liquids you are

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.560 
part and I took out the liquids you are
just<00:02:58.260> gonna<00:02:58.380> want<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.709> use<00:02:58.830> fresh<00:02:59.130> milk<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.730> or

just gonna want to use fresh milk and or

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.080 
just gonna want to use fresh milk and or
formula<00:03:01.140> until<00:03:01.950> your<00:03:02.280> baby's<00:03:02.519> old<00:03:02.700> enough<00:03:02.940> I

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
formula until your baby's old enough I

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.330

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
think they say six months they should be

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.180 
think they say six months they should be
fine<00:03:05.580> but<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.600> would<00:03:07.500> still<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.950> little<00:03:08.100> bit

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
fine but I would still be a little bit

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.920 
fine but I would still be a little bit
cautious<00:03:08.400> over<00:03:08.850> six<00:03:09.300> months<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.630> little<00:03:09.720> bit

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
cautious over six months a little bit

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.420 
cautious over six months a little bit
but<00:03:10.170> at<00:03:10.290> least<00:03:10.410> by<00:03:10.590> eight<00:03:10.769> months<00:03:11.070> it's<00:03:11.220> fine

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
but at least by eight months it's fine

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.259 
but at least by eight months it's fine
to<00:03:11.820> keep<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.769> teeth<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.920> nitrates<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.489> I'm

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269
