00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.459
 audition where are we 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:18.150
 the barthe-de-neste with the heroes of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.460
 mitsubishi bernard and philippe you 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.140
 do not have your toques I am very disappointed 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.240
 it's a little hot yes 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.759
 why the mitsubishi colt said 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.070
 bend over for the bored crc there's a 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.529
 little what needs to talk is more talkative 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.720
 it's a bit the Oise went around to 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.360
 we knew that the course was going 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.250
 to be quite mountainous and so you had to 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.860
 that we find a car fast enough and 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.989
 7000 to the rich there sticks she has a 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.030
 particularity is there she has a 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.079
 particularity is that to the one box 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.750
 visitors 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.550
 so there are four short reports and 4 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.190
 long reports that can be passed from 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.100
 indifferently how is there viewty ya 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.660
 a small lever or next to the lever of 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.430
 normal speed there is another there is a 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.739
 second lever so here and a position 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.080
 economy and there is the power position 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.430
 it was great we are very very good 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.350
 beaten explained I understood nothing but 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.720
 you say that plays on wii that's it 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.640
 do that it changes the link and that that 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.560
 add a couple a conical couple in 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.970
 exit from box and sade and multiply the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.140
 number of speed actually already there is a 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.080
 grilling gear range and its 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.820
 choice is very effective in the mountains 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.590
 so has short reports and in fact one 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.640
 can use the performance of the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.260
 way mountain car 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.760
 importantly what's the 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.280
 car and young people does that 70 thing 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.530
 I 'm shocked, we can see what 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.790
 rennais blow and that's it and as it is 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.110
 very light she went quite fast 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.140
 montlaur after the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.510
 the chassis is a little more perfectible 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.830
 that the honda of bernard that was 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.390
 much finer and much more 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.670
 rigid and had the best shot of 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.080
 new but so far it's another 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.780
 sequence and vincent ball why this 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.460
 history of double gearbox has 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.840
 not taken why we do not have this test 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.460
 to be expensive I think it had to 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.080
 expensive at the time and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.490
 visibly it's reliable it's a 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.229
 mechanical system it's mechanical 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.760
 Advanced electronics of pignan norris 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.800
 is not even an overdrive enough of the 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.660
 spyder of red you follow you 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:14.130
 intervenes at bagnols cc this is his period 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.100
 horrible opinions and pushed tax game to 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.610
 the alain griguer as at 0 and there since 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.750
 mitsubishi it's lisa niemi j mitsubishi 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.120
 manufactured an aircraft manufacturer 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.709
 also is good for us the decor 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.590
 it came naturally we recovered 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.150
 a car that was gray and then we 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.120
 know we are ten good in vichy weather 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.720
 gray car bah here at bittou bichi 0 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.370
 it has come 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.080
 it came like this is made 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.310
 little driver points here one by one 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.790
 sticker here are the details 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.790
 sometimes you spent three weeks 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.790
 85 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.260
 what is he who has them 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.310
 made in the final at the drill of 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.140
 office and we put several cases you 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.890
 yeah yes you'll make me the finish 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.130
 of the car 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.840
 blake fallen to 65 years be it is laid 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.820
 you're going to do that and intends to worship 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.670
 you want but not because you 're going 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.560
 you're pretty cool at my 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.360
 great surprise yes well go go 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.160
 really in very good used condition ago 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.630
 had no particular flaws 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.700
 there were tires we changed the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.700
 tires were handed over sovereigns who 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.990
 was a little more performant the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.310
 emptying we changed the cross 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.720
 dissolution which apparently has it 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.570
 had matched their guards so 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.150
 to make the whole thing more reliable on a route 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.290
 all in all quite difficult for the tour 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.070
 in turn this year 300 m3 or eagle 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.140
 and as it is a wealth 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.180
 we shared because renÃ©e associates 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.250
 so want to give soul accents to 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.990
 7000 euros eight centuries but here it is 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.160
 I fall to canvas becomes tight do 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.040
 follow I will follow 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:04:01.990
 I take 45% us to a small 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:04:03.010
 and goody do not you pass it 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.850
 can pass it at any time 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.530
 of culture gear but serves that I can 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.720
 to be engaged she changed to prison where 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.580
 you have to be in neutral no no no no 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.110
 no no no it's you like it and 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.290
 by finishing 4th you do not want it is in 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.940
 all you would like you are the sonatel 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.730
 regime that goes up in a natural way 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.960
 buy but I thought it was 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.910
 did she stop you know the 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.500
