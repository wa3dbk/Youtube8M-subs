00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.500
 in this case, I will show you which 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.580
 items repeat our wonderful 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.180
 flakonchik 8 the more we have black 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.330
 colors so 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.089
 let's go overturns 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.570
 then the situation at first I will tell by 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.029
 materials from which materials struck 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.249
 us phone means 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.380
 at the top 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.689
 these are the bottom of the project 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.130
 pretty good plastic 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.890
 means further metals this site is not 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.020
 lid camera module metal ones here 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.489
 This plastic in the family is also a plastic channel 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.269
 points to know that this is metal 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.210
 button a lot at least on 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.150
 turn 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.010
 it's metal too 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.550
 plastic 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.930
 volume button 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.220
 the percentage of stubs here are these too 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.810
 plastic 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.160
 pskov actually succeeded and move on to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400
 items will start here at our place 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.160
 regional speaker by the way is very successful 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.110
 located under the trenches too 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.420
 did that about a very pleasant stay 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.550
 because there is such a small outcome as 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.170
 once the fluff to this place has somewhere 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.790
 here most likely the city is located 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.140
 sensor 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.800
 mean approaching that is when we 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.710
 we highlight the callipers at our place 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.740
 the stairs 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.960
 that is, on the screen 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.170
 backlight 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.950
 here is the light sensor 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.780
 front camera she walks by herself 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.729
 microphone is going on the keys 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:29.850
 mechanical 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.110
 she plastic can be called very 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.690
 good comfortable 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.230
 further on the right side 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.810
 located 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.369
 camera activation activation key 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.770
 camera standard brother slider here 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.130
 this one is our zlochevsky doctors for 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.260
 unlock lock 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.410
 here further 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.740
 volume control 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.270
 pretty handy pros 10 such 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.969
 small 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.400
 there are groups 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.210
 part i i'm asking with a finger 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.310
 feel 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.070
 delay involving on / off 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.659
 cell phone waiting for the connector under 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.569
 plastic cap clink the board stock 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.260
 will buy operator smarts 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.510
 kidney and fears closing your mouth is that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.269
 or another connector because why he 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.120
 so it tends to open up 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.989
 spontaneously but not even to the end but 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.970
 Alas, there is such and so little on 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.639
 a few millimeters 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.529
 opens three and a half meters 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.469
 standard connector 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.099
 left and sides 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.859
 they are extremely vulnerable and here here 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.930
 small indicator rsi stadium which 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.140
 signals us by battery rating 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.019
 when we plug in the blood 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.730
 hr ossetia further and here is the map 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.709
 Alfred memory once a winner 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.249
 classmates is sim cards in order 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:55.409
 to cover 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.569
 here we are opening these parts of the sea 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.569
 Gershwin like this and then lower 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.479
 that's how it all happens 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.889
 because 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:13.559
 all the card and memory card to invest in 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.689
 quite comfortable closes also 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.049
 alternately first in the bottom close 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.939
 pilots offspring we close 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.849
 top attack well 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.579
 at the bottom is the Germans 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.179
 pc connector from charging 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.429
 charger connect 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.709
 the difference is only for people but to this extent 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.659
 bags 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.650
 for 1 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.239
 what we have to write we have is big 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.779
 account module such 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:42.919
 offset 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.919
 this is our dynamic this is ours 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.799
 incomprehensible cameras flash here am 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.509
 small indicator or rather indicators 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:59.119
 the charter of us highlighting the author of the focus that is 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:01.739
 merge with the holidays mvb color 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.309
 here and highlight us certain 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.259
 objects so that everyone could save 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:08.410
 rustaveli here here 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.620
 there is a second microphone in this place 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.280
 i.e. one microphone are funds 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.039
 another here if 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.980
 this is done beyond the records 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.749
 with her sound 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.819
 when we shoot blooms 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.490
 the only question is what is now for what 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.479
 either features and sizes 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.889
 Here for example the same 58 00 58 0 09 earlier 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.129
 that's so pure just to see how they are 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.379
 will lead 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.379
 this investigated cabinet 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.979
 but not yet noticed that about the same 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.979
 but if a little later 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.159
 rub 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.659
 factor 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.659
 But if the situation is right 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.059
 thank you all bye bye
