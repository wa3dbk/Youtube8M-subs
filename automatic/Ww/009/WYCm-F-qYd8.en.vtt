the other line that I played was warrior

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.160 
the other line that I played was warrior

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
now in the warrior everything is melee

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.820 
now in the warrior everything is melee
you're<00:00:04.740> always<00:00:05.160> met<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.520> melee<00:00:05.879> class<00:00:06.350> and<00:00:07.350> four

you're always met a melee class and four

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.580 
you're always met a melee class and four
of<00:00:07.980> them<00:00:08.220> are<00:00:08.400> DPS<00:00:09.030> lines<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.750> four<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.440> them

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
of them are DPS lines and four of them

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.430 
of them are DPS lines and four of them
are<00:00:10.710> tank<00:00:11.070> lines<00:00:11.429> how<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.300> make<00:00:12.540> four

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
are tank lines how can you make four

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.519 
are tank lines how can you make four
very<00:00:14.070> different<00:00:14.370> ways<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.299> tank<00:00:15.630> as<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> warrior

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
very different ways to tank as a warrior

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.760 
very different ways to tank as a warrior
I<00:00:16.920> just<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.430> cannot<00:00:18.199> how<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.260> hell<00:00:19.590> can

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
I just I just cannot how the hell can

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.400 
I just I just cannot how the hell can
they<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.449> well<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> know<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.020> bit<00:00:22.199> odd

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
they do that well I know it's a bit odd

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.170 
they do that well I know it's a bit odd
but<00:00:23.279> we'll<00:00:23.460> try<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.760> go<00:00:23.850> through<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
but we'll try and go through the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.570 
but we'll try and go through the
differences<00:00:24.630> here<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.769> start<00:00:26.010> with<00:00:26.099> DPS

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
differences here if we start with DPS

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.580 
differences here if we start with DPS
the<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.090> played<00:00:27.510> initially<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.320> rift

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the one I played initially was rift

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.679 
the one I played initially was rift
blade<00:00:28.920> which<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.550> dwarf<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> big

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
blade which is the dwarf with the big

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.590 
blade which is the dwarf with the big
fiery<00:00:30.960> sword<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:32.130> sort<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.550> two-hand<00:00:33.030> DPS

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
fiery sword it's sort of a two-hand DPS

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.650 
fiery sword it's sort of a two-hand DPS
line<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.290> based<00:00:34.530> around<00:00:34.969> putting<00:00:35.969> dots

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
line and it's based around putting dots

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.380 
line and it's based around putting dots
on<00:00:36.960> your<00:00:37.110> sword<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.860> dealing<00:00:38.190> damage<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
on your sword and dealing damage the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.150 
on your sword and dealing damage the
mechanic<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.050> warriors<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.860> sort<00:00:41.100> of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
mechanic of warriors is this sort of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.639 
mechanic of warriors is this sort of
three<00:00:41.430> combo<00:00:41.879> point<00:00:42.149> system<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.780> three<00:00:43.050> swords

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
three combo point system of three swords

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.510 
three combo point system of three swords
so<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> idea<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.809> build<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:47.100> combo

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
so the idea is that you build up combo

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.010 
so the idea is that you build up combo
points<00:00:47.879> by<00:00:48.000> using<00:00:48.180> abilities<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
points by using abilities then you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.470 
points by using abilities then you
unleash<00:00:49.379> abilities<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.059> know<00:00:51.180> cost

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
unleash abilities that you know cost

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.139 
unleash abilities that you know cost
your<00:00:51.809> sword

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
your sword

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.389 
your sword
so<00:00:54.149> rift<00:00:54.420> blade<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.870> more<00:00:55.170> dot<00:00:55.710> based<00:00:56.010> more

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
so rift blade is more dot based more

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.310 
so rift blade is more dot based more
magical<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.090> get<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> few<00:00:57.539> utility<00:00:58.079> things

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
magical you get a few utility things

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.869 
magical you get a few utility things
like<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> flame<00:00:58.890> spear<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.670> cast

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
like a flame spear that you can cast

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.660 
like a flame spear that you can cast

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
from range and a few sort of buffs and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.750 
from range and a few sort of buffs and
debuffs<00:01:02.960> mmm<00:01:04.070> champion<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.460> main

debuffs mmm champion is the main

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.899 
debuffs mmm champion is the main
two-hand<00:01:06.689> DPS<00:01:07.200> line<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.799> plays<00:01:08.460> very<00:01:08.820> much

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
two-hand DPS line and plays very much

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.870 
two-hand DPS line and plays very much
like<00:01:09.210> an<00:01:09.330> arms<00:01:09.720> warrior<00:01:10.080> from<00:01:10.350> wow<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:11.729> get

charged you get an over power ability
you<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> more<00:01:15.210> strike<00:01:15.720> ability

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
very familiar to anyone who's played and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.560 
very familiar to anyone who's played and
arms<00:01:23.490> whirring<00:01:23.939> wow<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.990> Paragon<00:01:25.830> line<00:01:26.070> is

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
arms whirring wow the Paragon line is

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.069 
arms whirring wow the Paragon line is
dual<00:01:27.570> wheel<00:01:27.990> based<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.810> again

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
dual wheel based so this is again

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.390 
dual wheel based so this is again
slightly<00:01:31.530> different<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.979> didn't<00:01:32.220> actually

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
slightly different I didn't actually

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.840 
slightly different I didn't actually
play<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> idea<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.850> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
play this one but the idea is that you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.050 
play this one but the idea is that you
jewel<00:01:36.119> wield<00:01:37.490> but<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.759> kind<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.000> be

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
jewel wield but it can kind of be

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.280 
jewel wield but it can kind of be
supported<00:01:39.900> by<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:41.310> champion<00:01:42.180> tree<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
supported by the champion tree or the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.399 
supported by the champion tree or the
rift<00:01:43.500> blade<00:01:43.710> tree<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.070> well<00:01:44.360> because<00:01:45.409> rather

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
rift blade tree as well because rather

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.399 
rift blade tree as well because rather
than<00:01:46.770> having<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.880> hand<00:01:48.210> specs<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
than having to hand specs in the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.649 
than having to hand specs in the
champion<00:01:49.979> line<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.030> talents<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.600> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
champion line you have talents that you

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.780 
champion line you have talents that you
can<00:01:51.840> choose<00:01:52.110> instead<00:01:52.560> which<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:52.979> boosts

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
can choose instead which are boosts

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.109 
can choose instead which are boosts
physical<00:01:54.210> damage<00:01:54.600> instead<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.850> wanted

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
physical damage instead so if you wanted

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.760 
physical damage instead so if you wanted
to<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.450> champion<00:01:57.899> as<00:01:57.960> your<00:01:58.079> secondary<00:01:58.500> you'd

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
to have champion as your secondary you'd

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.069 
to have champion as your secondary you'd
pick<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.939> ones<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.270> boosted<00:02:00.719> your<00:02:00.840> dual

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
pick the ones that boosted your dual

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.350

lot of stacking diseases and dots you

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.720 
lot of stacking diseases and dots you
can<00:04:05.670> put<00:04:06.000> on<00:04:06.200> enemies<00:04:07.200> this<00:04:07.650> it's<00:04:08.040> more<00:04:08.250> damage

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
can put on enemies this it's more damage

and threat focused or either the other
tank<00:04:11.100> line<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.460> actually<00:04:11.610> warlord<00:04:12.330> which<00:04:12.720> is

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
tank line is actually warlord which is

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.700 
tank line is actually warlord which is
more<00:04:13.020> of<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.140> support<00:04:13.590> tank<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.820> get<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.650> this

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:16.710 
more of a support tank you get so this

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.010 
more of a support tank you get so this
is<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:16.950> last<00:04:17.190> one<00:04:17.460> it's<00:04:17.910> kind<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.210> more<00:04:18.570> I

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
is the last one it's kind of more I

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.479 
is the last one it's kind of more I
think<00:04:19.350> it's<00:04:19.470> supposed<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.770> be<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.920> tank<00:04:20.250> in<00:04:20.370> its

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
think it's supposed to be a tank in its

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.260 
think it's supposed to be a tank in its
own<00:04:20.700> right<00:04:21.470> but<00:04:22.470> it's<00:04:22.710> got<00:04:22.890> more<00:04:23.430> sort<00:04:24.240> of

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
own right but it's got more sort of

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.510 
own right but it's got more sort of
debuff<00:04:24.840> abilities<00:04:25.500> like

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
debuff abilities like

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.820 
debuff abilities like
things<00:04:28.480> that<00:04:28.600> will<00:04:28.660> reduce<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:29.200> damage<00:04:29.560> of

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
things that will reduce the damage of

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.310 
things that will reduce the damage of
the<00:04:30.130> monster<00:04:30.430> you're<00:04:30.550> attacking<00:04:30.960> rather<00:04:31.960> than

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
the monster you're attacking rather than

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.690 
the monster you're attacking rather than
keep<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.580> alive<00:04:34.140> necessarily<00:04:35.140> mmm<00:04:35.980> it<00:04:36.580> is

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
keep you alive necessarily mmm it is

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.070 
keep you alive necessarily mmm it is
actually<00:04:37.000> worth<00:04:37.120> saying<00:04:37.390> that<00:04:37.540> you<00:04:37.810> can<00:04:37.930> have

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
actually worth saying that you can have

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.730 
actually worth saying that you can have
for<00:04:38.490> talent<00:04:39.490> specs<00:04:39.820> in<00:04:40.780> rift<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.380> you<00:04:41.440> can

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
for talent specs in rift so you can

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.680 
for talent specs in rift so you can
actually<00:04:41.890> effectively<00:04:42.760> it's<00:04:43.300> like<00:04:43.450> dual

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
actually effectively it's like dual

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.390 
actually effectively it's like dual
specking<00:04:44.260> where<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.680> can<00:04:44.830> change<00:04:45.100> between

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
specking where you can change between

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.960 
specking where you can change between
them<00:04:45.760> at<00:04:45.880> will<00:04:46.090> free<00:04:46.750> so<00:04:47.680> if<00:04:48.160> you<00:04:48.490> were<00:04:48.760> playing

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970

you<00:04:49.360> know<00:04:49.480> a<00:04:49.510> tank<00:04:49.870> in<00:04:50.110> rift<00:04:50.380> you<00:04:50.560> could

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
you know a tank in rift you could

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.530 
you know a tank in rift you could
potentially<00:04:51.100> have<00:04:51.460> all<00:04:51.610> four<00:04:52.000> different

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
tanks as your spec and you could switch

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.560 
tanks as your spec and you could switch
between<00:04:56.170> them<00:04:56.500> between<00:04:56.770> poles<00:04:57.190> so<00:04:58.120> if<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.390> boss
