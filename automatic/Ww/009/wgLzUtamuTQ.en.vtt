here your tip just goes an early goal
there<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.789> clip<00:00:20.970> was<00:00:21.090> trying<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.449> kind<00:00:21.600> of

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
there this clip was trying to kind of

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.939 
there this clip was trying to kind of
show<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.810> because<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.410> feel<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.710> was<00:00:22.890> a

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
show you because I feel this was a

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.429 
show you because I feel this was a
definite<00:00:23.490> penalty<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.060> look<00:00:24.300> at<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.600> he

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
definite penalty like look at it he

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.380 
definite penalty like look at it he
clearly<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.130> reason<00:00:26.460> Aguero<00:00:26.730> goes<00:00:26.910> down<00:00:27.180> is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
clearly the reason Aguero goes down is

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.970 
clearly the reason Aguero goes down is
because<00:00:27.480> he<00:00:27.930> comes<00:00:28.199> across<00:00:28.380> him<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.890> he's

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
because he comes across him and he's

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.490 
because he comes across him and he's
pushing<00:00:29.460> him<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.810> all<00:00:30.810> natural<00:00:31.140> clip<00:00:31.289> itself

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
pushing him and all natural clip itself

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
pushing him and all natural clip itself
who's<00:00:31.740> precious<00:00:32.219> he's<00:00:32.790> pressing<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> bball

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
who's precious he's pressing the bball

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.610 
who's precious he's pressing the bball
and<00:00:33.480> obviously<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> computer<00:00:34.500> so

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
and obviously it's going to computer so

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.110 
and obviously it's going to computer so
they<00:00:34.710> weren't<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.219> that's<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> kind<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
they weren't but that's the kind of

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.119 
they weren't but that's the kind of
feeling<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.680> really

Ramirez in the 35th minute that makes it
to<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:24.800> know<00:04:24.949> I<00:04:25.159> was<00:04:25.580> just<00:04:25.610> a<00:04:25.729> bit<00:04:25.849> shocked

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
to you know I was just a bit shocked

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.390 
to you know I was just a bit shocked
because

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
because

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.129 
because
I<00:04:27.490> would<00:04:28.240> say<00:04:28.449> that<00:04:28.479> they<00:04:28.780> were<00:04:28.930> playing

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
I would say that they were playing

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.600 
I would say that they were playing
better<00:04:29.410> football<00:04:29.860> but<00:04:30.100> they<00:04:30.220> weren't<00:04:30.400> like

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
better football but they weren't like

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.640 
better football but they weren't like
dominating<00:04:31.090> or<00:04:31.270> anything<00:04:31.570> like<00:04:31.650> maybe

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
dominating or anything like maybe

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.310 
dominating or anything like maybe
warnell<00:04:33.430> possibly<00:04:34.120> probably<00:04:34.540> nil<00:04:34.840> nil<00:04:35.020> but

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
warnell possibly probably nil nil but

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.659 
warnell possibly probably nil nil but
then<00:04:35.530> just<00:04:35.889> you<00:04:36.009> know<00:04:36.100> playing<00:04:36.280> bit<00:04:36.490> better

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
then just you know playing bit better

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:37.920 
then just you know playing bit better
football<00:04:37.060> but<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.330> thought<00:04:37.479> it<00:04:37.570> would<00:04:37.630> open<00:04:37.750> up

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
football but I thought it would open up

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.180 
football but I thought it would open up
the<00:04:38.080> second<00:04:38.380> half<00:04:38.500> but<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.800> just<00:04:38.979> kind<00:04:39.160> of

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
the second half but I just kind of

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.909 
the second half but I just kind of
wasn't<00:04:40.000> playing<00:04:40.449> great<00:04:40.780> defensively<00:04:41.289> and<00:04:41.770> it

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
wasn't playing great defensively and it

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.740 
wasn't playing great defensively and it
really<00:04:42.160> did<00:04:42.340> cost<00:04:42.610> me<00:04:42.759> we<00:04:42.970> all<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.419> final

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
really did cost me we all the final

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.450 
really did cost me we all the final
school<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.139> can<00:04:44.229> get<00:04:44.440> any<00:04:44.620> chances<00:04:45.039> really<00:04:45.220> at

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460

interment<00:04:59.740> League<00:04:59.919> we<00:05:00.820> are<00:05:00.940> away<00:05:01.150> from<00:05:01.210> home<00:05:01.389> I

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
interment League we are away from home I

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.870 
interment League we are away from home I
think<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.139> the<00:05:02.979> only<00:05:03.130> goal<00:05:03.310> that<00:05:03.550> was<00:05:03.639> scored

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
think and the only goal that was scored

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.180 
think and the only goal that was scored
was<00:05:04.060> this<00:05:04.210> one<00:05:04.419> I<00:05:04.600> like<00:05:05.229> what<00:05:05.380> Celtic<00:05:05.650> is<00:05:06.070> with

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
was this one I like what Celtic is with

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.010 
was this one I like what Celtic is with
a<00:05:06.220> header<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:07.300> was<00:05:07.419> before<00:05:07.600> I'd<00:05:07.810> has<00:05:07.900> got

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
a header this was before I'd has got

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.390 
a header this was before I'd has got
patched<00:05:08.260> as<00:05:08.440> well<00:05:08.590> so<00:05:08.740> they<00:05:08.860> were<00:05:08.979> a<00:05:09.010> bit<00:05:09.190> more

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
patched as well so they were a bit more

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.969 
patched as well so they were a bit more
of<00:05:09.460> a<00:05:09.639> power<00:05:09.820> than<00:05:10.060> they<00:05:10.150> are<00:05:10.240> now<00:05:10.710> warnell<00:05:11.710> so

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
of a power than they are now warnell so

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.469 
of a power than they are now warnell so
we<00:05:12.100> do<00:05:12.280> leaves<00:05:12.490> out<00:05:12.610> in<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:12.789> three<00:05:12.970> points<00:05:13.330> I

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
we do leaves out in the three points I

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.480 
we do leaves out in the three points I
think<00:05:14.110> that<00:05:14.139> actually<00:05:14.440> makes<00:05:14.590> everyone<00:05:15.250> in

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
think that actually makes everyone in

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.879 
think that actually makes everyone in
the<00:05:15.699> group<00:05:16.150> stage<00:05:16.449> mine<00:05:16.750> on<00:05:17.020> three<00:05:17.410> points<00:05:17.770> i

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
the group stage mine on three points i

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.439 
the group stage mine on three points i
