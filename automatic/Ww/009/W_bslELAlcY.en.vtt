00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.289
 Holzer now where Klose from Pocket PC point ch 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 and of course Klatten and Diethard want to support between the HTC Desire 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.529
 and if HTC Desire hd2 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.669
 As most of you probably would then suffer the desire 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.100
 a little and Almut Detert Spark 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 Treichl has to demonstrate 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 so plays in a multi-touch printable 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 and if I had irritated lift that my fingers 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 so and again 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.420
 now he will already make mistakes 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.920
 the program means 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.450
 my fingers do not care if we are honest about that 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.160
 Lord must visit in front 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.870
 now it can be right 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.770
 and now moved again 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.770
 funny 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.270
 Risk that its way 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.270
 this courage Spark 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.550
 now that the man often like testing the HTC Desire HD watch 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.680
 Obstacles included in the program 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 Too wet makes hand in hand doubt 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.510
 the CSU is not beating mistakes 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.730
 everything is smooth 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.490
 DuMont third quarter too 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.380
 there is also good 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 knows everyone 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.990
 comes another fourth is the maximum with him Hardy of this engine only two 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 Per cent Zwiener soon become or gives disturbances 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.780
 sometimes it runs quite fluently "sometimes there is 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.930
 quite 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.930
 as you can see here 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.740
 yes Ott nevertheless has certainly supported the Desire HD against that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.119
 Design won 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.069
 Aalen the screen was a lot 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.799
 improved 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.499
 yes and I think so for sure 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:16.329
 a good thing
