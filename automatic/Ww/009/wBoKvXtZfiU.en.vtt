 magic that has three different textures 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 with a single preparation to taste 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.160
 caramel salted butter it's going to be 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.870
 extraordinary 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.579
 so for our magic caramel cake 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.090
 we already have for the party so 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.300
 caramel of 300 g of white semolina sugar 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.710
 here I have 15 cm thick cream 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.640
 you can use liquid cream 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.800
 no matter here I have 75 g half butter 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.479
 salt never wanted to use the 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.700
 sweet butter of course thought to add 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.270
 a lot of salt for having embodied for 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.250
 salted butter 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.990
 then for the cake part so of 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.170
 our match someone we will need 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.520
 45 centimes liter of normal milk 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.890
 then I have four big ones that I have 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.709
 separated between newspapers and white here I 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.709
 Due to the very natural vanilla 90 g of 

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:28.470
 flour and in points 70 g of butter 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:30.360
 semi-salt beautiful site so jealous 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.899
 use sweet butter add a little 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.459
 of salt 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.289
 we will immediately start with 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.330
 part because ahmed so what am I going 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.090
 to do is simply to melt 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.240
 my white sugar yeah and do it 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.369
 caramelize on a gas stove so with 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.020
 a few drops of lemon juice and 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.140
 then we 'll add the rest of the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.340
 ingredients 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.869
 so as you can see from a very 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.509
 good caramel since when I take it 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.099
 we have a nice caramel color in 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.259
 it's perfect now what am I going 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.209
 to do is to add in my caramel 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.640
 makrem then there pay attention to 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.959
 burnt fava projections since you have 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.490
 simply add a mixture that has 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.679
 his prey in a caramel that is very 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.569
 hot so that's so well thought 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.149
 mix and especially you will see you 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:17.650
 go see 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:19.060
 projection but that's normal then 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.930
 I continued my fire log have 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.140
 now what am I going to do add 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.810
 my cold butter and the agreement 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.189
 could by mixing with maryse a 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.019
 following as a whole shell all 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.720
 my office at the bottom of the subject do it's 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.099
 let my caramel rest about 5 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.129
 minutes and you have great will continue the 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.379
 recipe then montcalm is there well 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.849
 rested I left 100 grams of pot 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.689
 so this is what I have done what the 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.280
 rest 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.599
 as soon as I put in my milk is just 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.720
 just doing it 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.549
 to heat so that the milk and the caramel 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.930
 be it at the word caramel milk mixture 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.579
 support our young people and that the chaos that 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.620
 the cairo well at all in the milk 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.879
 we will take about five minutes not 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.010
 need to boil the milk not 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.510
 no longer now what am I going all 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.450
 simply make his climbs but white 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.530
 in snow 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.049
 so I said target yellow that I am 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.620
 already beating ok i will 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.650
 add but 70 g of melted butter so 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.310
 I mix well at the same time as those 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.799
 then I see it there it's all 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.220
 simply add the flour and 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.079
 Mamani I'm sifted for a bar 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.690
 a feather duster because all there is easy to 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.810
 to return with so much marine I mix 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.280
 so here you are at this point 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.900
 are going to have a very thick paste that's 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.730
 normal because every time we do the 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.040
 magic and no now if I do enough 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.739
 add some of my milk but not everything 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.159
 to try to mix the two 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:45.180
 together and then to have a 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.180
 homogeneous preparation 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.729
 now what am I going to do so 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.569
 while continuing to converge 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.250
 it is homogeneous 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.540
 I will add all the rest we have 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.949
 2000 m go see it's going to be a 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.959
 extremely liquid preparation but 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.959
 it does not matter such principle of the magic 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.120
 so if he estimates my preparation which is 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.190
 now perfectly this game all 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.739
 to simply do it is to add all the 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.840
 egg whites by mixing singing with 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.019
 maryse to incorporate them into my 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.019
 preparation 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.989
 so here is now 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.430
 mixture is perfectly homogeneous what 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.799
 I like my new place so it's the 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.450
 put in a mold of 22 cm 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.740
 diameter that I cried and then I 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.870
 reopened the bottom of a layer of paper 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.669
 greaseproof that I then gilded for 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.280
 really to see him finish my cake 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.360
 easily this love aboard no you 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.540
 go see we'll see a lot of 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.940
 preparation so I put it in my 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.650
 mold and then what I did dance 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.010
 cook them in my oven is 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.260
 heated to 150 degrees Celsius for 50 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.970
 minutes to an hour where until they 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.229
 have a consistency a little risk 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.720
 and that you're going to be causing the butchers 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.370
 and rap a flan consistency at 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.810
 middle as if they were not 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.460
 fully cooked but it will be perfect 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.410
 for our magic is then young girl 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.050

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.400
 light we can no longer plan and the cus 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.100
