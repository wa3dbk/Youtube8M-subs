00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
creating it so this house was inspired

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.240 
creating it so this house was inspired
by<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> picture<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> found<00:00:33.120> online

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
by a picture that I found online

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.160 
by a picture that I found online
actually<00:00:35.250> more<00:00:35.460> or<00:00:35.550> less<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.120> all<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
actually more or less it was just all it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.200 
actually more or less it was just all it
showed<00:00:37.380> was<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.920> back<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.760> house<00:00:38.969> which

showed was the back of this house which

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.110 
showed was the back of this house which
would<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> pool<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.730> what<00:00:41.730> you'll<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:41.910> is

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
would be the pool and what you'll see is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.790 
would be the pool and what you'll see is
the<00:00:42.390> roof<00:00:42.629> after<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.379> thought<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> roof

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the roof after I just thought the roof

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.350 
the roof after I just thought the roof
was<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.070> amazing<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.879> loved<00:00:45.180> how<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
was like amazing and I loved how it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.139 
was like amazing and I loved how it
looked<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.280> just<00:00:47.280> thought<00:00:47.399> I'd<00:00:47.550> copy<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
looked so I just thought I'd copy it and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.630 
looked so I just thought I'd copy it and
put<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.739> interior<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.460> all

put it on here but the interior is all
me<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.390> decided<00:00:51.660> all<00:00:52.020> myself<00:00:52.579> because<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
me I decided all myself because in the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.869 
me I decided all myself because in the
picture<00:00:54.390> didn't<00:00:54.690> show<00:00:54.840> anything<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:56.760> know
