 tablet we just received this letter besides me of nine it 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.590
 So there is an Android tablet 2 points 3 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.099
 with 10 inches of screen 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.099
 if we will discover it together 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.419
 we have here 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.739
 buttons 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.239
 control what's nice enough no these are buttons 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.020
 we have adjusted volume 2 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.020
 a job recovery the backtracking 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.700
 here we rarely get crocs foam 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.820
 it looks like a war 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.130
 microphone jack for an external microphone jack headphone hdmi 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.960
 nor is it easy 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.530
 it looks like there is little 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.060
 the snop 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.000
 a face for cards 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.040
 the mic 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.040
 the heirs make the point 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.400
 we follow your art a socket usb the charging socket the button for 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.010
 so what else do we have in the box 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.840
 Martin Singer 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.710
 with an adapter 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.899
 for tristan deer 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.210
 we only have to ask 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.950
 it's a suicide 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.160
 here 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.370
 nothing 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.370
 workshop 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.740
 then the back of the tablet 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.070
 and white plastic it's original 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.950
 we have here 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.810
 empty the places loudspeakers 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.810
 we only have a calm voice at this level 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.110
 here I am patient I do not drink I do not have good I would say we would have a sensor 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.110
 of 2 8 million something 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.380
 a year 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.850
 so here's the tablet 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.340
 % we can still remember it so except the screen of 10 inches of 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.690
 diagonal 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.080
 who looks 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.080
 at first glance it's very reactive 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.329
 % processors more than wore is denis without defeat 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.899
 the 512 of two oars 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.149
 we will see what he can 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.149
 applications that has a 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.189
 no no percent 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.399
 his call for an investigation 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:33.889
 the second part to 4 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:38.529
 the camera the fol hope facebook is preinstalled and always the 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:39.299
 galleries 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.059
 general breitling which is 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:43.150
 an application 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.439
 so to take some 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.799
 and notes 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.359
 but in Europe ines fairly classic but what do his classics do 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.620
 mediator the replica office parameters that were loaded too 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:56.989
 that's good to be able to 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.129
 pdf for xls player files 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.369
 % with the guru 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.369
 Wales to pay them the system that is ready to give way 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.199
 the question no longer has the nail 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.629
 and the same style of times that I produce 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.629
 so that applied to him on the age 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.279
 that I would like to see these sites show you 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.859
 at the phone level the little worries 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.129
 so it's an android 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.680
 versions 2 - 3 points 3 rebounds to the meter 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.299
 a new version 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.299
 androy's fist three times a day in n2 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:42.679
 I like to see if we can see in terms of storage 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.959
 it's an hour 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.399
 4 some girls 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.399
 so why July 05 at the highest level 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:57.639
 space for applications the 6 213 mediocrity 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.689
 so for now the only thing I can say is that it looks 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.789
 Very kind 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.679
 use 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:12.679
 very reactive 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.109
 but we will do a most complete test 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.439

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.830
