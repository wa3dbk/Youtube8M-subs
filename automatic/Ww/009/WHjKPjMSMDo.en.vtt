00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.740
 let's do a help I'm going to do 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.839
 essence of rum well because the kilos in 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.459
 house and this for good the best good 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:17.640
 so that you like these older people is that 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:21.269
 I think your thing is to take the same 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.609
 amount of liquid that sugar if 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.519
 we took a glass of cognac for example 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.669
 We will remove a glass of water and 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.250
 we will add more sugar because the liquid 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.329
 will come up with the cognac of the question that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.789
 the liquid teques in them 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.900
 portions the same amounts as the 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:42.010
 sugar good once said that 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.010
 we understand the fire 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.870
 Water 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.130
 and we put the sugar 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.880
 and the only thing we're going to do 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.880
 for do 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.320
 in the background 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.010
 it looks white sugar disappears 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.910
 an electro occurred 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.930
 what we will do is throw the 6 the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.420
 cognac glass 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.880
 you pour the whiskey cognac 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.710
 whatever you want, whatever you want 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.170
 say once you have done the first 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.090
 boil 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.880
 and we wait again for another 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.860
 once a workshop life again turned off the 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.740
 fire and let it cool well 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.870
 in case you are well adults and you 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.700
 like the flavor of cognac instead of 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.100
 Take the glass and let it come back to 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.950
 make another boil what you have to 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.290
 to do is once it has served to turn off the 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.230
 fire and when it has already tempered 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.140
 your syrup 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.320
 you pour the cognac and the oar you see a 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.960
 mouse because the syrup is cold 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.070
 evaporate the alcohol you want and 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.860
 then it will be well charged 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.220
 I for example will make the first boil that 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.800
 I disappear no sugar that I have under 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.040
 and I'll throw a few drops of rum because 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.840
 as I said in my case of kids and it 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.020
 I'd throw it cold so that some flavor 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.020
 of 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.300
 now we just have to wait 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.470
 to the white background that is the 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.470
 sugar disappear 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.600
 as you can see the sugar from 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.160
 background has already disappeared now only me 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.050
 it is expected to start boiling 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.050
 It will not take long and put out the fire 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.940
 well there you are watching how it starts 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.120
 boil it automatically turned off the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.099
 fire 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.709
 as I said before what you want to throw 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.540
 Cognac but do not know very strong now 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.209
 that started to boil I was throwing and the glass 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.280
 of cognac then clear the temperature 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.739
 go back down and wait again for 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.010
 return to boil the second time 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.680
 Boil appears fire and ready to reserve 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.680
 to which temper to then look for our 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.829
 Biscuit 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.760
 that you want it stronger, you just make a 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:18.519
 boil when you cool milk in the dram 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.189
 of cognac close movement of cognac whiskey 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.300
 what you want what you want the liquor 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:26.350
 what do you want 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.510
 and now wait for it to cool and I'll throw 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.400
 a few droplets of rum essence 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.080
 good 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.960
 good 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.290
 and I have put a slice of the sponge cake 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.800
 As you can see, I have them cut more or less 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.360
 equal parts 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.860
 a silicone brush 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.130
 as you have 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.660
 and damage it to your liking against more 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.700
 EchÃ©is mojadito is going to stay 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.629
 that already 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.629
 to taste
