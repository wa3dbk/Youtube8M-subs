that<00:02:31.859> you<00:02:31.920> can<00:02:32.069> separate<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:32.730> they're<00:02:32.849> just

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
that you can separate and they're just

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.280 
that you can separate and they're just
on<00:02:33.150> ball<00:02:33.329> joints<00:02:33.629> so<00:02:33.689> they<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.109> little

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
on ball joints so they can have a little

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.619 
on ball joints so they can have a little
bit<00:02:34.409> of<00:02:34.549> rocking<00:02:35.549> motion<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.150> back<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.450> forth

bit of rocking motion but back and forth

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.240 
bit of rocking motion but back and forth
is<00:02:36.750> what<00:02:36.870> they're<00:02:36.989> going<00:02:37.079> to<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:38.040> side

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
is what they're going to do and the side

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.280 
is what they're going to do and the side
ones<00:02:38.549> are<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.390> simple<00:02:39.870> hinges<00:02:40.260> that
