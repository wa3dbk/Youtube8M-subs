to<00:01:19.630> millions<00:01:20.630> of<00:01:20.780> wintering<00:01:21.110> ducks<00:01:21.530> but<00:01:22.070> it's

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
to millions of wintering ducks but it's

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.070 
to millions of wintering ducks but it's
just<00:01:22.399> so<00:01:22.880> unique<00:01:23.090> with<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.570> water<00:01:23.810> being

just so unique with the water being

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.990 
just so unique with the water being
exchanged<00:01:24.560> there<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.160> grass<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.520> grows

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
exchanged there and the grass that grows

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.870 
exchanged there and the grass that grows
in<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.300> back<00:01:26.479> lakes<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.530> houses<00:01:28.250> fish

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
in the back lakes that houses fish

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.690 
in the back lakes that houses fish
throughout<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.570> year<00:01:30.009> folks<00:01:31.009> that<00:01:31.310> don't

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
throughout the year folks that don't

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.309 
throughout the year folks that don't
have<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.970> whole<00:01:32.119> lot<00:01:32.149> experience<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:32.959> think<00:01:33.229> we

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
have a whole lot experience I think we

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.499 
have a whole lot experience I think we
specialize<00:01:33.830> in<00:01:33.860> because<00:01:34.459> we're<00:01:34.610> able<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.209> boat

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
specialize in because we're able to boat

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.660 
specialize in because we're able to boat
fish<00:01:35.780> quite<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.140> bit<00:01:36.319> we<00:01:36.950> really<00:01:37.250> kind<00:01:37.459> of

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
fish quite a bit we really kind of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.499 
fish quite a bit we really kind of
customize<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.640> individual<00:01:40.640> group<00:01:41.330> or

fish but by far is catching a fish on
top<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.360> one<00:01:56.479> boom<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.679> get<00:01:57.800> this<00:01:57.950> huge

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
top of one boom you get this huge

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.359 
top of one boom you get this huge
explosion<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:59.030> a<00:01:59.509> fish<00:01:59.840> is<00:02:00.080> on<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.860> she

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
usually comes to top she's tail walking

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.490 
usually comes to top she's tail walking
just<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.039> visual<00:02:04.520> sensation<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:06.110> sound
