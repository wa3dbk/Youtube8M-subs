00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
pairings called right over at the end I

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.530

run<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.010> with<00:03:01.130> red<00:03:01.489> probably<00:03:02.120> could<00:03:02.239> have<00:03:02.300> used

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
run it with red probably could have used

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.140 
run it with red probably could have used
an<00:03:02.690> extra<00:03:02.959> spacer<00:03:03.350> on<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:04.459> couple<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.910> store

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
spaces but you started when I grabbed

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.400 
spaces but you started when I grabbed
ahold<00:03:07.489> of<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.209> gave<00:03:08.360> up<00:03:08.540> who<00:03:08.690> came<00:03:09.200> right

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
ahold of it and gave up who came right

off<00:03:09.940> basically<00:03:10.940> though<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.510> function

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
off basically though this to a function

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.190 
off basically though this to a function
that's<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.680> way<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:12.860> use<00:03:13.160> it
