00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello everybody is over e 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.200
 last-minute news or better than that 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.410
 news something that happened in short 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.300
 then as you see I am now up 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.389
 amazon.it is the famous site of 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.060
 shopping online if we go looking for gta 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.820
 5 gives us the opportunity to pre-order it 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.740
 both for playstation 3 and for xbox 360 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.289
 because it was announced then to them 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 they say when it comes out we give it to you 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.640
 paid 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.949
 we give it to you when it comes out 64 25 Jun a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.969
 standard price for the games of the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.460
 consul 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:41.790
 but if we go to French amazon 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.079
 so instead of punto.it punto fr e 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.350
 let us look for something today beyond 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.750
 to the xbox 360 and playstation 3 versions 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:59.190
 also gives us the possibility of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:01.680
 preorder a computer version they were 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.359
 so much this computer informatic to 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.979
 video place I don't know why I think that 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.990
 refer to computer or otherwise give us 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.670
 the possibility to pre order it also 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.470
 for computers and obviously less expensive 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.830
 because pc games on windows 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.810
 they cost less and give us the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.520
 possibility to windows 7 view xp mi 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.409
 it seems strange that they do it also for 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.119
 xp anyway it is a news to take 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.250
 in short, for the pliers it seems to me too 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.850
 very strange because it is a mistake 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.310
 in short, they will remove or extraneous because 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.900
 you can't pre order a game that 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.530
 it is not known if it will come out on that one 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.479
 ie a platform pays you and then if 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.689
 does not come out that gives him the money in line i 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.880
 money maybe hundreds of thousands of 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.729
 people seem pretty weird though 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.640
 I don't know if it can be good 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.409
 news more than anything some error or 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.369
 what certainly a thing to be given 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.520
 to say 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.960
 I would be happy if it came out also for PC but 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.299
 I'm sure guys will come out 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.890
 however I invite you to look at mine 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.190
 old video let's clear up on 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.680
 consul 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.320
 I link it to you in an annotation I believe 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.990
 that will come out for PC I repeat it but I believe that 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.900
 will come out after a long time maybe more 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.090
 six months as happened for gta 5 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.560
 for gta iv 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.910
 so nothing I just wanted to warn you of 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.850
 this thing here because you know there is 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.380
 notice on every single news item 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.980
 on this game except for those more 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.390
 stupid rumors that I think are unfounded 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.590
 so nothing see you next 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.590
 special video video hi
