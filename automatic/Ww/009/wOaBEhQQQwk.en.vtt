00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
number three will stay with user number

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.960 
number three will stay with user number
three<00:00:27.679> and<00:00:27.830> just<00:00:27.980> see<00:00:28.189> what<00:00:28.339> programs<00:00:28.550> in

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
three and just see what programs in

tells me segment five I want segment a

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.790 
tells me segment five I want segment a
pardon<00:00:41.510> me<00:00:41.570> I<00:00:41.600> want<00:00:41.810> five<00:00:42.020> segments<00:00:42.560> in<00:00:42.680> this

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
pardon me I want five segments in this

pardon me I want five segments in this
fiery<00:00:43.040> schedule<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:43.700> I'll<00:00:43.910> leave<00:00:44.120> that<00:00:44.180> alone

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
fiery schedule so I'll leave that alone

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.170 
fiery schedule so I'll leave that alone
the<00:00:47.740> ramp<00:00:48.740> for<00:00:49.310> segment<00:00:49.520> number<00:00:49.820> one

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
the ramp for segment number one

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.510 
the ramp for segment number one
programmed<00:00:50.900> in<00:00:51.110> now<00:00:51.260> is<00:00:51.470> 400<00:00:51.980> degrees<00:00:52.250> for<00:00:52.430> an

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
programmed in now is 400 degrees for an

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.060 
programmed in now is 400 degrees for an
hour<00:00:52.580> I'm<00:00:53.360> happy<00:00:53.780> with<00:00:53.900> 400<00:00:54.350> degrees<00:00:54.590> per<00:00:54.770> hour

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
hour I'm happy with 400 degrees per hour

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.180 
hour I'm happy with 400 degrees per hour
but<00:00:55.670> just<00:00:56.090> for<00:00:56.240> the<00:00:56.300> sake<00:00:56.480> of<00:00:56.510> demonstration

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
but just for the sake of demonstration

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.470 
but just for the sake of demonstration
I'll<00:00:58.190> put<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.520> up<00:00:58.640> to<00:00:58.760> 500<00:01:00.580> oops<00:01:01.580> a<00:01:01.910> little<00:01:02.180> too

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
I'll put it up to 500 oops a little too

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.850 
I'll put it up to 500 oops a little too
far<00:01:02.690> there<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.110> is<00:01:03.230> one<00:01:03.380> of<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.530> tricky

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
far there this is one of the tricky

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.980 
far there this is one of the tricky
things<00:01:04.070> about<00:01:04.220> this<00:01:04.519> controller<00:01:04.970> is<00:01:05.239> it<00:01:05.750> picks

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
things about this controller is it picks

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.810 
things about this controller is it picks
up<00:01:06.170> speed<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:06.679> it's<00:01:06.829> a<00:01:06.890> good<00:01:07.039> idea<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:07.399> hit<00:01:07.670> the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
up speed so it's a good idea to hit the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.639 
up speed so it's a good idea to hit the
button<00:01:08.149> and<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.630> down<00:01:08.840> on<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.140> UP<00:01:09.229> button<00:01:09.409> in

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
button and the down on the UP button in

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.160 
button and the down on the UP button in
small<00:01:09.950> bursts<00:01:10.549> rather<00:01:10.609> than<00:01:11.000> hold<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.329> on<00:01:11.479> so

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
small bursts rather than hold it on so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.560 
small bursts rather than hold it on so
it's<00:01:12.350> 500<00:01:12.560> degrees<00:01:13.159> per<00:01:13.369> hour<00:01:13.549> I'll<00:01:13.939> press<00:01:14.299> the

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
it's 500 degrees per hour I'll press the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.169 
it's 500 degrees per hour I'll press the
Enter<00:01:14.840> button<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:15.380> confirm<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:15.950> want<00:01:16.189> that<00:01:16.429> it's

it's calling for it to go up to thirteen
hundred<00:02:04.819> and<00:02:04.850> fifty<00:02:05.179> degrees<00:02:05.539> I<00:02:05.810> want<00:02:06.079> it<00:02:06.170> to

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
hundred and fifty degrees I want it to

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.880 
hundred and fifty degrees I want it to
be<00:02:06.380> hotter<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.579> I'm<00:02:07.759> gonna<00:02:07.909> increase<00:02:08.270> that<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.899> a

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
be hotter so I'm gonna increase that a a

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.460 
be hotter so I'm gonna increase that a a
a<00:02:09.979> small<00:02:10.369> burst<00:02:10.790> or<00:02:11.390> picks<00:02:11.720> up<00:02:11.870> speed<00:02:12.140> on<00:02:12.320> me

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
a small burst or picks up speed on me

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:22.070 
a small burst or picks up speed on me
and<00:02:12.590> runs<00:02:12.800> away

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.120 

fourteen<00:02:23.080> hundred<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.380> fifty<00:02:23.680> degrees<00:02:23.980> is

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
fourteen hundred and fifty degrees is

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.150 
fourteen hundred and fifty degrees is
what<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.310> want<00:02:24.640> I'll<00:02:25.120> accept<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.710> hold<00:02:26.710> for<00:02:26.830> 15

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
what I want I'll accept that hold for 15

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.190 
what I want I'll accept that hold for 15
minutes<00:02:28.320> I'll<00:02:29.320> accept<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:30.930> nine<00:02:31.930> nine<00:02:32.170> nine

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
minutes I'll accept that nine nine nine

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.860 
minutes I'll accept that nine nine nine
nine<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.040> code<00:02:33.250> for<00:02:33.280> as<00:02:33.580> fast<00:02:33.880> as<00:02:34.090> possible

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
nine is the code for as fast as possible

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.410 
nine is the code for as fast as possible
so<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.290> ramp<00:02:35.500> rate<00:02:35.800> in<00:02:36.010> segment<00:02:36.280> four<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:37.210> to

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
so the ramp rate in segment four is to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.360 
so the ramp rate in segment four is to
drop<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.810> temperature<00:02:37.960> as<00:02:38.350> fast<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:38.860> possible

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
drop the temperature as fast as possible

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.310 
drop the temperature as fast as possible
I'll<00:02:39.700> accept<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.300> down<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.140> nine<00:02:41.290> hundred

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
I'll accept that down to nine hundred

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.700 
I'll accept that down to nine hundred
and<00:02:41.680> fifty<00:02:42.070> degrees<00:02:42.600> accept<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.810> hold<00:02:44.530> for

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
and fifty degrees accept that hold for

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.990 
and fifty degrees accept that hold for
one<00:02:45.100> hour<00:02:45.280> for<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.000> anneal<00:02:46.300> except<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
one hour for the anneal except that the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.270 
one hour for the anneal except that the
ramp<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.360> segment<00:02:49.600> five<00:02:50.020> is<00:02:50.320> 400<00:02:50.770> degrees<00:02:51.040> per

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
ramp and segment five is 400 degrees per

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.030 
ramp and segment five is 400 degrees per
hour<00:02:51.840> down<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.900> 100<00:02:53.530> degrees<00:02:55.500> zero<00:02:56.500> means<00:02:56.830> it's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
hour down to 100 degrees zero means it's

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.360 
hour down to 100 degrees zero means it's
turned<00:02:57.340> off<00:02:57.690> there<00:02:58.740> that<00:02:59.740> says<00:03:00.010> ready<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:02.370> one

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
turned off there that says ready on one

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:17.500 
turned off there that says ready on one
click<00:03:06.370> just<00:03:06.880> turned<00:03:07.120> on<00:03:07.300> it's<00:03:07.660> now<00:03:07.810> firing
