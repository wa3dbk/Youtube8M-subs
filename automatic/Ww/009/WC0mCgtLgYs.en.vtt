what's up it's me they go paradise here

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.679 
what's up it's me they go paradise here
and<00:00:02.220> today<00:00:02.639> I'm<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.000> show<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.300> how<00:00:03.629> to

and today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.680 
and today I'm going to show you how to
build<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.200> Lego<00:00:04.500> chemistry<00:00:05.190> set<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:06.270> let's

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
build this Lego chemistry set so let's

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.080 
build this Lego chemistry set so let's
see<00:00:06.899> what<00:00:07.230> you're<00:00:07.379> going<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.620> need<00:00:08.000> so<00:00:09.000> you

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
see what you're going to need so you

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.940 
see what you're going to need so you
will<00:00:09.330> need<00:00:09.480> these<00:00:09.690> pieces<00:00:09.960> here<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.800> can

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
will need these pieces here and you can

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.459 
will need these pieces here and you can
pause<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> video<00:00:11.370> now<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.730> get<00:00:12.030> them<00:00:12.200> and<00:00:13.200> you

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
pause the video now to get them and you

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.259 
pause the video now to get them and you
will<00:00:13.620> also<00:00:13.799> need<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.340> table<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.969> put<00:00:15.120> your

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
will also need a table to put your

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.189 
will also need a table to put your
chemistry<00:00:15.690> set<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.630> start<00:00:18.960> off<00:00:19.170> by

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
chemistry set on so you start off by

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.859 
chemistry set on so you start off by
taking<00:00:19.529> your<00:00:19.920> 1<00:00:20.310> by<00:00:20.490> 2<00:00:20.550> tile<00:00:20.939> stud<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
taking your 1 by 2 tile stud in the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.509 
taking your 1 by 2 tile stud in the
middle<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.910> a<00:00:23.910> normal<00:00:24.240> Lego<00:00:24.570> stud<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.519> just

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
middle and a normal Lego stud and just

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.120 
middle and a normal Lego stud and just
place<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.760> right<00:00:30.019> next<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.439> take<00:00:31.650> this

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
place that right next you can take this

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.670 
place that right next you can take this
piece<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:33.500> place<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.640> top<00:00:36.680> somewhere

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
piece and place it just on top somewhere

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.560 
piece and place it just on top somewhere
there

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.850 

8<00:00:42.570> 1<00:00:42.840> by<00:00:42.989> 1<00:00:43.170> plate<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.430> clip<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.620> that<00:00:46.620> can

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
8 1 by 1 plate with a clip then that can

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.889 
8 1 by 1 plate with a clip then that can
go<00:00:47.059> over<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.450> whole<00:00:48.690> bar<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> side<00:00:50.039> just

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
go over this whole bar on the side just

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:59.500 
go over this whole bar on the side just
there<00:00:54.350> next<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> can<00:00:55.590> take<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.840> 1<00:00:57.840> by<00:00:57.870> 1<00:00:58.320> round<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
there next you can take a 1 by 1 round a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.299 
there next you can take a 1 by 1 round a
piece<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> bar<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> Clinton<00:01:02.129> end

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
piece with the bar and the Clinton end

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.580 
piece with the bar and the Clinton end
and<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.030> play<00:01:03.899> set<00:01:04.489> angle<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:06.439> just<00:01:07.439> like

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and just play set angle in it just like

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.660 
and just play set angle in it just like
this<00:01:10.580> just<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:13.549> now<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.909> take<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.650> blue

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
this just there now you can take a blue

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.429 
this just there now you can take a blue
sphere<00:01:17.670> I'll<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.659> place<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.080> underneath

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
sphere I'll just place that underneath

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.740 
sphere I'll just place that underneath
there<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:22.909> tap<00:01:23.909> piece<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.590> place<00:01:26.070> out<00:01:26.280> there

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
there a tap piece and place out there

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.510 
there a tap piece and place out there
and<00:01:28.640> put<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> seafood<00:01:30.210> stud<00:01:30.950> just<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> side

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
and put a seafood stud just on the side

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.249 
and put a seafood stud just on the side
of<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:33.020> just<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.200> that

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
of that just like that

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.380 
of that just like that
next<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.500> take<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:38.250> headpiece<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
next you can take your headpiece and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.600 
next you can take your headpiece and
just<00:01:40.350> place<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.560> upside<00:01:41.220> down<00:01:43.189> just<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.340> this

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.330 

making<00:01:47.610> sure<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> make<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.799> part<00:01:50.130> fall

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
making sure not to make this part fall

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
making sure not to make this part fall
off<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:52.790> to<00:01:53.790> finish<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.210> part<00:01:54.450> off<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.439> can

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
off and to finish this part off you can

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.219 
off and to finish this part off you can
take<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.369> by<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.549> cone<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.990> place<00:01:58.200> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
take a one by one cone and just place it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.420 
take a one by one cone and just place it
on<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> stud<00:01:58.860> right<00:01:59.369> here<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.280> put

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
on the stud right here and you can put

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.639 
on the stud right here and you can put
that<00:02:02.549> aside<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:02.969> now<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:04.200> build<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.469> little

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
that aside for now and to build a little

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.370 
that aside for now and to build a little
Bunsen<00:02:05.189> burner<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:06.030> simply<00:02:06.329> attach<00:02:06.420> flame

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
Bunsen burner just simply attach flame

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.180 
Bunsen burner just simply attach flame
to<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> clip<00:02:09.289> now<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.500> put<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:11.069> your

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
to a clip now you can put that on your

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.450 
to a clip now you can put that on your
table

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460
