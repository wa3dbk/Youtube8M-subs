the<00:00:37.440> years<00:00:37.760> sometimes<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.879> missed<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.210> little

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the years sometimes I missed a little

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.750 
the years sometimes I missed a little
bit<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.469> technical<00:00:41.070> stuff<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.579> I

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
bit out on on the technical stuff but I

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.940 
bit out on on the technical stuff but I
think<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.210> harder<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.440> drop<00:00:43.680> shots

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
think it's harder to just do drop shots

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.369 
think it's harder to just do drop shots
or<00:00:44.190> little<00:00:44.489> angles<00:00:44.910> because<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:46.050> don't<00:00:46.230> have

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
or little angles because you don't have

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.950 
or little angles because you don't have
much<00:00:46.559> time<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.219> anymore<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:48.059> I'd

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
much time to do that anymore but I'd

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.430 
much time to do that anymore but I'd
like<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> little<00:00:49.860> bit<00:00:49.980> more<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.309> that

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
like to see a little bit more of that

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.410
