00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
they were the only thing that stopped me

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.780 
they were the only thing that stopped me
from<00:02:25.290> running<00:02:25.470> further<00:02:25.860> because<00:02:26.250> they

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
from running further because they

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.440 
from running further because they
thought<00:02:27.540> they<00:02:28.200> had<00:02:28.410> popped<00:02:28.739> after<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.489> mile<00:02:30.180> and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
thought they had popped after a mile and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.220 
thought they had popped after a mile and
a<00:02:30.510> half<00:02:30.540> but<00:02:31.170> up<00:02:31.620> until<00:02:31.980> then<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.489> felt

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
a half but up until then it felt

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.630 
a half but up until then it felt
extraordinary<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.380> couldn't<00:02:34.680> believe<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.130> it

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
extraordinary I couldn't believe it it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.940 
extraordinary I couldn't believe it it
felt<00:02:35.910> like<00:02:36.090> somebody<00:02:36.420> was<00:02:36.660> massaging<00:02:37.410> the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
felt like somebody was massaging the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.590 
felt like somebody was massaging the
bottom<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.489> my<00:02:38.640> foot<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:40.280> interestingly<00:02:41.600> most

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
bottom of my foot and interestingly most

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.020 
bottom of my foot and interestingly most
people<00:02:43.019> think<00:02:43.230> it'd<00:02:43.440> be<00:02:43.519> excruciating<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.730> run

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
people think it'd be excruciating to run

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.440 
people think it'd be excruciating to run
on<00:02:45.300> submit<00:02:46.140> barefoot<00:02:46.890> or<00:02:47.130> asphalt<00:02:47.489> barefoot

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
on submit barefoot or asphalt barefoot

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.259 
on submit barefoot or asphalt barefoot
but<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.350> furthest<00:02:50.010> thing<00:02:50.040> from<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.910> just

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
but is a furthest thing from it it just

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.550 
but is a furthest thing from it it just
felt<00:02:51.720> great<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.670> that's<00:02:54.390> my<00:02:54.720> piece<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.170> advice

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
felt great so that's my piece of advice

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
if you're going to run period you might

if you're going to run period you might
like<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.840> try<00:03:01.230> running<00:03:01.769> barefoot<00:03:02.190> on<00:03:02.700> a

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049

challenging surface from time to time so

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.530 
challenging surface from time to time so
that<00:03:06.930> your<00:03:07.200> body<00:03:07.590> can<00:03:07.980> calibrate<00:03:08.340> itself<00:03:09.299> and
