00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.850 
which I it's just cool but it's same
time<00:01:25.690> like<00:01:25.900> I<00:01:25.960> kind<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.200> wish<00:01:26.350> we<00:01:26.380> had<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.620> color

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
time like I kind of wish we had a color

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.590 
time like I kind of wish we had a color
picture<00:01:27.220> just<00:01:27.370> a<00:01:27.520> little<00:01:27.910> tiny<00:01:28.090> bit<00:01:28.210> oh<00:01:28.540> I

think<00:01:28.780> that's<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.260> point<00:01:29.470> because<00:01:29.980> now

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
think that's the point because now

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.340 
think that's the point because now
they're<00:01:30.460> diggities<00:01:31.270> because<00:01:31.870> it's<00:01:32.050> a<00:01:32.170> more

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
they're diggities because it's a more

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.050 
they're diggities because it's a more
comic<00:01:32.710> book<00:01:32.890> universe<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:33.610> know<00:01:33.640> it's<00:01:33.910> like
