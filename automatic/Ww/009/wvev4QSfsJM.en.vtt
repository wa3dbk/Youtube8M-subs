00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
something how is this going to work

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.269

since<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.449> Kinect<00:00:30.779> supposedly<00:00:31.410> can't<00:00:32.040> work

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
since the Kinect supposedly can't work

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.639

this<00:00:41.190> other<00:00:41.340> stuff<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:42.030> he<00:00:42.090> does<00:00:42.270> mention

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
this other stuff but he does mention

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.090 
this other stuff but he does mention
that<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:42.960> completely<00:00:43.379> turn<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
when it is off it is not registering

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.680 
when it is off it is not registering
anything<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.399> top<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:48.030> he<00:00:48.480> also

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
anything but on top of that he also

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.810 
anything but on top of that he also
mentions<00:00:49.320> quote<00:00:49.680> he's<00:00:50.370> talking<00:00:50.700> about

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
something he says like online the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.420 
something he says like online the
console<00:00:54.360> will<00:00:54.660> still<00:00:55.020> function<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.829> Kinect

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
console will still function if Kinect

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.090 
console will still function if Kinect
isn't<00:00:57.059> plugged<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.840> although<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.739> won't<00:00:58.949> be

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
isn't plugged in although you won't be

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
isn't plugged in although you won't be
able<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> use<00:00:59.579> any<00:00:59.820> feature<00:01:00.090> or<00:01:00.359> experience

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
able to use any feature or experience

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.039 
able to use any feature or experience
that<00:01:01.469> explicitly<00:01:02.160> uses<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.510> sensor<00:01:03.899> so

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that explicitly uses the sensor so

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.440 
that explicitly uses the sensor so
according<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.559> him<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.580> Kinect<00:01:06.000> doesn't<00:01:06.330> even

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
according to him the Kinect doesn't even

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.109 
according to him the Kinect doesn't even
have<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.840> plugged<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:07.560> which<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
have to be plugged in now which is a

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.240 
have to be plugged in now which is a
reversal<00:01:09.119> again<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:10.080> Xbox<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.189> I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
reversal again for Xbox one but like I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.500 
reversal again for Xbox one but like I
said<00:01:11.490> they're<00:01:11.640> changing<00:01:11.909> everything<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.390> why

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
said they're changing everything so why

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170 
said they're changing everything so why
not<00:01:12.720> keep<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.080> changing<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.970> Gamescom<00:01:14.970> will

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
not keep on changing and Gamescom will

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.520 
not keep on changing and Gamescom will
probably<00:01:15.689> find<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> little<00:01:16.200> bit<00:01:16.320> more

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
probably find out a little bit more

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.590 
probably find out a little bit more
about<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.340> raises<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.390> couple

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
about this but this raises up a couple

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
about this but this raises up a couple
of<00:01:18.869> different<00:01:19.200> points<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:20.220> now<00:01:20.430> we'll

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
of different points because now we'll

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.450 
of different points because now we'll
Microsoft<00:01:21.540> release<00:01:21.869> an<00:01:21.990> Xbox<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.890> doesn't
