00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.569
 good to all of all welcome 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.070
 same in my channel today I bring you 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.720
 very rich and fresh snack that 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.250
 try this summer and the best 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.230
 super light for all of us 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.639
 We are taking care a little bit, it's very easy 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.530
 and it will not take more than a few minutes 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.740
 have it made so if you are interested in you 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.289
 I encourage you to stay and see her as 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.850
 ingredients we will need 0% yoghurts or 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.210
 of our favorite flavor 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.880
 the doubts that we prefer nuts 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.900
 or cereals and cookies 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.640
 we started and the first thing we will do is 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.460
 choose the amount of cookies that 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.170
 we want we can choose those of 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.520
 all life we can also use 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.800
 oatmeal cookies that is what I 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.780
 I usually use this goes completely to 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.820
 tastes and we leave them as crushed 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.530
 possible in a bowl if we can not do it 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.600
 with a mortar or a blender will be 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.280
 perfect and we have to leave the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.449
 texture that we prefer I like 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.960
 a lot and leave them completely 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.960
 crushed 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.010
 when we get the texture we fill it 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.230
 in the glass as far as we want 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.360
 and pour over the yogurt that we have 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.400
 chosen in this case was 0% of 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.890
 square but flavors sure 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.720
 also it is super rich in this case not 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.430
 I did it but usually interspersed a 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.410
 layer of fruit between the first half of the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.330
 yogurt and then I keep pouring on top 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.010
 of that layer of fruit and to give it the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.900
 final touch we can throw jam in 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.820
 the top part a little cookie 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.740
 something cereal what we 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.420
 we prepare to give it the touch and what 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.160
 I also like very much is to put a 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.380
 little bit of fruit I've been using 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.670
 also on the top and done 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.380
 this and we only have to put it in the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.440
 freezer and it will stay with a texture 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.210
 Frost that I love before I eat it 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.220
 Take it out and put it some time in the fridge 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.840
 because if it does not stay very frozen and 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.930
 this is the simplest way 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.390
 rich and light this summer I hope that 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.250

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.350
