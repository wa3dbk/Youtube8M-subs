whenever<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> range<00:01:03.510> slayer<00:01:03.809> task

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
whenever I have like a range slayer task

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.890 
whenever I have like a range slayer task
I<00:01:04.260> might<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.860> use<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:05.689> defense<00:01:06.689> because

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
I might just use it for defense because

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.179 
I might just use it for defense because
you<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.080> still<00:01:07.260> train<00:01:07.439> defense<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.979> um

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
you can still train defense with it um

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.730 
you can still train defense with it um
and<00:01:09.150> same<00:01:09.360> thing<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.540> my<00:01:10.049> melee<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.470> might

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and same thing with my melee I might

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.590 
and same thing with my melee I might
just<00:01:10.950> end<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.189> using<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.000> defense

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
just end up using you know defense

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.940 
just end up using you know defense
training<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> mean<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.740> don't<00:01:13.890> we

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
I mean it was enjoyable at times but if

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.900

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
he's like the exactly same shit once you

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.520 
he's like the exactly same shit once you
got<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.180> higher<00:04:54.420> levels<00:04:54.840> but<00:04:55.230> there's<00:04:55.440> no

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
got to the higher levels but there's no

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.020

difference<00:04:55.860> between<00:04:55.980> Slayer<00:04:56.520> I<00:04:56.610> like<00:04:56.790> level

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
difference between Slayer I like level
