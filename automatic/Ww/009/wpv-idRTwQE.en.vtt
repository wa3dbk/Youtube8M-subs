00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 because everything went well what was worked 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.250
 in the week 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.330
 we came 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.110
 thinking that we have to make a 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.440
 match from zero to zero and entry as well 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.990
 that went well if I do not know if winning 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.130
 posts I'm preparing for when 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.779
 touch me I'm here to add 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.960
 and good the equipment is very well so 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.460
 we are all in the same law or way 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.570
 sure we already this instance the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.980
 we take very very seriously 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.870
 we knew it was going to be a match 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.240
 rotten complicated but good 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.010
 we had the result in favor 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.740
 and we had worked to have the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.990
 ball of stick to the fire 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.050
 I do not think that these instances have to be 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.000
 face the best those who arrive 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.260
 they are the best that any of 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.260
 the two will be 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.270
 julian congratulations comfortable victory 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.270
 about the cúcuta and already installed in 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.910
 quarterfinals thank god was 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.070
 important you can ratify here at home 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.890
 what was done in cúcuta is the good 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.950
 result that was good for good 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.600
 I left more attentive 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.200
 and I think that in the first half of 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.700
 party was defined then 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.890
 now I have already thought about the next 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.130
 match by league and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.830
 and good happy good anybody clear 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.260
 the team to win 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.050
 first then on the football side 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.190
 that the team went out to do the first 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.590
 what I had to do not 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.600
 regardless of what was a 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.159
 match that was going to win against 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.259
 quotation marks 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.270
 I was very smart also we 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.009
 we despair in no time with the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.700
 ball to the floor with this work when 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.530
 you did not have to try to make pressure and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.830
 Well, fortunately, it is a result 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.050
 positive sure it generates it at home 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.520
 happy if I do not tell you but with your feet 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.950
 on earth I think that in the second 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.710
 time could have been liquidated with more 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.020
 goals because the arrivals were 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.510
 but not just the definition and obviously 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.130
 one always wants to win for many 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.370
 goals no 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.350
 I'm left with a good job in the part 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.820
 defensive first in a match 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.860
 practically that was solved in the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.410
 first time and good already in the second 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.770
 with much more tranquility taking in 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.710
 account 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.330
 and since she keeps winning we try 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.000
 handle the ball but never giving up 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.260
 to want to make more goals could have been 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.520
 more but good satisfied and calm 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.520
 america languages 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.260
 regardless of the rival that comes 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.989
 With a lot of respect 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.890
 we want to transcend in the cup 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.860
 not obviously for the club 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.940
 for the interests if you can say a 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.990
 team is america so they are teams 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.840
 history is a team that fills stadiums 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.270
 but regardless of what he counted 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.100
 As I say, we are with the same 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.170
 you win and the same tit and lord very many 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.730
 thanks and congratulations and we look forward to a 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.730
 very good match against the real that is
