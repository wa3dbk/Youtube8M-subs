the Lego Venator now everybody's excited
about<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.580> Lego<00:00:08.760> Venator<00:00:09.300> because<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.719> comes

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
about the Lego Venator because it comes

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.440 
about the Lego Venator because it comes
with<00:00:09.929> two<00:00:10.290> course<00:00:10.679> aunt<00:00:10.950> guards<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:12.000> may<00:00:12.420> be

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
with two course aunt guards that may be

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.900 
with two course aunt guards that may be
true<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:13.469> does<00:00:13.830> come<00:00:14.130> with<00:00:14.250> two<00:00:14.309> core<00:00:14.639> sont

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
true it does come with two core sont

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.689 
true it does come with two core sont
guards<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.929> I've<00:00:16.109> done<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.619> math<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
guards but I've done the math and the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.740 
guards but I've done the math and the
Lego<00:00:18.539> Venator<00:00:19.160> approximately<00:00:20.160> because<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.300> it

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
Lego Venator approximately because of it

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.710 
Lego Venator approximately because of it
will<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.500> about<00:00:22.910> 1000<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.090> little<00:00:24.480> over<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
will have about 1000 a little over a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.810 
will have about 1000 a little over a
thousand<00:00:25.140> pieces<00:00:25.260> probably<00:00:25.830> because<00:00:26.640> that

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
thousand pieces probably because that

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.130 
thousand pieces probably because that
just<00:00:26.849> makes<00:00:27.180> sense<00:00:27.330> considering<00:00:27.750> how<00:00:27.900> large

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
just makes sense considering how large

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.890 
just makes sense considering how large
it<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.670> I<00:00:29.670> compare<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.330> other<00:00:30.599> pieces

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
it is and I compare that to other pieces

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.540 
it is and I compare that to other pieces
with<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> same<00:00:31.529> amount<00:00:31.650> i'm<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> assume

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
with the same amount i'm going to assume

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.190 
with the same amount i'm going to assume
it's<00:00:32.880> about<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.270> hundred<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.540> fifty<00:00:33.840> dollars

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
it's about one hundred and fifty dollars

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.280 
it's about one hundred and fifty dollars
that's<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.620> safe<00:00:34.829> bet<00:00:34.860> 150<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> 200<00:00:36.300> that's

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
that's a safe bet 150 to 200 that's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.250 
that's a safe bet 150 to 200 that's
pretty<00:00:37.469> safe<00:00:37.739> bet<00:00:37.770> 150<00:00:38.520> now<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.540> lego<00:00:39.960> course

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
pretty safe bet 150 now the lego course

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.979 
pretty safe bet 150 now the lego course
on<00:00:40.410> cards<00:00:40.649> I've<00:00:40.800> made<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.570> taken<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
on cards I've made I have just taken to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.810 
on cards I've made I have just taken to
regular<00:00:43.410> clones<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.950> colored<00:00:44.399> them<00:00:44.610> in

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
regular clones and colored them in

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.069 
regular clones and colored them in
markers<00:00:45.239> now<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.350> am<00:00:47.160> gone<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.210> Sharpie<00:00:48.719> calm

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
markers now I am gone to Sharpie calm

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.319 
markers now I am gone to Sharpie calm
because<00:00:49.500> um<00:00:49.950> sharpies<00:00:50.760> probably<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
because um sharpies probably one of the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.170 
because um sharpies probably one of the
leading<00:00:51.949> permanent<00:00:52.949> markers<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.370> I've

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
leading permanent markers and I've

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.330 
leading permanent markers and I've
compared<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.530> prices<00:00:55.860> i<00:00:55.980> found<00:00:56.250> that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
compared to see that prices i found that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.029 
compared to see that prices i found that
a<00:00:56.430> Sharpie<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.000> about<00:00:57.210> worth<00:00:57.390> fifty<00:00:57.840> cents<00:00:58.199> so

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
a Sharpie is about worth fifty cents so

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.360 
a Sharpie is about worth fifty cents so
i<00:00:59.280> took<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.180> price<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> lego<00:01:01.890> venator

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
i took the price of the lego venator

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.590 
i took the price of the lego venator
which<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.789> about<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> hundred<00:01:03.000> fifty<00:01:03.359> dollars

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
which is about a hundred fifty dollars

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.820 
which is about a hundred fifty dollars
divided<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.379> by<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.220> price<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.909> sharpie<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
divided it by the price of a sharpie and

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.130 
divided it by the price of a sharpie and
I've<00:01:07.830> found<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.770> 300<00:01:10.770> times<00:01:11.100> cheaper

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
I've found that it is 300 times cheaper

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.800 
I've found that it is 300 times cheaper
300<00:01:13.140> times<00:01:13.320> cheaper<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.640> color<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.479> clone

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
300 times cheaper to just color a clone

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.770 
300 times cheaper to just color a clone
in<00:01:16.110> sharpie<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.000> 300<00:01:18.630> times

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
in sharpie that is it is 300 times

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.249 
in sharpie that is it is 300 times
cheaper<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.549> would<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.210> buy<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
cheaper so you would have to buy so you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.820 
cheaper so you would have to buy so you
could<00:01:22.470> make<00:01:22.680> three<00:01:23.720> nope<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.470> don't<00:01:25.710> really

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
could make three nope but I don't really

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.399 
could make three nope but I don't really
know<00:01:26.070> how<00:01:26.100> many<00:01:26.580> clone<00:01:27.570> horizont<00:01:28.020> guards<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
know how many clone horizont guards you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.080 
know how many clone horizont guards you
could<00:01:28.590> make<00:01:28.799> I'd<00:01:29.189> say<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.700> about<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.880> hundred

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
could make I'd say it's about a hundred

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.359 
could make I'd say it's about a hundred
you<00:01:30.479> could<00:01:30.689> make<00:01:31.640> 3,000<00:01:33.560> 3,000<00:01:34.560> course<00:01:35.159> aunt

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you could make 3,000 3,000 course aunt

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.359 
you could make 3,000 3,000 course aunt
guards<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.320> equal<00:01:37.680> about<00:01:37.829> half<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
guards and to just equal about half the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.240 
guards and to just equal about half the
price<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.450> lego<00:01:39.840> vendor<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.040> know

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
price that a lego vendor is so you know

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.770 
price that a lego vendor is so you know
if<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.670> want<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.939> spend<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.210> much<00:01:42.450> money<00:01:42.479> for

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
if you want to spend that much money for

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.810 
if you want to spend that much money for
two<00:01:43.020> corso<00:01:43.470> guards<00:01:43.829> fine<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.729> make

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
two corso guards fine but you can make

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.210 
two corso guards fine but you can make
an<00:01:44.939> entire<00:01:45.210> army<00:01:45.470> for<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> fraction<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
an entire army for a fraction of the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.969 
an entire army for a fraction of the
price<00:01:47.340> that's<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.420> what<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:48.720> saying<00:01:49.079> you
