00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.220
 well it's him everyone these 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.300
 problems when are you going me okay 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.800
 super good today we end up 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.689
 for a new gameplay on call of 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.100
 duty modern warfare 2 and I can you 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.660
 ensure but what does it do 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.070
 good to go back on stage blue and 2 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.380
 me in any case I took a real 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.660
 fun to play recently I've been around 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.070
 and only once and frankly that's it 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.720
 I advise you to return here 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.699
 there is just a little trick maybe 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.000
 that they could bring it down a bit 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.920
 the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 but how to say things it's just 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.309
 the connections will say they are really 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.750
 unstable right now it's pc of 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.370
 Americans I think they 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.660
 american connections precisely there are 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.280
 a lot more English I think you 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.260
 cheek to this game and so that's it for 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.880
 that I there are connections really 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.620
 unstable but that's me I still 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.329
 took a real pleasure to replay ricains 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.250
 that I am in any case I advise you 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.270
 to all returned zee so here is so 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.739
 in this gameplay so I was in 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.540
 search and destruction on the map 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.250
 scrap third of the game with the f 2000 then 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.229
 why emile life frankly live 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.280
 half maybe I'm one of the only 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.479
 players to play with his weapons and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.520
 frankly I find it really very 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.930
 powerful in any case me that at each 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.979
 times I take it it really goes very 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.270
 well, and that's why I tell you 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.160
 advise everyone to play it 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.300
 I put it without accessories what I 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.800
 find a silent 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.119
 I do not know I actually have with a 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.640
 silent already she's not too much of 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.619
 power in normal times add a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.660
 silent would be completely useless 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.979
 and that's why I wanted to put it 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.509
 without accessories with a large charger 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.520
 cape a handle before it goes all 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.039
 only then in high school if not I played 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.440
 with coltane condat otherwise grenade 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.390
 she's paralyzing herself and the centex 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.860
 which makes me feel good otherwise we've all been 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.270
 conjuring trick not going to happen 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.649
 still primordial with this weapon 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.200
 recharge quickly its advantages 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.179
 always 2 he's also going off 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.890
 rather slow loading we will say that 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.080
 that's why it's not happening 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.160
 definitely much more then if not 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.539
 second hit forces 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.990
 of opposition so why force 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.220
 apple 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.319
 it's true she does not have too many 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.869
 power in normal time so that's 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.020
 for that I strive for position and 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.630
 Franchois 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.220
 since already the rate of fire 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.259
 is very very high so suddenly you 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.450
 empty your balls quickly and that's why 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.860
 assure is really your your balls in 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.760
 put force 2 so you're sure 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.319
 to kill the enemy 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.150
 there is no problem and if not 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.040
 third trump I was playing with ninja pro 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.239
 so a pro's ninja of one is in 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.400
 search and destruction so that's 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.620
 primordial is also I play with a 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.989
 headphones in this part so 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.670
 mix the footsteps of your 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.830
 player to that of the enemies you 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.239
 scramble quickly and suddenly you have 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.530
 really likely to make you 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.730
 kill so that's why I have ninja 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.379
 pro and Chinese streaking that I was playing 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.340
 with the drone the predatory missile and 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.400
 the helicopter 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.290
 so here in this video I 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.060
 will talk about several topics already I 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.140
 sends it to qg code and codes cf and 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.430
 maybe other channels 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.349
 community of truth in the editing 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.549
 why I send site via you know 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.480
 that you know because I simply 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.879
 think there is a beautiful originality 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.409
 in the gameplay of the game bungie did not 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.549
 had a lot recently and alive 2000 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.989
 even less so that's why 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.060
 I sent them please me I 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.500
 thank you so much and so that's it 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.269
 in this video I told you about 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.319
 many topics so mini fugiers on 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.970
 can call that in this form 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.859
 so the first one I told you about paris 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.450
 games week is so firstly I 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.159
 will launch the question I'm going to or 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.420
 demanding ask him a question is this 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.099
 that you go to paris games 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.379
 week and if so why are you going there why 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.060
 you go there then me firstly 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.440
 yes so I go to paris games set 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.500
 for several things so the first 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.340
 it's for firstly I think it's 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.720
 primordial is a little why I'm there 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.549
 I'm going to test the next ones 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.079
 games that will come out but also 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.500
 it's to meet members of my 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.700
 team 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.650
 it is true that it is the ideal place 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.750
 to meet in everybody a 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.069
 little goes and suddenly it's rohff it's 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.380
 really cool the power a little is seen 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.299
 irl and that's it's really a 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.010
 meet quite warm and that's 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.389
 really that the nice side of paris games 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.040
 week and so here I advise you 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.590
 to really go there it's true they 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.150
 it's the how to say the element that can 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.680
 to stop going there maybe it can 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.609
 maybe the distance 1 for those who 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.200
 are in the south 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.549
 it's true that it can be a make a 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.599
 bit long journeys unless you 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.919
 are traveling I do not know about 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.900
 paris or maybe on vacation I know 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.430
 not at all but in any case that's otherwise 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.470
 the price of the ticket remains quite 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.180
 accessible we will say he has 9 euros I 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.829
 believe fourteen complaints arrive good 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.750
 it's still we run away make it a little bit 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.099
 what and so that's so then also 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.900
 I do not go there maybe to meet 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.299
 of big youtube who got kidnapped three 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.459
 that big youtuber they go the 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.680
 five days it seems fine and luxey% 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.299
 it would be really nice to be able to 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.190
 talk a little with them and that's when 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.530
 reproached a video their point of view by 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.389
 example on the next black up etc 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.620
 so that's so thank you an answer in 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.599
 the comments that would be really 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.460
 please me that so that could me 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.300
 allow me to fix one will say a 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.280
 overview of 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.379
 what are you going to do paris games 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.030
 week and so that's it so I play 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.159
 closed this subject there the second topic I 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.479
 a bit talked about hour blackhawk then 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.430
 I will talk about what not on this black 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.690
 ops then me recently it's true he 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.979
 there was a lot of gameplay of 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.889
 information that we have been 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.720
 passed on just me and blackhawks 2 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.789
 frankly I really expect it 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.159
 enormously the sludge there are a lot of 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.810
 good points for me who are who 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.340
 feel that is to say that I see 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.509
 really all good on this call of duty and 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.220
 after that, there will definitely be some 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.900
 flaws that's for sure but in any case 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.500
 me there I really expect it with 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.360
 impatience 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.620
 I am one of the people I think 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.150
 he wants I'll buy it in 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.469
 preorder but I 'll see her 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.509
 maybe two three days to the advanced in 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:08.159
 now there are a lot of shops 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.599
 video games that make sense they come out 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.370
 two three days to the advanced in general 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.930
 it had it had done the same for 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.770
 the three ie it had come out of 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.419
 three days to the advanced 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.560
 it was really nice anyway we 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.909
 can not play multi we can not 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.370
 post videos but hey it's by 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:22.110
 people a little tasted the games tested in 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.879
 it can put us in front of taste 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.710
 so that's me then frankly black 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.969
 ops also goes replied in the 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.159
 comments what are you in 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.629
 think of this opus is what you 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.860
 do you think that's what you are there 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.330
 will please you is what will you 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.909
 displease I do not know I 'd like 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.110
 really have your overview your reviews 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.340
 precisely in the comments but I 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.750
 am really this video to have some 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.610
 opinion on some issues that I'm 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.599
 pose is so that would be really 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.250
 nice to answer them 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.719
 so that's it I finished my two 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.800
 topics it's true that this video would have 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.870
 been pretty fast it would have been really a 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.789
 express gameplay but it's true that 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.710
 it's hard enough to put a subject on 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.699
 say on six minutes videos 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.440
 about it's true it's a bit 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.909
 boring by the way because one find 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.710
 a subject on a short term it's a 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:59.460
 little long balloon I'll say but it's
