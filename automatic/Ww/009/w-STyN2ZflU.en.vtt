in<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:01.469> video<00:00:01.770> we're<00:00:01.979> going<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.250> go<00:00:02.399> over<00:00:02.639> two

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
in this video we're going to go over two

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.539 
in this video we're going to go over two
additional<00:00:03.360> concepts<00:00:03.899> in<00:00:04.140> genetics<00:00:04.680> called

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
additional concepts in genetics called

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:15.110 
additional concepts in genetics called
penetrance<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:08.630> expressivity<00:00:13.549> these<00:00:14.549> terms

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
penetrance and expressivity these terms

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.410 
penetrance and expressivity these terms
will<00:00:15.690> help<00:00:15.929> us<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.440> quantify<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
will help us to quantify the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.700 
will help us to quantify the
relationship<00:00:18.420> between<00:00:19.350> genotype<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
relationship between genotype and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.140 
relationship between genotype and
phenotype<00:00:23.930> remember<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.380> genotype<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.490> what

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
phenotype remember that genotype is what

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.640 
phenotype remember that genotype is what
is<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.810> our<00:00:28.170> DNA<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.539> phenotype<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:31.500> we

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
is in our DNA and phenotype is what we

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.910 
is in our DNA and phenotype is what we
see<00:00:31.890> expressed<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> protein<00:00:33.920> so

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
see expressed in the protein so

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
see expressed in the protein so
penetrance<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:35.940> expressively<00:00:36.570> help<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
penetrance and expressively help to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.540 
penetrance and expressively help to
quantify<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.309> transition<00:00:38.879> from<00:00:39.500> DNA<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
quantify this transition from DNA to

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.930 
quantify this transition from DNA to
protein

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.090 

starting<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.170> penetrance<00:00:49.010> penetrance<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
starting with penetrance penetrance is

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.880 
starting with penetrance penetrance is
defined<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> percentage<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.539> people<00:00:51.890> with

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
defined as the percentage of people with

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.209 
defined as the percentage of people with
a<00:00:52.920> particular<00:00:53.129> allele<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:55.160> genotype<00:00:58.219> who

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
a particular allele or genotype who

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.740 
a particular allele or genotype who
express<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.539> phenotype<00:01:02.420> but<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.600> would

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
express the phenotype but we would

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.210 
express the phenotype but we would
expect<00:01:05.270> so<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.840> would<00:01:07.020> imply<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.500> not

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
expect so this would imply that not

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.550 
expect so this would imply that not
everybody<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> particular<00:01:10.200> genotype

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
everybody with a particular genotype

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.190 
everybody with a particular genotype
will<00:01:11.100> necessarily<00:01:11.790> show<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.479> phenotype<00:01:12.780> an

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
will necessarily show that phenotype an

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.530 
will necessarily show that phenotype an
example<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:16.830> found<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.180> disease

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
example can be found in the disease

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:27.499 
example can be found in the disease
osteogenesis<00:01:19.380> imperfecta<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:27.240> kind<00:01:27.450> of

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
osteogenesis imperfecta to kind of

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.200 
osteogenesis imperfecta to kind of
simplify<00:01:27.979> this<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> complicated

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
simplify this so it's a complicated

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.230 
simplify this so it's a complicated
process<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.470> simplify<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.240> basically

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
process but to simplify it basically

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.840 
process but to simplify it basically
there<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> protein<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.829> bones<00:01:35.280> called

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
there is a protein in bones called

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.130 
there is a protein in bones called
collagen<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:38.220> need<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.700> collagen<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
collagen you need this collagen for the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.740 
collagen you need this collagen for the
correct<00:01:40.560> structure<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.460> bones<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.630> you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
correct structure of bones and if you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
correct structure of bones and if you
mess<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> collagen<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.310> mess<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
mess up the collagen you mess up the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.219 
mess up the collagen you mess up the
bones<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:46.250> in<00:01:47.250> collagen<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> lot<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.869> amino

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
bones and in collagen you a lot of amino

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.780 
bones and in collagen you a lot of amino
acids<00:01:49.619> which<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.490> draw<00:01:50.729> as

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
acids which I'm just going to draw as

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.330 
acids which I'm just going to draw as
exes<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:52.020> an<00:01:52.560> amino<00:01:52.860> acid<00:01:52.890> called

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
exes you have an amino acid called

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.660 
exes you have an amino acid called
glycine<00:01:54.170> question<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> small<00:01:55.740> amino<00:01:56.219> acid

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
glycine question is a small amino acid

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.039 
glycine question is a small amino acid
but<00:01:57.710> sometimes<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.950> becomes<00:01:59.189> mutated<00:02:00.030> into<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
but sometimes it becomes mutated into a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.969 
but sometimes it becomes mutated into a
bulky<00:02:01.820> amino<00:02:02.820> acid<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.409> happens

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
bulky amino acid and when that happens

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.570 
bulky amino acid and when that happens
the<00:02:05.460> collagen<00:02:05.909> complex<00:02:06.450> gets<00:02:06.750> distorted

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
the collagen complex gets distorted

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.760 
the collagen complex gets distorted
can't<00:02:08.580> fold<00:02:08.849> properly<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.720> bone<00:02:10.140> development

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
can't fold properly and bone development

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.220 
can't fold properly and bone development
does<00:02:11.009> not<00:02:11.039> proceed<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:12.030> you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
does not proceed as you

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.740 
does not proceed as you
but<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.980> develop<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.760> osteogenesis

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
but and you develop this osteogenesis

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.539 
but and you develop this osteogenesis
imperfecta

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
imperfecta

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.820 
imperfecta
however<00:02:19.519> osteogenesis<00:02:20.519> imperfecta<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:22.110> the

however osteogenesis imperfecta that the
mutation<00:02:23.519> for<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.879> has<00:02:24.209> less<00:02:24.780> than<00:02:24.980> 100%

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
mutation for that has less than 100%

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.780 
mutation for that has less than 100%
penetrance<00:02:28.549> in<00:02:29.549> other<00:02:29.970> words<00:02:30.650> if<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.980> had<00:02:32.340> a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
penetrance in other words if you had a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.490 
penetrance in other words if you had a
hundred<00:02:33.450> people<00:02:34.519> with<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:36.209> mutation<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
hundred people with the mutation in the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.660 
hundred people with the mutation in the
DNA<00:02:38.329> that<00:02:39.329> would<00:02:39.510> make<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.959> think<00:02:40.519> they<00:02:41.519> would

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
DNA that would make you think they would

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.530 
DNA that would make you think they would
that<00:02:42.209> they<00:02:42.329> would<00:02:42.510> get<00:02:42.690> messed<00:02:43.290> up<00:02:43.409> bones<00:02:44.540> that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
that they would get messed up bones that

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.059 
that they would get messed up bones that
doesn't<00:02:45.870> happen<00:02:46.019> because<00:02:47.329> not<00:02:48.329> everybody<00:02:48.750> has

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
doesn't happen because not everybody has

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.470 
doesn't happen because not everybody has
this<00:02:50.239> transition<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:52.500> looked<00:02:53.099> at

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
this transition so looked at

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.390 
this transition so looked at
mathematically<00:02:54.480> let's<00:02:54.720> say<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:55.049> have<00:02:55.400> ten

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
mathematically let's say we have ten

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.750 
mathematically let's say we have ten
people<00:02:58.790> with<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.000> mutation

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
people with that mutation

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.270 
people with that mutation
so<00:03:02.760> they<00:03:02.879> all<00:03:03.030> have<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.900> mutation<00:03:04.049> on<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
so they all have that mutation on the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.289 
so they all have that mutation on the
DNA<00:03:05.819> level<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.950> would<00:03:08.190> make<00:03:08.430> their<00:03:08.670> collagen

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
DNA level that would make their collagen

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.920 
DNA level that would make their collagen
be<00:03:10.260> mutated<00:03:10.910> however<00:03:11.910> let's<00:03:12.480> say<00:03:12.660> I'm<00:03:12.900> just

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
be mutated however let's say I'm just

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.720 
be mutated however let's say I'm just
going<00:03:13.079> to<00:03:13.230> make<00:03:13.349> up<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.590> number<00:03:13.769> let's<00:03:14.579> say

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
going to make up a number let's say

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.610 
going to make up a number let's say
penetrance<00:03:15.980> in<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.220> case<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:18.870> out<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.290> ten<00:03:19.590> of

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
penetrance in this case is out of ten of

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.710 
penetrance in this case is out of ten of
these<00:03:19.829> individuals<00:03:20.489> will<00:03:20.669> actually<00:03:21.239> Express

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
these individuals will actually Express

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.379 
these individuals will actually Express
the<00:03:21.900> phenotype<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.739> even<00:03:23.519> though<00:03:23.760> on<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.120> DNA

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
the phenotype so even though on the DNA

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.339 
the phenotype so even though on the DNA
level<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:25.709> may<00:03:25.859> find<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.540> mutation<00:03:27.540> on<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
level you may find that mutation on the

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.559 
level you may find that mutation on the
phenotype<00:03:28.680> level<00:03:29.310> on<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:30.120> level<00:03:30.389> of<00:03:30.419> the

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
phenotype level on the level of the

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.250 
phenotype level on the level of the
collagen<00:03:31.190> only<00:03:32.190> 60%<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.209> them<00:03:34.519> 60%<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.609> them

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
collagen only 60% of them 60% of them

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.150 
collagen only 60% of them 60% of them
will<00:03:37.260> actually<00:03:37.290> bones

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
will actually bones

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.229 
will actually bones
so<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.150> penetrance<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.959> number<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.530> people

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
so the penetrance is a number of people

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.110 
so the penetrance is a number of people
who<00:03:42.239> actually<00:03:42.480> develop<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.380> phenotype<00:03:44.120> out

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
who actually develop that phenotype out

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.430 
who actually develop that phenotype out
of<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:46.799> sum<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.190> individuals<00:03:48.139> with<00:03:49.139> the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
of the sum of individuals with the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.699 
of the sum of individuals with the
allele<00:03:49.859> so<00:03:50.579> all<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:51.239> these<00:03:51.419> gray<00:03:51.780> dots<00:03:52.169> have

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
allele so all of these gray dots have

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.460 
allele so all of these gray dots have
that<00:03:53.040> allele<00:03:53.400> but<00:03:54.239> only<00:03:54.569> six<00:03:54.959> out<00:03:55.139> of<00:03:55.169> ten<00:03:55.440> of

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
that allele but only six out of ten of

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.900 
that allele but only six out of ten of
them<00:03:55.739> actually<00:03:56.400> had<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.900> improperly

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
them actually had the improperly

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.599 
them actually had the improperly
developed<00:03:59.910> bones<00:04:00.419> okay<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:01.620> that's

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
developed bones okay so that's

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.349 
developed bones okay so that's
penetrance<00:04:03.299> and<00:04:04.459> when<00:04:05.459> look<00:04:05.639> at<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.760> concept

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
penetrance and when look at the concept

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:13.430 
penetrance and when look at the concept
of<00:04:07.069> expressivity<00:04:11.930> we're<00:04:12.930> actually<00:04:13.109> looking

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
of expressivity we're actually looking

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.229 
of expressivity we're actually looking
at<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.949> degree<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.900> degree<00:04:16.349> to<00:04:16.380> which

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
at the degree the degree to which

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.770 
at the degree the degree to which
phenotype<00:04:18.239> is<00:04:19.910> expressed<00:04:21.019> so<00:04:22.019> in<00:04:22.349> this<00:04:22.830> case

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
phenotype is expressed so in this case

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.220 
phenotype is expressed so in this case
we<00:04:24.780> assume<00:04:25.400> 100

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
we assume 100

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.720 
we assume 100
penetrance<00:04:28.230> of<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.770> allele<00:04:29.070> in<00:04:29.340> other<00:04:29.490> words

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
penetrance of the allele in other words

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.390 
penetrance of the allele in other words
if<00:04:30.200> you<00:04:31.200> have<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.710> allele<00:04:34.100> you're<00:04:35.100> going<00:04:35.310> to

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
if you have the allele you're going to

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.360 
if you have the allele you're going to
get<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:36.330> phenotype<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.710> question<00:04:38.250> would

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
get the phenotype the question would

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.690 
get the phenotype the question would
express<00:04:38.820> emily<00:04:39.440> is<00:04:40.440> how<00:04:40.830> much<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.640> that

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
express emily is how much of that

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.500 
express emily is how much of that
phenotype<00:04:42.600> are<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.320> going<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.530> display<00:04:43.970> so<00:04:44.970> as

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
phenotype are you going to display so as

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.070 
phenotype are you going to display so as
an<00:04:45.780> example<00:04:47.390> let's<00:04:48.390> look<00:04:48.510> at<00:04:48.660> a<00:04:48.720> disease

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
an example let's look at a disease

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.960 
an example let's look at a disease
called<00:04:49.500> neurofibromatosis<00:04:53.180> in<00:04:54.380> this<00:04:55.380> disease

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
called neurofibromatosis in this disease

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.820 
called neurofibromatosis in this disease
the<00:04:56.970> people<00:04:57.360> with<00:04:57.570> that<00:04:57.750> allele<00:05:00.230> get<00:05:01.230> as<00:05:01.470> their

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
the people with that allele get as their

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:11.260 
the people with that allele get as their
phenotype<00:05:04.700> tumors<00:05:05.700> in<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:07.740> nervous<00:05:07.950> system

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.260 

so<00:05:12.270> if<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.450> have<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:12.870> allele<00:05:14.060> you're<00:05:15.060> going

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
so if you have the allele you're going

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.660 
so if you have the allele you're going
to<00:05:15.360> get<00:05:15.540> the<00:05:15.690> phenotype<00:05:16.170> in<00:05:16.470> this<00:05:17.070> case<00:05:17.340> if<00:05:17.580> you

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
to get the phenotype in this case if you

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.370 
to get the phenotype in this case if you
have<00:05:17.880> that<00:05:18.120> mutation<00:05:18.270> you're<00:05:18.990> getting<00:05:19.260> at<00:05:19.350> the

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
have that mutation you're getting at the

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.250 
have that mutation you're getting at the
phenotype<00:05:19.860> in<00:05:19.950> other<00:05:20.070> words<00:05:20.250> we<00:05:20.790> know

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
phenotype in other words we know

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.460 
phenotype in other words we know
penetrance<00:05:22.260> to<00:05:22.500> be<00:05:23.120> 100%<00:05:24.120> you're<00:05:24.960> going<00:05:25.320> to

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
penetrance to be 100% you're going to

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.040 
penetrance to be 100% you're going to
get<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.770> phenotype<00:05:26.220> however<00:05:27.090> in<00:05:27.450> this

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
get the phenotype however in this

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.800 
get the phenotype however in this
disease<00:05:28.440> there<00:05:28.920> is<00:05:28.950> variable<00:05:31.760> expressivity

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
disease there is variable expressivity

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.970 
disease there is variable expressivity
in<00:05:33.810> other<00:05:34.590> words<00:05:35.000> some<00:05:36.000> people<00:05:36.740> with<00:05:37.740> that

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
in other words some people with that

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.460 
in other words some people with that
allele<00:05:38.370> will<00:05:38.730> get<00:05:38.910> more<00:05:39.420> sick<00:05:40.050> they'll<00:05:40.320> get

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
allele will get more sick they'll get

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.640 
allele will get more sick they'll get
more<00:05:40.890> tumors<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:41.700> some<00:05:42.690> people<00:05:43.050> will<00:05:43.470> get

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
more tumors and some people will get

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.180 
more tumors and some people will get
less<00:05:44.190> sick<00:05:44.520> you'll<00:05:44.850> get<00:05:45.030> less<00:05:45.780> tumors<00:05:46.320> so<00:05:47.070> if

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
less sick you'll get less tumors so if

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.610 
less sick you'll get less tumors so if
we<00:05:47.310> look<00:05:47.490> at<00:05:47.610> that<00:05:47.780> in<00:05:48.780> sort<00:05:49.230> of<00:05:49.320> a<00:05:49.410> diagram

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
we look at that in sort of a diagram

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.100 
we look at that in sort of a diagram
let's<00:05:50.310> say<00:05:50.580> let<00:05:51.240> me<00:05:51.270> use<00:05:51.600> a<00:05:51.630> purple<00:05:52.290> color<00:05:54.110> to

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
let's say let me use a purple color to

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.380 
let's say let me use a purple color to
represent<00:05:55.590> this<00:05:55.710> mutation<00:05:56.370> and<00:05:56.940> remember<00:05:57.270> we

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
represent this mutation and remember we

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.540 
represent this mutation and remember we
said<00:05:57.540> 100%<00:05:58.140> penetrance<00:05:58.920> we<00:05:59.040> knew<00:05:59.100> if<00:05:59.220> you<00:05:59.250> have

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
said 100% penetrance we knew if you have

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.850 
said 100% penetrance we knew if you have
that<00:05:59.820> mutation<00:06:00.540> you're<00:06:01.080> going<00:06:01.260> to<00:06:01.350> get<00:06:01.500> sick

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
that mutation you're going to get sick

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.280 
that mutation you're going to get sick
but<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.700> size<00:06:03.000> of<00:06:03.950> my<00:06:04.950> mark<00:06:05.340> here<00:06:05.850> is<00:06:06.140> going<00:06:07.140> to

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
but the size of my mark here is going to

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.250 
but the size of my mark here is going to
reflect<00:06:07.920> how<00:06:08.520> six<00:06:09.060> so<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:09.420> bigger<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.720> circle

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
reflect how six so the bigger the circle

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.720 
reflect how six so the bigger the circle
is<00:06:10.440> sicker<00:06:10.680> in<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:10.950> individual<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.520> more

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
is sicker in the individual the more

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.320 
is sicker in the individual the more
tumors<00:06:12.120> they<00:06:12.300> have<00:06:13.010> so<00:06:14.010> all<00:06:14.520> of<00:06:14.880> these<00:06:15.000> people

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
tumors they have so all of these people

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.320 
tumors they have so all of these people
have<00:06:15.630> a<00:06:15.660> mutation<00:06:16.260> and<00:06:16.800> all<00:06:17.700> of<00:06:17.820> these<00:06:17.970> people

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
have a mutation and all of these people

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.820 
have a mutation and all of these people
are<00:06:18.630> sick<00:06:20.000> but<00:06:21.000> some<00:06:21.330> of<00:06:21.480> them<00:06:21.690> are<00:06:21.990> more<00:06:22.410> sick

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
are sick but some of them are more sick

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.970 
are sick but some of them are more sick
than<00:06:24.320> others<00:06:25.320> okay<00:06:26.960> so<00:06:27.960> the<00:06:28.350> size<00:06:28.650> of<00:06:28.890> the

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
than others okay so the size of the

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.390 
than others okay so the size of the
circle<00:06:29.490> representing<00:06:30.590> perhaps<00:06:31.590> a<00:06:31.740> degree<00:06:32.100> to

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
circle representing perhaps a degree to

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.040 
circle representing perhaps a degree to
which<00:06:32.580> they<00:06:32.940> have<00:06:33.090> tumors<00:06:33.540> in<00:06:33.750> the<00:06:33.840> nervous

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
which they have tumors in the nervous

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.010 
which they have tumors in the nervous
system<00:06:34.820> so<00:06:35.820> in<00:06:35.940> this<00:06:36.060> population<00:06:36.480> of<00:06:36.780> ten

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
system so in this population of ten

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.279 
system so in this population of ten
people<00:06:37.290> all<00:06:38.130> ten<00:06:38.970> have<00:06:39.270> the<00:06:39.450> allele

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
people all ten have the allele

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.730 
people all ten have the allele
all<00:06:40.379> ten<00:06:40.979> developed<00:06:41.639> tumors<00:06:41.999> but<00:06:42.599> some<00:06:43.020> got

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
all ten developed tumors but some got

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.679 
all ten developed tumors but some got
more<00:06:44.189> than<00:06:45.029> others

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:45.689 
more than others

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:52.159 
more than others
so<00:06:46.439> to<00:06:46.499> summarize<00:06:50.119> penetrance<00:06:51.119> answers<00:06:51.719> the

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 
so to summarize penetrance answers the

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:57.589 
so to summarize penetrance answers the
question<00:06:53.960> yes<00:06:54.960> or<00:06:55.319> no<00:06:55.979> if<00:06:56.550> they<00:06:57.210> have<00:06:57.389> the

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
question yes or no if they have the

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:59.689 
question yes or no if they have the
allele<00:06:57.899> will<00:06:58.889> there<00:06:59.069> or<00:06:59.279> will<00:06:59.309> they<00:06:59.490> not

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
allele will there or will they not

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.189 
allele will there or will they not
develop<00:07:00.300> the<00:07:00.569> phenotype<00:07:02.749> expressivity<00:07:03.749> on

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 
develop the phenotype expressivity on

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:09.439 
develop the phenotype expressivity on
the<00:07:04.349> other<00:07:04.469> hand<00:07:07.369> answers<00:07:08.369> the<00:07:08.520> question<00:07:08.969> how

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449 
the other hand answers the question how

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:14.059 
the other hand answers the question how
much<00:07:09.899> in<00:07:10.279> this<00:07:11.279> case<00:07:11.520> we<00:07:12.479> we<00:07:13.139> can<00:07:13.289> only<00:07:13.559> define

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:14.069 
much in this case we we can only define

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.089 
much in this case we we can only define
expressivity<00:07:14.849> if<00:07:15.240> we<00:07:15.569> know<00:07:15.839> there<00:07:16.199> to<00:07:16.379> be<00:07:16.499> 100%

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:17.099 
expressivity if we know there to be 100%

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:20.510 
expressivity if we know there to be 100%
penetrance<00:07:18.029> and<00:07:18.409> if<00:07:19.409> we<00:07:19.559> know<00:07:19.740> that<00:07:20.039> we<00:07:20.399> know

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
penetrance and if we know that we know

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.059 
penetrance and if we know that we know
they<00:07:20.699> must<00:07:20.939> get<00:07:21.119> the<00:07:22.080> phenotype<00:07:22.680> really

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:23.069 
they must get the phenotype really

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:25.309 
they must get the phenotype really
particularly<00:07:23.699> all<00:07:23.849> but<00:07:24.089> the<00:07:24.180> question<00:07:24.569> is<00:07:24.719> how

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 
particularly all but the question is how

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.189 
particularly all but the question is how
much<00:07:25.919> will<00:07:26.339> that<00:07:26.490> allele<00:07:26.849> actually<00:07:27.629> be

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 
much will that allele actually be

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:29.059 
much will that allele actually be
expressed

00:07:29.059 --> 00:07:29.069 
expressed

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:31.489 
expressed
so<00:07:29.219> penetrance<00:07:29.789> is<00:07:29.909> yes<00:07:30.180> or<00:07:30.360> no<00:07:30.499> expose

00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:31.499 
so penetrance is yes or no expose

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:34.369 
so penetrance is yes or no expose
ability<00:07:31.830> is<00:07:32.039> how<00:07:32.610> much<00:07:32.969> and<00:07:33.330> that<00:07:33.959> concludes

00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:34.379 
ability is how much and that concludes

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:38.029 
ability is how much and that concludes
our<00:07:34.589> video<00:07:35.180> discussing<00:07:36.180> these<00:07:36.389> two<00:07:37.039> concepts

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 
our video discussing these two concepts

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:41.510 
our video discussing these two concepts
which<00:07:38.699> help<00:07:38.939> us<00:07:39.089> to<00:07:39.149> quantify<00:07:39.949> the<00:07:40.949> genotype

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 
which help us to quantify the genotype

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.879 
which help us to quantify the genotype
to<00:07:42.509> phenotype<00:07:43.879> relationship
