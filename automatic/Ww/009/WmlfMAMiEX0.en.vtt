wrestling<00:01:26.520> does<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.570> from<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
wrestling does now from what I

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.770 
wrestling does now from what I
understand<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.070> don't<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.820> TNA<00:01:30.390> having

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
understand I don't really see TNA having

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.080 
understand I don't really see TNA having
the<00:01:30.869> same<00:01:31.110> schedule<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.430> global<00:01:32.909> force

the same schedule as global force

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.390 
the same schedule as global force
wrestling<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.560> think<00:01:34.650> Dixie<00:01:35.100> might<00:01:35.250> have

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.399 
wrestling so I think Dixie might have
pulled<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> powerplay<00:01:36.210> or<00:01:36.840> maybe<00:01:37.079> Dixie

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
pulled the powerplay or maybe Dixie

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.200 
pulled the powerplay or maybe Dixie
