00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
your chipboard my chipboard corners are

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.090 
your chipboard my chipboard corners are
cut<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:41.760> my<00:00:42.110> crop-a-dile<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
cut with my crop-a-dile this is the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.189 
cut with my crop-a-dile this is the
corner<00:00:44.370> Chomper<00:00:46.010> so<00:00:47.010> rather<00:00:47.280> than<00:00:47.750> cutting<00:00:48.750> at

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
corner Chomper so rather than cutting at

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.779 
corner Chomper so rather than cutting at
a<00:00:49.379> straight<00:00:49.739> angle<00:00:49.770> across<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.000> corner<00:00:51.480> just

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
a straight angle across the corner just

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.060 
a straight angle across the corner just
curve<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.930> corner<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
curve the corner you can just do it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.060 
curve the corner you can just do it
quite<00:00:56.430> roughly<00:00:57.170> with<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.350> scissors<00:00:58.590> and

quite roughly with your scissors and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.170 
quite roughly with your scissors and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and where the curve starts just cut some

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.500 
and where the curve starts just cut some
V's<00:01:11.159> into<00:01:11.939> your<00:01:12.119> paper<00:01:13.460> scissors

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
V's into your paper scissors

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.500

but cut so that you're about 1/8 of an
inch<00:01:18.600> away<00:01:18.870> from<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:20.690> chipboard<00:01:21.690> don't<00:01:22.110> cut

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
inch away from the chipboard don't cut

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:37.070 
inch away from the chipboard don't cut
right<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.840> I've<00:01:34.560> left<00:01:34.970> about<00:01:36.050> 3/4<00:01:37.050> of

three-quarters of an inch ID to leave

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.730 
three-quarters of an inch ID to leave
because<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.150> people<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.510> I<00:01:45.600> cover<00:01:45.900> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
because the people that I cover the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.400 
because the people that I cover the
piece<00:01:46.980> with<00:01:47.250> will<00:01:47.850> always<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.690> quarter<00:01:49.260> of
