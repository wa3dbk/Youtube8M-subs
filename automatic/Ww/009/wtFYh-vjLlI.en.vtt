00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
got all the electrics toward out

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.819 
got all the electrics toward out
basically<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> I've<00:00:49.410> mentioned<00:00:49.649> before

I'm a lot of the stuff had a lot of

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.460 
I'm a lot of the stuff had a lot of
safety<00:01:39.090> she<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.200> didn't<00:01:40.409> have

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
safety she don't know that I didn't have

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.990 
safety she don't know that I didn't have

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
for instance the kickstand that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.310 
for instance the kickstand that
doesn't<00:01:45.420> let<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.600> stand<00:01:45.840> unless<00:01:46.079> the

kickstand<00:01:46.799> up<00:01:47.630> which<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.869> pretty<00:01:49.140> weird<00:01:49.409> but

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
kickstand up which is pretty weird but

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.359 
kickstand up which is pretty weird but
I'll<00:01:50.270> what<00:01:51.270> else<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.619> clutch<00:01:52.890> sensor

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
I'll what else the the clutch sensor

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.819 
I'll what else the the clutch sensor
which<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:54.509> Leon<00:01:54.930> handlebar<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.590> turn<00:01:55.740> in

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
which is on Leon handlebar to turn in

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.480 
which is on Leon handlebar to turn in
death<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.280> how<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.420> open<00:01:57.570> up<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.159> fuse<00:01:59.159> box

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
death so how do you open up the fuse box

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.800 
death so how do you open up the fuse box
and<00:02:00.110> cut<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> few<00:02:01.380> wires<00:02:02.270> join<00:02:03.270> them<00:02:03.390> back<00:02:03.570> up

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
and cut a few wires join them back up

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.530 
and cut a few wires join them back up
use<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.770> wiring<00:02:05.070> diagram<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:06.060> someone's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
use the wiring diagram that someone's

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.819 
use the wiring diagram that someone's
put<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.049> internet<00:02:07.350> which<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.500> really

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
put on the internet which is really

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.960 
put on the internet which is really
handy

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
handy

wise and she liked that extended the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.560 
wise and she liked that extended the
that's<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.530> positive<00:02:17.870> battery<00:02:18.870> terminal<00:02:20.570> but

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
that's the positive battery terminal but

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.860 
that's the positive battery terminal but
