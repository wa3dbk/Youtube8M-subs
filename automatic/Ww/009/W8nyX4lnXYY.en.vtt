00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
when studying classification it's kind

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.500 
when studying classification it's kind
of<00:00:06.750> annoying<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.529> teach<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.980> because<00:00:08.510> when

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
of annoying to teach it because when

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.470 
of annoying to teach it because when
life<00:00:09.540> started<00:00:10.280> it<00:00:11.280> forgot<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.030> make<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
life started it forgot to make a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.419 
life started it forgot to make a
textbook<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> make<00:00:13.559> things<00:00:13.799> nice<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.070> simple

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
textbook to make things nice and simple

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.880 
textbook to make things nice and simple
and<00:00:14.670> easy<00:00:14.910> for<00:00:15.089> us<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.719> instead<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.740> just

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
and easy for us and instead of just

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.130 
and easy for us and instead of just
having<00:00:17.220> maybe<00:00:17.699> one<00:00:18.000> kingdom<00:00:18.449> or<00:00:18.570> two<00:00:18.720> kingdoms

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
having maybe one kingdom or two kingdoms

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.260 
having maybe one kingdom or two kingdoms
or<00:00:19.320> three<00:00:19.500> kingdoms<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.550> winds<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.090> having

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
or three kingdoms it winds up having

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.019 
or three kingdoms it winds up having
this<00:00:21.510> mess<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.560> when<00:00:23.400> people<00:00:23.789> started

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
this mess and when people started

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.400 
this mess and when people started
studying<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.539> they<00:00:24.689> said<00:00:24.900> okay<00:00:25.199> there's

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
studying it they said okay there's

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.320 
studying it they said okay there's
plants<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:25.980> animals<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.789> other<00:00:26.939> people<00:00:27.210> came

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
plants and animals and other people came

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.359 
plants and animals and other people came
along<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:28.410> about<00:00:28.500> things<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:28.830> fungi

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
along so what about things like fungi

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.980 
along so what about things like fungi
they<00:00:29.550> don't<00:00:29.730> they're<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.539> plants

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
they don't they're not really plants

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.510 
they don't they're not really plants
because<00:00:31.140> they<00:00:31.260> don't<00:00:31.830> make<00:00:31.980> their<00:00:32.130> own<00:00:32.160> food

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
because they don't make their own food

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.880 
because they don't make their own food
and<00:00:32.790> then<00:00:33.450> people<00:00:34.110> eventually<00:00:34.350> came<00:00:34.649> up<00:00:34.680> with

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and then people eventually came up with

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.910 
and then people eventually came up with
a<00:00:34.920> five<00:00:35.219> kingdom<00:00:35.640> system<00:00:36.350> well<00:00:37.350> unfortunately

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
a five kingdom system well unfortunately

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.369 
a five kingdom system well unfortunately
that<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.850> falling<00:00:39.180> by<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.329> wayside<00:00:39.600> too

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that is falling by the wayside too

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.350 
that is falling by the wayside too
but<00:00:40.950> we're<00:00:41.100> left<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.550> mess<00:00:41.850> called<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
but we're left with this mess called the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.760 
but we're left with this mess called the
protists<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.930> used<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.230> all<00:00:43.410> gathered

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
protists they used to be all gathered

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.619 
protists they used to be all gathered
together<00:00:43.890> into<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:44.489> big<00:00:44.520> happy<00:00:45.149> kingdom

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
together into one big happy kingdom

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.510 
together into one big happy kingdom
called<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.020> protists<00:00:46.410> kingdom<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.309> now

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
called the protists kingdom but now

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.029 
called the protists kingdom but now
everybody's<00:00:48.450> saying<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:49.140> they're<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.620> one

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
everybody's saying but they're not one

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.439 
everybody's saying but they're not one
big<00:00:50.280> kingdom<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:50.879> are<00:00:50.940> actually<00:00:51.239> this

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
big kingdom there are actually this

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.160 
big kingdom there are actually this
whole<00:00:51.899> mess<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.160> lots<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.610> other<00:00:53.789> kingdoms<00:00:54.449> but

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
whole mess of lots of other kingdoms but

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.099 
whole mess of lots of other kingdoms but
we<00:00:55.320> still<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.250> talk<00:00:56.789> about<00:00:57.000> them<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.809> I'm

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
we still like to talk about them so I'm

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.720 
we still like to talk about them so I'm
gonna<00:00:58.230> go<00:00:58.500> through<00:00:58.770> some<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> basics<00:00:59.609> of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
gonna go through some of the basics of

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.150 
gonna go through some of the basics of
the<00:01:00.030> protists<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.020> protists<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.770> kind<00:01:02.039> of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the protists the protists can be kind of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.429 
the protists the protists can be kind of
subdivided<00:01:02.789> into<00:01:03.000> two<00:01:03.420> major<00:01:03.750> groups<00:01:04.080> but

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
subdivided into two major groups but

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.620 
subdivided into two major groups but
what<00:01:04.619> those<00:01:04.799> groups<00:01:05.129> all<00:01:05.400> share<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.090> that

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
what those groups all share is that

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.140 
what those groups all share is that
they're<00:01:06.780> eukaryotes<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.850> they<00:01:08.850> reproduce

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
they're eukaryotes and they reproduce

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.109 
they're eukaryotes and they reproduce
mainly<00:01:09.990> asexually<00:01:10.890> using<00:01:11.159> mitosis<00:01:11.760> that

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
mainly asexually using mitosis that

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.399 
mainly asexually using mitosis that
doesn't<00:01:12.360> mean<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.510> they<00:01:12.720> can't<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.140> meiosis

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
doesn't mean that they can't do meiosis

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.830 
doesn't mean that they can't do meiosis
some<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.950> them<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.490> usually<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.479> reserve

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
some of them do but usually they reserve

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.450 
some of them do but usually they reserve
meiosis<00:01:16.170> which<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> ever<00:01:16.950> made

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
meiosis which it ever made

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.980 
meiosis which it ever made
meiosis<00:01:17.880> which<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> correct

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
meiosis which is the correct

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.620 
meiosis which is the correct
pronunciation<00:01:19.430> they<00:01:20.430> use<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.970> primarily

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
pronunciation they use that primarily

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.780 
pronunciation they use that primarily
for<00:01:21.960> extreme<00:01:22.530> circumstances<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:23.640> that's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
for extreme circumstances because that's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.380 
for extreme circumstances because that's
sexual<00:01:24.240> reproduction<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.990> they<00:01:25.799> figure<00:01:26.390> hey

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
sexual reproduction and they figure hey

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.840 
sexual reproduction and they figure hey
if<00:01:27.420> I'm<00:01:27.900> reproducing<00:01:28.439> asexually<00:01:28.670> life<00:01:29.670> is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
if I'm reproducing asexually life is

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.819 
if I'm reproducing asexually life is
good<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.210> me<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.900> clone<00:01:31.170> myself<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
good for me so if I clone myself a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.410 
good for me so if I clone myself a
sexually<00:01:32.340> life<00:01:32.759> will<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:33.000> good<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.329> my

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
sexually life will be good for my

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.359 
sexually life will be good for my
descendants<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.290> only<00:01:34.470> when<00:01:34.680> life<00:01:34.860> starts

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
descendants it's only when life starts

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.580 
descendants it's only when life starts
to<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:35.579> bad<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.030> they<00:01:36.119> say<00:01:36.270> oh<00:01:36.420> my<00:01:37.259> genes

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
to get bad that they say oh my genes

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.620 
to get bad that they say oh my genes
aren't<00:01:37.770> good<00:01:37.979> enough<00:01:38.340> maybe<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:39.119> try<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> new

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
aren't good enough maybe I can try a new

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.800 
aren't good enough maybe I can try a new
combination<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.530> time<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.920> some<00:01:41.070> sex

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
combination it's time to have some sex

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.480 
combination it's time to have some sex
they<00:01:42.810> range<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.439> size<00:01:43.680> from<00:01:43.710> unicellular

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
they range in size from unicellular

they range in size from unicellular

kingdom<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.829> they're<00:01:53.670> huge<00:01:54.329> they<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.840> be

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
kingdom and they're huge they can be

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.090 
kingdom and they're huge they can be
over<00:01:55.470> 150<00:01:56.310> feet<00:01:56.490> long<00:01:56.790> now<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:58.500> two<00:01:58.890> major

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
over 150 feet long now the two major

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.730 
over 150 feet long now the two major
groups<00:01:59.369> are<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> protozoa<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.570> their<00:02:01.560> name

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
groups are the protozoa and their name

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740 
groups are the protozoa and their name
means<00:02:01.979> early<00:02:02.430> animals<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.299> they're<00:02:03.479> in

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
means early animals and they're in

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.350 
means early animals and they're in
general<00:02:04.469> or<00:02:04.560> heterotrophic<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.969> then

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
general or heterotrophic and then

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.819 
general or heterotrophic and then
there's<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.719> algae<00:02:07.079> which<00:02:07.259> are<00:02:07.409> generally

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
there's the algae which are generally

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.800 
there's the algae which are generally
autotrophic<00:02:08.520> heterotrophic<00:02:09.300> means<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.690> you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
autotrophic heterotrophic means that you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.839 
autotrophic heterotrophic means that you
hunt<00:02:10.080> down<00:02:10.259> other<00:02:10.590> things<00:02:10.920> need<00:02:11.160> consume<00:02:11.640> them

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
hunt down other things need consume them

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.080 
hunt down other things need consume them
for<00:02:12.030> their<00:02:12.150> food<00:02:12.709> autotrophic<00:02:13.709> mean

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
for their food autotrophic mean

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.339 
for their food autotrophic mean
that<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.300> generally<00:02:14.690> make<00:02:14.720> your<00:02:14.959> own<00:02:15.110> food

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
that you generally make your own food

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.199 
that you generally make your own food
but<00:02:15.920> what<00:02:16.069> you'll<00:02:16.220> find<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:16.849> is<00:02:17.000> one<00:02:17.120> of

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
but what you'll find and this is one of

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.900 
but what you'll find and this is one of
the<00:02:17.269> reasons<00:02:17.569> why<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:18.440> grouping<00:02:19.430> hasn't

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
the reasons why this grouping hasn't

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.059 
the reasons why this grouping hasn't
really<00:02:20.150> worked<00:02:20.180> out<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.019> well<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.800> some

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
really worked out so well is that some

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.920 
really worked out so well is that some
of<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.220> protozoa<00:02:22.519> yeah<00:02:23.120> they'll<00:02:23.480> eat<00:02:23.780> other

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
of the protozoa yeah they'll eat other

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.570 
of the protozoa yeah they'll eat other
things<00:02:24.050> but<00:02:24.620> they<00:02:24.860> may<00:02:25.010> also<00:02:25.040> do<00:02:25.400> some

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
things but they may also do some

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.660 
things but they may also do some
photosynthesis<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.980> sometimes<00:02:27.980> some<00:02:28.550> of

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
photosynthesis and sometimes some of

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.420 
photosynthesis and sometimes some of
them<00:02:28.819> will<00:02:28.970> eat<00:02:29.470> some<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> algae<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.250> then

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
them will eat some of the algae and then

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.300 
them will eat some of the algae and then
use<00:02:32.090> them<00:02:32.330> as<00:02:32.540> reserve<00:02:33.310> photosynthetic

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
use them as reserve photosynthetic

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.550 
use them as reserve photosynthetic
organisms<00:02:35.060> inside<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.599> themselves<00:02:36.110> while

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
organisms inside of themselves while

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.740 
organisms inside of themselves while
continuing<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.340> eat<00:02:37.519> other<00:02:37.700> things<00:02:37.819> it's<00:02:38.480> kind

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
continuing to eat other things it's kind

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.869 
continuing to eat other things it's kind
of<00:02:38.810> freaky<00:02:39.260> weird<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:40.220> let's<00:02:40.430> take<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.610> look<00:02:40.790> at

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
of freaky weird so let's take a look at

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.199 
of freaky weird so let's take a look at
the<00:02:40.940> protozoa

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
the protozoa

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.600 
the protozoa
they<00:02:44.209> are<00:02:44.629> a<00:02:44.690> very<00:02:45.170> diverse<00:02:45.610> organization

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
they are a very diverse organization

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.990 
they are a very diverse organization
they<00:02:47.299> include<00:02:47.720> things<00:02:47.959> ranging<00:02:48.230> from<00:02:48.530> amoeba

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
they include things ranging from amoeba

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.620 
they include things ranging from amoeba
to<00:02:50.000> slime<00:02:50.599> molds<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:52.400> things<00:02:53.209> called

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
to slime molds to things called

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.960 
to slime molds to things called
Paramecium<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.980> used<00:02:55.250> little<00:02:55.519> cilia<00:02:55.849> to

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
Paramecium that used little cilia to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.360 
Paramecium that used little cilia to
move<00:02:56.150> around<00:02:56.470> while<00:02:57.470> within<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.890> algae<00:02:58.250> you

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
move around while within the algae you

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.670 
move around while within the algae you
get<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.760> wide<00:02:59.329> range<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.900> things<00:03:00.049> ranging<00:03:00.319> from

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
get a wide range of things ranging from

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.949 
get a wide range of things ranging from
the<00:03:00.890> green<00:03:01.129> algae<00:03:01.370> which<00:03:01.819> are<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.269> ancestors

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
the green algae which are the ancestors

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.250 
the green algae which are the ancestors
to<00:03:02.989> our<00:03:03.230> modern<00:03:03.560> land<00:03:03.769> plants<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:05.360> glass

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
to our modern land plants to the glass

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.670 
to our modern land plants to the glass
cell<00:03:07.190> walled<00:03:07.780> diatoms<00:03:08.780> which<00:03:08.930> are<00:03:09.349> a<00:03:09.379> major

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
cell walled diatoms which are a major

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.990 
cell walled diatoms which are a major
photosynthetic<00:03:10.959> organism<00:03:11.959> in<00:03:12.079> our<00:03:12.200> oceans<00:03:13.099> to

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
photosynthetic organism in our oceans to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.930 
photosynthetic organism in our oceans to
things<00:03:14.690> as<00:03:14.870> big<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.620> huge<00:03:16.069> and<00:03:16.370> multicellular

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
things as big and huge and multicellular

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.780 
things as big and huge and multicellular
as<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.660> brown<00:03:17.870> algae<00:03:18.109> so<00:03:18.889> as<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.250> can<00:03:19.400> see<00:03:19.609> the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
as the brown algae so as you can see the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.059 
as the brown algae so as you can see the
protists<00:03:20.180> Kingdom<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:20.750> huge<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.799> that's<00:03:21.859> why

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
protists Kingdom is huge and that's why

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.160 
protists Kingdom is huge and that's why
nobody<00:03:22.430> really<00:03:22.730> uses<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.269> anymore<00:03:23.540> except<00:03:24.019> as

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
nobody really uses it anymore except as

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.829 
nobody really uses it anymore except as
a<00:03:24.200> matter<00:03:24.440> of<00:03:24.530> convenience
