key as you can see opens a lot and I

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.620 
key as you can see opens a lot and I
take<00:00:16.439> that<00:00:16.590> out<00:00:16.830> now<00:00:17.130> making<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.939> bump<00:00:18.119> key<00:00:18.240> from

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
take that out now making a bump key from

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.920 
take that out now making a bump key from
scratch<00:00:19.520> you<00:00:20.520> need<00:00:20.610> to<00:00:20.790> be<00:00:20.939> lining<00:00:21.330> up<00:00:21.689> these

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
scratch you need to be lining up these

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.909 
scratch you need to be lining up these
with<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.349> pins<00:00:23.419> right<00:00:24.419> now<00:00:24.810> these<00:00:25.680> are<00:00:25.829> the

an easy way of making a bump key for a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.299 
an easy way of making a bump key for a
lot<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.030> you've<00:00:36.180> got<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> I'm<00:00:37.739> lining<00:00:38.010> that

up<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:38.930> yeah<00:00:40.129> you<00:00:41.129> see<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.550> key<00:00:41.820> each<00:00:42.269> point

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
up there yeah you see the key each point

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.889 
up there yeah you see the key each point
on<00:00:43.199> that<00:00:43.890> key<00:00:44.219> I'm<00:00:44.879> lining<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.719> those

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
on that key I'm lining up with those

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.590 
on that key I'm lining up with those
holes<00:00:46.289> those<00:00:47.219> holes<00:00:47.550> are<00:00:47.760> where<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.030> pins<00:00:48.300> are

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
holes those holes are where the pins are

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.739 
holes those holes are where the pins are
inside<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.499> lock<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:51.089> make<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.300> bump<00:00:51.629> key

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
inside the lock so to make a bump key

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.059 
inside the lock so to make a bump key
for<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.469> lock<00:00:52.800> using<00:00:53.609> the<00:00:53.909> lee<00:00:54.030> hsien<00:00:54.089> color

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:55.069 
for this lock using the lee hsien color

00:00:55.069 --> 00:01:01.399 
for this lock using the lee hsien color
you'd<00:00:56.069> need<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:57.289> basically<00:00:59.089> go<00:01:00.089> out<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:01.109> make

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
you'd need to basically go out and make

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.559 
you'd need to basically go out and make
a<00:01:01.469> bump<00:01:01.800> key<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.550> eat<00:01:02.729> where<00:01:03.059> each<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.449> these

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
a bump key to eat where each of these

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.610 
a bump key to eat where each of these
lenses<00:01:04.640> yeah<00:01:05.640> coming<00:01:06.180> down<00:01:06.479> right<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.440> this

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
lenses yeah coming down right now this

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.580 
lenses yeah coming down right now this
bottom<00:01:08.010> ridge<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:09.630> goes<00:01:09.810> into<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.350> key

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
bottom ridge here that goes into the key

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.060 
bottom ridge here that goes into the key
way<00:01:11.659> basically<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:12.930> these<00:01:13.200> peaks<00:01:13.620> to<00:01:13.920> be

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
way basically you want these peaks to be

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.499 
way basically you want these peaks to be
as<00:01:14.189> low<00:01:14.399> as<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
as low as this one here on the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.609 
as low as this one here on the
right-hand<00:01:15.719> side<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.310> what<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.850> do

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
right-hand side so what you have to do

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.249 
right-hand side so what you have to do
yes<00:01:19.619> ok<00:01:20.280> what<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> need<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.780> line<00:01:22.049> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
yes ok what you need to do is line that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.520 
yes ok what you need to do is line that
up<00:01:22.290> there<00:01:23.450> what<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.479> would<00:01:24.750> probably<00:01:24.899> do<00:01:25.289> is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
up there what I would probably do is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.700 
up there what I would probably do is
Mark<00:01:25.890> them<00:01:26.270> with<00:01:27.270> something<00:01:27.600> let's<00:01:28.289> see<00:01:28.530> what

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
keys where each of the peaks was tiny

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.590 
keys where each of the peaks was tiny
lying<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.909> I'm<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.179> pause<00:01:54.390> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the pins should be yeah they spin on the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.300 
the pins should be yeah they spin on the
left<00:02:09.420> ear<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.500> pin<00:02:10.679> at<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.830> other<00:02:11.039> side

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
left ear and the pin at the other side

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.070 
left ear and the pin at the other side
of<00:02:11.340> virtually<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> sizes<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.690> want<00:02:12.930> them<00:02:13.050> to

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
of virtually the sizes you want them to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.590 
of virtually the sizes you want them to
be<00:02:13.320> virtually<00:02:13.890> right<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.250> barn<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.240> I'm<00:02:15.360> going

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.699 
be virtually right the barn so I'm going
to<00:02:15.660> do<00:02:15.810> now<00:02:16.140> using<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.190> Lee's<00:02:17.370> yonkers<00:02:18.709> yeah
