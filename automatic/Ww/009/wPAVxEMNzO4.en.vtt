00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.730
 second stage of this great loop 2011 a time trial by teams of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.369
 23 kilometers around essarts exercise enjoyed by spectators 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.749
 but dreaded by the runners 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.900
 however the gaps should not be huge tonight because the 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.430
 course does not present great difficulties 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.630
 the first team to launch and the saxo bank of alberto contador 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.220
 contador who can not really hope to get back today 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.160
 are they not really cut out for the effort 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.490
 the evidence after the first score already no one is going to let go 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.950
 on arrival the first reference time and 25 minutes these 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.970
 seconds 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.999
 this time we will hold until the passage that the rabobank 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.839
 led by louis 76 spain champion of the time trial team 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.570
 Dutch first in first points after 9 km 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.890
 a trend that will be confirmed and upon arrival robert gesink's team 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.350
 set a new reference time in 25 minutes 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.020
 as the kidney cervélo well intends to improve favorites of this 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.930
 chrono with those I forget the director who is champion of 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.290
 United States time trial and what's more is already improving this 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.140
 second the first intermediate 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.719
 an advance that will grow 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.189
 at the second score bush can not wait she would count seconds of advanced on the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.260
 rabobank time a gap that will hold until the end 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.740
 and the girl ends in 24 minutes 48 seconds 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.980
 the astana them last team to have won a time trial by 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.550
 teams in 2009 will break their teeth on this chrono which is not the 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.430
 case of the skye team passing to the first intermediary with a second advance 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.050
 medina this pass rate and boasson hagen are not legs but does he have it all 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.680
 even four seconds late on the second late score ends 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.140
 identity on the line 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.020
 yann thomas it will not be yellow tonight 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.700
 and on it said to leave less quickly than the girls ditto for htc 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.610
 it must be said that it starts badly for the teammates of cavendish who go 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.120
 see bernard etienne boutet bitume from the first kilometers of what 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.509
 disorganize them and despite a good final no better time for them 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.350
 two American teams 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.230
 now only the leopard-treck of andy schleck the bmc of cadel evans is 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.470
 and the omega pharma-lotto of the yellow jersey philippe gilbert post encore 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.989
 hope to do better than the girl 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.290
 but the illusion is going to be short-lived for the leader of the general who 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.599
 sees his team go 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.749
 26 seconds behind after only 9 kilometers 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.259
 on the other hand the leopard trek which bmc are in the coup but not 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.769
 enough to delight the win to the kids cervélo who wins this 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.889
 team time trial with 4 seconds advanced on the bmc team and 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.639
 the team skai the yellow jersey so change poles tonight posés here the 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.389
 new leader of the general and norwegian it is called time when 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:43.749
