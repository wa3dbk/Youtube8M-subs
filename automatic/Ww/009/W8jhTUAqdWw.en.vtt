around<00:01:17.710> it's<00:01:18.710> very<00:01:18.920> simple<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.940> know<00:01:20.030> i

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
around it's very simple you know i

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.690 
around it's very simple you know i
didn't<00:01:20.479> go<00:01:20.690> too<00:01:20.750> technical<00:01:21.560> with<00:01:21.680> it<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:22.100> just

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
didn't go too technical with it I just

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.690 
didn't go too technical with it I just
pin<00:01:22.970> pieces<00:01:23.540> up<00:01:23.720> but<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.290> trick<00:01:24.500> here<00:01:24.740> is<00:01:24.800> when

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
pin pieces up but the trick here is when

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.180 
pin pieces up but the trick here is when
I<00:01:25.729> pin<00:01:26.030> my<00:01:26.060> pin<00:01:26.479> curls<00:01:26.750> up<00:01:26.900> I<00:01:27.110> chose<00:01:27.890> one

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
I pin my pin curls up I chose one

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.240 
I pin my pin curls up I chose one
direction<00:01:28.640> for<00:01:29.270> one<00:01:29.420> section<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.050> I<00:01:30.710> did<00:01:31.160> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
direction for one section and I did the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.770 
direction for one section and I did the
opposite<00:01:31.580> direction<00:01:31.700> for<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.150> other<00:01:32.300> section

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
opposite direction for the other section

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.660 
opposite direction for the other section
to<00:01:33.200> give<00:01:33.350> me<00:01:33.470> sort<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:33.890> finger<00:01:34.190> wave<00:01:34.340> look

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
to give me sort of a finger wave look

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.270 
to give me sort of a finger wave look
without<00:01:35.540> having<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.200> wet<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.710> hair<00:01:36.860> down<00:01:37.070> and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
without having to wet the hair down and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.740 
without having to wet the hair down and
literally<00:01:38.180> manipulate<00:01:38.690> it<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:41.060> I'm<00:01:41.540> going<00:01:41.720> to

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
literally manipulate it so I'm going to

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.160 
literally manipulate it so I'm going to
take<00:01:41.990> my<00:01:42.830> pin<00:01:43.040> curls<00:01:43.310> down<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.850> start<00:01:44.780> forming

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
take my pin curls down and start forming

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.430 
take my pin curls down and start forming
them<00:01:45.320> now<00:01:46.150> so<00:01:47.150> as<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.330> can<00:01:47.450> see<00:01:47.660> right<00:01:47.690> now<00:01:47.900> I'm

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
them now so as you can see right now I'm

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.740 
them now so as you can see right now I'm
already<00:01:49.280> starting<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.850> form<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.300> pincurls

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
already starting to form the pincurls

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.570 
already starting to form the pincurls
that<00:01:51.020> I've<00:01:51.140> placed<00:01:51.800> in<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.040> hair<00:01:52.220> in<00:01:52.430> the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
that I've placed in the hair in the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.830 
that I've placed in the hair in the
direction<00:01:54.670> going<00:01:55.670> from<00:01:55.970> left<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.330> right<00:01:56.420> and

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
direction going from left to right and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.780 
direction going from left to right and
then<00:01:57.770> right<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:58.130> left

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.670 

the<00:02:02.790> way<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.030> i<00:02:03.120> created<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.570> set<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.200> bring

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
the way that i created this set to bring

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.830 
the way that i created this set to bring
it<00:02:04.770> more<00:02:04.890> modern<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.850> didn't<00:02:06.420> give<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.570> so

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
it more modern is I didn't give it so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.199 
it more modern is I didn't give it so
much<00:02:06.900> volume<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.830> top<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:08.820> creating

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
much volume on the top and I'm creating

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.000 
much volume on the top and I'm creating
a<00:02:09.270> volume<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> bottom<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.740> give<00:02:11.039> texture

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.150 

then<00:02:17.010> I'm<00:02:17.280> going<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.520> turn<00:02:17.670> her<00:02:17.850> around<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
then I'm going to turn her around and

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.030 
then I'm going to turn her around and
repeat<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.190> same<00:02:20.280> steps<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:20.910> other<00:02:21.060> side

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
repeat the same steps on the other side

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.500 
repeat the same steps on the other side
so<00:02:23.040> i<00:02:23.070> didn't<00:02:23.370> get<00:02:23.430> confused<00:02:23.910> i<00:02:24.120> worked<00:02:24.360> with

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
so i didn't get confused i worked with

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.480 
so i didn't get confused i worked with
three<00:02:24.780> simple<00:02:25.080> sections<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:26.010> being<00:02:26.340> my

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
three simple sections this being my

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.300 
three simple sections this being my
first<00:02:27.170> over<00:02:28.170> here<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> left<00:02:28.860> side<00:02:29.010> being

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
first over here on the left side being

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.550 
first over here on the left side being
my<00:02:29.459> second<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.209> in<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.660> back<00:02:30.870> being<00:02:31.200> my<00:02:31.320> third

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
my second and in the back being my third

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.420 
my second and in the back being my third
and<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:34.440> helps<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.830> give<00:02:34.950> me<00:02:35.070> sort<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.340> a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
and that helps to give me sort of a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.830 
and that helps to give me sort of a
pattern<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:35.940> don't<00:02:36.120> get<00:02:36.209> lost<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
pattern so I don't get lost in the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.070 
pattern so I don't get lost in the
middle<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.170> my<00:02:37.350> set<00:02:37.650> or<00:02:38.690> where<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.720> know<00:02:39.810> where

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
middle of my set or where I know where

sections<00:04:39.610> in<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.790> back<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.330> my<00:04:40.420> sub<00:04:40.690> section

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
sections in the back and my sub section

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.240 
sections in the back and my sub section
and<00:04:41.320> maybe<00:04:42.310> three<00:04:42.670> in<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:42.940> front<00:04:44.250> because

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
and maybe three in the front because

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.130 
and maybe three in the front because
it's<00:04:45.520> really<00:04:45.790> about<00:04:45.880> expressing<00:04:46.420> my<00:04:46.720> clients

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
it's really about expressing my clients

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.890 
it's really about expressing my clients
inner<00:04:47.320> beauty<00:04:47.590> as<00:04:48.150> opposed<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.330> creating<00:04:49.480> it

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
inner beauty as opposed to creating it

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.370 
inner beauty as opposed to creating it
with<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.170> hair<00:04:50.580> in<00:04:51.580> a<00:04:52.540> way<00:04:52.660> of<00:04:52.810> maybe<00:04:53.080> like<00:04:53.350> a

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
with the hair in a way of maybe like a

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.270 
with the hair in a way of maybe like a
helmet<00:04:53.650> looking<00:04:54.130> look<00:04:55.530> so<00:04:56.530> this<00:04:56.710> is<00:04:56.860> my<00:04:57.010> look

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
helmet looking look so this is my look

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.270 
helmet looking look so this is my look
maybe<00:04:57.820> if<00:04:58.210> my<00:04:58.720> client<00:04:59.140> wanted<00:04:59.410> some<00:04:59.620> soft<00:04:59.920> ways

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
maybe if my client wanted some soft ways

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.130 
maybe if my client wanted some soft ways
if<00:05:00.850> she<00:05:01.210> didn't<00:05:01.450> really<00:05:01.630> know<00:05:01.780> where<00:05:01.960> she

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
if she didn't really know where she

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.440 
if she didn't really know where she
wanted<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:02.440> go<00:05:02.590> with<00:05:02.950> it<00:05:03.010> you<00:05:03.880> can<00:05:03.910> use<00:05:04.180> this<00:05:04.300> as

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.840 
wanted to go with it you can use this as
a<00:05:04.480> black<00:05:04.780> tie<00:05:05.140> look<00:05:05.560> or<00:05:05.890> even<00:05:06.550> just<00:05:06.580> walking

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
a black tie look or even just walking

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.180 
a black tie look or even just walking
around<00:05:07.150> on<00:05:07.420> the<00:05:07.480> street<00:05:08.850> next<00:05:10.830> I'm<00:05:11.830> going<00:05:11.890> to
