00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
file ready to put into the code that we

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.210 
file ready to put into the code that we
use<00:00:17.449> now<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.630> your<00:00:18.770> panorama<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.920> now<00:00:20.039> all

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
use now that your panorama is now all

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.189 
use now that your panorama is now all
assembled<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.789> ready<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.060> go<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.960> have<00:00:22.080> to

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
assembled and ready to go we have to

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.720 
assembled and ready to go we have to
just<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> couple<00:00:22.740> things<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.250> Photoshop

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
just do a couple things in Photoshop

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
first you need to flip the canvas

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.609 
first you need to flip the canvas
horizontally<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.269> get<00:00:27.420> an<00:00:27.480> image<00:00:27.599> or<00:00:28.349> take

ahead and save right now we're ready to
go<00:00:53.550> into<00:00:53.699> flash<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.570> i<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.809> new<00:00:54.960> project

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
go into flash so i have a new project

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.200 
go into flash so i have a new project
opened<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.100> first<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.340 
opened here and first I'm going to
change<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> dimensions<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> stage<00:01:00.350> so

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
change the dimensions of the stage so

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.609 
change the dimensions of the stage so
what<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.559> had<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.829> looked<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.309> 28<00:01:02.879> 28<00:01:03.210> x<00:01:03.390> 14<00:01:03.840> 14

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:19.560 

ok<00:01:09.049> and<00:01:10.049> we're<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> import<00:01:10.920> our<00:01:11.250> picture

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.469 

I'm<00:01:20.080> also<00:01:20.260> going<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.560> resize<00:01:20.950> our<00:01:21.460> photo<00:01:22.210> to

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
I'm also going to resize our photo to

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:31.770 
I'm also going to resize our photo to
its<00:01:22.630> correct<00:01:22.900> dimensions<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:31.180> set<00:01:31.690> the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
its correct dimensions and then set the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.740 
its correct dimensions and then set the
x<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.110> y<00:01:32.260> coordinates<00:01:32.760> 200<00:01:33.760> so<00:01:34.030> it's<00:01:34.180> exactly

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
x and y coordinates 200 so it's exactly

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.310 
x and y coordinates 200 so it's exactly
centered<00:01:35.200> on<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:36.580> stage<00:01:36.820> all<00:01:37.780> right<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.200> now

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
centered on the stage all right and now

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:49.050 
centered on the stage all right and now
we're<00:01:38.500> going<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.860> save<00:01:44.910> library<00:01:46.860> pano<00:01:48.060> and

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
we're going to save library pano and

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.540 
we're going to save library pano and
then<00:01:49.960> we're<00:01:50.050> going<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.229> test<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.560> movie<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.369> go

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
then we're going to test the movie so go

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:01.020 
then we're going to test the movie so go
to<00:01:51.610> control<00:01:52.890> test<00:01:53.890> movie<00:01:59.700> all<00:02:00.700> right<00:02:00.880> then

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
to control test movie all right then

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.090 
to control test movie all right then
this<00:02:01.180> comes<00:02:01.420> up<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:02.710> ahead<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:02.860> close<00:02:03.039> that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
this comes up go ahead and close that

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.219 
this comes up go ahead and close that
out<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.960> what<00:02:05.920> that<00:02:06.100> does<00:02:06.250> when<00:02:06.580> we<00:02:07.080> save<00:02:08.080> and

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
out and what that does when we save and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.949 
out and what that does when we save and
control<00:02:08.530> test<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:09.239> automatically<00:02:10.239> generates

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
control test it automatically generates

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.590 
control test it automatically generates
a<00:02:11.019> flash<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.650> swift<00:02:11.890> file<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:16.209> here<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.570> can

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
a flash and a swift file so here you can

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.690 
a flash and a swift file so here you can
see<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.930> flash<00:02:17.290> file<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.220> Swift<00:02:18.489> file

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
see the flash file in the Swift file

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.449 
see the flash file in the Swift file
that<00:02:19.150> we<00:02:19.209> just<00:02:19.239> generated<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:21.130> now<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.400> we

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
that we just generated so now that we
