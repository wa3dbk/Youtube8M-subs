original Nintendo DS it's been kind of a

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.690 
original Nintendo DS it's been kind of a
bumpy<00:01:13.360> ride<00:01:13.570> for<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:13.990> asphalt<00:01:14.190> franchise<00:01:15.190> the

by<00:01:17.619> critics<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.220> I<00:01:18.729> think<00:01:18.940> that's<00:01:19.119> partly

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
by critics and I think that's partly

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.120 
by critics and I think that's partly
because<00:01:19.750> they're<00:01:20.140> so<00:01:20.320> unoriginal

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
because they're so unoriginal

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.880 
because they're so unoriginal
I<00:01:21.280> mean<00:01:21.670> if<00:01:21.940> Need<00:01:22.330> for<00:01:22.360> Speed<00:01:22.690> and<00:01:23.320> burnout

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
I mean if Need for Speed and burnout

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.859 
I mean if Need for Speed and burnout
just<00:01:24.220> crashed<00:01:24.909> into<00:01:25.210> each<00:01:25.420> other<00:01:25.659> and

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
just crashed into each other and

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.560 
just crashed into each other and
cataclysmic<00:01:26.770> speeds<00:01:27.220> you<00:01:27.820> could<00:01:28.030> basically

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
cataclysmic speeds you could basically

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.230 
cataclysmic speeds you could basically
pull<00:01:28.810> asphalt<00:01:29.440> from<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.830> fiery<00:01:30.159> rubble<00:01:30.729> of

pull asphalt from the fiery rubble of
course<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.960> other<00:01:32.110> problem<00:01:32.680> has<00:01:32.830> been<00:01:33.040> that

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
course the other problem has been that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.700 
course the other problem has been that
the<00:01:33.460> games<00:01:33.670> just<00:01:34.030> aren't<00:01:34.299> very<00:01:34.360> good<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:35.080> even

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
the games just aren't very good and even
