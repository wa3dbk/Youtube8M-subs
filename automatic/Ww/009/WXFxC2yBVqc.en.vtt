00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
but if this is a bit dirty just get a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.249 
but if this is a bit dirty just get a
brush<00:01:25.190> like<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:25.729> dustpan<00:01:26.179> and<00:01:26.209> brush<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.720> clean

that<00:01:27.470> off<00:01:27.849> if<00:01:28.849> this<00:01:29.119> builds<00:01:29.569> up<00:01:29.690> with<00:01:30.170> material

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:30.349 
that off if this builds up with material

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:32.440 
that off if this builds up with material
firstly<00:01:31.310> your<00:01:31.459> suction<00:01:31.849> is<00:01:31.940> going<00:01:32.179> to<00:01:32.300> be

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
firstly your suction is going to be

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.930 
firstly your suction is going to be
reduced<00:01:33.110> but<00:01:33.860> secondly<00:01:34.399> what's<00:01:34.759> going<00:01:34.910> to

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
reduced but secondly what's going to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.510 
reduced but secondly what's going to
happen<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.390> your<00:01:35.539> little<00:01:35.750> motor<00:01:36.020> inside<00:01:36.890> the

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
happen is your little motor inside the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.190 
happen is your little motor inside the
handpiece<00:01:37.910> is<00:01:38.179> going<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.509> run<00:01:38.630> hotter<00:01:38.899> and

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
handpiece is going to run hotter and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.010 
handpiece is going to run hotter and
you're<00:01:39.679> going<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:39.860> wear<00:01:40.009> it<00:01:40.039> out<00:01:40.250> sooner<00:01:41.020> now

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
you're going to wear it out sooner now

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.339 
you're going to wear it out sooner now
this<00:01:42.470> part<00:01:42.770> here<00:01:43.119> this<00:01:44.119> has<00:01:44.330> been<00:01:44.599> cleaned<00:01:44.959> but

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
this part here this has been cleaned but

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.229 
this part here this has been cleaned but
it's<00:01:45.500> starting<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:45.950> get<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.069> bit<00:01:46.220> old<00:01:46.399> when<00:01:47.209> it

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:47.239 
it's starting to get a bit old when it

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:50.740 
it's starting to get a bit old when it
starts<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:47.959> get<00:01:48.920> all<00:01:49.069> fluffy<00:01:49.459> like<00:01:49.640> this<00:01:49.849> it's

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
starts to get all fluffy like this it's

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.570 
starts to get all fluffy like this it's
going<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.170> develop<00:01:51.289> little<00:01:51.739> holes<00:01:51.950> very<00:01:52.280> soon

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
going to develop little holes very soon

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.430 
going to develop little holes very soon
and<00:01:52.789> that<00:01:53.390> will<00:01:53.509> allow<00:01:53.750> too<00:01:54.080> much<00:01:54.110> material

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
and that will allow too much material

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.070 
and that will allow too much material
through<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.429> motor<00:01:55.640> again<00:01:55.940> once<00:01:56.899> you're

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
through to the motor again once you're

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.169 
through to the motor again once you're
starts<00:01:57.470> look<00:01:57.649> like<00:01:57.860> this<00:01:58.069> I<00:01:58.250> would<00:01:58.819> toss<00:01:59.030> it

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
starts look like this I would toss it

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.510 
starts look like this I would toss it
out<00:01:59.270> but<00:02:00.020> up<00:02:00.140> until<00:02:00.289> this<00:02:00.649> point<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.340> can

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
out but up until this point you can

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.020 
out but up until this point you can
quite<00:02:01.759> easily<00:02:01.789> clean<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:02.599> now<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.349> built<00:02:03.679> in

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
quite easily clean this now the built in

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.740 
quite easily clean this now the built in
it<00:02:05.030> has<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.509> built-in<00:02:05.899> cleaner<00:02:06.319> like<00:02:06.800> this

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
it has a built-in cleaner like this

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.180 
it has a built-in cleaner like this
which<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:08.899> great<00:02:09.170> for<00:02:09.379> cleaning<00:02:09.770> off<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.920> big

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
which is great for cleaning off the big

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.740 
which is great for cleaning off the big
stuff<00:02:10.459> but<00:02:10.970> it's<00:02:11.120> still<00:02:11.300> going<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.569> leave

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
stuff but it's still going to leave

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.080 
stuff but it's still going to leave
material<00:02:12.590> here<00:02:12.800> so<00:02:13.310> if<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.489> happen<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.820> have

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
material here so if you happen to have

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.330 
material here so if you happen to have
another<00:02:14.330> vacuum<00:02:14.900> lying<00:02:15.320> around<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.830> give

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
looking like this it's too thin and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.720 
looking like this it's too thin and
you're<00:02:21.709> going<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.890> need<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.190> replace<00:02:22.310> that
