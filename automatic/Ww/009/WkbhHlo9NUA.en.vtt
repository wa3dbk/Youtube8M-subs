00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.820 
saying I'm not sure if the skills will
be<00:07:18.690> that<00:07:18.840> useful<00:07:19.020> for<00:07:19.259> me<00:07:19.319> tonight<00:07:19.590> but<00:07:19.710> I

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.830 
be that useful for me tonight but I

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.680 
be that useful for me tonight but I
think<00:07:19.979> the<00:07:20.039> fighters<00:07:20.400> guild<00:07:20.550> might<00:07:20.789> be<00:07:20.910> more

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.690 
think the fighters guild might be more

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:28.520 
think the fighters guild might be more
beneficial<00:07:24.349> or<00:07:25.349> even<00:07:25.949> I<00:07:26.250> don't<00:07:27.090> know<00:07:27.530> they're

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.530 
beneficial or even I don't know they're

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.279 
beneficial or even I don't know they're
all<00:07:29.780> situationally<00:07:30.780> useful

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:31.289 
all situationally useful

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:33.200 
all situationally useful

I mean mage light seems like a very very

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.700 
I mean mage light seems like a very very
powerful<00:07:35.270> if<00:07:36.270> you're<00:07:36.419> getting<00:07:36.659> like<00:07:36.810> ganked

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.860 
might be a good idea to to pick the mace
liability<00:07:50.130> just<00:07:50.310> to<00:07:50.430> use<00:07:50.580> it<00:07:50.729> see<00:07:51.569> just<00:07:51.780> to

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:54.630 
reveal them really which might be quite

reveal them really which might be quite
a<00:07:54.659> thing<00:07:54.840> in<00:07:54.930> PvP<00:07:55.349> so<00:07:55.650> if<00:07:55.800> you're<00:07:55.919> my<00:07:56.009> room

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.190 
a thing in PvP so if you're my room

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.159 
a thing in PvP so if you're my room
that's<00:07:56.520> might<00:07:56.759> be<00:07:56.909> where<00:07:57.539> it's<00:07:57.659> very<00:07:57.810> useful

00:07:58.159 --> 00:07:58.169 
that's might be where it's very useful

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:03.040 
that's might be where it's very useful
and<00:07:58.830> here<00:07:59.099> we<00:07:59.159> are<00:07:59.190> we've<00:07:59.550> arrived<00:07:59.909> at<00:08:00.150> sillim

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.050 

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.240 

so<00:08:04.050> I<00:08:04.290> think<00:08:04.350> I<00:08:04.530> should<00:08:04.560> pretend<00:08:04.950> this<00:08:05.100> one

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.250 
so I think I should pretend this one

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.820 
so I think I should pretend this one
here<00:08:05.430> and<00:08:05.610> we'll<00:08:05.940> start<00:08:06.090> the<00:08:06.590> journey<00:08:07.590> in<00:08:07.740> 2

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:07.830
