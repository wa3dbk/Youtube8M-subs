00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
facility and grappling did he he got

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
facility and grappling did he he got
from<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.080> point<00:01:22.490> of<00:01:23.490> 0.5<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.840> what<00:01:25.340> rating<00:01:26.340> would

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
from a point of 0.5 to what rating would

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.800 
from a point of 0.5 to what rating would
you<00:01:26.700> give<00:01:26.909> him<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.420> scale<00:01:28.009> maybe<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.100> 1<00:01:29.810> why

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
you give him on your scale maybe a 1 why

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.670 
you give him on your scale maybe a 1 why
so<00:01:31.350> progress<00:01:32.780> well<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.259> he<00:01:34.470> made

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so progress well it's not that he made

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.590 
so progress well it's not that he made
such<00:01:34.950> little<00:01:35.280> progress<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.119> tremendous

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
such little progress it's a tremendous

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
such little progress it's a tremendous
amount<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.900> work<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.369> he's<00:01:38.610> not

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
amount of work all right so he's not

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.730 
amount of work all right so he's not
exactly<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.810> best<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.140> mean<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.590> his

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
exactly the best I mean that was his

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.859 
exactly the best I mean that was his
defense<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.820> he<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.420> weak<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
defense right that he was so weak that

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.020 
defense right that he was so weak that
he<00:01:43.229> had<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.680> use<00:01:43.860> his<00:01:44.040> gun<00:01:44.250> against<00:01:44.700> Trayvon
