to<00:00:12.150> calculate<00:00:12.719> beat<00:00:13.639> origin<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> sound<00:00:15.830> so

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
to calculate beat origin of the sound so

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.359 
to calculate beat origin of the sound so
put<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.310> top<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.730> trash<00:00:17.970> cans<00:00:18.270> no<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.800> wanted<00:00:20.279> to
