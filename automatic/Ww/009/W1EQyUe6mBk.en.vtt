putting a space a silence in internally
in<00:00:51.899> between<00:00:52.289> them<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:53.430> allows<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
in between them really allows you to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.959 
in between them really allows you to
start<00:00:54.870> listening<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.710> ideas<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
start listening to the ideas that that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.959 
start listening to the ideas that that
come<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.690> from<00:00:57.960> your<00:00:58.250> creative<00:00:59.250> imagination

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
come up from your creative imagination

come up from your creative imagination
and<00:01:00.090> those<00:01:00.210> silences<00:01:01.140> those<00:01:01.320> internal

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and those silences those internal

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.369 
and those silences those internal
silences<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.789> important<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:03.780> so

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
silences are so important because so

much<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.830> improvisation<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.760> about<00:01:06.240> listening

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
much of improvisation is about listening

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.710 
much of improvisation is about listening
inside<00:01:07.530> yourself<00:01:08.210> once<00:01:09.210> you've<00:01:09.390> done<00:01:09.659> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
inside yourself once you've done that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
inside yourself once you've done that
song<00:01:10.850> then<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.890> play<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.220> note<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
song then you can play it a note and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.510 
song then you can play it a note and
then<00:01:15.450> listen<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.290> next<00:01:16.560> note<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.220> wants

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
then listen for the next note that wants

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.060 
then listen for the next note that wants
to<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.790> played<00:01:18.270> or<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:19.290> you're<00:01:19.530> singing<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
next note that wants to be some and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.480 
next note that wants to be some and
allow<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:23.850> wherever<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.869> wants<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.250> let

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
allow it to go wherever it wants so let

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.490 
allow it to go wherever it wants so let

even sure exactly what mode it was but

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.990 
even sure exactly what mode it was but
that's<00:03:15.829> what<00:03:16.159> what<00:03:16.280> are<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.459> cool<00:03:16.670> things

about<00:03:17.180> self<00:03:17.569> expressive<00:03:18.140> improvisation<00:03:19.040> you

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
about self expressive improvisation you

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.309 
about self expressive improvisation you
just<00:03:19.430> kind<00:03:19.640> of<00:03:19.670> let<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.299> music<00:03:20.540> take<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.110> over

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
just kind of let the music take you over

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.910 
just kind of let the music take you over
and<00:03:21.500> do<00:03:21.859> what<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.129> wants<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.459> do<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:25.190> thing<00:03:25.489> was

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
and do what it wants to do the thing was

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.250 
and do what it wants to do the thing was
for<00:03:27.920> me<00:03:28.069> when<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.340> started<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.750> think<00:03:30.109> about

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
for me when I started to think about

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.309 
for me when I started to think about
what<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:30.950> next<00:03:31.129> don't<00:03:31.430> ought<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:32.030> be<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:33.019> I

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
what the next don't ought to be that I

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.270 
what the next don't ought to be that I
let<00:03:34.280> go<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.879> thought<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.390> listened<00:03:36.379> to

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
let go of that thought and listened to

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.539 
let go of that thought and listened to
hear<00:03:37.940> what<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.299> next<00:03:38.599> note<00:03:38.810> should<00:03:39.349> be<00:03:39.590> and

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
hear what the next note should be and

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.309 
hear what the next note should be and
sometimes<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.150> was<00:03:41.269> very<00:03:41.480> clear<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.840> me<00:03:41.989> and

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
sometimes it was very clear to me and

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.770 
sometimes it was very clear to me and
sometimes<00:03:43.069> like<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:43.879> think<00:03:44.150> we<00:03:44.329> say<00:03:44.450> after<00:03:44.569> the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
sometimes like I think we say after the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.220 
sometimes like I think we say after the
first<00:03:45.069> few<00:03:46.069> notes<00:03:46.599> it<00:03:47.599> was<00:03:47.720> clear<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:47.989> there

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
first few notes it was clear that there

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.949 
first few notes it was clear that there
was<00:03:48.349> a<00:03:48.409> rest<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:49.099> the<00:03:50.060> music<00:03:50.359> was<00:03:50.480> making<00:03:50.870> a

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
was a rest that the music was making a

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.000 
was a rest that the music was making a
phrase<00:03:51.640> all<00:03:52.640> these<00:03:52.940> things<00:03:53.209> are<00:03:53.419> are

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
phrase all these things are are

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.170 
phrase all these things are are
