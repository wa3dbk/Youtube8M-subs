nail polishes now I start putting some
drops<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.210> polish<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.230> water<00:00:46.579> first<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.820> put

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
drops of polish in the water first I put

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.200 
drops of polish in the water first I put
two<00:00:48.239> drops<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.050> same<00:00:49.230> color<00:00:49.850> then<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> put

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
two drops of the same color then I put

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.049 
two drops of the same color then I put
one<00:00:51.480> drop<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.410> color<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.070> another<00:00:53.730> drop

one drop of one color and another drop

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.779 
one drop of one color and another drop
with<00:00:54.329> another<00:00:54.719> color<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.190> doesn't<00:00:56.579> spread

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
with another color if it doesn't spread

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.750 
with another color if it doesn't spread
out<00:00:56.910> use<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> dotting<00:00:58.079> tool<00:00:58.109> turn<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.280> around<00:00:59.399> in

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
out use a dotting tool turn it around in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.039 
out use a dotting tool turn it around in
the<00:00:59.789> water<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.899> spreads<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.440> circles<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
the water so it spreads the circles and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.830 
the water so it spreads the circles and
I<00:01:04.049> go<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.070> enough<00:01:05.339> space<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.630> water

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
I go on if I have enough space the water

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.359 
I go on if I have enough space the water
marble<00:01:07.110> technique<00:01:07.439> should<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:07.950> done<00:01:08.130> quickly

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
marble technique should be done quickly

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.109 
marble technique should be done quickly
because<00:01:09.090> nail<00:01:09.540> polish<00:01:09.930> dries<00:01:10.200> quite<00:01:10.770> quickly

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
because nail polish dries quite quickly

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.030 
because nail polish dries quite quickly
then<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> use<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> dotting<00:01:13.290> tool<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.740> draw

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
then I use a dotting tool to draw

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.670 
then I use a dotting tool to draw
several<00:01:14.430> lines<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.110> them<00:01:16.409> join

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
several lines and I have them join

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.060 
several lines and I have them join
together<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.000> center<00:01:18.270> or<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.080> end<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
together at the center or at the end to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.830 
together at the center or at the end to
make<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> simple<00:01:20.700> water<00:01:20.909> marble<00:01:21.030> design<00:01:21.360> as

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
make the simple water marble design as

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.820 
make the simple water marble design as
you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.979> make<00:01:23.369> several<00:01:23.790> petals<00:01:24.799> then<00:01:25.799> I

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you can see I make several petals then I

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.640 
you can see I make several petals then I
use<00:01:26.040> an<00:01:26.280> artificial<00:01:26.759> nail<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:28.110> real<00:01:28.350> nail

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
use an artificial nail or my real nail

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.039 
use an artificial nail or my real nail
as<00:01:28.920> you'll<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.369> later<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.939> dip<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
as you'll see later I dip it in the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.380 
as you'll see later I dip it in the
water<00:01:31.259> marble<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.610> blow<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> surface

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
water marble and I blow on the surface

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
water marble and I blow on the surface
of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> water<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.960> make<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.350> dry<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> can

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
of the water to make it dry so I can

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.890 
of the water to make it dry so I can
remove<00:01:35.549> what's<00:01:35.909> left<00:01:36.030> quite<00:01:36.659> easily<00:01:38.689> then<00:01:39.689> I

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
remove what's left quite easily then I

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.020 
remove what's left quite easily then I
remove<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.500> artificial<00:01:40.890> nail<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
remove the artificial nail out of the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.700 
remove the artificial nail out of the
water<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.020> simple<00:01:43.380> water<00:01:43.560> marble

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
water to get the simple water marble

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.819 
water to get the simple water marble
design<00:01:44.280> as<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.390> now<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:46.560> show

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
design as you can see now I will show

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.830 
design as you can see now I will show
you<00:01:46.890> how<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.159> spread<00:01:47.610> out<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> drop<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.360> nail

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
you how to spread out a drop of nail

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.590 
you how to spread out a drop of nail
polish<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.680> doesn't<00:01:50.130> spread<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.329> drop

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
polish that doesn't spread if your drop

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.240 
polish that doesn't spread if your drop
is<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.840> water<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.560> more<00:01:52.740> than<00:01:52.890> five<00:01:53.070> minutes

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
is in water for more than five minutes

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.700 
is in water for more than five minutes
it's<00:01:53.640> obvious<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.450> gonna<00:01:54.630> be<00:01:54.810> dry<00:01:54.960> but

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
it's obvious that it's gonna be dry but

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.249 
it's obvious that it's gonna be dry but
if<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.520> drop<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.270> doesn't<00:01:57.810> spread

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
if you just drop it and doesn't spread

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.880 
if you just drop it and doesn't spread
out<00:01:58.369> just<00:01:59.369> use<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> dotting<00:02:00.060> tool<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.630> turn<00:02:01.619> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
out just use a dotting tool and turn it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.310 
out just use a dotting tool and turn it
around<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> water<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:04.049> will

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
around in the water like this this will

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.890 
around in the water like this this will
spread<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.860> drop<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.340> nail

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
spread the drop of nail

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.710 
spread the drop of nail
and<00:02:06.410> now<00:02:06.920> I<00:02:06.950> add<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.610> second<00:02:07.970> color<00:02:08.180> in<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
and now I add the second color in the

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.930 
and now I add the second color in the
water<00:02:08.900> it's<00:02:09.590> also<00:02:09.860> important<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.400> protect

to<00:03:10.489> make<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.880> spiral<00:03:11.390> design<00:03:11.660> with<00:03:12.470> two<00:03:12.500> nail

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
to make the spiral design with two nail

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.460 
to make the spiral design with two nail
polishes<00:03:13.520> or<00:03:13.700> more<00:03:13.940> using<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.720> same<00:03:15.050> method

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
polishes or more using the same method

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.250 
polishes or more using the same method
open<00:03:16.340> your<00:03:16.489> nail<00:03:16.700> polish<00:03:17.120> bottle<00:03:17.510> before<00:03:18.140> you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
open your nail polish bottle before you

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.710 
open your nail polish bottle before you
start<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.459> will<00:03:19.700> allow<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.239> gain<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.510> few

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
start and will allow you to gain a few

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.050 
start and will allow you to gain a few
seconds<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:21.440> very<00:03:21.739> important<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:23.030> I

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
seconds and it's very important so I

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.060 
seconds and it's very important so I
make<00:03:23.360> several<00:03:23.600> circles<00:03:24.200> in<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.500> water<00:03:24.709> like

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
make several circles in the water like

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.890 
make several circles in the water like
the<00:03:25.220> first<00:03:25.459> one<00:03:25.700> if<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.270> doesn't<00:03:26.630> spread<00:03:26.810> out

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
the first one if it doesn't spread out

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.199 
the first one if it doesn't spread out
use<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.320> dotting<00:03:27.770> tool<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.220> turn<00:03:28.610> it<00:03:28.790> around<00:03:28.880> in

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
use a dotting tool and turn it around in

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.050 
use a dotting tool and turn it around in
the<00:03:29.330> water<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.770> can<00:03:30.920> now<00:03:31.130> go<00:03:31.459> on<00:03:31.700> with<00:03:31.730> the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
the water and you can now go on with the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.110 
the water and you can now go on with the
other<00:03:32.239> circles<00:03:33.130> it's<00:03:34.130> important<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.730> make<00:03:34.910> as

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
other circles it's important to make as

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.030 
other circles it's important to make as
many<00:03:35.300> circles<00:03:35.780> as<00:03:35.959> you<00:03:36.080> can<00:03:36.290> for<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.560> spiral

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
many circles as you can for the spiral

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.520 
many circles as you can for the spiral
design<00:03:37.190> if<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.209> don't<00:03:38.450> have<00:03:38.720> enough<00:03:39.020> circles

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
design if you don't have enough circles

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.060 
design if you don't have enough circles
it<00:03:39.770> won't<00:03:40.070> look<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.280> great<00:03:41.770> then<00:03:42.770> I<00:03:42.800> use<00:03:43.040> a

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
it won't look that great then I use a

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.400 
it won't look that great then I use a
dotting<00:03:43.640> tool<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.910> draw<00:03:44.330> a<00:03:44.360> spiral<00:03:44.780> in<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
dotting tool to draw a spiral in the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.550 
dotting tool to draw a spiral in the
water<00:03:46.060> don't<00:03:47.060> do<00:03:47.270> it<00:03:47.390> too<00:03:47.600> fast<00:03:47.870> or<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.380> will

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
water don't do it too fast or it will

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.440 
water don't do it too fast or it will
make<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.920> whole<00:03:49.100> design<00:03:49.489> move<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.180> won't

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
make the whole design move and it won't
