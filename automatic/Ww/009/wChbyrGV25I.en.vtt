00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.580
 Y 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.150
 hello everyone today let's explain how 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.370
 use the mail that comes by default 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.670
 in mac is a mail manager the 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.080
 quite powerful although some do not know 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.350
 very well use all your 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.720
 features a few days ago google 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.460
 announced that he was buying sparrow that was a 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.890
 email client for mac 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.040
 very famous and many people were afraid of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.950
 that the project was set aside and so 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.370
 it was then people are trying 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:04.440
 find an alternative to sparrow 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.610
 and here we have one that is by default 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.770
 in mac os 10 then it will not be any 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.580
 economic problem because it's coming 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.509
 integrated into buying anything and we have 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.979
 some very good improvements with respect 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.310
 to previous versions of this 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.020
 email manager and then I'll 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.430
 teach a little about how how to use it 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.540
 let's put in full screen for 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.540
 that looks a little better 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.560
 and well we have here our manager 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.700
 mail as you can see I have here 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.740
 enough accounts of all my 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.900
 my email accounts that I have active 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.690
 now 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.040
 here we have the toolbar and 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.850
 well first let's see the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.100
 preferences 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.439
 Seeing preferences we have the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.299
 general presidency where we can 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.970
 put mails as an application by mail 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.330
 By default check for messages 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.540
 new every time or say that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.300
 manually checked I'm going to put 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.100
 every five minutes as he had it we can 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.170
 say that we want a sound to 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.300
 new messages 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.190
 where to put the download folder by 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.069
 good example these are some 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.950
 basic preferences here in accounts 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.599
 we have to add all the accounts of 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.630
 mail that we want to come out in 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.060
 this application with the + button we add 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.470
 an email account we put our 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.590
 name our mail from our 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.170
 password we give you to continue and you 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.780
 links to the email account for example 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.069
 I have the channel account here 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.720
 Youtube 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.700
 then we put the description that 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.830
 we want to come out in this bar 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.390
 the description that we want if it 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.580
 we change the name here it's going to change 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.410
 automatically here 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.080
 we put the email address the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.470
 password and we have everything we can 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.390
 activate a spam filter 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.430
 but I have disabled because some 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.320
 occasion has not happened to me that has 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.760
 sent an email he sends us 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.060
 automatically there I do not know why 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.550
 then I have it deactivated but 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.160
 well this is also the characteristic 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.350
 as well 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.780
 types and colors as we want it to be 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.300
 see the letters of the mail the colors 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.100
 etc I leave it predetermined 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.560
 then also what is interesting 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.690
 are the signatures we can put a signature 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.690
 for each account for example 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.720
 in the account d 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.810
 of macintosh as we can put a 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.720
 firm that is 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.450
 mcintosh in computer science we can get 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.160
 a firm that is computing in the 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.040
 personal account 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.720
 Well, I would sign as Carlos 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.700
 I call I can also put the 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.500
 message that we want is always going to 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.750
 add automatically at the end of 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.060
 our emails these are the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.880
 basic preferences is fine as of 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.020
 that we can put several accounts and so 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:11.050
 have everything in one place without 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.120
 we have to be from 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.640
 from on the internet getting into each 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.500
 account and we go that in the end is a leader 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.829
 better to have them all together for the 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.310
 people who have enough accounts 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.319
 and the last thing I wanted to explain this to me 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.930
 I realized recently is that the bar of 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:30.210
 tools up here you can 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.400
 customize as in all 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.710
 mac applications that have this bar 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.900
 in almost all it also lights you can 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.669
 customize better I make a video how 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.430
 customize it but exactly the same 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.760
 what are we going to do here 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.760
 We give the right button and we give 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.910
 customize toolbar 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.310
 and here we have all these buttons 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.990
 This is the toolbar 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.030
 default with the receive button 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.940
 new message delete the desired 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.340
 answer indicators and search but I 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.780
 I do not have a bit modified I added 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:10.689
 than this car that for example 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:13.180
 he tells me to mark as read 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:17.400
 or as a relief 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.400
 then we select a message 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.319
 we select a message for example and 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:28.699
 we give you here to mark as you have not read 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:31.720
 then it puts us as a law we 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.720
 let's go here as read 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:41.950
 let's see to customize we have here 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.040
 the print button that simply what 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.950
 we click and drag it and add it 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.140
 we can add where we want 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.750
 we can even change these buttons 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.250
 site is pretty good the truth 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.720
 I also like quite a lot of power 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.760
 customize this bar because if 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.130
 we can for example I maintain 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.780
 printer then everything does not work 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.460
 for nothing then what I do is 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.069
 eliminate it 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.000
 and so we have enough is enough 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.000
 pretty buttons 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:15.419
 we can put the one we want we can 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.099
 add spaces if we want between a 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.469
 application between one button and another has 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.659
 a public space in designing and eliminating 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.840
 and so we can make the application that 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:27.230
 be totally to our liking 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.430
 and as a last thing we can put that 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:34.350
 show only the icons 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:37.090
 show and with the text 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.730
 in which he tells us here 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.610
 the text in text what each 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:45.850
 icon in case we do not give in any or 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.400
 we prefer to have text below the 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.000
 icon and we can also put it alone 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.000
 as text 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:58.509
 but it's a little uglier 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:00.070
 then I will leave it as an icon and 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.180
 text 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.180
 and not just as a theme 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.199
 and nothing else I hope you liked it 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:11.750
 this little review of the net application 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.039
 to be able to take full advantage of it 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.740
 we need for our mail 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:17.449
 electronic the points that I like the most 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.360
 They are able to have all of my accounts 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:22.370
 email in the same place that 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.159
 be updated every five minutes to 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:28.060
 leave it when I get an email 

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:29.680
 new automatically tell me 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.440
 how it integrates with the center 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.110
 Makos daily notifications and 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.820
 I really like being able to customize the 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.970
 taskbar above 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:44.740
 and nothing else that you liked it
