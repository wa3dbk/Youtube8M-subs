00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
what percentage what's the story that

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.169 
what percentage what's the story that
you<00:01:23.860> hear<00:01:24.250> about<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.640> percentage<00:01:25.119> of

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
you hear about the percentage of

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:26.820 
you hear about the percentage of
students<00:01:25.479> who<00:01:25.539> are<00:01:25.659> Greek<00:01:25.899> and<00:01:26.170> then<00:01:26.259> what<00:01:26.530> I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
students who are Greek and then what I

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.100 
students who are Greek and then what I
think<00:01:27.220> school<00:01:28.000> says<00:01:28.360> like<00:01:28.569> thirty<00:01:28.810> percent

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
think school says like thirty percent

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.960 
think school says like thirty percent
but<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.560> think<00:01:29.890> they<00:01:29.979> take<00:01:30.190> that<00:01:30.220> before<00:01:30.789> the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
but I think they take that before the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.789 
but I think they take that before the
new<00:01:31.090> much<00:01:31.390> class<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.960> after<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.380> seniors<00:01:32.770> are

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
new much class and after the seniors are

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.230 
new much class and after the seniors are
graduating<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:34.060> it's<00:01:34.210> about<00:01:34.330> half<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.619> think

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
graduating so it's about half so I think

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.279 
graduating so it's about half so I think
accurately<00:01:37.240> I<00:01:37.450> think<00:01:37.720> it's<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.899> round<00:01:38.080> six

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
accurately I think it's a round six

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:39.809 
accurately I think it's a round six
Trent<00:01:38.590> I'm<00:01:38.740> making<00:01:39.069> that<00:01:39.190> up<00:01:39.310> but<00:01:39.490> that's<00:01:39.610> just
