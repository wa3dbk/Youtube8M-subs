00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.470
 hello everyone with you nick and today I want 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.470
 to tell 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:30.640
 bug novices who play 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.210
 counter-strike and not only 16 and errors 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.700
 also present on other versions 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.020
 let's start the first mistake of course so 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.500
 at 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.850
 some people are more like newbies 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.850
 counter strike replace procure these 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.059
 submachine guns 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.920
 and also some buy shotguns 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.589
 it will not understand it 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.829
 worth it because it does not count you 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.530
 adequate person 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.880
 the maximum is that people are less adequate 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.650
 buy it tab 4 and of course 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.800
 gun it go home 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.610
 that sort of thing and maybe here either 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.439
 cockerel or rattle nothing more 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.079
 to produce a new beginners second mistake 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:27.460
 this is a quick purchase 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:31.320
 and rush which just stand at the base of abu 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.570
 purchased and quickly return taking a knife 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.740
 they run over here or there 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.399
 would run from here and they don't represent 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.399
 what is here 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.200
 they are already waiting for pounds of the shooting range do not know 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.369
 that from here the future of terrorists is not 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.990
 this point of the field 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:05.759
 that rashid rashid sense is only and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:09.989
 forces rashite whole team still third 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:13.200
 error is this distribution 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:19.349
 teams for example a team of five people 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.569
 and three people were running one man 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.730
 budget seku normal person 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.290
 run on i sit and help mate and 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.260
 fans on top of those who do not give 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.269
 because if I go teacher 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.430
 the heating ridge is somehow not very 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:42.120
 good because whitefish is not alone 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:45.450
 so further one more mistake 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:54.389
 newbies are flavors that they 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:57.930
 buy and just run also with fake 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.400
 somewhere under your feet and so on 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:16.190
 Topics 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:16.190
 but fate throw out and here 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.680
 what else quran about paper 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.610
 throwing grenades is necessary only when 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.240
 I know that for example somewhere in the bank 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.240
 for example, you are sitting here on the shifta and 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:40.300
 hear someone from the can quietly quiet 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.300
 sneaks then you take a grenade 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.310
 that is, only when you know what 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.709
 there will be another beginners mistake this 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.140
 for example novice do you even see 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.860
 that he has a bomb this floor does not herachit 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.930
 forward stupa herachit forward for example 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.570
 there you run to love this here 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.989
 avoid here you kill here 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.920
 for example dofiga map and the bomb just here 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.850
 here will lie and all of that 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.890
 counter-terrorists will just feed 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.290
 the bomb is all that is nobody to her 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.570
 will do if you have a bomb then 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.510
 please be careful or just give it back 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:26.110
 pump to your intimate 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:28.610
 one more mistake for newbies is incomprehensible 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:34.460
 recharge ie for example a person 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:36.860
 just leaving so pharmacy with something 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.960
 cartridges and then 26 then find 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:46.040
 He charges, that is, this is nothing at all 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.570
 do not do it because well, it's stupid 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.390
 takes time in this moment 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:55.729
 recharging you can kill all three 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.800
 patron just fired and that is 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.590
 these three cartridges in life with 100 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.640
 well you still change the subject too 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:11.840
 it also happens that I am not a pro 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:16.940
 the player that's what else is of course so 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:21.160
 the habit of most people is to change 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:26.620
 weapon against priests 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.660
 changed but this is the opposite of it too 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.220
 mistake when here you change with you can 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.260
 get there well i'm obsessed by some other one 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:41.010
 of the mistakes of course 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:42.420
 and vp but if your team has 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.950
 vp 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.640
 even if you play a good 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:51.090
 so please do not buy it 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:56.050
 because well, I understand here is the maximum ec2 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:58.780
 more minutes and it can never 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.200
 cool very another beginners mistake 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.820
 when for example people run there people 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.280
 go on sifte I calmly all come 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.090
 depends beginners beginner here's a query 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.090
 we throw a grenade in there 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:23.920
 la la la la la la this is quieter 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.240
 adequate 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:31.120
 and don't run right and the last mistake 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.440
