00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 ah 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.650
 to begin with let's prepare our 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.430
 nail first we will remove cuticles 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.140
 we will apply disinfectant is moisturizing 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.410
 and file we have to remove the brightness of 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.500
 the natural nail we will apply a layer of 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.029
 first and we will select the mold that 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.029
 more fit our nails 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.840
 we take our mold wet the brush 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.510
 in the acrylic liquid and we form a 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.870
 pearl let's start forming the line 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.239
 of the smile as you can see me in the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.640
 mold I have drawn the small line with 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.019
 marker to draw the smile 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.019
 in an easier way 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.400
 It is important that the acrylic layer 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.590
 white is quite thick think of you 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.420
 the layer that will go on the tip to 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.120
 avoid then with any stroke 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.870
 can break it has to be a layer 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.870
 strong and resistant 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.330
 to see if you are drawing it well 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.590
 you can from time to time and turning the 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.590
 mold to check it 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.530
 you are very attentive and pay attention to everything 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.060
 that the edges of the mold are fine 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.060
 full of white acrylic 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.200
 since I 'm not a professional, it's 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.980
 much easier to make the target of 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.300
 mold in any way and then 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.300
 cut it into the desired length 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.319
 and now we fill the mold with acrylic 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.659
 pink 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.519
 I could fill it with dust 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.519
 clear color acrylic 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.020
 you have to make a good layer on 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.480
 all in the union between the acrylic 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.480
 white and pink acrylic 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.920
 once finished we take the mold and 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.930
 we apply on our nail you know 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.080
 that we have to press hard during 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.690
 a few seconds if we have remains in 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.780
 we will clean the sides with a 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.320
 orange stick or with a retired 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.320
 cuticles 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.520
 and we wait a few seconds until the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.500
 Acrylic hardens and while already 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.180
 you know you can take to go 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.180
 making the mold of other nails 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.900
 once dry we remove the mold 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.730
 just move a little on the tip of the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.069
 mold from side to side 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.069
 look how bright the nail stays 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.230
 we take the cut tease and cut in the 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.390
 length we want 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.280
 you already know that it is preferable to leave it more 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.280
 very long because then we are going to file 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.510
 in this case I have put a yellow flower 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.510
 of decoration 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.290
 I like it whenever I put one 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.720
 decoration encapsulate the so what 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.670
 I have done it has been to take the mold again 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.360
 put a little pink acrylic 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.680
 a very thin layer but covering all the 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.580
 nail so that then they do not remain 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.580
 imperfections 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.890
 in this way the decoration will remain 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.110
 much more protected you have to have 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.420
 Be careful not to put too many layers of 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.760
 acrylic so that the nail does not remain too 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.760
 thick because there is nothing natural 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.129
 we apply the mallow mold on 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:30.189
 our nail 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:30.189
 and that's how our encapsulated design will look 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.470
 you know we have to remove them from 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.979
 the remaining acrylic remains 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.979
 around 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.580
 and let dry a few minutes again 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.800
 when it is dry we remove the mold 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.720
 and now we only have to shape the nail 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.150
 filing the 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.000
 you know that it only takes 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.350
 encourage by the sides and by the 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.350
 from the front by the tip 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.450
 to finish we are going to apply a layer of 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.300
 tocoa you already know that I apply a 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.230
 sunscreen so that the nail does not 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.450
 then yellow 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:01.020
 and finally some oil for 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.020
 cuticles 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:11.970
 and that is the result of the acrylic nail 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:14.870
 at home with dual system force and without 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.870
 use tips
