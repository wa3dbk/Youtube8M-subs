00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.930
 imagine the eye that sees 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.570
 the world around us is a brain that processes 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.370
 information and super bright light source 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.129
 with brightness control 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.630
 We present you the latest development 5 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.840
 headlamp on 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.190
 with adaptive lighting technology one 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.190
 he is good and two is better 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.879
 lamp on and on adaptive technology 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.559
 lighting 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.000
 1 headlamp instantly 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.000
 adapting to your needs 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.440
 it automatically adapts power and 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.570
 characteristics of the light beam in 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.789
 depending on ambient light with 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.320
 lantern on and you do not need to think about manual 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.149
 you can fully adjust 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.220
 focus on your tasks 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.750
 it works longer due to more 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.570
 efficient use of charge 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.520
 battery is the main element of technology 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.420
 adaptive lighting built 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.310
 light sensor 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.679
 he analyzes the level of the external 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.000
 lighting and microprocessor control 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.130
 over bright LEDs 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.369
 provides the right level of lighting 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.070
 from 7 to 300 55 and lumen and beam type 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.350
 wide or focused 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.300
 lighting adapts instantly and 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.729
 not automatically requiring manual 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.050
 adjustments 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.270
 imagine that you are doing night 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.550
 Orientation headlamp on a with 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.020
 adaptive lighting technology 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.060
 constantly adjusts the brightness and type of beam 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.220
 so you can see well the terrain and 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.869
 time to notice an obstacle when are you 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.090
 look at the map it instantly 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.830
 decreases the brightness and switches to 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.410
 diffused light so as not to blind you 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.690
 here you are again looking at the road and the lantern 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.270
 on u again shines a bright beam 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.039
 providing you with perfect visibility all 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.050
 adjustments occur automatically 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.759
 not requiring intervention and allow you 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.940
 fully focus on your 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.940
 tasks 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.970
 lantern on and continuously adapts 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.160
 lighting providing the right amount 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.620
 light at any given time 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.570
 while it is as efficient as possible 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.090
 uses battery power giving out 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.710
 just as much light as you need if 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.910
 turn it on at full capacity 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.920
 single charge time 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.920
 the battery will look like this 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.780
 with adaptive lighting technology 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.280
 the amount of light varies depending 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.930
 from your needs 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.910
 at the same time you have the opportunity 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.000
 choose your own 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.750
 lighting level 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.750
 download free software 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.400
 providing about spices and you can do it yourself 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.560
 adjust brightness and time 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.170
 lantern on a for specific tasks on 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.340
 mustache adaptive lighting technology 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.830
 will make your movement in the dark 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.780
 most comfortable now it is not 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.700
 just power intelligence allows 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.350
 use this power to the maximum 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.700
 effectively providing 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.010
 optimal lighting 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.569
 no longer have to constantly push buttons 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.459
 to select the required level 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.190
 lighting no longer need to adjust 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.060
 manual power is easy enough 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.730
 turn on the flashlight 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.989
 he will do everything himself with technology 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.150
 adaptive lighting 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.760
 you always have exactly as much light as 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.760
 need 1 he is good and two is better
