lot of money for something that's pretty
much<00:06:19.270> just<00:06:19.330> like<00:06:19.690> a<00:06:19.750> highlighting<00:06:20.380> concealer

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
much just like a highlighting concealer

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.050 
much just like a highlighting concealer
/<00:06:22.620> illuminating<00:06:23.620> foundation<00:06:24.400> sort<00:06:24.760> of<00:06:24.850> thing

/ illuminating foundation sort of thing

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.300 
/ illuminating foundation sort of thing
it's<00:06:25.960> not<00:06:26.080> really<00:06:26.230> concealer<00:06:26.800> so<00:06:27.010> I<00:06:27.040> wouldn't

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
it's not really concealer so I wouldn't

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.940 
it's not really concealer so I wouldn't
say<00:06:27.430> that<00:06:27.460> more<00:06:28.360> like<00:06:28.630> a<00:06:28.920> highlighting<00:06:29.920> shade
