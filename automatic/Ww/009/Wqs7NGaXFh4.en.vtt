two or five so we study Tokyo four years

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.389 
two or five so we study Tokyo four years
ago<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.969> Hong<00:00:57.600> Kong<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.260> course<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:59.250> of

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
ago and Hong Kong was of course one of

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.060 
ago and Hong Kong was of course one of
my<00:00:59.579> preferred<00:01:00.300> destination<00:01:00.620> but<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> had<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
my preferred destination but I had to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.830 
my preferred destination but I had to
find<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:02.670> people<00:01:02.940> though<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.480> being<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
find the right people though as being a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.710 
find the right people though as being a
brand<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.739> treated<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.250> macaroons<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:06.420> being

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
brand I treated the macaroons as being

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.789 
brand I treated the macaroons as being
one<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> oldest<00:01:08.030> if<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> oldest<00:01:10.200> best

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
one of the oldest if not the oldest best

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.850 
one of the oldest if not the oldest best
three<00:01:11.040> branch<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.520> France<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.450> Paris<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
three branch in France in Paris and I

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
three branch in France in Paris and I
think<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.430> something<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.909> does<00:01:15.390> not

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
think this is something that does not

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.289 
think this is something that does not
exist<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:16.080> Hong<00:01:16.320> Kong<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.340> think<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.790> from

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
exist in Hong Kong and I think that from

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.820 
exist in Hong Kong and I think that from
the<00:01:18.360> experience<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.140> outside<00:01:19.619> in

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the experience we have outside in

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.350 
the experience we have outside in
Barrie's<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.310> course<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.850> would<00:01:21.060> say<00:01:21.210> of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
Barrie's of course of I would say of

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.050 
Barrie's of course of I would say of
Paris<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.930> mean<00:01:22.409> people<00:01:22.920> coming<00:01:23.400> from<00:01:23.610> this

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
Paris I mean people coming from this

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
Paris I mean people coming from this
region<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.689> world<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.770> our

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
region of the world they are our

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.640 
region of the world they are our
preferred<00:01:26.850> customers<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> think<00:01:27.960> they<00:01:28.290> were

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
preferred customers so I think they were

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.109 
preferred customers so I think they were
waiting<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> opening<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.670> Reggio<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
waiting for the opening of Reggio and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.020 
waiting for the opening of Reggio and
Hong<00:01:30.299> Kong

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
Hong Kong

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.240 
Hong Kong
so<00:01:31.300> when<00:01:31.540> they<00:01:31.630> come<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.870> regulate<00:01:32.440> they<00:01:33.010> won't

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
so when they come to regulate they won't

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.430 
so when they come to regulate they won't
have<00:01:33.430> exactly<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.210> same<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:35.140> the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
have exactly the same that the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.800 
have exactly the same that the
experience<00:01:35.980> that<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.910> dream<00:01:37.270> they<00:01:37.480> have<00:01:37.660> in

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
experience that the dream they have in

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.840 
experience that the dream they have in
Paris<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.320> coming<00:01:38.620> and<00:01:38.770> scheduled<00:01:39.130> which<00:01:39.640> mean

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
Paris is coming and scheduled which mean

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.510 
Paris is coming and scheduled which mean
that<00:01:39.880> from<00:01:40.660> what<00:01:40.840> you've<00:01:41.050> seen<00:01:41.260> today<00:01:41.530> it's

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
that from what you've seen today it's

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.540 
that from what you've seen today it's
precisely<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.930> same<00:01:44.200> than<00:01:44.530> if<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:45.220> were<00:01:45.370> in

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
precisely the same than if you were in

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.110 
precisely the same than if you were in
Paris

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
Paris

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.210 
Paris
of<00:01:46.660> course<00:01:47.260> it's<00:01:47.410> gonna<00:01:47.560> happen<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.010> time

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
of course it's gonna happen the time

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.490 
of course it's gonna happen the time
when<00:01:48.430> we<00:01:48.580> gonna<00:01:48.760> create<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.479> sometimes<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.140> try

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
when we gonna create and sometimes I try

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.680 
when we gonna create and sometimes I try
to<00:01:50.560> do<00:01:50.800> it<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.610> take<00:01:51.760> inspiration<00:01:52.570> of

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
to do it to take inspiration of

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.330 
to do it to take inspiration of
something<00:01:53.020> which<00:01:53.140> is<00:01:53.170> typically<00:01:53.860> from<00:01:54.130> Hong

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
something which is typically from Hong

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.580 
something which is typically from Hong
Kong<00:01:54.369> as<00:01:55.090> far<00:01:55.390> as<00:01:55.479> fragrance<00:01:55.930> or<00:01:56.140> taste<00:01:56.380> of

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
Kong as far as fragrance or taste of

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.980 
Kong as far as fragrance or taste of
fruits<00:01:56.860> wherever<00:01:57.220> for<00:01:58.030> example<00:01:58.360> New<00:01:58.479> York<00:01:58.690> was

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
fruits wherever for example New York was

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.510 
fruits wherever for example New York was
with<00:01:59.200> cinnamon<00:01:59.710> on<00:01:59.830> resin<00:02:00.190> which<00:02:00.400> is

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
with cinnamon on resin which is

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.580 
with cinnamon on resin which is
something<00:02:00.729> very<00:02:01.090> typical<00:02:01.240> which<00:02:01.990> we<00:02:02.260> created
