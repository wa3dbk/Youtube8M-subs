graphics engine looking nice shiny there
lots<00:00:13.930> of<00:00:14.140> detail<00:00:14.590> on<00:00:14.800> the<00:00:14.890> rider<00:00:15.510> what<00:00:16.510> can<00:00:16.630> we

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
lots of detail on the rider what can we

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.630 
lots of detail on the rider what can we
do<00:00:16.900> not<00:00:17.410> a<00:00:17.470> lot<00:00:17.619> at<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:17.740> moment<00:00:18.100> to<00:00:18.369> turn<00:00:18.550> the

do not a lot at the moment to turn the

do not a lot at the moment to turn the
camera<00:00:18.880> around<00:00:18.910> a<00:00:19.119> bit<00:00:19.269> there's<00:00:19.630> no<00:00:19.749> different

camera around a bit there's no different

filters or modes as of yet as I say

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.230 
filters or modes as of yet as I say
because<00:00:24.130> this<00:00:24.249> is<00:00:24.400> an<00:00:24.519> early<00:00:24.699> version<00:00:24.849> it's

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
because this is an early version it's

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.839 
because this is an early version it's
difficult<00:00:25.509> to<00:00:25.659> say<00:00:26.310> what<00:00:27.310> else<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:27.669> going<00:00:27.789> to

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
difficult to say what else is going to

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.399 
difficult to say what else is going to
be<00:00:27.909> included<00:00:28.179> you<00:00:28.570> can<00:00:28.689> see<00:00:28.810> dirt<00:00:29.050> on<00:00:29.230> the

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:29.409 
be included you can see dirt on the

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:31.140 
be included you can see dirt on the
rider<00:00:29.829> there<00:00:30.099> where<00:00:30.249> I've<00:00:30.339> flown<00:00:30.609> off<00:00:30.820> due<00:00:31.119> to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
rider there where I've flown off due to

rider there where I've flown off due to
my<00:00:31.359> new<00:00:31.539> penis<00:00:32.190> going<00:00:33.190> on<00:00:33.280> now<00:00:33.430> it's<00:00:33.640> just<00:00:33.790> go

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:34.359 
my new penis going on now it's just go

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.000 
my new penis going on now it's just go
around<00:00:34.449> reporter<00:00:34.930> mayor<00:00:35.109> course<00:00:35.500> I<00:00:35.739> would

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
around reporter mayor course I would

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.560 
around reporter mayor course I would
like<00:00:36.160> to<00:00:36.309> do<00:00:36.430> some<00:00:36.609> amazing<00:00:36.699> riding<00:00:37.239> for<00:00:37.510> you

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
like to do some amazing riding for you

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.660 
like to do some amazing riding for you
guys<00:00:37.750> as<00:00:38.079> usual<00:00:38.500> but<00:00:38.590> unfortunately<00:00:39.190> I<00:00:39.219> have

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
guys as usual but unfortunately I have

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.420 
guys as usual but unfortunately I have
to<00:00:39.699> admit<00:00:39.940> I<00:00:40.870> do<00:00:41.680> have<00:00:41.949> to<00:00:42.039> learn<00:00:42.160> some<00:00:42.399> of

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
to admit I do have to learn some of

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.720 
to admit I do have to learn some of
these<00:00:42.579> pulses<00:00:42.940> again<00:00:43.289> this<00:00:44.289> is<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.730> full

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
these pulses again this is the full

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.160 
these pulses again this is the full
simulation<00:00:46.030> model<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:48.129> I'm<00:00:48.750> being<00:00:49.750> tentative

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
simulation model so I'm being tentative

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.060 
simulation model so I'm being tentative
but<00:00:50.769> the<00:00:51.640> new<00:00:51.789> handling<00:00:52.239> now<00:00:52.420> is<00:00:52.600> is<00:00:52.870> it's<00:00:53.739> much

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
but the new handling now is is it's much

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.009 
but the new handling now is is it's much
easier<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.519> be<00:00:54.730> aggressive<00:00:54.940> of<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.329> bike<00:00:55.600> if

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
easier to be aggressive of the bike if

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.160 
easier to be aggressive of the bike if
there's<00:00:56.230> one<00:00:56.260> thing<00:00:56.379> about<00:00:56.820> sbk<00:00:57.820> exes<00:00:58.300> despite

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
there's one thing about sbk exes despite

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.229 
there's one thing about sbk exes despite
the<00:00:59.289> fact<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.530> yes<00:00:59.800> it's<00:01:00.249> realistic<00:01:00.579> and<00:01:01.059> yes

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
the fact that yes it's realistic and yes

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.900 
the fact that yes it's realistic and yes
in<00:01:01.749> theory<00:01:01.989> it<00:01:02.170> all<00:01:02.260> works<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.859> I<00:01:03.699> quite

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
in theory it all works and I quite

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.300 
in theory it all works and I quite
enjoyed<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.500> sometimes<00:01:05.500> you<00:01:05.680> did<00:01:05.860> feel<00:01:06.070> you<00:01:06.220> is

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
enjoyed it sometimes you did feel you is

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.760 
enjoyed it sometimes you did feel you is
always<00:01:06.460> tiptoeing<00:01:07.119> around<00:01:07.270> you<00:01:08.140> know<00:01:08.290> every

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
always tiptoeing around you know every

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.190 
always tiptoeing around you know every
every<00:01:09.400> corner<00:01:09.790> in<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.000> game<00:01:10.210> whereas<00:01:10.930> in<00:01:11.049> this

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
every corner in the game whereas in this

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.830 
every corner in the game whereas in this
now<00:01:11.439> who<00:01:11.619> I<00:01:11.680> am<00:01:11.890> in<00:01:12.329> simulation<00:01:13.329> I'm<00:01:13.540> able<00:01:13.689> to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
now who I am in simulation I'm able to

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.319 
now who I am in simulation I'm able to
throw<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.380> bike<00:01:14.530> into<00:01:14.799> a<00:01:14.920> corner<00:01:15.400> and<00:01:15.549> gently

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
throw the bike into a corner and gently

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.260 
throw the bike into a corner and gently
apply<00:01:16.600> seller<00:01:16.960> ation<00:01:17.290> nice<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:18.640> smooth<00:01:18.970> out

guys have been doing these bike games

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.860 
guys have been doing these bike games
for<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.130> while<00:01:41.310> now<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:41.760> of<00:01:41.850> course<00:01:42.030> they've

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
for a while now and of course they've

superstars and everything but in this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.930 
superstars and everything but in this
version<00:01:46.830> it<00:01:47.070> does<00:01:47.190> look<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> lot<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> the

game has been remodeled obviously using
this<00:01:50.100> new<00:01:50.369> shiny<00:01:50.790> new<00:01:51.030> graphics<00:01:51.420> engine<00:01:51.600> you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
this new shiny new graphics engine you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.950 
this new shiny new graphics engine you
can<00:01:52.440> see<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> details<00:01:53.070> there<00:01:53.630> better<00:01:54.630> frame

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
can see the details there better frame

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.650 
can see the details there better frame
rate<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.350> happy<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.710> point<00:01:55.890> out<00:01:56.660> let's

rate I'm happy to point out let's

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.950 
rate I'm happy to point out let's
restart<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.259> race<00:01:59.390> again<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:00.690> one

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
restart that race again it's just one

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.330 
restart that race again it's just one
rider<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.440> track<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.040> particular

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
rider on the track in this particular

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:11.450 
rider on the track in this particular
demo<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:05.280> we'll<00:02:05.400> just<00:02:05.550> do<00:02:05.670> one<00:02:05.850> more<00:02:06.030> lap

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.720 

lift<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> wheel<00:02:12.450> there<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> wheelie<00:02:13.050> yeah

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
lift the wheel there do a wheelie yeah

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.900 
lift the wheel there do a wheelie yeah
get<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.820> wheel<00:02:14.970> down<00:02:15.150> again<00:02:16.430> every<00:02:17.430> breaking

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
get the wheel down again every breaking

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.340 
get the wheel down again every breaking
into<00:02:18.090> turn<00:02:18.300> 1<00:02:18.570> i've<00:02:18.690> probably<00:02:18.840> still<00:02:19.140> broke

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
into turn 1 i've probably still broke

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.930 
into turn 1 i've probably still broke
too<00:02:19.500> too<00:02:19.890> late<00:02:20.160> now<00:02:20.190> i'm<00:02:20.580> all<00:02:20.730> right<00:02:22.880> hosting<00:02:23.880> a

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
too too late now i'm all right hosting a

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.150 
too too late now i'm all right hosting a
little<00:02:24.180> bit<00:02:24.300> through<00:02:24.450> 10<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.990> just<00:02:25.950> about

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
little bit through 10 to just about

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.350 
little bit through 10 to just about
making<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.700> slow<00:02:27.450> down<00:02:27.750> three<00:02:29.060> that's<00:02:30.060> because

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
making it slow down three that's because

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.010 
making it slow down three that's because
I<00:02:30.420> should<00:02:30.600> have<00:02:30.690> been<00:02:30.840> there<00:02:32.840> went<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
I should have been there went on the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.280 
I should have been there went on the
power<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.380> early<00:02:34.620> up<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.830> hill<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> again<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
power to early up the hill so again the

playing a lot of racing games and you've

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.790 
playing a lot of racing games and you've
got<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.660> relearn<00:02:42.660> your<00:02:42.900> lines<00:02:43.110> essentially

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800

where<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.190> break<00:02:44.460> I'm<00:02:44.760> breaking<00:02:45.120> way<00:02:45.300> too<00:02:45.360> late

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
where to break I'm breaking way too late

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.660 
where to break I'm breaking way too late
here<00:02:45.990> I'll<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:46.830> do<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.950> few<00:02:47.040> laps<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.550> this

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
here I'll have to do a few laps on this

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.280 
here I'll have to do a few laps on this
circuit<00:02:48.060> before<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.390> actually<00:02:48.570> know<00:02:48.870> exactly

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
circuit before I actually know exactly

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
where to break again though I'd say good

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.590 
where to break again though I'd say good

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
the rain weather let's see how we get on

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.380 
the rain weather let's see how we get on
I've<00:03:17.010> already<00:03:17.160> had<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.400> quick<00:03:17.820> couple<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.180> laps

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
I've already had a quick couple of laps

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.040 
I've already had a quick couple of laps
same<00:03:19.110> circuit<00:03:19.590> same<00:03:20.010> bike<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:21.050> immediate

change<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.560> handling<00:03:23.120> again<00:03:24.120> this<00:03:24.270> is

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
change for the handling again this is

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.290 
change for the handling again this is
running<00:03:24.690> in<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.840> full<00:03:25.050> simulation<00:03:25.320> mode<00:03:26.210> as<00:03:27.210> I

break<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.510> little<00:03:27.840> bit<00:03:27.930> late<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.530> have<00:03:28.650> to

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
break a little bit late you have to

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.520 
break a little bit late you have to
break<00:03:28.920> an<00:03:29.130> awful<00:03:29.490> lot<00:03:29.640> earlier<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.990> the<00:03:31.380> wet

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
break an awful lot earlier in the wet

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.020 
break an awful lot earlier in the wet
weather<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.890> course<00:03:31.920> there<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> lot<00:03:33.000> of

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
weather of course there is a lot of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.570 
weather of course there is a lot of
understeer<00:03:33.570> in<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.870> bike<00:03:34.080> as<00:03:34.350> well<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.460> it's

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
understeer in the bike as well so it's

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.400 
understeer in the bike as well so it's
really<00:03:35.970> difficult<00:03:36.300> getting<00:03:36.690> into<00:03:36.870> those<00:03:37.110> slow

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
really difficult getting into those slow

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.250 
really difficult getting into those slow
corners<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:38.570> generally<00:03:39.570> speaking<00:03:39.600> it's<00:03:40.050> you

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
corners but generally speaking it's you

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.900 
corners but generally speaking it's you
know<00:03:40.380> it's<00:03:40.410> taking<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> nice<00:03:41.250> line<00:03:41.580> it's

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
know it's taking a nice line it's

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.060 
know it's taking a nice line it's
breaking<00:03:42.330> early<00:03:42.630> into<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.960> corner<00:03:43.410> as<00:03:43.620> you

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
breaking early into the corner as you

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.290 
breaking early into the corner as you
can<00:03:44.220> see<00:03:44.370> trying<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.700> get<00:03:44.790> on<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.910> power<00:03:45.120> there

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
can see trying to get on the power there

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.210 
can see trying to get on the power there
I've<00:03:45.390> tried<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.660> get<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:45.870> too<00:03:46.050> early<00:03:46.350> spun<00:03:47.070> me

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
I've tried to get on too early spun me

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.510 
I've tried to get on too early spun me
right<00:03:47.430> out<00:03:47.460> and<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:49.140> difficulty<00:03:50.010> here<00:03:50.040> really

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
right out and the difficulty here really

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.400 
right out and the difficulty here really
is<00:03:50.550> if<00:03:50.880> you<00:03:51.000> do<00:03:51.180> start<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.540> lose<00:03:51.750> traction<00:03:51.990> wet

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
is if you do start to lose traction wet

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.070 
is if you do start to lose traction wet
obviously<00:03:53.100> it's<00:03:53.310> it's<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.480> going<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.900> be<00:03:54.990> all

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
obviously it's it's it's going to be all

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.720 
obviously it's it's it's going to be all
over<00:03:55.140> for<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:55.950> need<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.130> much<00:03:56.310> smoother

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
over for you so you need a much smoother

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.710 
over for you so you need a much smoother
riding<00:03:57.150> style<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.920> again<00:03:59.790> you've<00:03:59.970> seen<00:04:00.180> he's

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
riding style and again you've seen he's

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.080 
riding style and again you've seen he's
a<00:04:00.750> typical<00:04:01.020> slow<00:04:01.410> corner<00:04:01.890> crawl<00:04:02.580> into<00:04:02.880> the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
a typical slow corner crawl into the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.560 
a typical slow corner crawl into the
corner<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.720> then<00:04:04.970> progressively<00:04:05.970> accelerate

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
corner and then progressively accelerate

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.510 
corner and then progressively accelerate
out<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.080> so<00:04:07.770> it's<00:04:07.890> nice<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.070> feel<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
out of it so it's nice to feel the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.630 
out of it so it's nice to feel the
difference<00:04:08.880> in<00:04:09.480> handling<00:04:10.430> noted<00:04:11.430> though<00:04:11.610> that

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
difference in handling noted though that

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.430 
difference in handling noted though that
the<00:04:11.910> developers<00:04:12.360> have<00:04:12.480> said<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.200> can

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
the developers have said that you can

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.130 
the developers have said that you can
lean<00:04:13.680> slightly<00:04:14.070> further<00:04:14.550> on<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.540> bike<00:04:15.840> in

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
lean slightly further on this bike in

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.990 
lean slightly further on this bike in
wet<00:04:16.380> weather<00:04:16.410> then<00:04:16.920> you<00:04:17.489> could<00:04:17.640> probably<00:04:17.820> do

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
wet weather then you could probably do

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.690 
wet weather then you could probably do
in<00:04:18.120> real<00:04:18.239> life<00:04:19.040> it's<00:04:20.040> just<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.520> the

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
in real life it's just so that the

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.790 
in real life it's just so that the
difficulty<00:04:21.480> doesn't<00:04:22.410> necessarily<00:04:22.740> affect

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
difficulty doesn't necessarily affect

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.660 
difficulty doesn't necessarily affect
simulation<00:04:23.490> but<00:04:23.730> certainly

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
simulation but certainly

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.280 
simulation but certainly
making<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.390> game<00:04:25.510> more<00:04:25.690> approachable<00:04:25.990> for

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
making the game more approachable for

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.440 
making the game more approachable for
more<00:04:26.680> people<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:28.030> a<00:04:28.120> lot<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.300> that

riders themselves you actually felt that

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.220 
riders themselves you actually felt that
say<00:04:32.410> s<00:04:32.560> bkx<00:04:33.040> was<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.730> little<00:04:34.450> bit<00:04:34.540> too<00:04:34.690> difficult

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
say s bkx was a little bit too difficult

you<00:04:35.770> know<00:04:35.920> to<00:04:35.980> control<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.760> bite<00:04:36.970> leaning<00:04:37.390> in

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480

you know to control the bite leaning in
the<00:04:37.570> corners<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.830> whole<00:04:38.980> idea<00:04:39.160> of<00:04:39.370> this<00:04:39.580> now

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
the corners the whole idea of this now

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.790 
the corners the whole idea of this now
is<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.090> can<00:04:40.240> throw<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.990> bike<00:04:41.140> in<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.380> corn<00:04:41.650> or

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
is you can throw the bike in the corn or

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.860 
is you can throw the bike in the corn or
even<00:04:42.070> in<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.250> way<00:04:42.400> but<00:04:43.090> obviously<00:04:43.210> what<00:04:43.690> with

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
even in the way but obviously what with

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.230 
even in the way but obviously what with
the<00:04:44.080> lack<00:04:44.950> of<00:04:44.980> traction<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.030> lack<00:04:46.210> of

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
the lack of traction and the lack of

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.140 
the lack of traction and the lack of
steer<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.380> grip<00:04:47.950> from<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.280> front<00:04:48.580> end<00:04:48.790> into<00:04:49.030> a

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
steer and grip from the front end into a

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.050 
steer and grip from the front end into a
corner<00:04:49.600> it's<00:04:50.350> still<00:04:51.100> challenging<00:04:51.640> enough<00:04:51.820> to

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
corner it's still challenging enough to

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.910 
corner it's still challenging enough to
slow<00:04:52.360> down<00:04:52.510> those<00:04:52.780> lap<00:04:53.020> times<00:04:53.290> given<00:04:53.860> the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
slow down those lap times given the

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.890 
slow down those lap times given the
weather<00:04:54.070> conditions<00:04:54.610> this<00:04:55.390> version<00:04:55.630> doesn't

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
appear to have the drying line so we

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.450 
appear to have the drying line so we
interesting<00:04:58.510> to<00:04:58.660> see<00:04:58.840> how<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.190> drawing<00:05:00.190> line

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.130 
interesting to see how the drawing line
