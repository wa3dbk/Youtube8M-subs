carbines I'll take it because of its
solid<00:01:22.140> range<00:01:22.380> i'm<00:01:22.590> also<00:01:22.799> not<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.460> tempted

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
solid range i'm also not really tempted

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.370 
solid range i'm also not really tempted

to equip a heavy barrel like i usually
do<00:01:25.740> which<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.460> nice<00:01:26.790> because<00:01:27.030> i<00:01:27.210> don't<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
do which is nice because i don't have to
