convention ears had had their way with
it<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.119> battery<00:01:54.390> pack<00:01:54.840> was<00:01:55.290> mostly<00:01:55.710> depleted

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
it the battery pack was mostly depleted

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.940 
it the battery pack was mostly depleted
there<00:01:57.450> was<00:01:57.570> enough<00:01:57.780> energy<00:01:58.080> left<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.650> drive

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
there was enough energy left to drive

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.469 
there was enough energy left to drive
the<00:01:59.159> car<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.580> not<00:01:59.760> much<00:02:00.060> more

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the car but not much more

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.990

hence<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.500> engine<00:02:01.920> generator<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.700> going

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
hence the engine generator was going

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.820 
hence the engine generator was going
