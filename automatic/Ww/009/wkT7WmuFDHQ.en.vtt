the power's out if you're nervous about
it<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.970> always<00:00:30.090> use<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> circular<00:00:30.720> twice

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439

Bell top which is definitely a really
good<00:00:33.660> practice<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.460> case<00:00:35.670> there's<00:00:35.940> power

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
good practice just in case there's power

there<00:02:34.070> we<00:02:34.220> go<00:02:34.870> ceiling<00:02:35.870> fans<00:02:36.110> down<00:02:36.850> this<00:02:37.850> one<00:02:38.090> I

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
there we go ceiling fans down this one I

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.690 
there we go ceiling fans down this one I
can<00:02:38.330> probably<00:02:38.570> use<00:02:38.870> elsewhere<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.710> go<00:02:40.610> ahead

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
can probably use elsewhere so go ahead

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.270 
can probably use elsewhere so go ahead
and<00:02:40.850> cover<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:42.350> brachot<00:02:42.830> up<00:02:42.950> top<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.920> just

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
and cover the brachot up top you just

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:57.800 
and cover the brachot up top you just
have<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:48.520> then<00:02:49.520> mount<00:02:49.790> into<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.300> junction<00:02:50.630> box
