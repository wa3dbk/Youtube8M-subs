00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.830
 the complete for 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.170
 to prepare for the new season 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.940
 train all teams from education to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.890
 to the professionals for a few days in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.689
 naumburg the joint training camp 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.970
 is meanwhile tradition 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.990
 the feeling that year after year something 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.359
 you can still feel something special 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.980
 that is what matters that the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.260
 players communicate with each other 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.199
 they are at the individual eating 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.309
 stop meeting you can see that the 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.629
 great with the little ones while training too 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.940
 but you can see that the 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.140
 small if you have time and me 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.239
 even in training, everyone is complete 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.260
 at the training of professionals 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.210
 are that a lot of off 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.430
 can both in training with each other 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.190
 but also in the training easy 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.870
 only when studying what the l what 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.329
 the first team also plays and does 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.620
 and from there that's exactly what I think 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.809
 what we want to achieve with it 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.610
 dagur sigurdsson is with training 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.620
 the kids with full body use 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.989
 the thing the Icelanders appreciate 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.369
 work with the young talents 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.990
 Sensors christopher are located 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.759
 currently still in the reha phase 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.770
 the knee is not yet one hundred 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.780
 percent resilient the national player 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.789
 is in naumburg for the fourth time 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.410
 and is always the youth 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.569
 like with advice and did to the side 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.910
 I always think so 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.920
 a great story that we stop here 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.330
 just sometimes position specific 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.459
 Even if you do it for training 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.690
 a bit of your own training 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:30.090
 but it has to be okay 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.360
 and we are all young too 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.740
 started and I think that's it 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.179
 another special situation if you are 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.250
 then even the enjoyment gets from 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.200
 someone like romero, for example 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.520
 to get 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 who also played abroad 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.580
 he had a lot of international 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.959
 has retracted title but also from the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.060
 other guys regularly in the 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.560
 bundesliga just stand up to your man 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.690

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.390

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.670
