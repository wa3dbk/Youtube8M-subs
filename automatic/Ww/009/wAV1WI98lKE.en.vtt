00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
recording alright so this is a pretty

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.880 
recording alright so this is a pretty
simple<00:00:03.300> process<00:00:03.540> really<00:00:03.929> I'm<00:00:04.529> going<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.799> show

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
simple process really I'm going to show

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.710 
simple process really I'm going to show
you<00:00:04.950> two<00:00:05.400> different<00:00:05.430> methods<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:06.210> take<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
you two different methods to take the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.169 
you two different methods to take the
foiling<00:00:07.200> off<00:00:07.379> of<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.130> card<00:00:08.460> one<00:00:08.760> on<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.030> new

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
foiling off of a card one on the new

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.560 
foiling off of a card one on the new
cards<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.809> one<00:00:10.080> on<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> old<00:00:10.440> card<00:00:10.910> I<00:00:11.910> highly

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
cards and one on the old card I highly

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.110 
cards and one on the old card I highly
recommend<00:00:13.200> if<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.410> can<00:00:13.650> find<00:00:14.219> some<00:00:14.639> Marchetti

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
recommend if you can find some Marchetti

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.870 
recommend if you can find some Marchetti
and<00:00:15.210> masques<00:00:15.660> foils<00:00:16.279> it<00:00:17.279> was<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> first<00:00:17.699> step

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and masques foils it was the first step

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.609 
and masques foils it was the first step
they<00:00:18.060> ever<00:00:18.210> did<00:00:18.359> falling<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.230> really

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
they ever did falling and so it's really

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.070 
they ever did falling and so it's really
really<00:00:20.100> really<00:00:20.279> easy<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.850> take<00:00:21.119> off<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
really really easy to take off the the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.259 
really really easy to take off the the
ink<00:00:22.260> they<00:00:22.710> must<00:00:22.949> have<00:00:23.010> used<00:00:23.070> really<00:00:23.369> crap<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
ink they must have used really crap the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.150 
ink they must have used really crap the
ink<00:00:24.449> at<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.660> time<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.800> I'm<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.070> to

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
ink at the time so I'm just going to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.290 
ink at the time so I'm just going to
show<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.279> how<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:26.880> really<00:00:26.939> simple

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
show you how to do it it's really simple

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.019 
show you how to do it it's really simple
you<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.480> need<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.750> acetone<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.939> doesn't<00:00:29.939> you

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
you just need to acetone and doesn't you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.939 
you just need to acetone and doesn't you
don't<00:00:30.179> need<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> even<00:00:30.510> know<00:00:30.779> something<00:00:31.740> very

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
don't need to even know something very

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.130 
don't need to even know something very
rough<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.759> rag<00:00:33.030> will<00:00:33.239> work<00:00:35.719> one<00:00:36.719> up<00:00:36.870> real

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
rough so a rag will work one up real

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.610 
rough so a rag will work one up real
quick

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.830 

just<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> little<00:00:40.860> piece<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.219> rag<00:00:41.399> work<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.690> is

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
just a little piece of rag work this is

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.069 
just a little piece of rag work this is
just<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.320> think<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.829> bed<00:00:44.460> sheet<00:00:44.870> just<00:00:45.870> dip

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
just a I think it's a bed sheet just dip

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.950 
just a I think it's a bed sheet just dip
it<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> acetone<00:00:47.059> and<00:00:48.059> there<00:00:48.329> by<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.809> way

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
it in the acetone and there by the way

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.779 
it in the acetone and there by the way
the<00:00:49.110> reason<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.980> stuck<00:00:50.340> down<00:00:50.579> like

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the reason I have it stuck down like

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.049 
the reason I have it stuck down like
this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.410> all<00:00:52.410> especially<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> old<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.940> old

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
this is all especially the old the old

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.970 
this is all especially the old the old
faces<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.140> acetone<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> back

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
faces if you get acetone on the back

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.580 
faces if you get acetone on the back
you're<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.699> ruin<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.500> much

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
you're really ruin it it's not so much

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.319 
you're really ruin it it's not so much
that<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.859> can't<00:00:59.129> use<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.699> proxy<00:01:00.059> anyway

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that you can't use it for a proxy anyway

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.779 
that you can't use it for a proxy anyway
but<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.539> looks<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.719> crap<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.370> don't

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
but it looks like crap so and you don't

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.410 
but it looks like crap so and you don't
want<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.120> use<00:01:04.189> duct<00:01:05.189> tape<00:01:05.369> duct<00:01:06.060> tape<00:01:06.240> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
want to use duct tape duct tape you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
want to use duct tape duct tape you
don't<00:01:06.600> want<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> use<00:01:06.990> scotch<00:01:07.229> tape<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.740> figured

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
don't want to use scotch tape I figured

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.740 
don't want to use scotch tape I figured
this<00:01:08.820> out<00:01:08.970> very<00:01:09.030> quickly

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
this out very quickly

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.980 
this out very quickly
acetone<00:01:10.380> makes<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.830> turn<00:01:11.040> into<00:01:11.189> jello<00:01:11.960> not<00:01:12.960> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
acetone makes this turn into jello not a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
acetone makes this turn into jello not a
good<00:01:13.229> idea<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.770> masking<00:01:14.700> tape<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> way<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
good idea so masking tape is the way to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
good idea so masking tape is the way to
go<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> did<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.710> kind<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.189> attach

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
go and what I did is just kind of attach

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.940 
go and what I did is just kind of attach
to<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:17.970> side<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.299> I'm<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.530> trying<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.799> take

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
to this side so I'm just trying to take

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.440 
to this side so I'm just trying to take
off<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> center<00:01:20.520> right<00:01:20.670> now<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.240> want<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
off the center right now if you want to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.640 
off the center right now if you want to
take<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> full<00:01:21.869> thing<00:01:22.080> off<00:01:22.200> which<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
take the full thing off which is what I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.230 
take the full thing off which is what I
suggest<00:01:22.740> you're<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.610> take

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
suggest you're going to have to take

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.170 
suggest you're going to have to take
your<00:01:24.420> time<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.189> do<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.490> acetone<00:01:26.850> very

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
your time and do it with acetone very

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.149 
your time and do it with acetone very
very<00:01:27.420> lightly<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.350> that's<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
very lightly and that's that's the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.530 
very lightly and that's that's the
hardest<00:01:29.460> part<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> takes<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.329> while

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
hardest part so it takes a little while

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.749 
hardest part so it takes a little while
but<00:01:30.750> I'll<00:01:30.900> show<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.170> how<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.439> works<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:31.890> so

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
but I'll show you how it works here so

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.249 
but I'll show you how it works here so
basically<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.360> little<00:01:33.750> more<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> stamp

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
basically a little more a stamp

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.490 
basically a little more a stamp
essentially<00:01:35.360> once<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.479> start<00:01:36.810> rubbing<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.259> it

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
essentially once you start rubbing it it

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.090 
essentially once you start rubbing it it
should<00:01:37.680> start<00:01:37.890> coming<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.280> pretty<00:01:38.520> quick

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
should start coming up pretty quick

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.560 
should start coming up pretty quick
you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:42.290> coming<00:01:43.290> right<00:01:43.530> off<00:01:43.740> pretty<00:01:44.130> much

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.480 

so<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.690> can<00:01:48.810> see<00:01:48.990> how<00:01:49.200> how<00:01:49.500> fast<00:01:49.830> it<00:01:50.070> comes<00:01:50.250> off

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
so you can see how how fast it comes off

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.580 
so you can see how how fast it comes off
on<00:01:50.730> one<00:01:50.910> of<00:01:50.940> these<00:01:51.030> marc-etienne<00:01:51.450> mass<00:01:51.720> plants

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
on one of these marc-etienne mass plants

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.590 
on one of these marc-etienne mass plants
and<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.620> basic<00:01:55.770> idea<00:01:56.390> once<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.480> get

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
and you get the basic idea once you get

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.750 
and you get the basic idea once you get
this<00:01:57.720> whole<00:01:57.960> thing<00:01:57.990> off<00:01:58.440> it<00:01:59.220> becomes<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.610> very

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
this whole thing off it becomes a very

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.810 
this whole thing off it becomes a very
beautiful<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.840> shiny<00:02:01.260> surface<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.610> put

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
beautiful like shiny surface you can put

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.250 
beautiful like shiny surface you can put
foils<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.330> I'll<00:02:03.630> show<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.900> what<00:02:04.050> those<00:02:04.140> look

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
foils on I'll show you what those look

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.790 
foils on I'll show you what those look
like<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.920> alright<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.300> these<00:02:06.690> I<00:02:07.410> was

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
like in that alright so for these I was

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.109 
like in that alright so for these I was
trying<00:02:08.040> to<00:02:08.130> figure<00:02:08.250> out<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.490> way<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> use<00:02:08.910> them

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
trying to figure out a way to use them

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.880 
trying to figure out a way to use them
because<00:02:09.300> at<00:02:09.660> Stone<00:02:09.929> does<00:02:10.110> absolutely<00:02:10.380> nothing

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
because at Stone does absolutely nothing

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.460 
because at Stone does absolutely nothing
to<00:02:11.310> them<00:02:11.460> so<00:02:12.420> what<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:12.960> do<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.380> can

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
to them so what you can do is you can

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.800 
to them so what you can do is you can
make<00:02:13.650> them<00:02:13.860> into<00:02:14.010> these<00:02:14.720> these<00:02:15.720> blank<00:02:16.530> cards

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
make them into these these blank cards

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.360 
make them into these these blank cards
like<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.080> these<00:02:19.770> are<00:02:19.950> really<00:02:20.280> really

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
like this and these are really really

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.090 
like this and these are really really
nice<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.910> use<00:02:21.150> for<00:02:21.480> just<00:02:21.630> most<00:02:22.200> most<00:02:22.650> proxies

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
nice to use for just most most proxies

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.460 
nice to use for just most most proxies
they're<00:02:23.400> very<00:02:23.700> very<00:02:23.850> quick<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.240> make<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:25.320> I

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
they're very very quick to make and I

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.690 
they're very very quick to make and I
was<00:02:25.560> trying<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.800> figure<00:02:25.920> out<00:02:26.040> how<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.310> grab

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
was trying to figure out how you grab

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.670 
was trying to figure out how you grab
this<00:02:26.970> foiling<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:28.020> see<00:02:28.170> how<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.410> peels

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
this foiling you can see how it peels

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.550 
this foiling you can see how it peels
off<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.340> how<00:02:30.270> do<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.540> grab<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.050> edge<00:02:31.170> I

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
off like this how do you grab the edge I

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.530 
off like this how do you grab the edge I
tried<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.250> with<00:02:32.310> an<00:02:32.459> exacto<00:02:32.910> knife<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.240> try<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.450> a

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
tried it with an exacto knife I try to a

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.720 
tried it with an exacto knife I try to a
couple<00:02:33.870> different<00:02:33.990> things<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.190> basically<00:02:35.430> I

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
couple different things so basically I

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.580 
couple different things so basically I
figured<00:02:36.030> out<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.270> if<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.510> take<00:02:36.750> one<00:02:37.230> corner<00:02:37.500> I

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
figured out is if you take one corner I

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.220 
figured out is if you take one corner I
try<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:37.950> keep<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.340> same<00:02:38.520> corner<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:40.020> dip

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
try to keep the same corner and you dip

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.670 
try to keep the same corner and you dip
it<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:41.420> acetone<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.660> little<00:02:43.170> bit<00:02:43.320> don't<00:02:43.560> need

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
it in acetone a little bit don't need

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.670 
it in acetone a little bit don't need
much<00:02:43.830> very<00:02:44.430> little<00:02:44.910> on<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.150> corner<00:02:45.530> let's<00:02:46.530> say

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
much very little on the corner let's say

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.199 
much very little on the corner let's say
just<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.040> little<00:02:47.070> bit<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.520> corner<00:02:47.820> what<00:02:48.120> it

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
just a little bit in the corner what it

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.300 
just a little bit in the corner what it
does<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.600> allows<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.709> get<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.130> edge

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
does is it allows you to get that edge

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.610 
does is it allows you to get that edge
so<00:02:50.660> once<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.780> just<00:02:52.110> start<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.500> can

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
so once you just start it you can

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.650 
so once you just start it you can
actually<00:02:52.709> dip<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.100> again<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.700> I'm<00:02:54.209> using<00:02:54.510> it

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
actually dip it again and I'm using it

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.390 
actually dip it again and I'm using it
face<00:02:54.870> down<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.320> as<00:02:55.769> little<00:02:56.040> as<00:02:56.250> possible

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
face down so that as little as possible

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.270 
face down so that as little as possible
touches<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.060> back<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.560> card

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.660 

see<00:03:03.970> how<00:03:04.090> starting<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.990> peel<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.320> off<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:06.520> once

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
see how starting to peel it off and once

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.880 
see how starting to peel it off and once
you<00:03:06.790> get<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.060> edge<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:08.140> can<00:03:08.320> start<00:03:08.650> ripping

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
you get the edge you can start ripping

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.670 
you get the edge you can start ripping
it<00:03:09.160> off<00:03:09.570> really<00:03:10.570> simply<00:03:12.270> that's<00:03:13.270> it<00:03:13.570> so<00:03:14.530> once

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
it off really simply that's it so once

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.040 
it off really simply that's it so once
you<00:03:14.770> get<00:03:14.890> all<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.070> way<00:03:15.250> up<00:03:16.950> use<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:17.980> as<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:19.050> so

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
you get all the way up use it as a so

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.780 
you get all the way up use it as a so
that's<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:22.380> done<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:24.190> those<00:03:24.340> are<00:03:24.460> actually

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
that's it so done so those are actually

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.490 
that's it so done so those are actually
really<00:03:25.030> useful<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.750> can<00:03:25.900> do<00:03:25.990> very<00:03:26.290> quick

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
really useful you can do very quick

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.230 
really useful you can do very quick
proxies<00:03:26.920> compared<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.520> process<00:03:28.090> which

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
proxies compared to this process which

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.060 
proxies compared to this process which
takes<00:03:28.420> I<00:03:28.720> don't<00:03:29.320> know<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.650> last<00:03:29.800> one<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.010> did

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
takes I don't know the last one I did

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.310 
takes I don't know the last one I did
took<00:03:30.400> about<00:03:30.640> 15<00:03:31.300> to<00:03:31.390> 20<00:03:31.660> minutes<00:03:31.930> but<00:03:32.050> that<00:03:32.110> was

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
took about 15 to 20 minutes but that was

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.290 
took about 15 to 20 minutes but that was
with<00:03:32.440> Odyssey<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.700> one<00:03:33.880> comes<00:03:34.120> off<00:03:34.240> a

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
with Odyssey so this one comes off a

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.780 
with Odyssey so this one comes off a
little<00:03:34.600> bit<00:03:34.690> easier<00:03:34.960> won't<00:03:35.200> take<00:03:35.350> you<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.500> zone

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
little bit easier won't take you a zone

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.050 
little bit easier won't take you a zone
alright<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:37.530> that's<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.460> next<00:03:39.820> step<00:03:39.970> of

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
alright so that's that the next step of

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.450 
alright so that's that the next step of
the<00:03:40.120> process<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:42.220> applying<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:43.060> directly<00:03:43.270> to

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
the process is applying it directly to

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.320 
the process is applying it directly to
transparency<00:03:45.460> and<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:45.910> can<00:03:46.090> do<00:03:46.180> two

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
transparency and you can do two

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.940 
transparency and you can do two
different<00:03:46.450> kinds<00:03:46.810> of<00:03:46.870> transparency<00:03:47.560> one<00:03:47.770> with

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
different kinds of transparency one with

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.550 
different kinds of transparency one with
an<00:03:48.190> adhesive<00:03:48.750> built-in<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:49.990> those<00:03:50.110> are<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.320> lot

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
an adhesive built-in and those are a lot

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.120 
an adhesive built-in and those are a lot
more<00:03:50.590> expensive<00:03:50.860> direct<00:03:51.580> twenty<00:03:52.360> dollars<00:03:52.720> for

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
more expensive direct twenty dollars for

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.310 
more expensive direct twenty dollars for
twenty<00:03:54.130> ten<00:03:54.520> sheets<00:03:54.760> very<00:03:55.060> expensive<00:03:55.960> but

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
twenty ten sheets very expensive but

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.590 
twenty ten sheets very expensive but
this<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.680> just<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:57.220> plain<00:03:57.820> transparency<00:03:58.510> you

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
this is just a plain transparency you

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.520 
this is just a plain transparency you
can<00:03:58.750> buy<00:03:58.870> it<00:03:58.930> Office<00:03:59.290> Depot<00:04:01.080> basically<00:04:02.080> what

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
can buy it Office Depot basically what

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.230 
can buy it Office Depot basically what
I'm<00:04:02.620> going<00:04:02.710> to<00:04:02.800> do<00:04:02.950> is<00:04:03.250> I'm<00:04:03.850> going<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.060> go<00:04:04.150> ahead

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.530 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:04.420> use<00:04:04.600> Elmer's<00:04:05.530> spray<00:04:06.100> on<00:04:06.220> adhesive<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:07.390> get

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
and use Elmer's spray on adhesive to get

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.479 
and use Elmer's spray on adhesive to get
an<00:04:07.630> even<00:04:07.870> coat<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.500> like<00:04:09.100> this<00:04:09.220> one<00:04:09.370> because

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
an even coat I like this one because

an even coat I like this one because
it's<00:04:09.700> got<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:10.000> good<00:04:10.270> head<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:11.170> actually<00:04:11.470> gives<00:04:11.620> a

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
it's got a good head it actually gives a

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.960

real even coat and then I'm just going

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.580 
real even coat and then I'm just going
to<00:04:16.090> show<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.239> do<00:04:16.540> that<00:04:16.660> real<00:04:16.780> quick<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.140> the

where<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.560> put<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.830> ink<00:04:24.040> when<00:04:24.790> I<00:04:24.820> realized

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
where you put the ink when I realized

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.540 
where you put the ink when I realized
that<00:04:25.419> in<00:04:25.600> order<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.870> kind<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.320> make<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.280> not

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
that in order to kind of make it not

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.550 
that in order to kind of make it not
sticky<00:04:27.970> inside<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.300> sleeve<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.900> also<00:04:29.169> to<00:04:29.230> kind

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
sticky inside a sleeve and also to kind

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.340 
sticky inside a sleeve and also to kind
of<00:04:29.590> protect<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.220> ink<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:31.210> picture<00:04:31.630> what

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
of protect the ink and the picture what

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.810 
of protect the ink and the picture what
it<00:04:32.530> was<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.680> printed<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.190> backwards

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
it was I printed it backwards

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.090 
it was I printed it backwards
I<00:04:33.880> flipped<00:04:34.210> up<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:34.960> picture<00:04:35.290> so<00:04:35.590> when<00:04:35.800> I

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
I flipped up the picture so when I

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.650 
I flipped up the picture so when I
actually<00:04:36.370> stick<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.820> card<00:04:37.060> on<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.390> it

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
actually stick the card on to it

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.210 
actually stick the card on to it
the<00:04:37.900> ink<00:04:38.080> is<00:04:38.230> on<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.440> inside<00:04:38.620> rather<00:04:39.040> than<00:04:39.130> the

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
the ink is on the inside rather than the

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.980 
the ink is on the inside rather than the
outside<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:40.090> this<00:04:40.180> kind<00:04:40.419> of<00:04:40.480> protects<00:04:40.840> the

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
outside so this kind of protects the

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.550 
outside so this kind of protects the
card<00:04:41.230> I'm<00:04:41.980> just<00:04:42.130> kind<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.280> show<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:42.520> how<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:42.730> do

and preferably if you have them all
ready<00:05:38.729> it<00:05:39.150> makes<00:05:39.360> a<00:05:39.449> little<00:05:39.600> bit<00:05:39.870> easier<00:05:40.320> you

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
ready it makes a little bit easier you

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.240 
ready it makes a little bit easier you
don't<00:05:40.650> get<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.539> any<00:05:42.539> glue<00:05:43.080> drawing<00:05:43.620> just<00:05:43.770> yet

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
don't get the any glue drawing just yet

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:51.320 
don't get the any glue drawing just yet
so<00:05:44.970> I<00:05:45.030> kind<00:05:45.330> of<00:05:45.360> messed<00:05:45.539> up<00:05:45.720> that<00:05:50.150> in<00:05:51.150> this

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
so I kind of messed up that in this

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.520 
so I kind of messed up that in this
state<00:05:51.570> it<00:05:51.660> works<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.080> same<00:05:52.199> way<00:05:52.350> that<00:05:52.440> the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
state it works the same way that the

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.920 
state it works the same way that the
foil<00:05:52.770> just<00:05:52.979> stick<00:05:53.160> it<00:05:53.250> right<00:05:53.280> on<00:05:53.930> same<00:05:54.930> way

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
foil just stick it right on same way

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.490 
foil just stick it right on same way
there's<00:05:57.930> this<00:05:58.289> slight

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.720 

and<00:06:01.500> there<00:06:01.800> we<00:06:01.949> go

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.340 

so<00:06:08.730> let's<00:06:08.940> going<00:06:09.060> to<00:06:09.120> show<00:06:09.240> you<00:06:09.300> like<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.200> one

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
so let's going to show you like the one

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.480 
so let's going to show you like the one
I'm<00:06:10.440> actually<00:06:10.620> I'm<00:06:10.920> just<00:06:11.040> using<00:06:11.190> something

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
I'm actually I'm just using something

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.520 
I'm actually I'm just using something
flat<00:06:11.820> basically<00:06:12.420> just<00:06:12.660> using<00:06:13.020> it<00:06:13.200> to<00:06:13.230> roll

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
flat basically just using it to roll

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.160 
flat basically just using it to roll
across<00:06:13.680> it<00:06:14.520> kind<00:06:14.700> of<00:06:14.760> push<00:06:14.940> it<00:06:14.970> on<00:06:15.210> a<00:06:15.510> little

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
across it kind of push it on a little

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.960 
across it kind of push it on a little
harder<00:06:16.560> you<00:06:17.010> can<00:06:17.100> use<00:06:17.220> a<00:06:17.280> rolling<00:06:17.580> pin<00:06:17.730> or

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
harder you can use a rolling pin or

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:18.950 
harder you can use a rolling pin or
whatever<00:06:18.210> you<00:06:18.300> want<00:06:18.510> just<00:06:18.600> something

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
whatever you want just something

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.550 
whatever you want just something
circular<00:06:19.250> you<00:06:20.250> can<00:06:20.400> roll<00:06:20.840> so<00:06:21.840> it<00:06:22.110> makes<00:06:22.410> the

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
circular you can roll so it makes the

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.560 
circular you can roll so it makes the
glue<00:06:22.740> a<00:06:22.770> little<00:06:22.890> bit<00:06:23.190> more<00:06:23.400> even<00:06:23.730> you<00:06:24.300> kind<00:06:24.540> of

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
glue a little bit more even you kind of

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.500 
glue a little bit more even you kind of
see<00:06:24.780> the<00:06:24.900> way<00:06:25.020> it's<00:06:25.170> going<00:06:25.320> to<00:06:25.380> look<00:06:26.420> so<00:06:27.420> they

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
see the way it's going to look so they

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.220 
see the way it's going to look so they
come<00:06:27.690> up<00:06:27.780> pretty<00:06:27.960> nicely<00:06:28.290> actually<00:06:29.630> and<00:06:30.630> I'll

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
come up pretty nicely actually and I'll

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.750 
come up pretty nicely actually and I'll
show<00:06:31.410> you<00:06:31.500> a<00:06:31.560> couple<00:06:31.710> finished<00:06:32.160> products

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
show you a couple finished products

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.420 
show you a couple finished products
let's<00:06:33.210> get<00:06:33.390> that<00:06:33.930> stack<00:06:34.200> over<00:06:34.440> here<00:06:34.620> all<00:06:35.310> right

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
let's get that stack over here all right

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.520 
let's get that stack over here all right
couple<00:06:35.790> foil<00:06:36.060> ones<00:06:36.330> first<00:06:36.930> so<00:06:37.110> you<00:06:37.290> can<00:06:37.320> see

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
couple foil ones first so you can see

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.560 
couple foil ones first so you can see
how<00:06:37.680> how<00:06:38.250> nice<00:06:38.520> they<00:06:38.760> actually<00:06:39.030> come<00:06:39.150> out<00:06:39.270> this

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
how how nice they actually come out this

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.550 
how how nice they actually come out this
is<00:06:39.720> the<00:06:39.810> most<00:06:39.960> recent<00:06:40.140> one

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
is the most recent one

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.850 
is the most recent one
so<00:06:40.800> Library<00:06:41.400> of<00:06:41.460> Alexandria<00:06:41.910> a<00:06:42.480> book<00:06:43.470> would

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
so Library of Alexandria a book would

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.500 
so Library of Alexandria a book would
have<00:06:43.890> been<00:06:43.980> really<00:06:44.280> nice<00:06:44.400> but<00:06:44.670> I<00:06:44.700> had<00:06:45.480> a

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
have been really nice but I had a

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.200 
have been really nice but I had a
splotch<00:06:46.170> of<00:06:46.230> of<00:06:47.160> glue<00:06:47.490> that<00:06:47.700> I<00:06:47.760> didn't<00:06:48.090> quite

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
splotch of of glue that I didn't quite

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.770 
splotch of of glue that I didn't quite
see<00:06:48.300> so<00:06:48.950> cokes<00:06:49.950> a<00:06:50.100> little<00:06:50.340> for<00:06:50.820> and<00:06:51.480> of<00:06:51.570> course

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
see so cokes a little for and of course

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.550 
see so cokes a little for and of course

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.140 
the amazing kayo which for some reason I

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.110 
the amazing kayo which for some reason I
can't<00:07:02.900> unfortunately<00:07:04.490> well<00:07:05.490> it's<00:07:05.790> in<00:07:05.910> here

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 
can't unfortunately well it's in here

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.310 
can't unfortunately well it's in here
somewhere<00:07:06.330> okay<00:07:06.480> there's<00:07:06.840> a<00:07:06.870> couple<00:07:07.110> other

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
somewhere okay there's a couple other

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.160 
somewhere okay there's a couple other
ones<00:07:07.410> just<00:07:07.830> basic<00:07:08.670> basic<00:07:09.390> proxies<00:07:09.870> that<00:07:09.900> I've

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.170 
ones just basic basic proxies that I've

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:19.420 
ones just basic basic proxies that I've
done<00:07:11.150> and<00:07:12.150> see<00:07:12.570> if<00:07:12.630> we<00:07:12.750> can<00:07:12.870> find<00:07:13.140> that<00:07:13.260> kayak

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.890 

that's<00:07:20.000> what<00:07:22.360> all<00:07:23.360> right<00:07:23.479> well<00:07:23.750> that's

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:23.900 
that's what all right well that's

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.870 
that's what all right well that's
unfortunate<00:07:24.380> we'll<00:07:24.919> have<00:07:25.070> to<00:07:25.220> look<00:07:25.490> for<00:07:25.550> it

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:25.880 
unfortunate we'll have to look for it

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.999 
unfortunate we'll have to look for it
and<00:07:26.120> then<00:07:26.330> I'll<00:07:26.479> upload<00:07:26.930> it<00:07:27.199> as<00:07:27.350> a<00:07:27.380> short<00:07:27.800> video

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:28.009 
and then I'll upload it as a short video

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:29.740 
and then I'll upload it as a short video
on<00:07:28.310> the<00:07:28.400> next<00:07:28.550> one<00:07:28.759> all<00:07:29.060> right<00:07:29.210> that's<00:07:29.600> pretty

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
on the next one all right that's pretty

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.540 
on the next one all right that's pretty
much<00:07:29.960> the<00:07:30.110> process<00:07:30.289> pretty<00:07:30.949> simple<00:07:31.280> and<00:07:31.460> then

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
much the process pretty simple and then

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.159 
much the process pretty simple and then
you<00:07:31.639> have<00:07:31.759> to<00:07:32.449> cut<00:07:32.630> it<00:07:32.750> out<00:07:32.870> you<00:07:33.020> can<00:07:33.139> use

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169 
you have to cut it out you can use

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:34.840 
you have to cut it out you can use
scissors<00:07:33.470> or<00:07:33.770> an<00:07:33.860> exacto<00:07:34.280> knife<00:07:34.460> something

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:34.850 
scissors or an exacto knife something

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.520 
scissors or an exacto knife something
probably<00:07:35.060> better<00:07:35.300> than<00:07:35.479> this<00:07:35.600> didn't<00:07:36.380> work<00:07:36.500> so

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:36.530 
probably better than this didn't work so

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.980 
probably better than this didn't work so
well<00:07:36.800> and<00:07:37.039> that's<00:07:37.729> that's<00:07:38.449> pretty<00:07:38.690> much<00:07:38.780> it

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:38.990 
well and that's that's pretty much it

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.529 
well and that's that's pretty much it
it's<00:07:39.169> really<00:07:39.380> simple<00:07:39.620> actually<00:07:39.889> and<00:07:40.539> just

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:41.539 
it's really simple actually and just

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:43.990 
it's really simple actually and just
remember<00:07:41.930> that<00:07:42.139> if<00:07:43.070> you're<00:07:43.310> if<00:07:43.550> you're<00:07:43.580> doing

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 
remember that if you're if you're doing

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.210 
remember that if you're if you're doing
it<00:07:44.180> on<00:07:44.270> the<00:07:44.389> on<00:07:44.660> and<00:07:45.020> you're<00:07:45.650> exporting<00:07:45.979> the

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:46.220 
it on the on and you're exporting the
