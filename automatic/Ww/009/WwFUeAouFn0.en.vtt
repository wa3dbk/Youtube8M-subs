00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello now we will learn how 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.849
 to make potatoes into the potatoes 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.550
 turned out I'm not really a dish 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.530
 but rather a potato cut that serves to 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.199
 that we can leave a plate with 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:24.090
 potatoes even cuter than he is 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:26.070
 a normal rate we do potatoes 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.140
 have some potatoes left over 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.570
 better for corruption . 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.270
 then the ideas are the white potato 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.219
 English or open these potatoes 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.110
 they have a little water 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.370
 higher that causes later when the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.680
 Cook for them 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.510
 she gets a little more succulent 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600
 inside is not an ideal potato for us 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.910
 to be able to fry the potatoes to make 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.100
 people can use two different knives 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.809
 usually short knives can be a 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.989
 do so when a little bit more 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.090
 curve or can be the knife with straight blade 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.190
 now to make the tornado I prefer 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.420
 to use this flaw here we end up 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.460
 peeling potatoes 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.530
 I make a cut in them the potato is a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.580
 little big if she is smaller neighbors 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.960
 She's not even cut, she said cutting 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.510
 we do not even peel because 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.080
 exactly the turning process is this. 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.869
 here o 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.920
 Are you and kind of barking her? 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.979
 taking a part of her to let her 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.119
 pretty what we call 27 sides 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.420
 of potato 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.000
 so the 7 is an allusion to a kitchen 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.189
 old that had we not today 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.079
 need to necessarily set but is 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.990
 a more beautiful way we can 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.409
 present it will stay in the form of a 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.409
 little balloon 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.700
 O 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.290
 her end result is this here is a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.890
 battle that she looks like a little balloon and 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.100
 it has the seven or eight sides that 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.780
 normally she should be she has several 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.210
 sizes this is one of the largest sizes 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.580
 what she has is for us to understand a 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.760
 little better how to do one more then the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.460
 People always start peeling it from 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.320
 a bit coarse shape until you pull 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:16.480
 really a good piece of potato and 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.610
 making the sides in it 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.430
 these pieces that you are seeing that 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.440
 It's over here, we do not play outside. 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.380
 then you can take the bark off her 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.890
 cook and make a good potato power 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.500
 so nothing here is wasted too 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.240
 here I 'm taking all sides and 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.710
 touching the format of it it has not yet 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.170
 It's cool because his base is not 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.090
 big so I had a little bit more 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.870
 to make it more 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.620
 perfect and so I'm hitting up 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.280
 she reaches the final format takes the tip 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.000
 back 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.930
 there is a certain low end there is one more 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.930
 tornado potato 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.280
 these potatoes here I'm going to jump 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.610
 and our shredded potatoes are 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.500
 ready agents to her uncle here with a 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.659
 a little oil and in the end put a 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.099
 bit of green smell or it can only be 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.099
 the parsley and she's ready 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.680
 and this is how a lid is made 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.710
 And then you liked the video then click here 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.540
 I liked the bottom 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.710
 if there was any doubt, enjoy it more 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.210
 down in comments 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.280
 and also leave your doubt that people 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.870
 will make it clear to you if you want 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.010
