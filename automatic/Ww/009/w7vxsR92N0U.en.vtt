is<00:02:43.709> pretty<00:02:44.709> large<00:02:44.950> tree<00:02:47.220> been<00:02:48.220> pulling<00:02:48.700> stuff

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
is pretty large tree been pulling stuff

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.750 
is pretty large tree been pulling stuff
like<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:49.840> around<00:02:50.620> with<00:02:50.830> no<00:02:51.070> problem<00:02:51.730> but

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
like this around with no problem but

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.180 
like this around with no problem but
this<00:02:52.209> is<00:02:52.390> by<00:02:52.600> far<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:53.200> largest<00:02:53.560> piece<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:53.860> what

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
this is by far the largest piece of what

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.550 
this is by far the largest piece of what
I've<00:02:54.370> pulled<00:02:54.700> with<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.350> since<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.530> had<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.190> I

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
I've pulled with it since I had it and I

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.840 
I've pulled with it since I had it and I
would<00:02:59.560> say<00:02:59.770> it<00:02:59.950> would<00:03:00.070> pull<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.310> little<00:03:00.610> bit

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
would say it would pull a little bit

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.770 
would say it would pull a little bit
more<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.980> there<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.280> have<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.780> another
