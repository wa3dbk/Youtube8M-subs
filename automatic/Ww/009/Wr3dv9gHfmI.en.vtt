shooting bow and arrows and you know and
doing<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> gravity<00:02:54.569> spikes<00:02:54.870> like<00:02:55.109> I'm<00:02:55.440> doing

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
doing the gravity spikes like I'm doing

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.099 
doing the gravity spikes like I'm doing
and<00:02:56.069> stuff<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.639> that<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:57.810> will<00:02:57.959> have<00:02:58.079> a

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
gravity spikes if I go up in the air and

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.939 
gravity spikes if I go up in the air and
try<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.579> do<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.819> little<00:03:20.970> stomp<00:03:21.959> somebody

like<00:03:43.349> drop<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.310> arrows<00:03:45.230> but<00:03:46.230> like<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.590> said

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
like drop to the arrows but like I said

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.099 
like drop to the arrows but like I said
other<00:03:47.879> than<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:50.489> game<00:03:50.730> what<00:03:51.629> why<00:03:51.870> did<00:03:51.930> I

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109

ghosts<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.629> advanced<00:04:06.989> warfare<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.650> swear

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
ghosts and advanced warfare I swear

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.039 
ghosts and advanced warfare I swear
advanced<00:04:08.549> ghosts<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.449> could<00:04:09.629> play<00:04:09.810> for<00:04:10.019> a

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
advanced ghosts I could play for a

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.539 
advanced ghosts I could play for a
little<00:04:10.199> while<00:04:10.470> then<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.889> gets<00:04:11.010> boring<00:04:11.280> because

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:17.969 
warfare I used to play Oh Aussie see you

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:21.090 
warfare I used to play Oh Aussie see you
could<00:04:18.150> get<00:04:18.299> shot<00:04:18.329> down<00:04:18.620> out<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.070> sky<00:04:20.219> with

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
could get shot down out of the sky with

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.720 
could get shot down out of the sky with
you<00:04:21.250> know<00:04:21.960> which<00:04:22.960> are<00:04:23.170> um<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:24.340> know<00:04:24.490> what

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
you know which are um you know what

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.120 
you know which are um you know what
would<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.120> gravity<00:04:25.750> spikes<00:04:25.960> thing<00:04:26.260> but<00:04:27.010> if

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
would that gravity spikes thing but if

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.820 
would that gravity spikes thing but if
you<00:04:27.250> keep<00:04:27.460> looking<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.630> will<00:04:28.870> see<00:04:29.140> that<00:04:29.560> um
