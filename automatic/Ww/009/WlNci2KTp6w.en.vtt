00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so we as here tell electronics

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.099 
so we as here tell electronics
corporation<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.230> you're<00:00:04.650> doing<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.980> dual-core

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109 
corporation and you're doing a dual-core

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:16.010 
corporation and you're doing a dual-core
7-inch<00:00:07.109> capacitive<00:00:07.470> tablet<00:00:13.219> 1.6<00:00:14.219> e<00:00:14.540> 1.6<00:00:15.540> g<00:00:15.809> so

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
7-inch capacitive tablet 1.6 e 1.6 g so

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.640 
7-inch capacitive tablet 1.6 e 1.6 g so
so<00:00:16.440> there<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.840> why<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.020> say<00:00:19.170> 800

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
so there it is why do you say 800

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.689 
so there it is why do you say 800
megahertz<00:00:20.480> it's<00:00:21.480> 24<00:00:21.960> which<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:22.619> 1.6<00:00:23.460> g

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
megahertz it's 24 which is like 1.6 g

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.089 
megahertz it's 24 which is like 1.6 g
and<00:00:24.150> uh<00:00:24.420> persistent<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:25.109> angel<00:00:25.650> two<00:00:25.769> points

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
and uh persistent is angel two points

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.429 
and uh persistent is angel two points
you<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.060> 10<00:00:27.269> inches<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.260> same

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
you and we have 10 inches and the same

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.749 
you and we have 10 inches and the same
inches<00:00:28.890> but<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:29.970> 533<00:00:30.869> megahertz<00:00:31.759> it's

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
inches but is it not 533 megahertz it's

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.020 
inches but is it not 533 megahertz it's
not<00:00:32.969> 533<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.840> 800<00:00:34.290> megahertz<00:00:34.500> yes<00:00:35.160> 800<00:00:35.700> it's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
not 533 is 800 megahertz yes 800 it's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.080 
not 533 is 800 megahertz yes 800 it's
not<00:00:36.149> 533<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.079> sure<00:00:37.230> no<00:00:37.590> okay<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.850> version

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
not 533 you sure no okay this version

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:49.430 
not 533 you sure no okay this version
was<00:00:39.239> 533<00:00:39.989> inversion<00:00:40.379> was<00:00:40.500> 800<00:00:41.930> no<00:00:42.930> no<00:00:44.090> okay<00:00:48.440> but

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
was 533 inversion was 800 no no okay but

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590 
was 533 inversion was 800 no no okay but
this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.829> 10.1<00:00:50.430> inch<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.820> one<00:00:51.000> how's

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
this is 10.1 inch this one how's

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.299 
this is 10.1 inch this one how's
different<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.079> that's<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> that's<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.160> one

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
different one that's the that's that one

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.189 
different one that's the that's that one
is<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.879> same<00:00:54.059> cpu<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.809> they're<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> same

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
is the same cpu and they're the same

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.380 
is the same cpu and they're the same
Scipio<00:00:55.620> ever<00:00:55.829> since<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> same<00:00:56.370> alright<00:00:57.030> same

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
Scipio ever since the same alright same

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.689 
Scipio ever since the same alright same
function<00:00:57.870> only<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.379> screen<00:00:58.649> sizes<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.219> fit<00:00:59.250> so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
function only the screen sizes to fit so

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.280 
function only the screen sizes to fit so
let's<00:00:59.879> check<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> other<00:01:00.270> one

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.540 

this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.830> showing<00:01:06.650> cages<00:01:07.650> ok<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.370> one

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
this is showing cages ok this one

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.800 
this is showing cages ok this one
doesn't<00:01:08.880> work<00:01:08.910> out<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.600> doesn't<00:01:10.020> turn<00:01:11.810> designs

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
doesn't work out it doesn't turn designs

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.060 
doesn't work out it doesn't turn designs
so<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:15.420> here

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
so it's going to be like this in here

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.230 
so it's going to be like this in here
all<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:19.010> is<00:01:20.010> this<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.520> high-resolution

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
all right so is this a high-resolution

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.120 
all right so is this a high-resolution
screen<00:01:21.510> or<00:01:21.690> is<00:01:21.810> 800<00:01:22.320> time<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.830> Eddie<00:01:23.010> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
screen or is 800 time for Eddie the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.840 
screen or is 800 time for Eddie the
screen<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.240> capacitive<00:01:25.020> screen<00:01:25.850> mr.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
screen this is capacitive screen mr.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.870 
screen this is capacitive screen mr.
