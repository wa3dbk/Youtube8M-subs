00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.469
 I could upload video because I had 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.670
 been very busy but I promise you that 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.430

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.930

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.180
 psychoanalyst because several people will 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.690
 they asked to talk about him in fact 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.609
 I had never read but provided the 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.230

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.869
 encouraged but as you told me 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.000
 I bought it because I bought it and read it 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.510

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.600

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.940
 suspense novel and the protagonist of 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.250

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.160
 letter signed by Mr. r 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.040
 and this gentleman tells you in the letter that 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.410
 You have 15 days to discover who he is 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.960
 and if you do not discover it you have two options 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.879
 the first is suicide and the second is 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.030

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.760
 yours 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.950
 so it's a game class has 15 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.690
 days if you discover who is the author of the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.180
 letter manages to live and continues with his life 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.700
 normal and if you do not achieve it then you have to 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.229
 choose between these two options in this 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.830
 game also involved two others 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.830
 people 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.190
 the first is virile that is a woman 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.990
 very attractive that you could say that 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.460
 help the doctor is here giving you clues 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.390
 to discover who is the author of the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.240
 letter and the second person is marilyn and 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.050
 berlin is a lawyer who represents a 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.850
 to a fictional character who demands the 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.060
 doctor stacks of sexual abuse 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.649
 practically the role of merlin is 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.649
 discredit and isolate the doctor were you 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.350
 the book I liked a lot makes me very 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.120
 interesting how the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.700
 psychology of the characters and how 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.440
 you get to know the characters you get to 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.290
 know how they are and why they are from that 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.200
 way I have a teacher who created us 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.880
 that we all care about health 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.050
 common diseases but in 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.750
 no one really cared about the 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.000
 mental illnesses and told us the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.500
 next sentence mental health is what 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.500
 most delicate of the human being 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.730
 I think he's right, you just need to 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.040
 pass an event that can mark 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.510
 can not twist our 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.240
 feelings can make us change 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.670
 as people and I think that's a floor 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.190
 what happened to the people in this book 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.319
 that was all for the video thank you very much 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.110
 if you have any comments a suggestion 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.770
 they want to tell me something whatever it is here 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.130
 down or on twitter and well that's it 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.130
 wrong
