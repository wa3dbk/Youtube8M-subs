00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
a high top or low top um I guess it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
a high top or low top um I guess it
depends<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.829> mood<00:01:50.070> depends<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> on

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
depends on the mood depends on the on

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.770 
depends on the mood depends on the on
the<00:01:51.030> outfit<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.020> gear<00:01:53.390> probably<00:01:54.390> low<00:01:54.509> top

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the outfit the gear probably low top

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.050 
the outfit the gear probably low top
gives<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> little<00:01:55.259> more<00:01:55.380> ankle<00:01:55.829> mobility

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
gives you a little more ankle mobility

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.840 
gives you a little more ankle mobility
but<00:01:57.060> high<00:01:57.540> top

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
but high top

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.179 
but high top
gives<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.750> that<00:01:59.900> ankle<00:02:00.260> support<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.009> just

gives you that ankle support so it just

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.130 
gives you that ankle support so it just
depends<00:02:01.509> depends<00:02:02.509> where<00:02:02.659> you're<00:02:02.780> where<00:02:03.020> your
