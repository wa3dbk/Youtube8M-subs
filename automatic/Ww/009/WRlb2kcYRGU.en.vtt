00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
see the pixel at all you can't see the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.890 
see the pixel at all you can't see the
pixel<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.520> ball<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> screen<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.479> when<00:01:15.630> i<00:01:15.659> go

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
pixel a ball on the screen but when i go

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.899 
pixel a ball on the screen but when i go
to<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.200> next<00:01:16.409> image<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.040> start<00:01:17.310> moving<00:01:17.580> it

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
to the next image and start moving it

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.590 
to the next image and start moving it
the<00:01:18.509> image<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.369> pixel<00:01:20.369> starts<00:01:20.729> fading<00:01:21.210> in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the image or the pixel starts fading in

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840 
the image or the pixel starts fading in
but<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> doesn't<00:01:22.830> do<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.189> when<00:01:23.430> i<00:01:23.460> start

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
but it doesn't do that when i start

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.039 
but it doesn't do that when i start
moving<00:01:24.210> away<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.780> video<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.670> really

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
moving away the video so that is really

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.940 
moving away the video so that is really
really<00:01:28.049> odd<00:01:29.210> also<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.420> other<00:01:30.630> images<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.590> just

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
really odd also on other images it just

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.280 
really odd also on other images it just
won't<00:01:32.130> show<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.020> kind<00:01:34.170> of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
won't show up and you can see it kind of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.679 
won't show up and you can see it kind of
in<00:01:34.470> between<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.369> black<00:01:35.640> lines<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.450> when<00:01:36.659> i

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
in between the black lines here when i

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.499 
in between the black lines here when i
move<00:01:37.200> through<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> images<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:39.000> show<00:01:39.299> up

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
move through the images it will show up

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.480 
move through the images it will show up
for<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> second<00:01:40.290> sometimes<00:01:40.829> they'll<00:01:41.070> show<00:01:41.310> up

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
for a second sometimes they'll show up

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.660 
for a second sometimes they'll show up
like<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.880> i'm<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.960> fully<00:01:43.619> black<00:01:43.979> image<00:01:44.399> like

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
like if i'm on a fully black image like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.730 
like if i'm on a fully black image like
i<00:01:44.850> am<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.659> start<00:01:45.930> showing<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
i am here it will start showing up and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.399 
i am here it will start showing up and
it<00:01:47.220> will<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:47.490> show<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.899> corners<00:01:49.380> of

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
it will also show up in the corners of

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.520 
it will also show up in the corners of
the<00:01:49.770> image<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:50.880> when<00:01:51.780> I'm<00:01:51.930> moving<00:01:52.350> it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the image right here when I'm moving it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.550 
the image right here when I'm moving it
but<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.430> doesn't<00:01:53.850> seem<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> want<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.960> show<00:01:55.320> up

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
