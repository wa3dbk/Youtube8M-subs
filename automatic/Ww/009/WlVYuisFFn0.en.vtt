too bad that it's hard to tell it is a
little<00:01:36.670> bit<00:01:36.880> complicated<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:38.470> people<00:01:38.500> and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
little bit complicated for people and

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.440 
little bit complicated for people and
also<00:01:39.729> we<00:01:40.210> have<00:01:40.540> our<00:01:41.380> water<00:01:42.180> filters<00:01:43.180> on<00:01:43.420> our

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
also we have our water filters on our

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.950 
also we have our water filters on our
juror<00:01:44.080> page<00:01:44.470> water<00:01:44.860> filters<00:01:45.280> we<00:01:45.909> list<00:01:46.540> what

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
juror page water filters we list what

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.039 
juror page water filters we list what
filters<00:01:47.560> fit<00:01:48.460> what<00:01:48.729> machines<00:01:49.119> but<00:01:49.600> this<00:01:49.869> is

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
filters fit what machines but this is

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.920 
filters fit what machines but this is
the<00:01:50.170> easy<00:01:50.350> way<00:01:50.650> yeah<00:01:50.979> with<00:01:51.610> jurors<00:01:51.850> it's<00:01:52.150> more

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
the easy way yeah with jurors it's more

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.020 
the easy way yeah with jurors it's more
complicated<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:54.159> is<00:01:54.369> so<00:01:54.549> easy<00:01:54.729> that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
complicated so this is so easy that

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.030 
complicated so this is so easy that
they've<00:01:55.180> made<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.540> color<00:01:55.750> yeah<00:01:56.439> it's<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.770> lot

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
they've made it a color yeah it's a lot

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.230 
they've made it a color yeah it's a lot
easier<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.400> then<00:01:57.670> they<00:01:57.790> have<00:01:57.939> this<00:01:58.060> little

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
easier and then they have this little

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.730 
easier and then they have this little
thing<00:01:58.360> up<00:01:58.630> here<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.990> where<00:01:59.140> you<00:01:59.200> can<00:01:59.320> set<00:01:59.560> the

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
thing up here to where you can set the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.840 
thing up here to where you can set the
