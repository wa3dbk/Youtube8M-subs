00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.910
 they now go to another module 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.029
 of infringement 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.710
 refraction of light is also a way for the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.840
 people have a certain ease in 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.890
 most of them equations are quite 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.990
 simple, right? 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.460
 So I wanted you to go into the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.439
 Little world with me here, we are for people. 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.059
 begin to understand we often 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.050
 for example on the edge of a 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.309
 swimming pool né 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.930
 And look at the bottom of the pool has the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.390
 feel of the tile is higher up 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.320
 so it seems like it rocks and such care 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.790
 thereby 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.129
 it's an optical phenomenon we know 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.650
 as refraction another example you take 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.420
 for example a glass of good water with 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.059
 pencil from the inside and has the feel 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.550
 the pencil has broken too. 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.200
 feeling where you have saved is not called 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.510
 refraction that is an optical phenomenon that 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.640
 happens when the light changes 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.219
 When she changes from email she suffers 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.670
 change in their speed and this change 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.700
 in its speed could even lead to a 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.770
 deviation and this deviation from the light galera that 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.380
 not a refraction is the consequence of 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.899
 change in velocity the refraction is 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.450
 change in the speed of light due to the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.310
 change in the environment in which it spreads 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.470
 beauty then we have to start 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.110
 this module with the basic concept 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.940
 called the refractive index all in all 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.800
 we say that the indigent in their midst 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.640
 of the year then that going guy 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.470
 characterize will measure how much refraction to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.170
 light will suffer in the change of email 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.649
 how much of a change of speed does it go? 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.720
 to suffer 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.929
 by changing means and then we have two 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.910
 ways to parameterize it right to 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.670
 first would be through the index 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.489
 absolute what would be of me without solution 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.810
 measured in relation to the speed of light in the 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.390
 vacuum that is a speed that people 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.550
 certainly know right then we have 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.619
 that the index refraction is the velocity of 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.319
 light is not divided by the speed of the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.899
 light or question so for example I want 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:07.259
 know how much the index is worth 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.450
 she gives light on the plastic is then the index 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.970
 refraction of light on a plastic would 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.099
 three times octave, which is the value of 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.110
 speed of light does not divide by the 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.599
 than light that effectively does not 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.060
 neighborhood how to calculate and glass that 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.790
 value requested by the speed of light 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.010
 the glass then the index of a medium 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.080
 any speed today a fact 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.520
 divided by the speed of light 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.880
 this means that you are calculating the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.550
 index too and then I noticed the following 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.210
 the greater the speed of light in the 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.480
 medium 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.100
 the less will be the index of refraction 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.320
 then agrees its target by increasing 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.180
 speed of gmail will decrease the 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.520
 refraction index and which is the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.070
 speed of light can assume 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.260
 the speed of light in the vacuum then 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.060
 when here was the highest value 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.120
 that is to say when three times the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.550
 octave the index will assume the lowest 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:06.330
 possible value so we say that 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:08.130
 the index of light in vacuum one also then 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.470
 the index of refraction of light was not worth 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.060
 because that value would be here then this 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.310
 divided by a value equal to the parent in a 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.260
 of problems often people 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.480
 considers this value the air neither because the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.660
 speed of light there is very close 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.040
 value there with rounding 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.709
 situation of the student to have this 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.300
 also more or less expensive chair 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.800
 It's not perfect but it's to give a gift to 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.140
 give a good idea of ​​how people 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.360
 really a day for example you that I 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.430
 want to run around the room 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.840
 of a room, for example, it is good to run from 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.670
 one side to the other beauty 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.200
 if I have no obstacle if she 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.180
 I 'm free I 'll get one 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.580
 first my highest legal speed 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.620
 not then how much less matter has medium 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.200
 but I can more easily 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.690
 propagate easier with five died 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.430
 now his chair in his room 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.070
 obstacles and trying to get to the other side 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.050
 I'm going to take these seats from the flight to 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.970
 think about them and I will not have to divert 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.350
 in a certain way and that's what made 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.600
 increase the time will decrease 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.700
 speed then how much more matter 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.430
 have the most difficult means of light 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.130
 also propagated then the more you read the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.110
 your middle lower the speed of light 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.620
 the lower the speed of light 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.739
 greater will be 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.720
 the index of refraction beauty then the 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.030
 very large inflation index is a 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.810
 indicating that it is very difficult law 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.220
 to spread 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.520
 I do not want you to have this relationship 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.530
 on the head so much content very dance 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.290
 It's a very difficult medium she's paying 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.630
 the index as close to 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.560
 an easier not to spread 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.540
 something else that is very important 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.669
 when you have calculated in situation 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.340
 of absolute or calculate the index of there 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.770
 of rubber so inventing people of the 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.330
 God damn the oil will be car time by 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.880
 calculate the index of light in the 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.620
 Car're beauty is how do I 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.780
 calculate the index would not be 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.789
 Let's survive that I'm going to make mine. 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.840
 account and I think the absolute index 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:01.300
 of 0.75 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.490
 I'm absolutely sure I was going to have it. 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.539
 what to do because because 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.600
 I told you 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:11.770
 the lowest index for higher speed 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.169
 the lowest index is when it is worth 15 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.060
 smaller is any value I think 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.789
 smaller than a land on account that I 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.340
 I did some wrong process he entered 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.490
 this too obviously 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.950
 company that in relation to going well 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.950
 another very important thing is the index 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.510
 certain good is that when 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.639
 we talk about one relative to 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.039
 to the other ratio in the indices 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.740
 okay then that would be the index in the middle in 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.539
 relation to my 20 plastic and glass 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.760
 index of plastic divided by index 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:46.240
 and how does the calculation of the 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.389
 1 ess index is about seeing a calculation 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.610
 2 index is about to be two and then the 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.800
 People get the first one right and multiply 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.199
 the second by the inverse you will reach the 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.160
 conclusion that me a nephew and two is 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:02.560
 equal to v2 survive and a good one then 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.360
 beware of this order or teaching 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.760
 plastic on the index of glass by 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.680
 example will be the speed with which the 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.000
 light propagates glass and sold by the 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.310
 speed with which it spreads in the 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.240
 plastic then in a nephew and two 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:19.979
 governors about seeing a good team in 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.979
 absolute relative in itself
