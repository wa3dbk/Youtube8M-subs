a key focus for the industry to achieve

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.069 
a key focus for the industry to achieve
this<00:00:29.839> is<00:00:30.109> to<00:00:30.169> downsize<00:00:30.859> engines<00:00:31.689> in<00:00:32.689> essence

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.010 

so<00:01:54.899> how<00:01:55.079> does<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:57.030> V<00:01:57.299> charge<00:01:57.600> unit

so how does it do this the V charge unit

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.929 
so how does it do this the V charge unit
is<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.229> gearless<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.890> fully<00:01:59.250> variable<00:01:59.729> pressure

so<00:02:21.990> we<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.680> convert<00:02:22.950> an<00:02:23.130> engine<00:02:23.400> speed<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.940> say

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
so we can convert an engine speed of say

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.060 
so we can convert an engine speed of say
1500<00:02:25.230> rpm<00:02:25.650> up<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:27.140> 150,000<00:02:28.140> rpm<00:02:28.560> at<00:02:28.860> the

turbine there is always a lag whilst the

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.140 
turbine there is always a lag whilst the
speed<00:03:30.530> picks<00:03:30.830> up<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.220> create<00:03:31.520> more<00:03:31.790> exhaust

speed picks up to create more exhaust

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.590

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.840 
and hence more boost once it's warmed up
it<00:03:35.690> works<00:03:35.990> well<00:03:36.320> but<00:03:37.280> at<00:03:37.430> higher<00:03:37.640> engine

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
it works well but at higher engine

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.420 
it works well but at higher engine
speeds<00:03:38.030> there's<00:03:38.570> too<00:03:38.750> much<00:03:38.900> boost<00:03:39.230> at<00:03:40.100> which
