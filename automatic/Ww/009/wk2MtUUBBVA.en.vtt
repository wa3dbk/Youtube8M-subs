because<00:02:39.540> that's<00:02:39.780> where<00:02:40.050> we're<00:02:40.230> investigating

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
because that's where we're investigating

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.750 
because that's where we're investigating
the<00:02:41.280> freezing<00:02:41.760> temperature<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.930> water

during the first part of the graph you

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.990 
during the first part of the graph you
can<00:02:49.410> see<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.860> temperature<00:02:50.340> drops<00:02:50.700> as

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
can see that the temperature drops as

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.380 
can see that the temperature drops as
the<00:02:51.450> water<00:02:51.630> cools<00:02:51.990> in<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.230> test<00:02:52.470> tube<00:02:53.390> during

the water cools in the test tube during

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.090 
the water cools in the test tube during
this<00:02:54.570> part<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.110> graph<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.590> temperature

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
this part of the graph the temperature

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.820 
this part of the graph the temperature
stays<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.610> same<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:57.930> because<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.680> water

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
stays the same this is because the water

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.350 
stays the same this is because the water
in<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.160> test<00:02:59.400> tube<00:02:59.490> is<00:02:59.790> going<00:03:00.120> through<00:03:00.300> a
