slow<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.459> down<00:02:30.580> enough<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.239> people<00:02:31.269> kind<00:02:31.780> of

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870

guess<00:02:33.099> when<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.400> went<00:02:33.849> because<00:02:34.120> your<00:02:34.269> style

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
guess when you went because your style

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.540 
guess when you went because your style
is<00:02:34.750> somewhat<00:02:35.140> like<00:02:35.349> yeah<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.769> know<00:02:36.040> early<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.400> is

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
is somewhat like yeah I know early on is

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.160 
is somewhat like yeah I know early on is
what<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.790> base<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.330> on<00:02:37.540> kind<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.840> preaching

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
what you base it on kind of preaching

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.330 
what you base it on kind of preaching
you<00:02:38.500> know<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.620> didn't<00:02:38.830> put<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.010> state's<00:02:39.220> future

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
you know I didn't put the state's future

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.309 
you know I didn't put the state's future
nothing<00:02:39.670> from<00:02:40.000> like<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.269> family<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.080> preachers

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
nothing from like a family of preachers

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.920 
nothing from like a family of preachers
and<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.799> kind<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.489> know<00:02:42.790> my<00:02:42.940> dad<00:02:43.269> broke<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.690> mold

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
and I kind of know my dad broke the mold

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.839 
and I kind of know my dad broke the mold
and<00:02:44.110> then<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.349> continued<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.340> break<00:02:45.489> them<00:02:45.700> all

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
and then I continued to break them all

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.150 
and then I continued to break them all
so<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.299> grew<00:02:46.569> up<00:02:46.629> a<00:02:46.780> lot<00:02:46.989> around<00:02:47.530> preachers

and I guess some of it gets into the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.479 
and I guess some of it gets into the
work<00:02:50.319> and<00:02:50.530> when<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.799> see<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.130> content<00:02:51.400> with
