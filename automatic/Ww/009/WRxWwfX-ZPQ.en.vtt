00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.210
 Hello everyone today, let's look at how to play 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.750
 song valentine strykalo I beat women and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.689
 children 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.099
 why you ask me because in 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.520
 my group vkontakte 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.150
 this song won the question what song 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.370
 parse the next I added for fun 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.370
 do you ask much 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.550
 let's go so first chord we have a chord 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.489
 already see here you have drawn everything 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.489
 simple valentine chords not 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.770
 bother and when we him him alive 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.420
 we play a simple six fight 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.030
 down down up up everywhere 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.910
 we play it twice on this chord 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.010
 then go to the Kurds 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.110
 on it, too, play the same will be twice 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.500
 then me 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.030
 m no m we play on it twice then 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.600
 am 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.159
 once from 1 and d 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.229
 at the time this fight 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.859
 try this piece to play with 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.859
 my underwear on 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.930
 Well 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.710
 ok next he goes to kurt valuable 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:45.060
 which plays the same fight twice 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.060
 then tm 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.430
 sometimes he plays the same fight sometimes 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.320
 once and sometimes twice in concert 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.210
 you can see the records here 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.610
 if he does there once 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 pause and then move on to the next 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.380
 a piece of 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.860
 okay think the next bit is clear 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.860
 in the following way 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.630
 this is where he appeared those funny things 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.680
 He gave his legs under the liver for such words and 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.560
 everything is in that spirit 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.500
 what's the trick chords are all the same 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.270
 only he changes the pain for example 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.270
 does he just make two blows down 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:38.049
 then you have two blows down again 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.049
 then on em again full fight six 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.990
 then on and on again just 2 water equals 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.430
 you are two blows down again 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.430
 same full fight 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.930
 here it was the whole verse chorus nothing 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.569
 does not change everything goes on for sure 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.940
 the same analogy in exactly the same rhythm 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.420
 and now for fixing let's play 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.459
 together with me 1 verse and one chorus 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.310
 fairly slow tempo when 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:15.010
 podpoyu how I will turn out so go 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.010
 one two three May 4 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.020
 right but 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.020
 I'm broken and 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.920
 course 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.920
 small her keepers foot 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.950
 I beat women 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.940
 one will be the world 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.630
 but because language 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.630
 and 1 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.970
 a game 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.280
 and I salon 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.420
 but 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.880
 and then a pause and the second verse begins 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.709
