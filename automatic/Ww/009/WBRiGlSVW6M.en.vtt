device I'd love to yes given your age
has<00:01:18.440> been<00:01:18.680> hard<00:01:18.979> gaining<00:01:19.520> respect<00:01:20.119> from

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
has been hard gaining respect from

has been hard gaining respect from
seniors<00:01:20.810> in<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.259> scientific<00:01:21.830> field<00:01:21.860> oh<00:01:22.280> it's

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
seniors in the scientific field oh it's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.690

a<00:01:22.700> very<00:01:22.880> good<00:01:23.060> question<00:01:23.479> sir<00:01:23.960> no<00:01:24.710> actually<00:01:25.550> I

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
a very good question sir no actually I

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.190 
a very good question sir no actually I
found<00:01:25.970> my<00:01:26.180> colleagues<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.899> be<00:01:27.050> able

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
found my colleagues to be able

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.980 
found my colleagues to be able
professional<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.450> open-minded<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.600> hasn't

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
professional and open-minded it hasn't

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.499 
professional and open-minded it hasn't
been<00:01:30.110> hard<00:01:30.380> at<00:01:30.500> all<00:01:30.640> second<00:01:31.640> grade<00:01:31.910> is<00:01:32.240> really

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
been hard at all second grade is really

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.649 
been hard at all second grade is really
hard<00:01:32.960> because<00:01:33.590> we<00:01:34.549> just<00:01:34.820> learned<00:01:35.030> regular

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
hard because we just learned regular

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.570 
hard because we just learned regular
letters<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.290> now<00:01:36.409> we<00:01:36.470> have<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.860> run<00:01:37.010> curly

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
letters and now we have to run curly

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.020 
letters and now we have to run curly
letters

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.920 

let's<00:01:43.030> change<00:01:43.810> this<00:01:45.000> um<00:01:46.000> yes<00:01:47.010> hmm

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
did bean a twin inspire you to design

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.899 
did bean a twin inspire you to design
this<00:01:52.479> cloning<00:01:52.900> device<00:01:53.009> very<00:01:54.009> good<00:01:54.340> question

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
this cloning device very good question

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.780 
this cloning device very good question
sir<00:01:55.180> actually<00:01:55.690> yes<00:01:56.200> as<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.560> fraternal<00:01:57.280> twin<00:01:57.580> I

sir actually yes as a fraternal twin I

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.219 
sir actually yes as a fraternal twin I
was<00:01:57.909> always<00:01:58.030> very<00:01:58.149> interested<00:01:58.479> in<00:01:59.170> a

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
was always very interested in a

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.889 
was always very interested in a
telepathic<00:01:59.800> bond<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:00.670> wins<00:02:00.940> shams<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.720> know

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
telepathic bond that wins shams you know

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.210 
telepathic bond that wins shams you know
what<00:02:02.080> we're<00:02:02.649> twins

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
what we're twins

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.830 
what we're twins
it<00:02:03.310> was<00:02:03.490> sleeping<00:02:03.850> twin<00:02:04.090> beds<00:02:06.390> I'm<00:02:07.390> Victor

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
it was sleeping twin beds I'm Victor

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.050 
it was sleeping twin beds I'm Victor
sometimes<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.619> go<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:08.830> sleep<00:02:09.160> with<00:02:09.310> gum<00:02:09.819> on<00:02:10.030> my

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
sometimes I go to sleep with gum on my

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.420 
sometimes I go to sleep with gum on my
mouth<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.840> ends<00:02:11.140> up<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:11.410> my<00:02:11.440> hair<00:02:13.980> today<00:02:14.980> so

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
mouth and it ends up in my hair today so

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.370 
mouth and it ends up in my hair today so
much<00:02:15.580> technology<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.690> geared<00:02:17.019> towards

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
much technology is geared towards

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.550 
much technology is geared towards
weaponry<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.370> destruction<00:02:19.269> of<00:02:19.720> life<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.380> and
