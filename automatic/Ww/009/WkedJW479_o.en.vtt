00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.670
 That's the way. 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:50.050

 Oh, so you can fix it. 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:43.170
 It's pretty big. 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:47.549
 There's a little laughing out there . 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:52.709

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:56.850
 But you said it was a human being . 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:58.140

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.530
 It's a product. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.769
 I did not do this. This guy gave me a present as a present on my computer. 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.660

 Okay 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.380
 Yes, I have a lot of hard work. 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.470
 It's good to be wrong once the homepage is cleaned. 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:49.940
