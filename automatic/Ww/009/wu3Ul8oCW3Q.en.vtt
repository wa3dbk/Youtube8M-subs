this<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.090> that's<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> reason<00:01:48.600> why<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.020> used<00:01:49.439> 8

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
this and that's the reason why I used 8

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.960 
this and that's the reason why I used 8
this<00:01:49.860> smells<00:01:50.130> amazing<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.670> I've<00:01:50.729> been<00:01:50.850> using

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
this smells amazing and I've been using

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.310 
this smells amazing and I've been using
it<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.329> quite<00:01:51.420> some<00:01:51.630> time<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.810> bought<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
it for quite some time I bought it in a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.810 
it for quite some time I bought it in a
two<00:01:52.530> pack<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> heat

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
two pack and that's for a heat

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.639 
two pack and that's for a heat
protectant<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.450> actually<00:01:54.630> don't<00:01:54.899> use<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
protectant I actually don't use one and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.590 
protectant I actually don't use one and
I<00:01:55.799> figured<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.399> because<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> only<00:01:57.000> curl<00:01:57.479> my

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
I figured it's because I only curl my

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.160 
I figured it's because I only curl my
hair<00:01:57.630> every<00:01:58.140> two<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.710> three<00:01:58.740> days<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.450> just

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
hair every two to three days so I just

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.039 
hair every two to three days so I just
kind<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.680> opted<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.420> know<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.869> that's

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
kind of opted out but I know that that's

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.319 
kind of opted out but I know that that's
bad<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.950> if<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.310> guys<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.119> anything

big<00:02:49.140> giant<00:02:49.500> one<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.610> was<00:02:50.730> cool<00:02:50.940> it's<00:02:51.210> just

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
big giant one and it was cool it's just

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.060 
big giant one and it was cool it's just
that<00:02:51.570> after<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.050> second<00:02:52.410> day<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.770> after<00:02:52.980> the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
that after the second day and after the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.680 
that after the second day and after the
third<00:02:53.280> day<00:02:53.460> in<00:02:53.700> my<00:02:53.790> hair<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.150> looks<00:02:54.330> really

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
third day in my hair it looks really

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.930 
third day in my hair it looks really
straight<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:56.040> was<00:02:56.160> kind<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.520> flippy

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
straight and it was kind of like flippy

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.870 
straight and it was kind of like flippy
DJ<00:02:57.330> at<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.630> bottom<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.650> was<00:02:58.770> nice<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.460> um

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
DJ at the bottom and it was nice but um

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.080 
DJ at the bottom and it was nice but um
I<00:03:00.300> figured<00:03:00.870> when<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.380> use<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.980> smaller<00:03:02.400> size<00:03:02.760> it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
I figured when I use the smaller size it

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.400 
I figured when I use the smaller size it
curls<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> lot<00:03:03.630> faster<00:03:04.020> because<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.230> don't

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
curls it a lot faster because I don't

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.260 
curls it a lot faster because I don't
keep<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:05.250> heat<00:03:05.430> for<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.700> long<00:03:05.970> after

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
keep it on the heat for that long after

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.330 
keep it on the heat for that long after
the<00:03:06.780> second<00:03:07.080> day<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:07.500> kind<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:07.980> wavy<00:03:08.160> gravy

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
the second day it's kind of wavy gravy

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.220 
the second day it's kind of wavy gravy
and<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.910> third<00:03:09.060> day<00:03:09.270> it's<00:03:09.420> more<00:03:09.570> straight<00:03:09.960> but

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
and the third day it's more straight but

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.220 
and the third day it's more straight but
with<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.380> flow<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.520> I<00:03:11.910> figured<00:03:12.270> I<00:03:12.540> might<00:03:13.080> as<00:03:13.170> well

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
with a flow so I figured I might as well

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.020 
with a flow so I figured I might as well
just<00:03:13.440> start<00:03:13.590> out<00:03:13.740> with<00:03:13.830> like<00:03:13.980> big<00:03:14.340> curly<00:03:14.820> hair

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
just start out with like big curly hair

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.880 
just start out with like big curly hair
the<00:03:15.180> first<00:03:15.360> day<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.959> then<00:03:16.230> kind<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.500> wind<00:03:16.740> down

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
the first day and then kind of wind down

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.990 
the first day and then kind of wind down
from<00:03:17.040> there<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.490> that's<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.670> reason<00:03:17.760> why<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
from there so that's the reason why the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.510 
from there so that's the reason why the
second<00:03:18.330> size<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.810> always<00:03:18.990> on<00:03:19.470> my<00:03:19.620> turn<00:03:19.860> it's

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
second size is always on my turn it's

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.860 
second size is always on my turn it's
really<00:03:20.760> cool<00:03:20.910> because<00:03:21.060> what<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.450> do<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.720> you

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
really cool because what you do is you

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.420 
really cool because what you do is you
kind<00:03:22.050> of<00:03:22.080> lock<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.530> place<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.100> turn<00:03:23.280> it

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
kind of lock it in place and you turn it

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.680 
kind of lock it in place and you turn it
on<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> cool<00:03:24.240> thing<00:03:24.270> is<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.510> it's

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
on and the cool thing is that it's

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.880 
on and the cool thing is that it's
ceramic<00:03:25.050> so<00:03:25.170> it's<00:03:25.290> not<00:03:25.380> too<00:03:25.500> bad<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:25.800> your

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
bottom section of my hair because it's

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.560 
bottom section of my hair because it's
normally<00:04:11.220> not<00:04:11.250> as<00:04:11.670> frizzy<00:04:12.120> as<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.360> top

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
normally not as frizzy as the top

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.720 
normally not as frizzy as the top
section<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:13.020> my<00:04:13.110> her

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
section of my her

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.970 
section of my her
can<00:04:13.879> I<00:04:13.909> just<00:04:14.209> fly<00:04:14.780> through<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.560> kind<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.769> do

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
can I just fly through it and kind of do

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.189 
can I just fly through it and kind of do
the<00:04:16.609> curls<00:04:16.880> really<00:04:17.239> quickly<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.750> I<00:04:17.810> normally

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
the curls really quickly and I normally

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.110 
the curls really quickly and I normally
just<00:04:18.380> curl<00:04:18.560> it<00:04:18.709> away<00:04:18.859> from<00:04:19.040> my<00:04:19.160> face<00:04:19.400> so<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:19.970> do

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
just curl it away from my face so I do

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.610 
just curl it away from my face so I do
it<00:04:20.209> all<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.510> way<00:04:20.600> around<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.139> I<00:04:21.229> kind<00:04:21.410> of<00:04:21.440> do

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
it all the way around and I kind of do

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.430 
it all the way around and I kind of do
it<00:04:21.769> not<00:04:22.639> really<00:04:22.910> using<00:04:23.449> like<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.660> pattern<00:04:24.080> I'm

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
it not really using like a pattern I'm

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.110 
it not really using like a pattern I'm
not<00:04:24.919> really<00:04:25.070> perfect<00:04:25.460> with<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.639> and<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:25.910> kind<00:04:26.090> of

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
not really perfect with it and I kind of

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.610 
not really perfect with it and I kind of
skip<00:04:26.360> sections<00:04:26.720> too<00:04:26.960> because<00:04:27.199> it's<00:04:27.350> just<00:04:27.530> the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
skip sections too because it's just the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.810 
skip sections too because it's just the
bottom<00:04:27.740> of<00:04:27.919> my<00:04:27.979> hair<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.520> was<00:04:28.639> really

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
bottom of my hair and it was really

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.670 
bottom of my hair and it was really
gonna<00:04:28.910> pay<00:04:29.090> attention<00:04:29.510> to<00:04:29.690> it<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.169> I<00:04:30.410> also

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
gonna pay attention to it and I also

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.260 
gonna pay attention to it and I also
like<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.100> messy<00:04:31.370> look<00:04:31.550> too<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.000> then<00:04:32.120> what<00:04:32.240> I

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
like the messy look too and then what I

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.900 
like the messy look too and then what I
do<00:04:32.389> is<00:04:32.750> I<00:04:32.840> divide<00:04:33.199> one<00:04:33.470> section<00:04:34.160> on<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.760> side

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
do is I divide one section on the side

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.450 
do is I divide one section on the side
of<00:04:35.030> my<00:04:35.120> head<00:04:35.330> across<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.260> I<00:04:36.290> kind<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.560> just<00:04:36.800> do

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
of my head across and I kind of just do

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.700 
of my head across and I kind of just do
the<00:04:37.580> same<00:04:37.729> thing<00:04:37.790> but<00:04:38.720> pay<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:38.930> little<00:04:39.320> bit<00:04:39.440> more

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
the same thing but pay a little bit more

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.469 
the same thing but pay a little bit more
attention<00:04:39.949> so<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.520> first<00:04:40.760> section<00:04:41.180> of<00:04:41.300> hair

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
attention so the first section of hair

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.219 
attention so the first section of hair
maybe<00:04:42.380> do<00:04:42.590> it<00:04:42.680> for<00:04:42.830> like<00:04:42.889> five<00:04:43.130> seconds<00:04:43.520> each

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
maybe do it for like five seconds each

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.659 
maybe do it for like five seconds each
section<00:04:45.229> and<00:04:45.410> then<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.220> second<00:04:46.520> section

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
section and then the second section

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.189 
section and then the second section
maybe<00:04:47.000> I'll<00:04:47.120> do<00:04:47.270> for<00:04:47.479> like<00:04:47.600> eight<00:04:47.780> seconds

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
maybe I'll do for like eight seconds

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.960 
maybe I'll do for like eight seconds
each<00:04:48.530> section<00:04:49.010> and<00:04:49.280> then<00:04:49.430> just<00:04:49.729> be<00:04:49.820> more

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
each section and then just be more

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.490 
each section and then just be more
careful<00:04:50.180> with<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.720> make<00:04:50.870> sure<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.289> curls

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
careful with it make sure that the curls

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.939 
careful with it make sure that the curls
are<00:04:51.650> a<00:04:51.680> little<00:04:51.889> bit<00:04:52.130> more<00:04:52.370> clean<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.510> then

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
are a little bit more clean and then

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.379 
are a little bit more clean and then
finally<00:04:54.949> for<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.310> last<00:04:55.340> section<00:04:55.850> when<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.060> let

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
finally for the last section when I let

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.840 
finally for the last section when I let
it<00:04:56.510> down<00:04:56.720> I<00:04:57.110> want<00:04:57.380> this<00:04:57.590> top<00:04:57.949> section<00:04:58.490> to<00:04:58.669> be

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
it down I want this top section to be

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.260 
it down I want this top section to be
the<00:04:59.210> most<00:04:59.479> perfect<00:04:59.960> so<00:05:00.710> what<00:05:01.160> I<00:05:01.190> do<00:05:01.310> is<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:01.850> kind

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
the most perfect so what I do is I kind

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.830 
the most perfect so what I do is I kind
of<00:05:02.389> suction<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:02.930> out<00:05:03.050> perfectly<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.860> really

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
of suction it out perfectly and really

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.870 
of suction it out perfectly and really
carefully<00:05:05.840> curly<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.919> leave<00:05:07.460> it<00:05:07.580> there<00:05:07.699> for

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
carefully curly and I leave it there for

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.240 
carefully curly and I leave it there for
around<00:05:07.970> like<00:05:08.360> eight<00:05:09.080> to<00:05:09.440> ten<00:05:09.620> seconds<00:05:10.070> each

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
around like eight to ten seconds each

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.390 
around like eight to ten seconds each
curl<00:05:10.610> so<00:05:11.240> it's<00:05:11.449> more<00:05:11.630> uniform<00:05:12.199> and<00:05:12.590> it's<00:05:12.800> just

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
curl so it's more uniform and it's just

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.430 
curl so it's more uniform and it's just
a<00:05:13.460> lot<00:05:13.639> prettier<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:14.180> then<00:05:14.720> what<00:05:15.050> I<00:05:15.080> end<00:05:15.289> up

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
a lot prettier and then what I end up

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.040 
a lot prettier and then what I end up
with<00:05:15.500> is<00:05:15.979> just<00:05:16.010> a<00:05:16.430> gradual<00:05:16.940> curl<00:05:17.270> effect<00:05:17.510> so

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
with is just a gradual curl effect so

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.510 
with is just a gradual curl effect so
the<00:05:18.260> top<00:05:18.440> part<00:05:18.470> it's<00:05:18.770> gonna<00:05:18.830> be<00:05:19.039> a<00:05:19.070> little<00:05:19.340> bit

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
the top part it's gonna be a little bit

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.210 
the top part it's gonna be a little bit
bigger<00:05:20.289> it<00:05:21.289> looks<00:05:21.530> kind<00:05:21.680> of<00:05:21.740> strange<00:05:21.889> at<00:05:22.190> first

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
bigger it looks kind of strange at first

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.890 
bigger it looks kind of strange at first
and<00:05:22.700> then<00:05:22.880> I<00:05:22.910> just<00:05:23.180> do<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.360> other<00:05:23.389> side<00:05:23.690> of<00:05:23.840> my

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
and then I just do the other side of my

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.020 
and then I just do the other side of my
hair<00:05:24.200> and<00:05:24.470> then<00:05:24.800> when<00:05:25.070> I'm<00:05:25.190> done<00:05:25.220> I<00:05:25.700> end<00:05:25.880> up

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
hair and then when I'm done I end up

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.270 
hair and then when I'm done I end up
with<00:05:26.180> this<00:05:26.330> huge<00:05:26.720> fluffy<00:05:27.229> mess<00:05:27.530> that's<00:05:28.070> like

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
with this huge fluffy mess that's like

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.029 
with this huge fluffy mess that's like
super<00:05:28.639> curly<00:05:29.000> and<00:05:29.510> I<00:05:30.050> don't<00:05:30.410> know<00:05:30.500> I<00:05:30.680> never

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
super curly and I don't know I never

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.379 
super curly and I don't know I never
they<00:05:31.190> like<00:05:31.400> it<00:05:31.550> when<00:05:31.580> it's<00:05:31.820> like<00:05:31.880> super<00:05:32.210> curly

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
they like it when it's like super curly

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.570 
they like it when it's like super curly
like<00:05:32.660> that<00:05:32.900> so<00:05:33.050> what<00:05:33.200> I<00:05:33.229> do<00:05:33.320> is<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.620> run<00:05:33.889> my<00:05:34.220> hands

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
like that so what I do is I run my hands

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.279 
like that so what I do is I run my hands
through<00:05:34.610> it<00:05:34.820> sometimes<00:05:35.210> I'll<00:05:35.360> even<00:05:35.510> like<00:05:35.840> damp

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
through it sometimes I'll even like damp

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.779 
through it sometimes I'll even like damp
my<00:05:36.470> hands<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:36.860> little<00:05:36.950> bit<00:05:37.099> with<00:05:37.430> a<00:05:37.460> little<00:05:37.550> bit

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789

run<00:05:45.470> it<00:05:45.590> through<00:05:45.740> really<00:05:46.070> quickly<00:05:46.340> and<00:05:46.789> if<00:05:47.090> it

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
run it through really quickly and if it

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.400 
run it through really quickly and if it
needs<00:05:47.360> a<00:05:47.450> little<00:05:47.539> bit<00:05:47.660> of<00:05:47.870> texture<00:05:48.110> then<00:05:48.320> I'll

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
needs a little bit of texture then I'll

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.379 
needs a little bit of texture then I'll
add<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:49.280> sample<00:05:49.639> that<00:05:49.729> I<00:05:49.789> got<00:05:49.970> from<00:05:50.030> living

proof and it's like a text instant
texture<00:05:52.460> mist<00:05:52.849> and<00:05:53.300> it's<00:05:53.570> amazing<00:05:53.840> because<00:05:53.930> it

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
texture mist and it's amazing because it

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.870 
texture mist and it's amazing because it
kind<00:05:54.229> of<00:05:54.260> clumps<00:05:54.530> up<00:05:54.650> your<00:05:54.800> hair<00:05:54.979> into<00:05:55.580> like
