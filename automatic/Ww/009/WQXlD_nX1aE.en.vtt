00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.719
 je suis cimenta min 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.580
 now added investors for one more day and 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.670
 today I am in a little ol's guide and 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.310
 I bring you the mercury sash that good 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.689
 let's emphasize on this object in 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.410
 question that is an object for me 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.410
 quite 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.869
 little used for my taste is made with 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.599
 the layer of denial that you have now 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.759
 same screen gives you 48 points of 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.140
 magic resistance and it serves to make the 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.640
 force of nature but given to the 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.290
 death of crossing the sash of having 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.870
 ass in question and the veil of audouin in 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.780
 good domain because this object is 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.790
 quite a bit used in games 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.829
 normal and many in tournaments you have 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.180
 realized the sash of mercury is the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.390
 object that will now appear on the screen 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.720
 what serves 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.450
 given the magic resistance more than it has 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.829
 a use that if you use it frees you from 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.980
 any drawing you have the drawing 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.610
 it's a kind of thing that makes you things 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.300
 bad 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.940
 to apply the best one slow down a 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.190
 learn something like that you know the spell 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.659
 of invocation clean I guess so and 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.240
 if not then it is an invoker's spell 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.860
 that takes away everything all these bad 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.800
 things that throw you away with this what 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.270
 we have for a pretty enough price 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.259
 cheap because you can count on the layer 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.869
 of denial and then happens to go 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.330
 directly to this you are just that and 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.810
 it is already quite quite useful for 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.810
 me when you need some resistance 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.179
 magic some of the other team is being 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.000
 fighting the middle one for example and has 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.560
 a lot of paper because this is not very very 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.110
 expensive so you can have it very fast and 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.440
 be able to use it at any time 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.150
 magic resistance plus s 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.880
 that skill he was talking about 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.720
 right now then what what 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.280
 we can see from this is 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.380
 but more important to what we have to 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.570
 have we start with the examples you see 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.119
 that throws me to start and I use the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.979
 sash of mercury that you can see that 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.590
 has been completely removed here we have 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.120
 another example more in what we're going to 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.550
 use last with the sash of 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.800
 mercury escaped me from that daze 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.270
 to slow everything is here 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.670
 we have the dragon you see the drawing of the 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.290
 dragon down there just what to point out and 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.370
 clean you see that it has been removed but 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.490
 relocates because just give me 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.190
 but the fire of the 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.580
 dragon here we have the this place 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.400
 and clean and that's it and it's over clean 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.880
 it is not easy to mercury forgive 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.550
 next is we have evelyn ya momo 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.460
 jairo we see is the last talk beats 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.290
 real in let's let's emphasize what 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.670
 What has happened to me has thrown me the last 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.470
 garment exhaustion and the slow down of 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.780
 evelyn and it worked perfectly there 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.160
 as you can see the drawing of the red that is the 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.800
 same as the dragon and also 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.730
 logically it is what does not and now we are going 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.730
 from the client's group 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.730
 just to see if it really is that I 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:18.450
 is hitting 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.450
 and went through there 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.990
 but I do not have the time toning having 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.990
 a car that wants
