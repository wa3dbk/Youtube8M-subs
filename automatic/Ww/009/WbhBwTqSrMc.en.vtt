I guess you can say my phone had a

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.890 
I guess you can say my phone had a
stroke<00:04:44.370> because<00:04:45.380> none<00:04:46.380> of<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:48.090> left<00:04:48.660> side

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.100 
stroke because none of the the left side
works<00:04:50.780> nothing<00:04:51.780> on<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:51.930> left<00:04:52.200> side<00:04:52.350> works<00:04:52.970> so
