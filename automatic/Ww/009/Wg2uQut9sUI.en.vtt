00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.990
 hi there, this is crazycat today 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.600
 video will be devoted to all kinds 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.880
 creams for culinary change you what 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.640
 there are alternatives to liquid plastics gel 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.029
 pros and cons of convenience of one or another 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.099
 direct the first is familiar to all the media 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.410
 from polymer clay fimo gel and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.300
 mixing which we get beautiful 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.850
 the consistency of a cream to imitate 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.340
 different chocolate poliwag topping 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.950
 hot chocolate and stuff 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.800
 can also get imitation whipped 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.809
 cream, many soften the plastic slightly 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.300
 fimo gel beforehand i take 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.250
 just a good piece of fimo 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.410
 soft and with the confectionery nozzle 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.449
 let plastic at the exit with us 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.379
 ready cream which can be decorated 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.989
 sides of the cake or make special meringues 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.850
 cons plastic mixture gel is not 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.350
 what for example full meringues and 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.479
 big cream make pretty 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.490
 problematic otherwise works 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.470
 without fail 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.689
 the second is that I used one time and 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.509
 periodically returning to this method 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.240
 This is the most common silicone sealant 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.180
 building sealant it freezes around 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.250
 12 hours then calmly withstand 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.310
 high temperatures and does not lose its 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.229
 original form + sealant in that 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.180
 that it remains after solidification 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.000
 shiny and out of it can be made 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.770
 chic meringue specialized 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.079
 nozzles of course you will not find on 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 sealant but it's not a problem i just 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.840
 notched jagged manicure 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.509
 scissors 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.850
 on standard nozzle which goes to 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.040
 Complete with sealant feature it in 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.890
 the fact that after solidification it remains 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.110
 rubber is not plus or minus it 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.170
 just such an interesting effect let's say 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.570
 so there were also cases of plastic 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.380
 after firing, the sealant sank a little 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.659
 peel off 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.729
 after which I took the habit already on 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.430
 finished product deliberately tear off 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.950
 sealant and glue it on super glue for 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.349
 reliability only minus sealant 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.670
 this smell it can be quite sharp and 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.940
 work better with this material 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.190
 well ventilated room what 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.290
 concerns the cost then in the markets 100 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.470
 gram of sealant costs about 100 rubles 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.590
 that is, it is enough budget option 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.260
 3 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.180
 This is such silicone no branch 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.739
 Now they are divorced in large 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.860
 I will rise varieties 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.410
 China makes them, of course, at a cost 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.330
 again, the price range is large if very 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.569
 try something you can find in your 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.160
 the city has an adequate price range 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.920
 again, looking for what purposes it is you 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.680
 I need my own average I buy 300 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.500
 rubles per 100 grams and it doesn't matter if they are large 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.049
 the quantities he uses or small personally 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.269
 I pay off handsomely in 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.000
 The kit comes with various nozzles that 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.590
 greatly facilitates the process of working white 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.329
 I have fresh cream 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.480
 I tried to say nothing I can 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.970
 but the chocolate I have about a year to 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.200
 mostly went to decorate the cakes and 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.390
 small miniatures 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.690
 that is, there is a lot of cremona 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.819
 even when the cream was fresh cream was going 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.010
 chic through the nozzle extruded 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.829
 smooth portions could be fully 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.440
 decorate the box for example or do 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.739
 creamy whorls or a hill of cream 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.239
 however, over time, a little cream 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.609
 it stagnates inside the package 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.769
 there was a little water on the quality 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.389
 for example coatings for a cake 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.120
 affects that is, you need to squeeze a little 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:39.060
 cream mix it thoroughly and 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.370
 use but here's a beautiful cream 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.739
 curls alas not work as they 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.799
 already leave complicated through the nozzle and 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.200
 uneven so if you want to 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.019
 meringue's example is better on tape from 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.269
 fresh cream them on making frog different 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.170
 sizes and use as 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.989
 needs 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.569
 these creams dry rather quickly in 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.510
 for literally 20-30 minutes and 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.299
 harden 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.540
 also withstands high temperatures and 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.909
 baking smell as such do not have 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.760
 except that very weak barely perceptible 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.500
 cosmetic fragrance 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.389
 only you did not notice the minuses 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.329
 immediately that the loss of some qualities 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.519
 held his tube you become you very 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.220
 handy thing and cream from this cream 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.260
 looks gorgeous honest this is what 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.120
 called option for lazy who don't 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.600
 Sims want to mess with gel 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.639
 confectionery nozzles and other more on 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.680
 the expanses of the worldwide network met 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.440
 tinted glue option really not 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.440
 what pva super glue was mentioned 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.510
 or some other tint 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.639
 for me personally, this is quite 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.860
 budget option at first glance 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.870
 as according very comfortable no one 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.020
 insured in this case for example from 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.699
 lumps of paint or bed 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.430
 uneven color distribution yes and 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.350
 general aesthetic appearance 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.539
 thatâ€™s all imitation options 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.090
 whipped cream I personally use 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.710
 you can alternate them you can choose to 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.930
 yourself most comfortable 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.599
 but always nice when there is a choice and 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.910
 alternatives all these methods and materials 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.889
 I will be very comfortable in their own way I will be glad if 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.289
 helped find the one that fits 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.139
 to you both financially and visually 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.940
 aesthetically speaking so if you
