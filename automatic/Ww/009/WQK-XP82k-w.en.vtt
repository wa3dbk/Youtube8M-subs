 natural and it fits into this 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.629
 device within the simulator and 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.489

 functions the function where the academic 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.350
 interpreting spellings also in the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.390
 simulators on the dolls are not 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.310
 real and we also had patients

 made in a scanned form 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.530
 sometimes we need to print the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.460
 ray did not just view it 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.829
 a digital form 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.500
 interested in being that Andrew Printer 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.840

 employee then places on the cart and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.940
 inside that car then it is used 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.950
 into the clear eyes 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.459
 these two autoclaves are two towels 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.320
 Digital made every 360 liters 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.180
 cycle the process of realization o 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.880
 employee then provides 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.120
