bell this butter is soft but still firm

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.810 
bell this butter is soft but still firm
enough<00:02:27.500> that<00:02:27.800> it<00:02:27.920> holds<00:02:28.040> its<00:02:28.250> shape<00:02:28.370> when<00:02:28.760> I

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
enough that it holds its shape when I

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.510 
enough that it holds its shape when I
peel<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.390> paper<00:02:30.200> off<00:02:30.380> which<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.040> which<00:02:31.370> is

peel the paper off which is which is
important<00:02:31.940> if<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.180> were<00:02:32.300> too<00:02:32.510> runny<00:02:32.810> or<00:02:33.110> if<00:02:33.650> you

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
important if it were too runny or if you

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.190 
important if it were too runny or if you
had<00:02:33.920> any<00:02:34.100> melted<00:02:34.940> butter<00:02:35.150> spilling<00:02:35.720> off<00:02:35.900> it's

not going to hold the water tension
which<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.180> what<00:02:38.330> keeps<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.810> butter<00:02:38.990> fresh<00:02:42.100> so

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
which is what keeps the butter fresh so

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.620 
which is what keeps the butter fresh so
you<00:02:43.190> really<00:02:43.340> want<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.700> pack<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.180> butter<00:02:44.390> in

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
you really want to pack the butter in

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.140 
you really want to pack the butter in
here<00:02:45.100> because<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.220> want<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.490> remove<00:02:46.730> all<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
here because you want to remove all the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.640 
here because you want to remove all the
air<00:02:47.270> pockets<00:02:47.750> possible<00:02:49.900> any<00:02:50.900> pockets<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.500> air

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
air pockets possible any pockets of air

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.370 
air pockets possible any pockets of air
in<00:02:51.830> here<00:02:52.070> will<00:02:52.370> allow<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:53.540> course<00:02:53.840> air<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.200> get

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
in here will allow of course air to get

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.260 
in here will allow of course air to get
to<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> butter<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:55.700> could<00:02:55.910> create<00:02:56.150> a

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
to the butter and that could create a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.120 
to the butter and that could create a
pocket<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.720> mold<00:02:57.080> which<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.830> what<00:02:57.980> you're

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
pocket of mold which is what you're

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.600 
pocket of mold which is what you're
trying<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.580> avoid<00:03:02.830> so<00:03:03.830> as<00:03:03.920> you<00:03:04.070> can<00:03:04.190> see<00:03:04.459> it

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
trying to avoid so as you can see it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.070 
trying to avoid so as you can see it
easily<00:03:05.330> holds<00:03:05.800> exactly<00:03:07.120> one<00:03:08.120> stick<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.510> butter

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
easily holds exactly one stick of butter

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
easily holds exactly one stick of butter
and<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.370> just<00:03:11.180> pressing<00:03:11.690> out<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:12.590> rest<00:03:12.800> of<00:03:12.950> the

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
and so just pressing out the rest of the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.600 
and so just pressing out the rest of the
air<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:15.320> trying<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.800> make<00:03:15.950> as<00:03:16.160> much<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.520> a

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
air and trying to make as much of a

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.910 
air and trying to make as much of a
level<00:03:17.209> surface<00:03:17.570> as<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.050> can

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.520 

okay<00:03:22.520> so<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.360> way<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.810> store<00:03:24.110> this<00:03:24.319> now

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
okay so the way that you store this now

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.500 
okay so the way that you store this now
is<00:03:25.130> you're<00:03:25.280> going<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.459> just<00:03:25.610> invert<00:03:26.239> this

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
is you're going to just invert this

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.930 
is you're going to just invert this
butter<00:03:27.110> Bell<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.650> place<00:03:27.830> it<00:03:28.010> right<00:03:28.040> into<00:03:28.550> the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
butter Bell and place it right into the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.180 
butter Bell and place it right into the
crock<00:03:29.180> part<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:30.410> will<00:03:30.560> displace<00:03:30.950> the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
crock part and it will displace the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.640 
crock part and it will displace the
water<00:03:31.370> enough<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.020> water<00:03:33.200> will<00:03:33.319> come<00:03:33.500> up

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
water enough that the water will come up

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.630 
water enough that the water will come up
to<00:03:33.830> about<00:03:34.010> halfway<00:03:34.310> in<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:36.110> crock<00:03:36.349> and<00:03:36.640> that

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
to about halfway in the crock and that

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.059 
to about halfway in the crock and that
cool<00:03:38.000> water<00:03:38.330> will<00:03:39.080> keep<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.440> butter<00:03:39.620> good<00:03:39.860> for

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
cool water will keep the butter good for

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.640 
cool water will keep the butter good for
30<00:03:40.250> days<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.630> at<00:03:41.840> any<00:03:41.959> point<00:03:42.260> over<00:03:42.560> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
30 days and so at any point over the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.890 
30 days and so at any point over the
months<00:03:42.980> you'll<00:03:43.520> be<00:03:43.640> able<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.030> just<00:03:44.239> open<00:03:44.750> this

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
months you'll be able to just open this

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.920 
months you'll be able to just open this
let<00:03:45.800> the<00:03:45.920> water<00:03:46.130> drip<00:03:46.400> off<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:46.880> your<00:03:47.720> butter

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
let the water drip off and your butter

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.509 
let the water drip off and your butter
will<00:03:48.170> be<00:03:48.260> exactly<00:03:48.800> this<00:03:49.040> spreadable

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
will be exactly this spreadable

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.229 
will be exactly this spreadable
consistency<00:03:51.099> the<00:03:52.099> other<00:03:52.640> thing<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.030> need<00:03:53.060> to

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
consistency the other thing you need to

consistency the other thing you need to
keep<00:03:53.390> in<00:03:53.599> mind<00:03:53.840> with<00:03:54.140> these<00:03:54.319> is<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.860> need<00:03:55.040> to

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
keep in mind with these is you need to

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.940 
keep in mind with these is you need to
replace<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.970> water<00:03:56.150> in<00:03:56.750> here<00:03:57.140> about<00:03:57.410> every

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
replace the water in here about every

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.710 
replace the water in here about every
three<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.190> four<00:03:58.459> days<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:59.090> if<00:03:59.450> you're<00:03:59.569> in<00:03:59.660> a

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
three to four days and if you're in a

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.050 
three to four days and if you're in a
particularly<00:04:00.230> hot<00:04:00.530> climate<00:04:01.160> you're<00:04:01.790> going<00:04:02.000> to

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
particularly hot climate you're going to

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.030 
particularly hot climate you're going to
want<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.269> maybe<00:04:02.660> add<00:04:03.019> an<00:04:03.200> ice<00:04:03.319> cube<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:03.890> this

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
want to maybe add an ice cube to this

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.690 
want to maybe add an ice cube to this
this<00:04:04.940> should<00:04:05.209> stay<00:04:05.540> at<00:04:05.870> 70<00:04:06.410> degrees<00:04:06.440> or<00:04:07.130> cooler

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
this should stay at 70 degrees or cooler

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.620 
this should stay at 70 degrees or cooler
so<00:04:08.299> if<00:04:08.569> you<00:04:08.690> keep<00:04:08.900> your<00:04:09.019> house<00:04:09.200> at<00:04:09.590> 74<00:04:10.489> degrees

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
so if you keep your house at 74 degrees

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.300 
so if you keep your house at 74 degrees
every<00:04:11.630> third<00:04:11.870> day<00:04:11.900> just<00:04:12.380> add<00:04:12.530> one<00:04:12.739> ice<00:04:12.890> cube<00:04:13.160> to

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
every third day just add one ice cube to

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.370 
every third day just add one ice cube to
this<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.640> they'll<00:04:13.730> keep<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:14.060> cool<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:15.170> I<00:04:15.200> hope

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
this and they'll keep it cool so I hope

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.740 
this and they'll keep it cool so I hope
you<00:04:15.530> enjoy<00:04:15.769> this<00:04:15.920> as<00:04:16.100> much<00:04:16.130> as<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.519> have<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:17.600> can
