that<00:01:22.810> would<00:01:22.930> be<00:01:23.079> hell<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.590> get<00:01:23.710> out<00:01:24.210> just

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
that would be hell to get out just

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:38.879 
that would be hell to get out just
saying<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:33.729> tot<00:01:33.880> set<00:01:34.090> aside<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:37.889> start

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:38.889 
saying little tot set aside and start

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.249 
saying little tot set aside and start
darkening<00:01:39.460> around<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.179> perimeter<00:01:40.719> too
