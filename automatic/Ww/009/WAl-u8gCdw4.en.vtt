00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.190
 hello everyone i am sen ix and today we are a 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.899
 little minor or hardcore and in the episode 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.639
 today we are going to capture the guides 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.650
 that is a pokÃ©mon that moves by the 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.780
 singing map in the previous episode 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.360
 we captured rayco listener that were moving 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.680
 by giotto and then now we're going to 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.270
 the thesis and well I will tell the 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.609
 strategy for which you have been 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.890
 moving on this route between route 7 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.170
 where we are and the process there 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.939
 that will be blue city then the aunts 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.820
 is changing position, let's see what 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.980
 it changes its position on the map and 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.409
 when he has stayed here he says here here 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.059
 here or here where we are 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:39.010
 we go around the city routes 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.600
 saffron there is when it would not be 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.239
 capture it because when we move towards 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.489
 safran and then the route of this laya 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.070
 It is still there and had not moved so 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.949
 How good is that strategy? 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.829
 I recommend because as you will see when 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.870
 let's go saffron acid 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.159
 is still there and does not move I do not know why 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.079
 this happens because it is assumed that 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.390
 change city 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.059
 you know of a route a city then 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.299
 I should change position but I do not know 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.810
 Why not happen anyway because 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.759
 better for me but we in general 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.030
 now we enter route 8 and it's still here 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.420
 let's check it out there and it's good 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.510
 this route as we see there are some saplings 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.550
 I bring you cut so it shortens us 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.260
 and we are going to enter and I found myself before 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.950
 once with what you have to paralyze it 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.120
 and now take forward to avenge perfect 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.120
 let's save the game it's not worth being 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.460
 that we kill him 150 hours of play and a 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.980
 minute but good you know they are not 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.970
 real because when you accelerate the emulator it 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.970
 accelerate the hours of play 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.290
 let's go into the grass find us 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.540
 with the aunts 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.380
 come on the sterols aunts 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.380
 dr 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.740
 you're going to see that Latin music does not 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.560
 is that it is very epic but it shows 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.560
 note when is this is not aunt 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.000
 hoppe 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.759
 one as I have escaped 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.500
 to see where it is today has gone well 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.290
 let's go back where it is 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.020
 and I 'm going to make a cut because 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.780
 suppose we're going to find it 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.780
 bengal aunts to scare would yeah 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.540
 flare and it was where I found it the 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.540
 again 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.730
 routes 7 we go where we should 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.700
 save here not 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.170
 yes because if I have to save that is 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.319
 restart the game from the other route 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.900
 and I came here 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.849
 although it seems to me before I save 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.969
 restart and then it had moved from 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.770
 site you've been good, nothing would happen 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:51.530
 case would be in case I kill it especially 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.660
 and neither this 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.200
 chrome consumption 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.980
 follow the route if you follow the route 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.240
 benassal this stellar you will see as of 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.710
 distinguish 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.470
 there is paralyzed let's go there come 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.110
 I'm looking for him to fit 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.550
 and this that kind of will not have a roar like that 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.150
 we're not going to do the emov we're going to 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.570
 make a perfect lick one more if 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.840
 we do not kill it is a blow is critical 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.420
 blow is critical a blow is critical 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.500
 because I have to have such bad luck 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.870
 well let's see what will have moved 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.299
 true route 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.760
 If we had moved it would be molar but it has 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.680
 moved so nothing comes back when I 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.400
 I find again in a nearby route 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.400
 10 saffron 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.040
 You see it already have need 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.829
 route on route 6 so let's go there 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.650
 let's save come let's save 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.990
 that the saved would really help me 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.240
 previous because how are you going to move 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.240
 but we keep on these routes 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.210
 and this time we're not going to hit him 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.020
 critical please please come not 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:09.470
 you are not, you do not do it 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.860
 who did not see the poster there is the idea 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.860
 is good 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.440
 ok it's the same as before we're going to do 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.730
 an evil eye that I do not forget 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.420
 a lick 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.790
 which slow has paralyzed us 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.860
 you see perfect so that's how you get 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.120
 let the earth remain 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.640
 now let's throw everything because 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.660
 I have a few 123 are a few do not 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.160
 because there are still a few 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.290
 legendary I said well I'm going to 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.840
 buy many eyes I still have to 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.840
 buy more you believe 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.860
 well we have captured it the truth is that 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.960
 it has been very difficult for us 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.490
 and the truth is that as I so fast 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.469
 I could not even see it but it's good that 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.110
 when it goes at normal speed it's all more 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:01.360
 slow so let's see what we 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.300
 says of the aunt is that it is the type pokemon 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.039
 psychic dragon as we all know and it 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.719
 communicates by telepathy its plumage 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.319
 reflects light what allows it to be 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:14.620
 invisible magnificent now we are going to 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:19.300
 go see also they are I am walking no no 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:23.230
 let's play wild 1 dish let's go as 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.110
 well I tell you to see its nature 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.660
 it would be good if it were for example 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.580
 modest scared was filled 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.740
 any of those three would be fine the 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.800
 true 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:40.289
 because I would prefer fears and fears 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.069
 let's see if we're lucky we get 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.069
 fearful 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:50.669
 there you are the guides and you are strong 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:52.889
 neutral nature what's wrong with the attack 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.650
 brave sandra of the relief and squirts 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.080
 fog ball is not so bad level 35 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:03.300
 6 shortest of all no 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.360
 to see if these are in 40 40 52 them 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.000
 they are not legendary vouchers 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.770
 you are right 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.990
 and we are going to place this there next to the 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.700
 article and so the three dogs 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.200
 genres together the birds together that 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.110
 here we were three but good and the 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.370
 changed when I have it and nothing is already 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.530
 at ten o'clock, I left with good 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.690
 nature what a pity but 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.580
 well that's going to be all for the episode 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:32.009
