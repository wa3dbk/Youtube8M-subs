00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello friends welcome to my channel today 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.490
 I will introduce you how to prepare 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.510
 ricky quarter cakes for that we're going to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.540
 need green bananas yautÃ­a a 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.940
 green banana and a potato is a matter of 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.620
 the person and if they want we can 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.030
 add 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.520
 good for that we go 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.800
 wayan is not the mass that there was the 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.520
 Equality is not the mass for our 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.360
 papers 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:37.040
 here we have the ready and seasoned dough 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.760
 to taste here we have pork 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.340
 minced 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:48.320
 we throw chickpea and spend the season 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.980
 to the taste of not very salty people 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.410
 we throw him his fried and we started doing 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.950
 our role 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.950
 EU 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.030
 use 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.440
 this paper was paper because I did not get 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.520
 the paper that is used regularly for 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.509
 cake 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.469
 good for that we need sheets of 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.550
 I already have the guineo leaves 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:25.460
 previously clean 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.520
 and gone through the fire 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.400
 let's start this is a little bit 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.850
 what I'm going to do is cut it 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.850
 little bit 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.760
 ah 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.450
 well let's cut it in half that 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.450
 it is very big 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.049
 and do not bounce anything because we can all 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.440
 use ok here we have oil with 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.590
 achiote that we already had it 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.629
 fire and we get the color we're going to 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.110
 add a little oil this to 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:22.380
 prevent the dough from sticking to the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.380
 leaf at the time of cooking 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.690
 we put a spoonful of dough not much 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.710
 because we can open the cake knows 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.880
 we can leave and we do not want that 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.880
 we add meat 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.640
 be quite generous and peppers 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.640
 morrones 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.660
 let's double 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:00.270
 the cake each person many people 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.850
 they bend it differently to me 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:09.840
 It makes it easier this way 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.840
 we take out the air and we fold again 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.960
 and we turn the corner 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.209
 look another here 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:35.250
 done this let's tie the cake 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.610
 we can tie it one or tie it 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.910
 in a meeting in this case I am going to make a 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.610
 yunta of cake that we are going to make we go 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.610
 to place one on top of the other 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.680
 in this way 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.920
 with this thread we're going to tie it up let's 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.290
 cut a big enough piece there 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.290
 people who already cut it before 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.500
 start tying it 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.730
 and we are going to tie 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.730
 in this way 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.509
 there 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.509
 we flipped 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.879
 so we go back and we go around this 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.879
 way 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.450
 A) Yes 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.529
 and we finish the front 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:43.419
 with a common loop and current 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:48.370
 you can leave it like that and there to make a knot or 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.370
 we come back and tie up to be sure 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.520
 that is not left 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.080
 tightly packed 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.190
 Y 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.830
 we cut 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.980
 here we have our cake this what 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:18.700
 let's bring to cooking in water with 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:21.520
 salt approximately for 45 minutes 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.060
 good friends already here we have our 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.060
 cake 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:33.810
 already after about 45 to 50 minutes of 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.810
 cooking 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.620
 they see the paper works very well 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.820
 now there is 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.820
 try out 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.110
 well everything was well cooked 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:04.370
 you have to see if the dough had its 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.370
 a good taste
