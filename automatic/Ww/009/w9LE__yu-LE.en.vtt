00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.270 

so<00:00:14.790> for<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> first<00:00:15.180> climb<00:00:15.510> of<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.720> day<00:00:16.280> that's

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
so for the first climb of the day that's

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.700 
so for the first climb of the day that's
a<00:00:18.110> real<00:00:19.940> eye-opener<00:00:21.110> it's<00:00:22.110> not<00:00:22.200> just<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
a real eye-opener it's not just for the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.340 
a real eye-opener it's not just for the
spectacular<00:00:23.310> scenery<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.820> we've<00:00:24.000> got<00:00:24.350> see

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
spectacular scenery that we've got see

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.660 
spectacular scenery that we've got see
the<00:00:25.500> snow-capped<00:00:25.800> mountains<00:00:26.520> in<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the snow-capped mountains in the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.560 
the snow-capped mountains in the
background<00:00:26.760> but<00:00:27.980> I<00:00:29.090> think<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:30.270> overall

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
background but I think for the overall

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.690 
background but I think for the overall
length<00:00:31.369> being<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.550> horse<00:00:33.540> category<00:00:34.200> climb

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
length being a horse category climb

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.010 
length being a horse category climb
that's<00:00:35.700> beyond<00:00:36.090> rating<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.690> Tour<00:00:36.930> de

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that's beyond rating in the Tour de

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.260 
that's beyond rating in the Tour de
France<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:40.160> we<00:00:41.160> climbing<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.239> about<00:00:43.489> 24<00:00:44.489> 25<00:00:44.940> k

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
France so we climbing for about 24 25 k

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.970 
France so we climbing for about 24 25 k
now<00:00:46.190> just<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.670> approach<00:00:47.880> the<00:00:48.150> summit

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
now just about to approach the summit

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.630 
now just about to approach the summit
where<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.130> a<00:00:50.540> civil<00:00:51.540> look<00:00:51.750> we've<00:00:51.870> done<00:00:52.640> 1600

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
where it's a civil look we've done 1600

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.450 
where it's a civil look we've done 1600
meters<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.030> climbing<00:00:54.800> over<00:00:55.800> all<00:00:55.950> since

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
meters of climbing over all since

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.850 
meters of climbing over all since
abbeville<00:00:57.030> and<00:01:00.020> we're<00:01:01.020> at<00:01:01.080> nineteen<00:01:01.500> hundred

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
abbeville and we're at nineteen hundred

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.859 
abbeville and we're at nineteen hundred
meters<00:01:02.160> elevation<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.739> climb<00:01:04.949> itself

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
meters elevation so the climb itself

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.770
