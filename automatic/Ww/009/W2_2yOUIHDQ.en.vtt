generic design and let's talk about that
for<00:00:48.680> a<00:00:48.920> minute<00:00:49.100> so<00:00:50.470> if<00:00:51.470> you've<00:00:51.650> been<00:00:51.739> reading

my<00:00:52.040> blog<00:00:52.369> you<00:00:53.089> know<00:00:53.119> that<00:00:53.390> I've<00:00:53.479> been<00:00:53.600> having<00:00:53.809> a

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
my blog you know that I've been having a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
my blog you know that I've been having a
problem<00:00:54.080> with<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.670> Wilco<00:00:55.989> Airbus's<00:00:56.989> not

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
problem with the Wilco Airbus's not

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.820 
problem with the Wilco Airbus's not
working<00:00:58.879> with<00:00:59.089> my<00:00:59.269> throttles<00:00:59.689> so<00:01:00.530> setup

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
working with my throttles so setup

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.179 
working with my throttles so setup
that's<00:01:00.979> worked<00:01:01.220> perfectly<00:01:01.610> for<00:01:02.049> to<00:01:03.049> have<00:01:03.290> more

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
that's worked perfectly for to have more

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.789 
that's worked perfectly for to have more
than<00:01:04.339> three<00:01:04.610> years<00:01:04.790> maybe<00:01:05.439> and<00:01:06.439> suddenly<00:01:06.710> it

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
than three years maybe and suddenly it

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.250 
than three years maybe and suddenly it
won't<00:01:06.950> work<00:01:07.070> I<00:01:07.310> dunno<00:01:07.670> why<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.900> throttles

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
won't work I dunno why and the throttles

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.960 
won't work I dunno why and the throttles
work<00:01:09.380> perfectly<00:01:09.830> with<00:01:10.100> every<00:01:10.369> other<00:01:10.460> aircraft

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
work perfectly with every other aircraft

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.670 
work perfectly with every other aircraft
and<00:01:11.330> everything<00:01:11.840> else<00:01:11.990> in<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.350> wilco

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680

and everything else in the wilco
Airbus's<00:01:13.220> works<00:01:13.610> we've<00:01:14.509> tried<00:01:14.720> three

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
Airbus's works we've tried three

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.100 
Airbus's works we've tried three
different<00:01:15.080> downloads<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:16.689> the<00:01:17.689> different

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
different downloads of the different

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.560 
different downloads of the different
versions<00:01:18.790> different<00:01:19.790> sources<00:01:20.090> if<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:20.420> like

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
versions different sources if you like

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.440 
versions different sources if you like
of<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.080> air<00:01:21.200> pulses<00:01:21.729> doesn't<00:01:22.729> work<00:01:22.850> totals

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
of the air pulses doesn't work totals

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.719 
of the air pulses doesn't work totals
don't<00:01:23.659> respond<00:01:24.289> correctly<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.859> the<00:01:25.490> hardware

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
don't respond correctly to the hardware

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.919 
don't respond correctly to the hardware
so<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:27.109> aircraft<00:01:27.409> is<00:01:27.560> unreliable<00:01:28.749> so<00:01:29.749> that's

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
so the aircraft is unreliable so that's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.810 
so the aircraft is unreliable so that's
why<00:01:30.109> I'm<00:01:30.200> stopping<00:01:30.469> that's<00:01:31.130> why<00:01:31.280> I've<00:01:31.429> I've

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
why I'm stopping that's why I've I've

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.039 
why I'm stopping that's why I've I've
stopped<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:33.100> change<00:01:34.100> direction<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:35.840> is<00:01:36.020> a

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
stopped and change direction this is a

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.370 
stopped and change direction this is a
has<00:01:36.829> always<00:01:37.159> been<00:01:37.249> an<00:01:37.399> Airbus<00:01:37.729> cockpit<00:01:38.380> it's

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
has always been an Airbus cockpit it's

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.319 
has always been an Airbus cockpit it's
designed<00:01:39.649> to<00:01:39.740> be<00:01:39.799> an<00:01:39.920> Airbus<00:01:40.249> and<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:41.030> doesn't

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
designed to be an Airbus and it doesn't

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.510 
designed to be an Airbus and it doesn't
really<00:01:41.420> work<00:01:41.689> with<00:01:42.200> anything<00:01:42.590> else<00:01:42.770> very<00:01:43.280> well

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
really work with anything else very well

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.859 
really work with anything else very well
because<00:01:43.880> everything's<00:01:44.270> laid<00:01:44.450> out<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.719> be<00:01:44.810> an

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
because everything's laid out to be an

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.819 
because everything's laid out to be an
Airbus<00:01:46.810> preview<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.929> screen<00:01:48.170> cutouts<00:01:48.590> I

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
Airbus preview the screen cutouts I

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.410 
Airbus preview the screen cutouts I
think<00:01:49.039> that's<00:01:49.189> my<00:01:49.340> main<00:01:49.520> problem<00:01:49.759> switches

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
think that's my main problem switches

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.059 
think that's my main problem switches
and<00:01:50.569> stuff<00:01:50.749> you<00:01:50.899> can<00:01:51.020> work<00:01:51.170> around<00:01:51.319> it<00:01:51.619> in<00:01:51.770> the

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
and stuff you can work around it in the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.010 
and stuff you can work around it in the
lights<00:01:52.549> turn<00:01:52.819> the<00:01:52.939> lights<00:01:53.119> on<00:01:53.359> the<00:01:53.600> nav<00:01:53.749> lights

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.330 
lights turn the lights on the nav lights

from the nav lights on the head and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.410 
from the nav lights on the head and
changes<00:01:55.639> are<00:01:55.729> heading<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:55.999> was<00:01:56.090> really<00:01:56.270> matter

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
changes are heading it was really matter

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.010 
changes are heading it was really matter
what<00:01:56.600> what<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.469> deer<00:01:58.219> frame<00:01:58.579> is<00:01:58.869> can<00:01:59.869> work

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
what what the deer frame is can work

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.859 
what what the deer frame is can work
around<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:00.549> hi<00:02:01.549> generally<00:02:01.969> speaking<00:02:02.179> but<00:02:02.509> I

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
around that hi generally speaking but I

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.629 
around that hi generally speaking but I
can't<00:02:03.109> work<00:02:03.319> around<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.859> screen<00:02:04.280> cut<00:02:04.490> out

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
can't work around the screen cut out

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:08.520 
can't work around the screen cut out
since<00:02:04.880> really<00:02:05.209> that's<00:02:05.780> become<00:02:06.049> a<00:02:06.079> problem

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.660 

another<00:02:09.530> reason<00:02:09.830> why<00:02:09.950> I'm<00:02:10.009> stopping<00:02:10.280> is<00:02:10.520> that

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
another reason why I'm stopping is that

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.780 
another reason why I'm stopping is that
I'd<00:02:10.880> really<00:02:11.150> like<00:02:11.240> my<00:02:11.420> living<00:02:11.630> room<00:02:11.690> back<00:02:11.959> out

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790

that extra Colonel I'm experimenting

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.550 
that extra Colonel I'm experimenting
with<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.650> idea<00:03:55.950> of<00:03:56.040> maybe<00:03:56.460> having<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:57.560> side

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
with the idea of maybe having a side

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.320 
with the idea of maybe having a side
stick<00:03:58.830> but<00:03:59.130> have<00:03:59.250> them<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.580> center<00:03:59.850> of<00:04:00.030> it

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
stick but have them in the center of it

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.850 
stick but have them in the center of it
between<00:04:00.690> my<00:04:00.840> legs<00:04:00.990> like<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.290> fighter<00:04:01.560> cockpit

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
between my legs like a fighter cockpit

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.000 
between my legs like a fighter cockpit
maybe<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.700> don't<00:04:03.150> know<00:04:03.560> I'll<00:04:04.560> have<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.740> look<00:04:04.860> at

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
maybe I don't know I'll have a look at

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.880 
maybe I don't know I'll have a look at
that<00:04:05.390> I'm<00:04:06.390> going<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:06.690> put<00:04:06.870> some<00:04:06.900> radios<00:04:07.350> out<00:04:07.740> to

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
that I'm going to put some radios out to

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.540 
that I'm going to put some radios out to
the<00:04:08.010> left<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.550> me<00:04:09.830> reduce<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.950> size<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
the left of me reduce the size of the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.270 
the left of me reduce the size of the
the<00:04:11.850> whole<00:04:12.000> thing<00:04:12.270> overall<00:04:13.100> tweak<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.250> a

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
the whole thing overall tweak it a

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.160 
the whole thing overall tweak it a
little<00:04:14.430> bit<00:04:14.670> maybe<00:04:15.420> make<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.870> little<00:04:15.990> bit

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
little bit maybe make it a little bit

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.490 
little bit maybe make it a little bit
any<00:04:16.350> more<00:04:17.480> polished<00:04:18.480> if<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:19.020> like<00:04:19.200> in<00:04:19.410> the

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
a removable kind of way so do you go to

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.000 
a removable kind of way so do you go to
take<00:04:45.389> apart<00:04:45.660> again<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.500> nothing's<00:04:46.800> moving

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
take apart again so nothing's moving

something and they push into pets lab by
an<00:04:50.190> inch<00:04:50.340> or<00:04:50.430> whatever<00:04:50.699> which<00:04:50.880> is<00:04:51.030> kind<00:04:51.240> of

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
an inch or whatever which is kind of

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.580 
an inch or whatever which is kind of
annoying<00:04:51.479> when<00:04:51.750> that<00:04:51.870> happens<00:04:52.260> so<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.560> happens

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
annoying when that happens so it happens

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.430 
annoying when that happens so it happens
a<00:04:52.949> lot<00:04:53.360> so<00:04:54.360> that's<00:04:54.479> another<00:04:54.960> thing<00:04:55.199> that<00:04:55.350> I'm

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
a lot so that's another thing that I'm

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.730 
a lot so that's another thing that I'm
going<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.740> do<00:04:56.479> we'll<00:04:57.479> finally<00:04:57.720> get<00:04:57.930> some<00:04:57.990> big

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
going to do we'll finally get some big

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.680 
going to do we'll finally get some big
monitors<00:04:59.190> so<00:04:59.760> many<00:05:00.000> of<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.210> have<00:05:00.330> complained

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
monitors so many of you have complained

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.570 
monitors so many of you have complained
about<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:01.020> teeny<00:05:01.289> monitors<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.010> I<00:05:02.070> know<00:05:02.130> it's

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
about the teeny monitors and I know it's

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.790 
about the teeny monitors and I know it's
annoying<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:02.910> me<00:05:03.060> too<00:05:03.440> but<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.500> should<00:05:04.650> be<00:05:04.680> able

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
annoying to me too but I should be able

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.770 
annoying to me too but I should be able
to<00:05:04.949> get<00:05:05.070> maybe<00:05:05.490> just<00:05:05.760> one<00:05:05.910> giant<00:05:06.090> monitor<00:05:06.479> or

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
to get maybe just one giant monitor or

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.570 
to get maybe just one giant monitor or
possibly<00:05:07.440> even<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.680> projector<00:05:08.130> if<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.430> room

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
possibly even a projector if the room

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.050 
possibly even a projector if the room
can<00:05:08.789> fit<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.240> that<00:05:09.720> will<00:05:09.840> be<00:05:09.930> nice<00:05:11.060> an

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
can fit it that will be nice an

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.790 
can fit it that will be nice an
advantage<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.630> doing<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:12.930> this<00:05:13.020> way<00:05:13.080> is<00:05:13.260> that

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
advantage of doing it this way is that

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.980 
advantage of doing it this way is that
the<00:05:13.979> overall<00:05:14.340> cockpit<00:05:15.270> will<00:05:15.419> be<00:05:15.539> much<00:05:15.720> smaller

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
the overall cockpit will be much smaller

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.400 
the overall cockpit will be much smaller
probably<00:05:16.590> about<00:05:17.690> that<00:05:18.690> measure<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:19.020> yesterday

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
probably about that measure it yesterday

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.469 
probably about that measure it yesterday
about<00:05:19.500> a<00:05:19.620> meter<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:19.979> a<00:05:20.039> half<00:05:20.070> wide<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:20.970> still

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
about a meter and a half wide and still

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.909 
about a meter and a half wide and still
be<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:21.720> same<00:05:21.750> depth<00:05:22.229> but<00:05:22.500> of<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.680> only<00:05:22.889> a

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919
