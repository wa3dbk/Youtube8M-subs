00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.850
 Hi, how are you? 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:10.219
 and the day from now we are going to do something 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.010
 for our hands as you know 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.539
 every day we are going to have to 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.720
 to be doing something with our hands 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:20.599
 either write grabbing things or 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.880
 driving what I know but we are always 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.609
 in constant work with our hands 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.029
 that's more than either because the super 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.310
 they need music I love them so much 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.470
 handyman and then the day now I wanted 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.930
 make a video to consent to our 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.200
 hands and that can be prettier more 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.200
 hydrated healthy and soft and 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.600
 Well, I have masks for you, or what 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.030
 that we are going to do for hands 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.300
 pamper our little hands and they are 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.640
 super super nice and then the only thing 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.920
 we are going to need are super things 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.590
 natural so do not worry because 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.380
 not you spend almost nothing so 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.570
 let's start with this video I hope 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.699
 that you like a lot very much and that 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.699
 can work them so he runs whistled 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.930
 ok let's start by putting the sugar in 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.450
 a little dish and then we will add the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.850
 little step with milk this does not have any 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.640
 measure so you can put the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.380
 amount you want 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.409
 then I will incorporate my adela with the 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:34.600
 other ingredients and finally I'm going to 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.049
 add a teaspoon of oil 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.490
 coconut and let's mix very very well I think 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.310
 that these ingredients can 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.100
 find just in the pan tree to your 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.289
 home so seriously it's not hard to 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.670
 buy it in case you do not have it 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.670
 can find in the supermarket 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.960
 Now that we have our mix 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.150
 list the only thing we're going to do is 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.979
 grab it and start putting it all 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:07.200
 our hands are going to make movements 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.170
 circular and top to bottom 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.290
 making it shorter, remove us 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.170
 all those annoying little ones and the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.170
 hardness that our hands can have 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.270
 the second step is to take a cucumber 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.660
 cut in half and rub it by 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.260
 all all hands and this is going to do 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:35.280
 that our hands stay much more 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.350
 hydrated as final touch and last 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.500
 Step let's choose our cream 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.600
 favorite and we're going to apply it by doing 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.959
 that our hands are left with a smell 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.820
 super super rich and besides that super 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.820
 soft if you're like something 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.940

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.790

 Believe me, my hands were left 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.470

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.840

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.940
