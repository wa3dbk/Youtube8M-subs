along with the problems that he had

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.990 
along with the problems that he had
growing<00:03:14.139> up<00:03:14.379> right<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.889> and<00:03:15.639> in<00:03:15.879> that

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
growing up right and and in that

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.929 
growing up right and and in that
dichotomy<00:03:16.449> is<00:03:17.069> kind<00:03:18.069> of<00:03:18.159> too<00:03:18.250> full<00:03:18.519> because<00:03:18.849> he

gives a lot of variety which i think is

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.949

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
adding to his his success and that

frustrated<00:05:00.050> me<00:05:00.200> about<00:05:00.590> this<00:05:00.740> album<00:05:01.100> besides

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
frustrated me about this album besides

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.620 
frustrated me about this album besides
what<00:05:01.610> you<00:05:01.730> mentioned<00:05:01.910> with<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.210> took<00:05:02.270> which<00:05:02.540> I

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
what you mentioned with I took which I

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.180 
what you mentioned with I took which I
totally<00:05:02.780> agree<00:05:02.990> with<00:05:03.140> you<00:05:03.290> on<00:05:03.410> is<00:05:03.740> the

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
totally agree with you on is the

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.040 
totally agree with you on is the
production<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:04.970> actually<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.570> first<00:05:05.750> time<00:05:05.900> I

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
production and actually the first time I

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.780 
production and actually the first time I
listened<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.590> this<00:05:06.680> album<00:05:06.860> I<00:05:07.040> liked<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.370> a<00:05:07.490> lot

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
listened to this album I liked it a lot

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.210 
listened to this album I liked it a lot
less<00:05:08.240> than<00:05:08.750> subsequent<00:05:09.320> lessons<00:05:09.470> that<00:05:10.190> I

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
less than subsequent lessons that I

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.950 
less than subsequent lessons that I
think<00:05:10.430> its<00:05:10.580> peak<00:05:10.760> me<00:05:11.450> a<00:05:11.480> while<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:11.630> realize

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
think its peak me a while to realize

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.510 
think its peak me a while to realize
this<00:05:12.110> but<00:05:12.140> I<00:05:12.320> think<00:05:12.500> it<00:05:12.560> was<00:05:12.620> because<00:05:12.770> of<00:05:13.010> the

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
this but I think it was because of the

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.180 
this but I think it was because of the
production<00:05:13.880> and<00:05:14.780> just<00:05:15.170> how<00:05:15.260> inconsistent<00:05:15.890> it

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
production and just how inconsistent it

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.390 
production and just how inconsistent it
is<00:05:16.720> with<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.900> quality<00:05:18.170> and<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:18.590> style<00:05:18.920> of<00:05:19.250> it

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
is with the quality and the style of it

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.850 
is with the quality and the style of it
for<00:05:20.240> example<00:05:20.660> the<00:05:20.930> first<00:05:21.110> track<00:05:21.350> outside

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
for example the first track outside

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.720 
for example the first track outside
which<00:05:22.040> is<00:05:22.160> actually<00:05:22.310> one<00:05:22.550> of<00:05:22.580> my<00:05:22.670> favorite

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
which is actually one of my favorite

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.510 
which is actually one of my favorite
tracks<00:05:23.390> on<00:05:23.570> this<00:05:23.690> album<00:05:23.750> I<00:05:24.260> love<00:05:24.890> how<00:05:25.070> it<00:05:25.220> drops

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
tracks on this album I love how it drops

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.730 
tracks on this album I love how it drops
into<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:26.180> chorus<00:05:26.600> rather<00:05:27.170> than<00:05:27.320> building

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
into the chorus rather than building

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.760 
into the chorus rather than building
into<00:05:28.070> a<00:05:28.100> chorus<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:29.060> that's<00:05:29.990> a<00:05:30.080> great<00:05:30.410> switch

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
into a chorus that that's a great switch

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.430 
into a chorus that that's a great switch
up<00:05:30.980> not<00:05:31.220> enough<00:05:31.460> people<00:05:31.790> do<00:05:32.000> that<00:05:32.240> some<00:05:33.170> great

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
up not enough people do that some great

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.160 
up not enough people do that some great
lyrics<00:05:33.980> on<00:05:34.190> their<00:05:34.460> great<00:05:35.060> and<00:05:35.240> beat<00:05:35.450> yet<00:05:36.140> I

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
lyrics on their great and beat yet I

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.730 
lyrics on their great and beat yet I
feel<00:05:36.560> like<00:05:36.710> the<00:05:37.130> the<00:05:37.910> EQ<00:05:38.840> on<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.080> vocals<00:05:39.530> and

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
feel like the the EQ on the vocals and

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.100 
feel like the the EQ on the vocals and
its<00:05:40.040> placement<00:05:40.400> and<00:05:40.850> volume<00:05:41.300> in<00:05:41.510> the<00:05:41.630> mix<00:05:41.870> is

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
its placement and volume in the mix is

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.710 
its placement and volume in the mix is
way<00:05:42.680> too<00:05:42.740> front<00:05:43.340> and<00:05:43.460> center<00:05:43.820> it<00:05:44.030> just<00:05:44.420> doesn't

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
way too front and center it just doesn't

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.630 
way too front and center it just doesn't
jive<00:05:44.900> with<00:05:45.230> the<00:05:45.590> rest<00:05:45.800> of<00:05:45.920> what's<00:05:46.070> going<00:05:46.280> on<00:05:46.490> in

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
jive with the rest of what's going on in

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.220 
jive with the rest of what's going on in
the<00:05:46.730> song<00:05:46.940> and<00:05:47.180> that<00:05:47.240> really<00:05:47.540> bothered<00:05:47.960> me<00:05:47.990> I

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
the song and that really bothered me I

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.230 
the song and that really bothered me I
know<00:05:48.560> what's<00:05:48.710> strange<00:05:48.980> about<00:05:49.220> that<00:05:49.400> is<00:05:49.820> that

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
know what's strange about that is that

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.730 
know what's strange about that is that
it's<00:05:50.360> totally<00:05:50.750> inconsistent<00:05:51.290> there<00:05:51.680> are

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
it's totally inconsistent there are

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.230 
it's totally inconsistent there are
other<00:05:51.890> tracks<00:05:52.250> on<00:05:52.430> the<00:05:52.520> album<00:05:52.640> where<00:05:53.000> I<00:05:53.030> feel

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
other tracks on the album where I feel

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.210 
other tracks on the album where I feel
like<00:05:53.360> the<00:05:53.720> vocals<00:05:54.050> are<00:05:54.140> lower<00:05:54.530> in<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.830> mix<00:05:55.040> and

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
like the vocals are lower in the mix and

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.180 
like the vocals are lower in the mix and
it<00:05:55.520> works<00:05:55.730> perfectly<00:05:56.000> also<00:05:56.960> like<00:05:57.170> a<00:05:57.350> track<00:05:57.890> six

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
it works perfectly also like a track six

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.400 
it works perfectly also like a track six
heartbeat<00:05:58.790> I<00:05:59.000> that<00:05:59.720> was<00:05:59.750> definitely<00:06:00.050> with<00:06:00.320> my

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
heartbeat I that was definitely with my

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.860 
heartbeat I that was definitely with my
least<00:06:00.680> favorite<00:06:01.100> songs<00:06:01.370> um<00:06:01.730> I<00:06:02.210> thought<00:06:02.630> it<00:06:02.780> had

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
least favorite songs um I thought it had

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.110 
least favorite songs um I thought it had
a<00:06:02.900> really<00:06:03.110> weak<00:06:03.440> chorus<00:06:03.950> but<00:06:04.190> beyond<00:06:04.490> that<00:06:04.670> I

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
a really weak chorus but beyond that I

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.120 
a really weak chorus but beyond that I
did<00:06:05.690> not<00:06:05.870> like<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:06.200> production<00:06:06.680> and<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:06.860> beat

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
did not like the production and the beat

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.030 
did not like the production and the beat
you<00:06:07.550> had<00:06:07.760> this<00:06:07.940> this<00:06:08.180> synth<00:06:08.720> pad<00:06:09.080> line<00:06:09.770> that

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
you had this this synth pad line that

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.850 
you had this this synth pad line that
was<00:06:10.190> right<00:06:11.000> front<00:06:11.420> and<00:06:11.480> center<00:06:11.900> again<00:06:12.200> instead

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
was right front and center again instead

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.650 
was right front and center again instead
of<00:06:12.890> like<00:06:13.070> being<00:06:13.340> split<00:06:13.730> stereo<00:06:14.060> kind<00:06:14.570> of

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
of like being split stereo kind of

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.600 
of like being split stereo kind of
coming<00:06:14.960> at<00:06:15.080> you<00:06:15.230> from<00:06:15.410> the<00:06:15.500> side<00:06:15.860> for<00:06:16.370> some

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
maybe in the center of the mix it's just

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.170 
maybe in the center of the mix it's just
