00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.109
 yao next kia side i hope all 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.449
 the world is good for me it's great 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.040
 well we end up for a video a 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.829
 unusual on the chain of clans 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.329
 so this is my very first 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.910
 mats or code confused I am 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.050
 accompanied by my friend's master the 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.860
 high place them via me so it's at 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.020
 job that's like he said little 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.110
 video a little special iphone 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.640
 the idea and iphones 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.860
 can is broached this subject right 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.760
 next yeah we will address this topic while 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.109
 right now did not I beg you 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.699
 since it's a mistake that drags 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.770
 behind that was my mistake for the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.100
 10th he in the series so I did 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.240
 a gun shoot I actually was 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.610
 panicked you know what what 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.090
 did rigor stop panic shoots 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.590
 So here it is here 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.070
 so that they have the hunger that guen 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.490
 for the 10th he of his series good me 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.009
 I confess I shouted a bit when 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.240
 when we were in the game but but 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.220
 that's the end he still managed 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.810
 you will see in the end he managed to do 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.920
 a kill of +0 31 at the knife of the fim 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.689
 series31 so there is still 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.460
 quiet with a knife even if 1 kg gun 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.400
 bomba if we can say it's forgivable 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.780
 you excuse me yes and excuses especially that 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.399
 hey it's not sure why you're going you're 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.850
 with the gun knowing that you can have 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:53.250
 killed with a knife trigger stops my mouth 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.229
 so here is wholesale belga on bio 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.820
 love in team death match we are 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.439
 doing cam kills 50 and 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.360
 quiet kills we were in this lobby 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.860
 for a while it was four or 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.060
 five game so frankly that's 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.409
 to help megan but who's worth what 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.789
 I swear years ps3 lobbies 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.310
 american it was about that 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.799
 exactly the make it play with the 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.390
 feet or with them or with the screen is a 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.700
 This game is not really because Urs 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.349
 there for once there are moments 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.629
 guys who touched in the spawn 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.829
 do not know what was working 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.200
 because that way you're fine the 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.569
 see in the gameplay sometimes there are some 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.519
 guys who are glued to each other in 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.810
 jumping on them sometimes 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.120
 has one who camp in a corner as a 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.609
 mega good here that happens I admit 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.810
 we had the right lobby and as I 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.069
 I said we made several game before and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.409
 we said we're equal brasil they are 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.599
 really too dumb absolutely happy 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.129
 the dn1 with the knife against them and the game 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.430
 just before we actually played on 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.959
 biolab game we all tried it too at 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.139
 knife good everyone is dead except 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.269
 I obviously die at 23 years old series 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:03:00.040
 of 23 as an obstacle disgusted there 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.160
 were throwing out that there would be really stupid 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.140
 so 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.450
 so here is finally full time in the end the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.950
 Sheath according to combine the read and 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.440
 follies so 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.560
 so that's pretty good for sure 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.950
 a no need to make the actors on 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.410
 the lobby we can not necessarily 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.820
 when you see fathers what this 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.060
 on any game from elsewhere 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.320
 he was there the kilo stone had really 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.390
 the two-sided but serious time that have 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.130
 the more money he captures nothing a guy with 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.020
 his laser but I do not know them 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.790
 lasers that always makes me freak out 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.200
 does not yeah on a laser I'm in 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.240
 stressful it's true that it's a bit 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.770
 anything but 7.1 yeah so like 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.360
 I said it's with that when you 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.390
 look at the perfs whether it's on 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.100
 any colossus the line huc the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.450
 faster stuff like that do not have to 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.790
 also believe that the guys who play 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.810
 against lights that in general it's 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.550
 necessarily nobles we can not 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.960
 nothing not so ok he knew not hold 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.150
 their controller and it looks like limit of 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.130
 boots but hey so that's when 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.690
 even a sacred performance knowing that 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.160
 it's difficult on this game good I 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.630
 think we had more luck with 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.630
 lobbies try me anyway cartel 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.920
 he pretended a big gameplay there are 2 quads 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.340
 fit in the gameplay so in addition to 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.950
 dna the guy does not care of Poitiers 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.730
 clips squarely so be it to me 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.419
 I could have put every time I 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:27.140
 insured with stabbing because 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.700
 that you are freaking 1 in series you 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.680
 do not play the big crypt 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.940
 your life what are you here it is that I confess 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.720
 by the way there I want you 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.740
 had a creepy brushard clip and that's right 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.270
 that is how you were able to see 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.460
 last two he was in a corner 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.080
 ghana comes who moves that was limited 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.120
 to the cases and lotz upa who passed him 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.770
 in front of the camera we send 4 here I 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.700
 let kratos line up except he 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.820
 flakes like an asshole 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.280
 I understood the winter 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.150
 hop we took the opportunity to make a pretty 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:00.540
 quad and that's all in the end good I mean 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:07.500
 it's a dna iphone take it capable 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:09.540
 de brahim ben no it's true but no 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.250
 but suddenly that's still a mega 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.010
 performance it's true that mios the beast 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.360
 a mata fun enough to play with a knife at 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.950
 level of displacements there are quite a few 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.120
 close combat so it was really 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.410
 of the ideal map but like that 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.910
 you can see it and it's already 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.860
 two pointed in the corner took all 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.970
 shoot on it but here it is true that 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.670
 it's been two times he's in the corner 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.170
 for sure they do not have it is 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.520
 not at the top the guy but hey bah no it's 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.020
 clear that it's not it's not him who 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.780
 will be in the next emerge it's 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.000
 clear so that was already medal 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.260
 brutal blow there he remains 5 he follows me 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.140
 we were a bit like crazy it was screaming 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.460
 a little in the bone in the ears their 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.750
 accounts on skype 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.330
 she is gorgeous a this premium a 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.800
 beautiful trip he goes back to do the quad 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.090
 on that one obviously good he has 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.220
 completely done he preferred to insure 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:57.180
 assured he but it's already two 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:58.740
 movies and so that's it bah the blow of 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:09.320
 stay in kiel to be seen on the 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:12.810
 oracle ground epci the consecration of the blow 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.860
 hair dilated it suddenly it's the 30th 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.690
 that he really wants to knife that makes 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.090
 30 years old in all but 30th kg knife 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.520
 he had a gun so we will be in 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.570
 breast stop but trigger stop are 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.220
 removed right away after so 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.680
 here are the first jewels and who more 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.120
 is a flood so it ends in 32 0 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.160
 so really we will ask you for a max 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.780
 of like a max of comment sharing 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.370
 here to stand here how many 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.330
 seedling girls even if only 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.460
 the French community 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.460
 good it was carter and ono for agnéby
