00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
I'm gonna show you a short movie now but

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.290 
I'm gonna show you a short movie now but
my<00:00:01.829> good<00:00:02.010> friend<00:00:02.220> Louis<00:00:02.460> Schwartzberg<00:00:02.879> that

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
my good friend Louis Schwartzberg that

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.510 
my good friend Louis Schwartzberg that
shows<00:00:03.540> how<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:03.959> bees<00:00:04.230> forage<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.310> bees

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
shows how the bees forage and the bees

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.629 
shows how the bees forage and the bees
leave<00:00:05.970> these<00:00:06.330> hives<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:07.080> then<00:00:07.830> they<00:00:08.519> don't

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
leave these hives and then they don't

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.030 
leave these hives and then they don't
come<00:00:08.760> back

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
come back

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.709 
come back
and<00:00:11.040> so<00:00:11.280> when<00:00:11.490> Louis<00:00:11.940> Schwartzberg<00:00:12.360> knew<00:00:12.599> of

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
and so when Louis Schwartzberg knew of

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.749 
and so when Louis Schwartzberg knew of
my<00:00:12.840> work<00:00:13.080> with<00:00:13.349> insects<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.099> fungi<00:00:14.280> he<00:00:14.580> says

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
my work with insects and fungi he says

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.480 
my work with insects and fungi he says
Paul<00:00:14.969> can<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.240> help<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.960> bees<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.560> then<00:00:17.400> I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
Paul can you help the bees and then I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.279 
Paul can you help the bees and then I
have<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:18.119> epiphany<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.720> took<00:00:18.840> me<00:00:18.960> thirty

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
have this epiphany that took me thirty

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.710 
have this epiphany that took me thirty
years<00:00:20.060> and<00:00:21.109> so<00:00:22.220> we<00:00:23.220> have<00:00:23.369> now<00:00:23.550> created<00:00:23.820> Michael

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
years and so we have now created Michael

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.429 
years and so we have now created Michael
honey<00:00:24.980> coming<00:00:25.980> from<00:00:26.340> mycelium<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.439> approached

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
honey coming from mycelium I approached

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.560 
honey coming from mycelium I approached
several<00:00:28.769> universities<00:00:29.429> when<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> contacted

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
several universities when I contacted

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.359 
several universities when I contacted
Western<00:00:30.869> State<00:00:31.050> University<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:32.130> said

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
Western State University they said

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.160 
Western State University they said
please<00:00:32.579> don't<00:00:32.820> go<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> anyone<00:00:33.420> else<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:34.140> is

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
please don't go to anyone else this is

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.700 
please don't go to anyone else this is
too<00:00:34.500> cool<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.890> an<00:00:34.980> idea<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.320> started<00:00:37.620> doing

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
too cool of an idea so we started doing

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.520 
too cool of an idea so we started doing
experiments<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.610> bees<00:00:39.170> first<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.320> want<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
experiments with bees first you want to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.889 
experiments with bees first you want to
do<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> stress<00:00:40.980> test<00:00:41.180> 100<00:00:42.180> bees<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.690> cage

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
do a stress test 100 bees in a cage

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.590 
do a stress test 100 bees in a cage
they're<00:00:43.620> given<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.370> extracts<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
they're given the extracts of the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.830 
they're given the extracts of the
mycelium<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.410> micro<00:00:46.710> honey<00:00:47.180> then<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.600> said

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
mycelium the micro honey then we said

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.350 
mycelium the micro honey then we said
well<00:00:49.129> let's<00:00:50.129> look<00:00:50.280> at<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> viruses<00:00:51.090> being

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
well let's look at the viruses being

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.470 
well let's look at the viruses being
vectored<00:00:51.600> by<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.020> mites<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.210> feeding<00:00:54.210> them

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
vectored by the mites and feeding them

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.600 
vectored by the mites and feeding them
our<00:00:54.840> extracts<00:00:55.500> compared<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> sugar

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
our extracts compared to the sugar

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.420 
our extracts compared to the sugar
control<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.620> how<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.890> viral

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
control and you can see how the viral

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.770 
control and you can see how the viral
counts<00:01:00.020> skyrockets<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:02.039> at<00:01:02.539> 0.1<00:01:03.539> one

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the viral counts plummet looking at

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.359 
the viral counts plummet looking at

Birds<00:01:11.549> trees<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.930> similar<00:01:13.200> effect<00:01:13.619> how

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
Birds trees we get a similar effect how

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.710 
Birds trees we get a similar effect how
weird<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> same<00:01:16.979> mushrooms

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
weird is this that the same mushrooms

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.230 
weird is this that the same mushrooms
that<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.869> limit<00:01:19.080> bird<00:01:19.470> flu<00:01:19.830> h5n1<00:01:20.270> herpes<00:01:21.590> also

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
that can limit bird flu h5n1 herpes also

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.940 
that can limit bird flu h5n1 herpes also
positively<00:01:24.240> affect<00:01:24.930> bees<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.710> being<00:01:25.860> able

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
positively affect bees and being able

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.270 
positively affect bees and being able
for<00:01:26.700> them<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.420> control<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.409> viral<00:01:28.740> burden<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
for them to control the viral burden and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.030 
for them to control the viral burden and
reduce<00:01:29.759> them<00:01:30.229> 30%<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.290> our<00:01:31.380> food<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.619> directly

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
reduce them 30% of our food is directly

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.670 
reduce them 30% of our food is directly
pollinated<00:01:32.579> by<00:01:32.610> bees<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.630> 70%<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.380> our<00:01:34.500> food

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
pollinated by bees and 70% of our food

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.730 
pollinated by bees and 70% of our food
is<00:01:34.979> controlled<00:01:35.400> by<00:01:35.460> pollinators<00:01:36.110> we<00:01:37.110> are<00:01:37.259> we

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
is controlled by pollinators we are we

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.010 
is controlled by pollinators we are we
suffering<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.490> collapse<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.270> our<00:01:39.390> ecosystems

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
suffering a collapse of our ecosystems

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.539 
suffering a collapse of our ecosystems
but<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:42.180> something<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> I

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549

my<00:02:46.459> mission<00:02:46.879> is<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.269> discover<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.780> language

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
my mission is to discover the language

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.869 
my mission is to discover the language
of<00:02:48.349> nature<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:49.010> fungal<00:02:49.189> networks<00:02:49.489> that

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
of nature of the fungal networks that

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.940 
of nature of the fungal networks that
communicate<00:02:50.030> with<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.540> ecosystem<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:51.500> I

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
communicate with the ecosystem and I

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.870 
communicate with the ecosystem and I
believe<00:02:52.370> nature<00:02:52.609> is<00:02:53.120> intelligent

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.340 

the<00:02:57.390> fact<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.690> we<00:02:57.810> lack<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.170> language

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
the fact that we lack the language

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.190 
the fact that we lack the language
skills<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.190> communicate<00:02:59.910> with<00:03:00.360> nature<00:03:00.570> does

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
skills to communicate with nature does

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.500 
skills to communicate with nature does
not<00:03:01.230> impugn<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.280> concept<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:03.030> nature<00:03:03.450> is

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
not impugn the concept that nature is

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.930 
not impugn the concept that nature is
intelligent<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.560> speaks<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.950> our<00:03:05.040> inadequacy

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
intelligent it speaks to our inadequacy

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.460 
intelligent it speaks to our inadequacy
for<00:03:06.390> communication<00:03:08.840> if<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:10.020> don't<00:03:10.230> get<00:03:10.380> our

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
for communication if we don't get our

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.500 
for communication if we don't get our
act<00:03:10.650> together<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.400> come<00:03:11.640> in<00:03:11.730> commonality<00:03:12.390> and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
act together and come in commonality and

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.670 
act together and come in commonality and
understanding<00:03:13.020> with<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.170> organisms<00:03:13.620> that

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
understanding with the organisms that

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.950 
understanding with the organisms that
sustain<00:03:14.070> us<00:03:14.100> today<00:03:14.580> not<00:03:14.820> only<00:03:15.780> will<00:03:15.930> we

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
sustain us today not only will we

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.660 
sustain us today not only will we
destroy<00:03:16.260> those<00:03:16.620> organisms<00:03:17.010> but<00:03:17.430> we<00:03:17.550> will

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
destroy those organisms but we will

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.770 
destroy those organisms but we will
destroy<00:03:18.000> ourselves

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.690 

we<00:03:26.780> need<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.109> have<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.319> paradigm<00:03:27.920> shift<00:03:28.069> in<00:03:28.459> our

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
we need to have a paradigm shift in our

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.399 
we need to have a paradigm shift in our
consciousness<00:03:29.090> what<00:03:29.900> will<00:03:30.079> it<00:03:30.200> take<00:03:30.230> to

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
consciousness what will it take to

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.449 
consciousness what will it take to
achieve<00:03:30.859> that<00:03:31.239> if<00:03:32.239> I<00:03:32.450> die<00:03:32.510> trying<00:03:32.859> and<00:03:33.859> but<00:03:34.370> I'm

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
achieve that if I die trying and but I'm

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.849 
achieve that if I die trying and but I'm
inadequate<00:03:34.999> to<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.120> task<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:36.260> make<00:03:36.409> a<00:03:36.439> course

many<00:03:42.590> people<00:03:42.859> are<00:03:42.950> not<00:03:43.099> trying<00:03:43.510> if<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.719> knew

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
many people are not trying if you knew

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.020 
many people are not trying if you knew
that<00:03:44.870> every<00:03:45.230> breath<00:03:45.379> you<00:03:45.439> took<00:03:45.790> could<00:03:46.790> save

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
that every breath you took could save

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.240 
that every breath you took could save
hundreds<00:03:47.810> of<00:03:47.870> lives<00:03:47.930> into<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.590> future<00:03:48.920> have

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
hundreds of lives into the future have

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.709 
hundreds of lives into the future have
you<00:03:49.340> walked<00:03:49.549> down<00:03:49.639> this<00:03:49.879> path<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:50.299> knowledge

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:50.719 
you walked down this path of knowledge

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:52.449 
you walked down this path of knowledge
would<00:03:51.469> you<00:03:51.650> run<00:03:51.859> down<00:03:52.069> that<00:03:52.250> path<00:03:52.430> of

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
would you run down that path of

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.649 
would you run down that path of
knowledge<00:03:52.730> as<00:03:53.030> fast<00:03:53.239> as<00:03:53.389> you<00:03:53.510> could<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:55.659> believe

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
knowledge as fast as you could I believe

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.959 
knowledge as fast as you could I believe
nature<00:03:57.019> is<00:03:57.379> a<00:03:57.409> force<00:03:57.739> of<00:03:57.950> good<00:04:00.040> good<00:04:01.040> is<00:04:01.370> not

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:01.969 
nature is a force of good good is not

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.170 
nature is a force of good good is not
only<00:04:02.299> a<00:04:02.480> concept<00:04:03.079> it<00:04:03.379> is<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.829> spirit<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.579> so

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
only a concept it is a spirit and so

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.479 
only a concept it is a spirit and so
hopefully<00:04:05.659> the<00:04:06.500> spirit<00:04:06.859> of<00:04:06.949> goodness<00:04:07.159> will

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
hopefully the spirit of goodness will

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.760 
hopefully the spirit of goodness will
survive
