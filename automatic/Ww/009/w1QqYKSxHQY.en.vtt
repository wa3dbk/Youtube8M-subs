00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
gonna come here so I figured this was a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.740 
gonna come here so I figured this was a
perfect<00:00:47.160> place<00:00:47.340> an<00:00:47.579> opportunity<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> go<00:00:48.480> ahead

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
perfect place an opportunity to go ahead

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.360 
perfect place an opportunity to go ahead

and knock this trophy out of the way

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.639 
and knock this trophy out of the way
there's<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.480> another<00:00:51.870> trophy<00:00:52.379> or<00:00:52.440> two

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
beginning here to see a whole bunch of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.840

recommend<00:01:24.030> probably<00:01:24.540> using<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.900> crossbow<00:01:25.170> last

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
recommend probably using a crossbow last

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.109 
recommend probably using a crossbow last
just<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> takes<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.670> long<00:01:26.820> time<00:01:26.850> but

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
just because it takes a long time but

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.460 
just because it takes a long time but
I'm<00:01:27.210> gonna<00:01:27.330> go<00:01:27.479> ahead<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.720> use<00:01:27.840> my<00:01:27.869> crossbow

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
sense of how combat works and how

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.990 
sense of how combat works and how
dodging<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.899> very<00:01:46.200> important<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.829> here<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
dodging is very important in here if you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.580 
dodging is very important in here if you
can<00:01:48.119> see<00:01:48.210> I'm<00:01:48.299> using<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.600> crossbow<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.380> not

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.280 
can see I'm using the crossbow it's not
it<00:01:50.009> takes<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.399> little<00:01:50.549> while<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.840> de<00:01:51.840> load<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.259> so

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
it takes a little while to de load it so

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.499 
it takes a little while to de load it so
because<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.369> does<00:01:53.520> low<00:01:53.700> damage<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.210> probably

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
