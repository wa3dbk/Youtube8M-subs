 reverse patented 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:04.590
 key 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.690

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.860
 it is from non-profit 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.559
 among them are located the pin system when 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.250
 which 19 pins located in five 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.980
 rows 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.550
 thanks to the patented 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.250
 key or key code card as well 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.660
 due to the fact that the key blanks are not 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.169
 distributed in the duplicate key market 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.300
 cylinder era ts is p 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.439
 can be done only at the enterprise 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.890
 chase 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.310
 due to the large number of pins and 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.230
 features you know how different size and 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.690
 radial location 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.750
 cylinders this with centers 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.100
 provide high resilience 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.050
 autopsy by banking 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.540
 it is with poison 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.130
 also provide a high degree 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.250
 protection against autopsy using 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.250
 making key impressions 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.690
 but besides the maximum level 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.580
 manufacturing safety 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.210
 duplicate key cylinder is the same press 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.670
 three 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.140
 different from others by its wider 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.230
 opportunities 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.760
 create maximum 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.150
 number of combinations 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.990
 what allows to solve the most various 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.590
 tasks in creating control systems 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.610
 access 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.640
 has all the necessary 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.240
 characteristics that meet the most 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.890
 high degrees of the norm to her 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.289
 13 03 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.609
 which must correspond 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.239
 armored doors classified as 

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:30.289
 fourth to sixth degree according to standard

 elena 16 27 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.650
 these are the main characteristics 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.990
 cylinder 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.990
 era with actors 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.020
 select changed the most interesting 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.020
 for you circus 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.479
 the inability to purchase new items 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.420
 key blanks difficulty 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.479
 copy existing keys 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.020
 so-called and shock key great 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.680
 the number of pins is their target size and 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.080
 location along the radius provide 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.790
 high degree of protection against opening 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.720
 cylinder by the method of banking besides cylinders this 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.810
 edge projection 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.330
 guarantees a high degree of protection 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
 opening with key casts 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.609
 cylinder m p centers comes together 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.079
 patented key 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.909
 individual card key code 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.980
 including this it centers 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.180
 there is a built-in case element 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.120
 which makes it even more difficult 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.489
 making copies of keys 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.459
 the key is the centers 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.730
 security of the illegal 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.590
 making duplicates of it 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.590
 blanks cannot be purchased on the market 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.899
 to provide even greater guarantees 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:49.449
 security end 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:51.529
 consumer key code card 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:53.139
 provide a high degree 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.949
 individual approach with 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.209
 making duplicate keys 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.189
 so the duplicate key is with the actors 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.349
 can be made solely on 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.349
 enterprise number itself 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:13.999
 the key they this pico the second successfully combines 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.790
 in itself beauty and safety 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.899
 design and high technology 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:20.959
 thanks to its particular shape and for 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.929
 which keys are easy to hold and 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:24.939
 thanks to the red color 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.539
 chase the key ali is different 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.359
 appearance and convenience in 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.599
 using 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.539
 key they are the first key which has 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.539
 transparent plastic rates 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.529
 as seen through the transparent rates of it 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:41.419
 other head connects with 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.699
 metal parts including 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.149
 hole on the metal part 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:46.029
 key 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.789
 guarantees high reliability of fastening 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:50.789
 key rings or cube pants 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.220
 cylinder potential is a projection of the edge 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.379
 when creating access control systems 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.349
 these are 85 million different cylinders 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.659
 which can be opened by one macmaster 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.629
 key micron 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.689
 since the cylinders are rae centers having up 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.650
 19 elements of a secret code 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.319
 cylinder or foam 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.949
 he provides the greatest 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:18.780
 opportunities 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.759
 for access control projects 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.800
 and nonchalant individual
