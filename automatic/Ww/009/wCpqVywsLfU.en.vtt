00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
well and they let me see a little bit

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.840 
well and they let me see a little bit
more<00:01:01.289> gameplay<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.520> very<00:01:02.699> cool

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
more gameplay and this is a very cool

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.579 
more gameplay and this is a very cool
weapon<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.239> well<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.719> how<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.439> haven't

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
weapon as well this is how one I haven't

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
weapon as well this is how one I haven't
seen<00:01:04.860> before<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.820> appears<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> be

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
seen before and that this appears to be

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.910 
seen before and that this appears to be
what<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:06.810> will<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> heavy

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
what I think will be in the heavy

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.380 
what I think will be in the heavy
weapons<00:01:08.340> category<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> looks<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.150> it's

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
weapons category it looks like it's

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.600 
weapons category it looks like it's
another<00:01:09.570> energy<00:01:10.110> weapon<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:11.100> seems<00:01:11.340> almost

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
another energy weapon it seems almost

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.399 
another energy weapon it seems almost
like<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.939> sniper<00:01:12.330> rifle<00:01:12.540> with<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.810> iron<00:01:13.020> sights

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
like a sniper rifle with the iron sights

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.230 
like a sniper rifle with the iron sights
but<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> way<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.159> kind<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.400> shoots<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
but the way it kind of shoots and the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.700 
but the way it kind of shoots and the
colors<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:15.960> comes<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
colors of what comes out of it it

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.920 
colors of what comes out of it it
definitely<00:01:16.860> appears<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
definitely appears to be a

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.630 
definitely appears to be a
directed-energy<00:01:18.930> weapon<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.280> seems<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
directed-energy weapon and it seems to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.789 
directed-energy weapon and it seems to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
next up we can see on the map is sin

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.660 
next up we can see on the map is sin
this<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.740> these<00:01:31.890> turrets<00:01:32.310> look<00:01:32.490> like

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
this is one of a map based school

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.480 
this is one of a map based school
streets<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:34.950> activate<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
around the middle of the map and then we

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.010 
around the middle of the map and then we
can<00:01:38.640> see<00:01:38.729> another<00:01:39.000> brand<00:01:39.299> new<00:01:39.390> weapon<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.780> is

the very similar to the mores from
courgette<00:01:41.909> ghost<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:42.360> sure<00:01:42.570> will<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.750> called

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
courgette ghost not sure will be called

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.600 
courgette ghost not sure will be called
in<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.290> game<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:43.979> definitely<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
in this game but it's definitely the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.510 
in this game but it's definitely the
more's<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> ma<00:01:45.450> WS<00:01:46.380> rocket<00:01:47.070> launcher<00:01:47.430> from

more's the ma WS rocket launcher from
courgette<00:01:47.909> goes<00:01:48.180> which<00:01:48.600> was<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> port

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
courgette goes which was the port

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.569 
courgette goes which was the port
streaked<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.560> I'm<00:01:49.619> assuming<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.159> will<00:01:50.399> now

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
streaked but I'm assuming this will now

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.550 
streaked but I'm assuming this will now
be<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.030> rocket<00:01:51.479> launch<00:01:51.600> category<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.229> it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
be in the rocket launch category and it

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920 
be in the rocket launch category and it
looks<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.159> single<00:01:53.579> free<00:01:53.939> fire<00:01:54.210> kind

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
looks like it's a single free fire kind

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.149 
looks like it's a single free fire kind
of<00:01:55.020> miss<00:01:55.140> our<00:01:55.320> launcher<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> looks<00:01:56.040> very

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
of miss our launcher but it looks very

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.490 
of miss our launcher but it looks very
interesting<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.790> well<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:58.049> next<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.380> we

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
interesting as well and then next up we

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.780 
interesting as well and then next up we
can<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.740> within<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> multiplayer<00:01:59.310> modes<00:01:59.640> we

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
can see within the multiplayer modes we

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.730 
can see within the multiplayer modes we
can<00:01:59.909> see<00:02:00.000> another<00:02:00.270> glimpse<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:01.170> same

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
can see another glimpse of this same

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.469 
can see another glimpse of this same
rifle<00:02:02.189> right<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> seems<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.390> be

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
rifle right here and it seems to be

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.149 
rifle right here and it seems to be
shooting<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.930> very<00:02:04.170> very<00:02:04.439> cool<00:02:04.619> kind<00:02:05.070> of

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.530 
shooting a very very cool kind of
colorful<00:02:05.430> blasts<00:02:05.790> from<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.360> seems

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
colorful blasts from it and it seems

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.809 
colorful blasts from it and it seems
very<00:02:06.689> similar<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.439> em1<00:02:07.740> rifle<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.429> which

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
very similar to the em1 rifle in which

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.279 
very similar to the em1 rifle in which
it<00:02:08.970> doesn't<00:02:09.119> actually<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.569> reload<00:02:10.080> it's

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
it doesn't actually have to reload it's

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.050 
it doesn't actually have to reload it's
simply<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.649> over<00:02:11.039> charges<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.610> they're

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
simply just over charges and they're

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.540 
simply just over charges and they're
kind<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.239> Oh

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
kind of Oh

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.680 
kind of Oh
heat<00:02:12.730> then<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:12.970> have<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.180> wait<00:02:13.360> for<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.570> to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
heat then you have to wait for it to

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.090 
heat then you have to wait for it to
cool<00:02:13.840> down<00:02:13.900> for<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.350> second<00:02:14.680> then<00:02:14.800> we<00:02:14.830> get<00:02:15.070> a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
cool down for a second then we get a

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.040 
cool down for a second then we get a
look<00:02:15.340> at<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.970> first<00:02:16.240> glimpse<00:02:16.900> of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
look at the first glimpse of

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.930 
look at the first glimpse of
search-and-destroy<00:02:17.620> there's<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.280> little<00:02:18.850> bit

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
search-and-destroy there's a little bit

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.400 
search-and-destroy there's a little bit
of<00:02:19.000> talk<00:02:19.150> about<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.510> game<00:02:19.690> modes<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.050> here

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
of talk about the game modes and here

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.900 
of talk about the game modes and here
you<00:02:20.500> can<00:02:20.560> see<00:02:20.740> this<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.100> what<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> actual<00:02:21.520> bomb

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
you can see this is what the actual bomb

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.430 
you can see this is what the actual bomb
in<00:02:22.180> search-and-destroy<00:02:22.690> will<00:02:23.080> look<00:02:23.290> like

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
in search-and-destroy will look like

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.990 
in search-and-destroy will look like
obviously<00:02:23.740> one<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.280> B<00:02:24.430> bombs<00:02:24.880> you

actually<00:02:35.260> look<00:02:35.410> like<00:02:35.440> he's<00:02:35.710> over<00:02:35.920> B<00:02:36.100> bomb<00:02:36.760> site

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
actually look like he's over B bomb site

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.150 
actually look like he's over B bomb site
one<00:02:37.210> which<00:02:37.570> is<00:02:37.690> on<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.930> map<00:02:38.170> defender<00:02:38.950> and

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160

glimpse of what certian destroyed in
advanced<00:02:41.980> warfare<00:02:42.130> is<00:02:42.430> gonna<00:02:42.580> look<00:02:42.730> like<00:02:42.910> on

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
advanced warfare is gonna look like on

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.880 
advanced warfare is gonna look like on
the<00:02:43.180> bombs<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.750> stuff<00:02:43.930> like<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.440> then<00:02:44.770> we

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
the bombs and stuff like that then we

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.710 
the bombs and stuff like that then we
see<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.070> guy<00:02:45.250> rocking<00:02:45.460> a<00:02:45.640> very<00:02:45.880> very<00:02:46.090> cool<00:02:46.270> gold

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
cool one to see without all the brass

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.780 
cool one to see without all the brass
and<00:02:50.440> put<00:02:50.560> an<00:02:50.650> exosuit<00:02:51.100> can't<00:02:51.400> tell<00:02:51.580> exactly

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
cool-looking so I can't wait to see a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.260 
cool-looking so I can't wait to see a
bit<00:02:56.920> more<00:02:57.070> information<00:02:57.220> about<00:02:57.520> those<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:58.180> we

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
bit more information about those then we

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.910 
bit more information about those then we
go<00:02:58.360> look<00:02:58.570> at<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.930> domination<00:02:59.410> game-mode

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
go look at the domination game-mode

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.230 
go look at the domination game-mode
being<00:03:00.130> played<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.490> map<00:03:00.610> right<00:03:00.910> we<00:03:01.030> can<00:03:01.150> see

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
being played on the map right we can see

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.240 
being played on the map right we can see
the<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.360> flag<00:03:01.780> right<00:03:01.990> here<00:03:02.050> it's<00:03:02.590> very<00:03:02.890> much<00:03:03.070> out

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
the a flag right here it's very much out

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.100 
the a flag right here it's very much out
in<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.340> open<00:03:03.640> this<00:03:03.730> flag<00:03:04.000> looks<00:03:04.270> very<00:03:04.630> very

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
in the open this flag looks very very

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.230 
in the open this flag looks very very
cruel<00:03:05.470> it's<00:03:05.680> completely<00:03:06.400> out<00:03:06.760> in<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:06.970> open

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
cruel it's completely out in the open

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.300 
cruel it's completely out in the open
with<00:03:07.360> zero<00:03:07.690> cover<00:03:08.050> at<00:03:08.290> all<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.770> there<00:03:09.220> though

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
with zero cover at all and there though

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.890 
with zero cover at all and there though
so<00:03:09.460> it's<00:03:09.580> been<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.730> very<00:03:09.880> very<00:03:10.420> hard<00:03:10.660> at

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
so it's been a very very hard at

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.600 
so it's been a very very hard at
domination<00:03:11.350> flag<00:03:11.590> capture<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.220> be<00:03:12.340> able<00:03:12.430> to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
domination flag capture to be able to

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.160 
domination flag capture to be able to
take<00:03:12.850> control<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.300> simply<00:03:13.840> because<00:03:14.020> there's

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
take control of simply because there's

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.930 
take control of simply because there's
no<00:03:14.290> covers<00:03:14.650> not<00:03:14.770> even<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.010> car<00:03:15.250> in<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.730> middle

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
no covers not even a car in the middle

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.010 
no covers not even a car in the middle
to<00:03:16.000> be<00:03:16.060> able<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.240> hide<00:03:16.420> behind<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:16.780> if<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.900> want

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
to be able to hide behind so if you want

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.540 
to be able to hide behind so if you want
to<00:03:17.080> take<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.320> you'll<00:03:17.560> be<00:03:17.709> very<00:03:17.920> very<00:03:18.010> exposed

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
to take this you'll be very very exposed

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.100 
to take this you'll be very very exposed
but<00:03:19.090> it's<00:03:19.270> gonna<00:03:19.390> be<00:03:19.450> very<00:03:19.630> interesting<00:03:19.900> cell

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
but it's gonna be very interesting cell

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.520 
but it's gonna be very interesting cell
domination<00:03:20.650> plays<00:03:20.890> in<00:03:21.160> advanced<00:03:21.730> warfare<00:03:21.940> and

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
domination plays in advanced warfare and

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.020 
domination plays in advanced warfare and
then<00:03:23.530> we<00:03:23.620> can<00:03:23.739> see<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.070> something<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:24.790> haven't

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
then we can see a something I haven't

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.220 
then we can see a something I haven't
seen<00:03:25.209> before<00:03:25.480> this<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.750> very<00:03:25.930> very<00:03:26.020> cool

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230

small looking one almost like a Uzi and
the<00:03:28.720> next<00:03:29.050> up<00:03:29.170> we<00:03:29.320> can<00:03:29.470> see<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.920> very<00:03:30.160> strange

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
the next up we can see a very strange

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.680 
the next up we can see a very strange
kill<00:03:30.730> streak<00:03:30.970> if<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.300> look<00:03:31.480> at<00:03:31.630> the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
kill streak if you look at the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.540 
kill streak if you look at the
right-hand<00:03:31.900> side<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.620> can<00:03:32.650> see<00:03:32.890> his<00:03:33.100> top<00:03:33.340> kill

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
right-hand side you can see his top kill

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.890 
right-hand side you can see his top kill
straight<00:03:33.760> he<00:03:33.820> looks<00:03:34.000> very<00:03:34.060> very<00:03:34.300> strange<00:03:34.720> I'm

straight he looks very very strange I'm
not<00:03:35.050> sure<00:03:35.230> whether<00:03:35.350> it's<00:03:35.470> just<00:03:35.590> an<00:03:35.709> unfinished

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
not sure whether it's just an unfinished

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.979 
not sure whether it's just an unfinished
kind<00:03:36.670> of<00:03:36.730> placeholder<00:03:37.030> icon<00:03:37.660> or<00:03:37.750> whether<00:03:37.900> it's

kind of placeholder icon or whether it's

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.390 
kind of placeholder icon or whether it's
actual<00:03:38.170> kill<00:03:38.530> streak<00:03:38.770> it<00:03:38.920> looks<00:03:39.100> very<00:03:39.310> very

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
actual kill streak it looks very very

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.520 
actual kill streak it looks very very
weird<00:03:39.760> just<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.330> very<00:03:40.540> very<00:03:40.720> small<00:03:40.959> cross<00:03:41.350> I'm

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
weird just a very very small cross I'm

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.110 
weird just a very very small cross I'm
starting<00:03:41.800> to<00:03:41.830> think<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.130> might<00:03:42.310> be<00:03:42.370> just<00:03:43.030> an

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
starting to think it might be just an

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.030 
starting to think it might be just an
unfinished<00:03:43.570> kind<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:43.959> icon<00:03:44.440> in<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.709> heads-up

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
unfinished kind of icon in the heads-up

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.110 
unfinished kind of icon in the heads-up
display<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.520> it's<00:03:45.640> not<00:03:45.790> really<00:03:46.000> like

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
display and it's not really like

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.670 
display and it's not really like
completed<00:03:46.630> just<00:03:46.780> yet<00:03:46.989> some<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.530> game

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
completed just yet some of the game

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.500 
completed just yet some of the game
isn't<00:03:47.950> finished<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.520> but<00:03:48.940> I'm<00:03:49.030> not<00:03:49.180> sure<00:03:49.330> what

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510
