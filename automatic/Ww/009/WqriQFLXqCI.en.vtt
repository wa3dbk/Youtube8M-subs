00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.300 

so<00:00:44.690> we're<00:00:45.110> nearly<00:00:45.290> ready<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.590> go<00:00:45.740> drill<00:00:45.980> invert

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
so we're nearly ready to go drill invert

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.150 
so we're nearly ready to go drill invert
them<00:00:46.870> we've<00:00:47.870> got<00:00:47.990> the<00:00:48.080> micro<00:00:48.410> fertilizer<00:00:48.950> to

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
them we've got the micro fertilizer to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.070 
them we've got the micro fertilizer to
put<00:00:49.190> in<00:00:49.490> which<00:00:49.940> is<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.270> small<00:00:50.540> stuff<00:00:50.840> in<00:00:50.990> the

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
put in which is the small stuff in the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.650 
put in which is the small stuff in the
hopper<00:00:51.350> at<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.530> back<00:00:51.740> I<00:00:52.480> thought<00:00:53.480> it's<00:00:53.630> a

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
hopper at the back I thought it's a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.090 
hopper at the back I thought it's a
silver<00:00:53.930> hopper<00:00:54.290> at<00:00:54.350> that<00:00:54.440> fertilizer<00:00:54.860> waiting

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
silver hopper at that fertilizer waiting

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.460 
silver hopper at that fertilizer waiting
but<00:00:55.160> actually<00:00:55.430> using<00:00:55.670> these<00:00:55.760> little<00:00:56.470> little

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
but actually using these little little

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.460 
but actually using these little little
white<00:00:57.740> hoppers<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:59.480> there<00:00:59.690> it<00:00:59.780> is<00:00:59.810> bagged<00:01:00.290> up

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
white hoppers and there it is bagged up

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.240 
white hoppers and there it is bagged up
there<00:01:01.600> very<00:01:02.600> very<00:01:02.870> fine<00:01:03.200> fertilizer<00:01:03.860> it's<00:01:04.100> not

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
there very very fine fertilizer it's not

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.710 
there very very fine fertilizer it's not
like<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.550> big<00:01:04.670> chunky<00:01:05.030> stuff<00:01:05.240> I<00:01:05.360> put<00:01:05.540> on<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
like the big chunky stuff I put on the

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.260 
like the big chunky stuff I put on the
grassland<00:01:06.200> I<00:01:06.670> presume<00:01:07.670> that's<00:01:07.820> because<00:01:08.150> it

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
grassland I presume that's because it

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.160 
grassland I presume that's because it
will<00:01:08.360> break<00:01:08.540> down<00:01:08.570> easily<00:01:08.990> by<00:01:09.320> VM<00:01:09.740> by<00:01:11.170> the

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
will break down easily by VM by the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.630 
will break down easily by VM by the
seeds<00:01:12.500> as<00:01:12.650> it<00:01:12.770> germinates

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.850 

to<00:01:17.090> put<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.510> into<00:01:17.660> my<00:01:17.900> office<00:01:17.930> without<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.740> look

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
to put it into my office without a look

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:29.649 
to put it into my office without a look
at<00:01:19.040> in<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.220> minute<00:01:19.340> see<00:01:19.640> how<00:01:19.700> small<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.180> is

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.910 

just<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.810> cake<00:01:31.049> mixer<00:01:31.470> something<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.799> these

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
just like cake mixer something in these

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:44.639 
just like cake mixer something in these
silver<00:01:32.280> bags

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.870 

pretty<00:01:45.649> fine<00:01:45.859> stuff<00:01:46.189> though<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.579> Ramius

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
pretty fine stuff though and it Ramius

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.959 
pretty fine stuff though and it Ramius
really<00:01:47.299> fine<00:01:47.570> in<00:01:47.750> there<00:01:47.929> it's<00:01:48.859> like<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.490> gravy

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
really fine in there it's like so gravy

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.419 
really fine in there it's like so gravy
granules<00:01:50.439> is<00:01:51.439> actually<00:01:51.829> there<00:01:51.979> breaks<00:01:52.219> down

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
granules is actually there breaks down

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.450 
granules is actually there breaks down
easily<00:01:52.609> by<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.939> seed<00:01:53.539> I<00:01:53.689> space<00:01:54.159> that<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:55.310> use

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
easily by the seed I space that you use

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.260 
easily by the seed I space that you use
a<00:01:55.490> very<00:01:55.700> small<00:01:55.969> amount<00:01:56.119> right<00:01:57.909> that's<00:01:58.909> really

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
a very small amount right that's really

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:10.059 
a very small amount right that's really
fine

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.170

here's<00:06:13.660> one<00:06:13.870> of<00:06:13.930> the<00:06:14.020> fertilizer<00:06:14.560> bags<00:06:14.949> from

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
here's one of the fertilizer bags from

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.770 
here's one of the fertilizer bags from
the<00:06:15.370> micro<00:06:15.819> fertilizer<00:06:16.830> at<00:06:17.830> supers<00:06:18.729> a<00:06:18.879> 10<00:06:19.120> so

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
the micro fertilizer at supers a 10 so

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.230 
the micro fertilizer at supers a 10 so
there<00:06:19.900> you<00:06:20.050> go<00:06:20.340> you<00:06:21.340> can<00:06:21.370> just<00:06:21.520> make<00:06:21.879> out<00:06:22.060> on

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
there you go you can just make out on

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.020 
there you go you can just make out on
