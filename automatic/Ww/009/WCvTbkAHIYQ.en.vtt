00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
past two and a half months so that's I

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.120 
past two and a half months so that's I
usually<00:00:17.699> feel<00:00:17.820> like<00:00:18.680> three<00:00:19.680> weeks<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.100> month

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
usually feel like three weeks to a month

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.010 
usually feel like three weeks to a month
is<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> good<00:00:20.789> enough<00:00:21.000> time<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.420> me<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.869> get<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
is a good enough time for me to get a

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.420 
is a good enough time for me to get a
good<00:00:22.230> sense<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.650> skincare<00:00:22.890> product<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
good sense of a skincare product and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.340 
good sense of a skincare product and
whether<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.670> works<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.840> me<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.140> whether<00:00:25.230> it

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
whether it works for me and whether it

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.220 
whether it works for me and whether it
works<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.680> general<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.960> obviously

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
works in general and so obviously

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.509 
works in general and so obviously
because<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.650> use<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:28.980> longer<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.460> do

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
because I can use it for longer I do

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.890 
because I can use it for longer I do
like<00:00:29.880> it

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
like it

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.990

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
first off you can get tested for it it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.860 
first off you can get tested for it it

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
used to be a lot worse but my

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.450 
used to be a lot worse but my
medications<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.570> been<00:01:00.690> taking<00:01:00.960> care<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.170> it

medications have been taking care of it
but<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> usually<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.879> require<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> pretty<00:01:03.570> harsh

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
but I usually do require a pretty harsh

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.929 
but I usually do require a pretty harsh
face<00:01:04.589> wash<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.070> keep<00:01:05.250> my<00:01:05.400> oil<00:01:05.640> production

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
face wash to keep my oil production

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.789 
face wash to keep my oil production
under<00:01:06.330> control<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:08.100> my<00:01:09.000> skin<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.960> take<00:01:10.200> some

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
under control and my skin can take some

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.640 
under control and my skin can take some
of<00:01:10.890> those<00:01:10.979> pretty<00:01:11.250> harsh<00:01:11.460> ones<00:01:11.780> I'm<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
of those pretty harsh ones I'm not on a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.130 
of those pretty harsh ones I'm not on a
really<00:01:14.220> really<00:01:14.460> intense<00:01:14.820> acne<00:01:15.600> medication

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
really really intense acne medication

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.380 
really really intense acne medication
like<00:01:16.259> accutane<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:16.830> retin-a<00:01:17.430> which<00:01:18.030> destroys

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
like accutane or retin-a which destroys

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.700 
like accutane or retin-a which destroys
my<00:01:18.570> skin<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.930> which<00:01:19.049> case<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.350> wouldn't<00:01:19.560> eat

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
my skin in which case I wouldn't eat

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.520 
my skin in which case I wouldn't eat
something<00:01:19.950> gentle<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.740> need<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:24.530> buildup

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
something gentle but I need the buildup

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.730 
something gentle but I need the buildup
I<00:01:25.740> guess<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.670> medication<00:01:27.630> plus<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.320> really

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
I guess of the medication plus a really

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.460 
I guess of the medication plus a really
strong<00:01:29.009> cleanser<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:30.659> sometimes<00:01:31.079> even<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
strong cleanser and sometimes even a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.760 
strong cleanser and sometimes even a
mattifier<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.610> skin<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> stay

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
mattifier to get my skin to stay

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.700 
mattifier to get my skin to stay
oil-free<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:35.159> most<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.430> day<00:01:36.350> so<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> wasn't

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
well those things where it lasts until I
