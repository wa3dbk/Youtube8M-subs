00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
freakin awesome look how much smaller

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.400 
freakin awesome look how much smaller
those<00:05:10.020> tires<00:05:10.290> are<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:11.900> don't<00:05:12.900> know<00:05:13.080> if<00:05:13.230> they're

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
those tires are I don't know if they're

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.280 
those tires are I don't know if they're
different<00:05:14.390> like<00:05:15.390> if<00:05:15.510> these<00:05:15.630> were<00:05:15.840> geared<00:05:16.050> down

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
different like if these were geared down

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.050 
different like if these were geared down
to<00:05:16.500> deal<00:05:16.650> with<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.830> bigger<00:05:16.950> tires<00:05:17.220> but<00:05:17.640> maybe

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
to deal with the bigger tires but maybe

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.800 
to deal with the bigger tires but maybe
that'll<00:05:18.330> help<00:05:18.360> with<00:05:18.540> power<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:20.300> know<00:05:21.300> if<00:05:21.630> it's

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
that'll help with power you know if it's

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.150 
that'll help with power you know if it's
if<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.230> makes<00:05:22.410> a<00:05:22.500> geared<00:05:22.710> lower<00:05:22.950> for<00:05:23.100> the

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
if it makes a geared lower for the

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.240 
if it makes a geared lower for the
height<00:05:24.050> these<00:05:25.050> are<00:05:25.200> big<00:05:25.440> softball<00:05:25.800> tires

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
height these are big softball tires

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.600 
height these are big softball tires
these<00:05:26.520> are<00:05:26.640> kind<00:05:26.850> of<00:05:26.940> stiffer<00:05:28.250> which<00:05:29.250> yeah

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
these are kind of stiffer which yeah

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.970 
these are kind of stiffer which yeah
that's<00:05:29.850> not<00:05:30.090> good<00:05:30.390> Ravinder<00:05:31.020> I'm<00:05:31.770> look<00:05:31.950> at

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
that's not good Ravinder I'm look at

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.940 
that's not good Ravinder I'm look at
this<00:05:32.220> bitch-ass<00:05:33.090> tiny<00:05:33.660> little<00:05:33.990> flash<00:05:34.320> circuit

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
this bitch-ass tiny little flash circuit

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.450 
this bitch-ass tiny little flash circuit
board<00:05:35.990> prepared<00:05:36.990> of<00:05:37.110> this<00:05:37.260> fucker<00:05:37.560> oh<00:05:37.770> maybe

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
board prepared of this fucker oh maybe

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.490 
board prepared of this fucker oh maybe
this<00:05:38.610> one's<00:05:38.820> doing<00:05:39.000> a<00:05:39.120> lot<00:05:39.240> more<00:05:39.450> of<00:05:39.570> it<00:05:39.720> still

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
this one's doing a lot more of it still

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.200 
this one's doing a lot more of it still
pretty<00:05:40.680> awesome<00:05:40.740> oh<00:05:42.680> yeah<00:05:43.970> yeah<00:05:44.970> it's<00:05:45.150> the

guys check this out so I've got the this

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.209 
guys check this out so I've got the this
is<00:06:07.169> a<00:06:07.199> band<00:06:07.499> one<00:06:08.090> vehicle<00:06:09.830> so<00:06:10.830> I've<00:06:10.919> got<00:06:11.039> this

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
is a band one vehicle so I've got this

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:14.600 
is a band one vehicle so I've got this
obviously<00:06:11.819> different<00:06:12.240> band<00:06:12.479> one<00:06:13.610> transmitter

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
obviously different band one transmitter

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.550 
obviously different band one transmitter
from<00:06:14.819> one<00:06:15.719> of<00:06:15.840> the<00:06:15.930> Malibu's<00:06:18.259> check<00:06:19.259> it<00:06:19.379> out

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
from one of the Malibu's check it out

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.330 
from one of the Malibu's check it out
when<00:06:19.800> I<00:06:19.830> turn<00:06:20.069> it<00:06:20.219> on<00:06:21.469> the<00:06:22.469> fucking<00:06:22.740> headlights

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
when I turn it on the fucking headlights

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.980 
when I turn it on the fucking headlights
work

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:36.880 

that's<00:06:29.320> me<00:06:29.530> turning<00:06:30.070> me

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.060 

laughs<00:06:37.520> rap

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.340 

what<00:06:41.670> that<00:06:41.850> leads<00:06:42.390> me<00:06:42.570> to<00:06:42.600> believe<00:06:42.780> is<00:06:43.050> it<00:06:43.170> that

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
what that leads me to believe is it that

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.620 
what that leads me to believe is it that
the<00:06:43.620> transmitter<00:06:44.190> the<00:06:44.880> light<00:06:45.060> switch<00:06:45.360> on<00:06:45.480> the

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
the transmitter the light switch on the

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.270 
the transmitter the light switch on the
other<00:06:45.840> transmitter<00:06:46.380> isn't<00:06:46.650> working<00:06:46.950> so<00:06:46.980> let's

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
other transmitter isn't working so let's

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.020 
other transmitter isn't working so let's
go<00:06:47.430> check<00:06:47.460> that<00:06:47.790> out

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
go check that out

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.970 
go check that out
I<00:06:48.300> shoulda<00:06:48.900> checked<00:06:48.960> this<00:06:49.350> before<00:06:49.830> but

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 
I shoulda checked this before but

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.360 
I shoulda checked this before but
there's<00:06:50.190> the<00:06:50.370> switch<00:06:50.670> there's<00:06:51.090> the<00:06:51.270> two<00:06:52.370> so

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
there's the switch there's the two so

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.880 
there's the switch there's the two so
now<00:06:53.520> there's<00:06:53.760> the<00:06:53.880> two<00:06:54.030> wires<00:06:54.470> when<00:06:55.470> I<00:06:55.560> connect

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
now there's the two wires when I connect

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.700 
now there's the two wires when I connect
them<00:06:56.810> definitely<00:06:57.810> turns<00:06:58.020> headlights<00:06:58.440> on<00:06:58.560> so

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
them definitely turns headlights on so

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.680 
them definitely turns headlights on so
the<00:06:58.800> switch<00:06:59.040> isn't<00:06:59.250> working<00:06:59.640> so<00:06:59.670> maybe<00:07:00.060> I<00:07:00.210> can

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
the switch isn't working so maybe I can

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.030 
the switch isn't working so maybe I can
a<00:07:00.950> lot<00:07:01.950> of<00:07:01.980> this<00:07:02.190> older<00:07:03.710> electronic<00:07:04.710> stuff<00:07:04.890> you

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
a lot of this older electronic stuff you

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.560 
a lot of this older electronic stuff you
can<00:07:05.160> kind<00:07:05.340> of<00:07:05.430> like<00:07:05.580> there's<00:07:06.000> tabs<00:07:06.240> and<00:07:06.480> you

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
can kind of like there's tabs and you

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.930 
can kind of like there's tabs and you
can<00:07:06.690> pop<00:07:06.840> switches<00:07:07.230> apart<00:07:07.530> so<00:07:07.800> maybe<00:07:08.730> I<00:07:08.790> can

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
can pop switches apart so maybe I can

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:22.420 
can pop switches apart so maybe I can
clean<00:07:09.120> something<00:07:09.390> oh<00:07:11.420> wait<00:07:12.420> wait

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.920 

if<00:07:22.850> you<00:07:22.970> don't<00:07:23.120> work<00:07:23.180> now<00:07:23.360> maybe<00:07:23.570> I<00:07:23.630> just<00:07:23.780> need
