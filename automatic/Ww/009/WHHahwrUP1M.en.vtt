00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
really the definition of what a Disney

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.450 
really the definition of what a Disney
princess<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.950> unless<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.130> look<00:02:25.280> at<00:02:25.370> the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
princess is unless you look at the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.820 
princess is unless you look at the
original<00:02:25.730> version<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.420> Jasmine<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.320> that

original version of Jasmine and that
horrible<00:02:28.130> song<00:02:28.580> she's<00:02:28.850> saying<00:02:29.030> about<00:02:29.180> how

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
horrible song she's saying about how

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.400 
horrible song she's saying about how
okay<00:02:30.530> basically<00:02:30.920> once<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.310> love<00:02:31.760> Monet<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.930> don't

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
okay basically once I love Monet I don't

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.710 
okay basically once I love Monet I don't
need<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> rich<00:02:33.890> man<00:02:34.220> they<00:02:34.790> cut<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.240> for<00:02:35.510> good

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
need a rich man they cut it for good

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.870 
need a rich man they cut it for good
reasons<00:02:36.560> that's<00:02:36.740> not<00:02:36.980> what<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.370> princess<00:02:37.760> is

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
reasons that's not what a princess is

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
reasons that's not what a princess is
supposed<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.180> be<00:02:38.360> it's<00:02:38.510> someone<00:02:38.750> who<00:02:38.840> is

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
supposed to be it's someone who is

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.820 
supposed to be it's someone who is
courageous<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.770> compassionate<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.450> loving

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
courageous and compassionate and loving

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.310 
courageous and compassionate and loving
and<00:02:42.830> strong<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.670> represents<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.570> lot<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:44.900> ideals

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
and strong it represents a lot of ideals

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.690 
and strong it represents a lot of ideals
that<00:02:45.920> hopefully<00:02:46.430> young<00:02:47.300> girls<00:02:47.600> could<00:02:48.700> relate

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
that hopefully young girls could relate

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.940 
that hopefully young girls could relate
to<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.150> try<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.420> emulate<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.320> positive<00:02:51.800> way

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
to and try to emulate in a positive way

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.970 
to and try to emulate in a positive way
I<00:02:52.670> think<00:02:53.000> that's<00:02:53.510> at<00:02:53.660> least<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:54.050> goal<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:54.770> yes

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
I think that's at least the goal so yes

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.120 
I think that's at least the goal so yes
it<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.280> time<00:02:55.550> for<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:56.450> mix<00:02:57.050> princess<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.980> a

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
it is time for a mix princess and a

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.970 
it is time for a mix princess and a
Caribbean<00:02:58.400> princess<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.570> a<00:03:00.080> Korean<00:03:00.410> princess

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
Caribbean princess and a Korean princess

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.980 
Caribbean princess and a Korean princess
and<00:03:01.160> all<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.550> princesses<00:03:02.120> but<00:03:02.360> one<00:03:02.810> could

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
and all of the princesses but one could

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.500 
and all of the princesses but one could
argue<00:03:03.140> do<00:03:03.560> we<00:03:03.680> really<00:03:03.980> need<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.250> do<00:03:04.880> we<00:03:05.030> do<00:03:05.390> we

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
argue do we really need that do we do we

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.780 
argue do we really need that do we do we
really<00:03:05.660> need<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.140> have<00:03:06.380> those<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:07.250> represented

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
really need to have those it represented

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.310 
really need to have those it represented
as<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.210> princess<00:03:08.690> or<00:03:08.810> just<00:03:08.990> have<00:03:09.140> them

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
as a princess or just have them

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.820 
as a princess or just have them
represented<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.760> believable<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.830> positive

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
represented in a believable and positive

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.040 
represented in a believable and positive
way<00:03:12.980> in<00:03:13.250> general<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:14.240> could<00:03:14.390> argue<00:03:14.510> yes

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
way in general and you could argue yes

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.290 
way in general and you could argue yes
but<00:03:15.320> I'm<00:03:15.410> gonna<00:03:15.590> answer<00:03:15.800> no<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:16.820> time<00:03:17.030> for

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
but I'm gonna answer no it is time for

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.670 
but I'm gonna answer no it is time for
all<00:03:17.450> of<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.690> different<00:03:17.840> representation

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
all of that different representation

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.530 
all of that different representation
it's<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.130> weird<00:03:19.370> feeling<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.970> not<00:03:20.180> feel

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
it's a weird feeling to not feel

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.360 
it's a weird feeling to not feel
represented<00:03:21.260> for<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> long<00:03:21.680> time<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.160> then<00:03:22.250> to

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
represented for a long time and then to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.550 
represented for a long time and then to
see<00:03:22.580> it<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.880> then<00:03:22.970> feel<00:03:23.210> like<00:03:23.240> yes<00:03:24.080> someone

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
see it and then feel like yes someone

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.250 
see it and then feel like yes someone
hears<00:03:24.830> me<00:03:25.010> someone<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.430> counting<00:03:25.880> me<00:03:26.110> it's<00:03:27.110> a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
hears me someone is counting me it's a

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260 
hears me someone is counting me it's a
it's<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.560> great<00:03:27.680> validation<00:03:28.160> at<00:03:28.610> least<00:03:28.790> that's

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
it's a great validation at least that's

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.240 
it's a great validation at least that's
what<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.540> think<00:03:29.690> what<00:03:30.290> do<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:30.680> think<00:03:31.040> what

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
what I think what do you think what

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.490 
what I think what do you think what
values<00:03:31.700> need<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.030> be<00:03:32.120> represented<00:03:32.330> in<00:03:32.780> Disney

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500
