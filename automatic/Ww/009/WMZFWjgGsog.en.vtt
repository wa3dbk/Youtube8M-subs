00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
opposed to a USB tablet so how does this

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.410 
opposed to a USB tablet so how does this
tablet<00:02:37.280> perform<00:02:37.550> that<00:02:37.640> actually<00:02:37.970> performs

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
tablet perform that actually performs

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.479 
tablet perform that actually performs
very<00:02:38.630> well<00:02:38.690> now<00:02:39.260> might<00:02:39.590> take<00:02:39.830> your<00:02:39.980> bit<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.280> get

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
very well now might take your bit to get

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.550 
very well now might take your bit to get
used<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.940> I'd<00:02:41.180> never<00:02:41.510> really<00:02:41.810> used<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.170> graphics

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
used to I'd never really used a graphics

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.949 
used to I'd never really used a graphics
tablet<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:43.250> puffin<00:02:43.610> just<00:02:43.850> playing<00:02:44.390> around<00:02:44.540> with

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
tablet a puffin just playing around with

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.790 
tablet a puffin just playing around with
one<00:02:45.730> but<00:02:46.730> this<00:02:47.269> is<00:02:47.480> actually<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:48.110> really<00:02:48.620> good

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
one but this is actually a really good

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.000 
one but this is actually a really good
tablet<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.640> they're<00:02:50.450> quite<00:02:50.690> easy<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.050> use<00:02:51.440> but

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
tablet and they're quite easy to use but

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.470 
tablet and they're quite easy to use but
as<00:02:52.100> I<00:02:52.250> said<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.580> might<00:02:52.760> take<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.090> bit<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.390> get

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
as I said it might take you a bit to get

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.530 
as I said it might take you a bit to get
used<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:54.310> one<00:02:55.310> thing<00:02:55.580> that<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.760> noticeable<00:02:56.330> is

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
used to one thing that is noticeable is

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.729 
used to one thing that is noticeable is
you<00:02:57.140> could<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:57.530> have<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.860> hover<00:02:58.360> your<00:02:59.470> the<00:03:00.470> pen

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
you could you have to hover your the pen

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.479 
you could you have to hover your the pen
over<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.519> tablet<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:03.230> within<00:03:03.829> like<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.190> few

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
over the tablet so within like a few

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.630 
over the tablet so within like a few
millimeters<00:03:05.239> like<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.579> opponents<00:03:07.579> are

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
millimeters like that opponents are

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.520 
millimeters like that opponents are
actually<00:03:07.910> touching<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:08.959> when<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.290> touch

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
actually touching it so when you touch

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.250 
actually touching it so when you touch
it<00:03:09.560> it's<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.700> equivalent<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.239> click<00:03:12.019> and

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
it it's the equivalent to a click and

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.319 
it it's the equivalent to a click and
you<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.829> double<00:03:13.250> tap<00:03:13.430> which<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.299> a

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
you can double tap which is a

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.690 
you can double tap which is a
right-click<00:03:14.630> or<00:03:15.079> you<00:03:15.890> can<00:03:16.070> hold<00:03:16.280> down<00:03:16.400> one<00:03:16.640> of

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
right-click or you can hold down one of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.039 
right-click or you can hold down one of
the<00:03:16.760> buttons<00:03:16.940> which<00:03:17.360> can<00:03:17.540> be<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> right<00:03:17.900> click

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
the buttons which can be a right click

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.009 
the buttons which can be a right click
to<00:03:18.170> these<00:03:19.160> two<00:03:19.370> buttons<00:03:19.579> are<00:03:19.970> configurable<00:03:20.660> to

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
to these two buttons are configurable to

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.060 
to these two buttons are configurable to
any<00:03:21.590> function<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.489> like<00:03:23.590> yeah<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:24.860> if

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
any function that you like yeah so if

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.920 
any function that you like yeah so if
you<00:03:25.250> just<00:03:25.459> want<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.790> move<00:03:26.030> your<00:03:26.299> mouse<00:03:26.900> around

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
you just want to move your mouse around

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.710 
you just want to move your mouse around
you<00:03:27.500> hover<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.950> like<00:03:28.100> that<00:03:28.220> but<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:29.510> is

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
you hover it like that but this is

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.930 
you hover it like that but this is
actually<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.260> equivalent<00:03:30.799> to<00:03:31.310> your<00:03:31.459> screen

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
actually the equivalent to your screen

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.289 
actually the equivalent to your screen
so<00:03:32.480> instead<00:03:32.959> of<00:03:33.019> having<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.739> kind<00:03:34.040> of<00:03:34.160> drag<00:03:35.060> it

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
so instead of having to kind of drag it

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.430 
so instead of having to kind of drag it
along<00:03:35.450> as<00:03:35.930> like<00:03:36.560> a<00:03:36.590> mouse<00:03:36.950> pad<00:03:37.930> so<00:03:38.930> that's<00:03:39.290> the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
along as like a mouse pad so that's the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.110 
along as like a mouse pad so that's the
top<00:03:39.739> right<00:03:39.980> hand<00:03:40.100> corner<00:03:40.220> of<00:03:40.519> your<00:03:40.640> display

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
top right hand corner of your display

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.460 
top right hand corner of your display
and<00:03:41.360> that's<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.690> bottom<00:03:41.810> left-hand<00:03:42.290> corner

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
and that's the bottom left-hand corner

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.520 
and that's the bottom left-hand corner
of<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.739> display<00:03:42.980> which<00:03:43.880> is<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:45.320> main<00:03:45.500> thing

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
of the display which is the main thing

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.289 
of the display which is the main thing
that's<00:03:45.980> hard<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.370> get<00:03:46.519> used<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:47.030> really

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
that's hard to get used to really

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.750 
that's hard to get used to really
because<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:47.870> need<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.049> learn<00:03:48.640> kind<00:03:49.640> of

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
because you need to learn kind of

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.720 
because you need to learn kind of
whereabouts<00:03:50.390> everything<00:03:51.049> is<00:03:51.320> so<00:03:51.829> it's<00:03:52.459> quite

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
whereabouts everything is so it's quite

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.850 
whereabouts everything is so it's quite
easy<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:53.150> operate<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.840> operating<00:03:54.380> system

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
easy to operate the operating system

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.310 
easy to operate the operating system
with<00:03:55.040> this<00:03:55.220> but<00:03:55.700> still<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.090> mouse<00:03:56.450> pad<00:03:56.989> or

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
with this but still a mouse pad or

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.780 
with this but still a mouse pad or
trackpad<00:03:57.650> or<00:03:57.829> wherever<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:58.220> want<00:03:58.370> school<00:03:58.579> or

just<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.780> normal<00:04:00.079> Mouse<00:04:00.380> is<00:04:00.650> much<00:04:01.010> easier<00:04:01.040> than

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
just a normal Mouse is much easier than

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.880 
just a normal Mouse is much easier than
using<00:04:02.180> this<00:04:02.450> but<00:04:02.780> when<00:04:03.019> you<00:04:03.140> come<00:04:03.320> to<00:04:03.560> graphic
