00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.200
 this was a nice for you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.040

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.439
 in london chelsea against manunited the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.480
 would have to be the second leg of the fa cup 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.480
 The game ended 22 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.030
 when you run 2 0 and then inside 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.930
 of less than ten minutes through gates of 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.760
 hazard and ramires still 2 2 cashed and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.720
 Chelsea then did that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.750
 back play in your own stadium secured 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.059
 performance at the blue 64 percent 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.970
 last 2 0 victory over city rivals west 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.000
 ham 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.220
 the europe league 3 1 against steaua 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.270
 Bucharest and get ahead 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.070
 secured as I said the hinspiel 2 2 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.080
 then the game against steaua single 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.059
 lost and as against west bromwich 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.440
 albion 1 0 won manunited 1 70% 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.070
 last 1 0 victory against redding 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.900
 That's why 2 2 plays against Real Madrid 2 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.120
 1 spot in the champions league and 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.390
 with it eliminated over norwich 40 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.690
 as well as the queens park rangers 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.810
 rangers 2 0 won the balance 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.440
 As far as the slight trend is concerned 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.050
 say to united I do not know 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.930
 18 7 united 16 draw 17 chelsea 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.229
 win the goalkeeper in this competition 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.690
 chicharito is best at uniteds four 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.180
 gates behind june with three and of 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.229
 Percy Nani and Giggs are here each 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.020
 with a gate 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.740
 at chelsea 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.579
 oskar moses ramirez demba ba and lampard 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.860
 each with two goals 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.979
 yes, I think both have injury 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.390
 not to complain 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.219
 I'm sure of that right now 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.219
 and looks so yet was quick to 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.390
 that's not the problem right now 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.360
 that we will not get it done 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.510
 would 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.950
 yes okay for jones still hurt but there 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.120
 would have to be fit again soon otherwise 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.540
 Paul Scholes 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.220
 because fletcher and took each injured 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.700
 But they are all on the way 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.200
 improvement 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.910
 except for the fletcher he has ne intest op 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.270
 there is still a lot going on behind it 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.800
 take time and at the 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.540
 chelsea players loriot romeo injured 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.690
 with a knee injury that will be 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.730
 It may take about until the beginning of May 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.090
 right back in training with him 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.090
 and up 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.380
 we come again to proceed to the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.870
 of the two clubs in the fourth round 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.110
 manchester 4 1 win against fc fulham 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.760
 So also a club from London then 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.430
 fifth round 2 1 win over redding against 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.950
 the chelsea players against rentfort in the 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.890
 first game 2 2 played and im 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.520
 return to the home stadium 4 0 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.970
 then won in the fifth round 2 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.730
 0 victory over middlesbrough and so on 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.360
 it is now in the quarter-final in the return leg 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.180
 after the 2 2 in the first game chelsea against 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:32.220
 manchester united what does mine look like 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.410
 I believe that united in the 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.790
 end effect of the squad 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.430
 From the squad you can not say more 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.320
 but from 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.170
 whole package is a little bit better and 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.080
 Therefore, I'm typing on a 1 0 victory of the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.760
 red but it's just because you can pokal 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.040
 happen much can be on that 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.820
 penalty shooting goes and yes it is 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.040
 just english 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.850
 let's see who then there in the end the 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.850
 nose in front
