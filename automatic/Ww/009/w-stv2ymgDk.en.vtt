00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
sorry off your stick now this once you

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.480 
sorry off your stick now this once you
start<00:00:28.170> doing<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.740> pretty<00:00:29.039> basic

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
start doing this it's pretty basic

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.730 
start doing this it's pretty basic
motion<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.050> really<00:00:31.230> start<00:00:31.560> working

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
motion you want to really start working

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.410 
motion you want to really start working
on<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.279> go<00:00:32.369> start<00:00:32.640> moving<00:00:32.850> faster<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.360> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
on it and go start moving faster so you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.490 
on it and go start moving faster so you
want<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.630> go<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.870> way<00:00:34.399> stop<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.910> way

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
want to go this way stop this way

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.180 
want to go this way stop this way
stop<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.950> way<00:00:38.899> stop<00:00:39.899> now<00:00:40.710> let's<00:00:40.950> put<00:00:41.100> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
stop this way stop now let's put that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.709 
stop this way stop now let's put that
into<00:00:41.399> motion<00:00:41.579> alright<00:00:42.270> let's<00:00:42.420> get<00:00:42.510> into

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
into motion alright let's get into

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.060 
into motion alright let's get into
movement<00:00:43.110> now<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> best<00:00:43.680> way<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.860> practice

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
movement now so the best way to practice

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.650 
movement now so the best way to practice
this<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.579> find<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.910> circle<00:00:45.300> or<00:00:45.450> make<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
this is to find a circle or make a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.510 
this is to find a circle or make a
circle<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.770> way<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.250> least<00:00:47.340> have

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
circle that way you can at least have

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.310 
circle that way you can at least have
little<00:00:47.820> bearings<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:48.870> start<00:00:49.079> by<00:00:49.200> going

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
little bearings so just start by going

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.930 
little bearings so just start by going
around<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> circle<00:00:49.829> normally<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.879> don't

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
around the circle normally you don't

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.119 
around the circle normally you don't
have<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> do<00:00:51.360> any<00:00:51.480> crossovers<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.170> see<00:00:52.379> just

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
have to do any crossovers you see just

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.619 
have to do any crossovers you see just
how<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.489> edges<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.090> working<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.539> you're

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
how your edges are working so you're

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.750 
how your edges are working so you're
going<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.930> you're<00:00:55.050> inside<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> outside<00:00:55.890> now

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
going on you're inside the outside now

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.889 
going on you're inside the outside now
you're<00:00:56.910> naturally<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.750> bring
