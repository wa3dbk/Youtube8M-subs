and once you clear through this area you
will<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.299> able<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:24.659> straight<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> final

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
will be able to go straight to the final

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.530 
will be able to go straight to the final
balls<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:26.580> thing<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> note<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.240> will

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
balls one thing to note is that you will

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.350 
balls one thing to note is that you will
need<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.110> overpower<00:01:28.770> three<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.640> higher

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
need to be on overpower three or higher

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.390 
need to be on overpower three or higher
to<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.780> able<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.920> are<00:01:31.950> not<00:01:32.220> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
to be able to do this if you are not it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.800 
to be able to do this if you are not it
simply<00:01:32.850> will<00:01:33.090> not<00:01:33.119> work<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:36.420> reason<00:01:36.570> this

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
simply will not work and the reason this

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.770 
simply will not work and the reason this
works<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.229> because<00:01:37.500> instead<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.689> turning<00:01:39.689> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
works is because instead of turning in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.469 
works is because instead of turning in
the<00:01:39.869> quest<00:01:40.200> being<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.920> trigger<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.610> is

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the quest being the trigger it is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.870 
the quest being the trigger it is
actually<00:01:45.799> killing<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> final<00:01:47.310> boss<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
actually killing the final boss is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.870 
actually killing the final boss is
actually<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.869> trigger<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:50.009> getting

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
actually what the trigger for getting

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.760 
actually what the trigger for getting
your<00:01:51.000> newest<00:01:51.390> overpower<00:01:51.899> level<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.500> can

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
your newest overpower level so you can

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370 
your newest overpower level so you can
