on<00:02:13.829> stage<00:02:14.099> switcher<00:02:14.459> it's<00:02:14.969> usually<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.299> good

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
on stage switcher it's usually a good

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.390 
on stage switcher it's usually a good
idea<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.750> read<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.019> readme<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:17.099> have<00:02:17.219> me

the purpose of this tutorial we can

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:57.379 
the purpose of this tutorial we can
replace<00:02:55.590> many<00:02:56.159> things<00:02:56.519> over<00:02:56.790> final

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
destination as we all know we can

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.860 
destination as we all know we can
replace<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.489> with<00:02:59.579> final<00:02:59.909> and<00:03:00.060> subspace

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
replace it with final and subspace

3d<00:03:11.370> stages<00:03:11.790> basically<00:03:12.389> everything<00:03:12.810> can<00:03:13.139> go

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
3d stages basically everything can go

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.949 
3d stages basically everything can go
over<00:03:13.409> final<00:03:13.829> destination<00:03:14.659> so<00:03:15.659> what<00:03:15.810> we're

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
over final destination so what we're

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.140 
over final destination so what we're
going<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.169> do<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.500> make<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.639> more<00:03:17.849> difficult

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
going to do is make a more difficult

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.559

the<00:03:45.689> dark<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.560> arielle<00:03:46.949> folder<00:03:47.310> will<00:03:47.459> be

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
the dark in the arielle folder will be

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.699 
the dark in the arielle folder will be
here<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.150> can<00:03:48.269> have<00:03:48.419> up<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.569> whatever<00:03:49.500> you

whole game in here so click on it and

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.020 
whole game in here so click on it and
they'll<00:03:54.389> ask<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.720> what<00:03:54.930> stage<00:03:55.199> is<00:03:55.439> this<00:03:55.769> file

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
they'll ask you what stage is this file

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.099 
they'll ask you what stage is this file
and<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.120> obviously<00:03:57.239> know<00:03:57.629> that's<00:03:57.659> final

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
and you obviously know that's final

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.349 
and you obviously know that's final
destination<00:03:58.819> again<00:03:59.819> you<00:03:59.939> can<00:03:59.970> do<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.209> for

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
destination again you can do this for

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.360 
destination again you can do this for
any<00:04:00.419> stage<00:04:00.780> but<00:04:01.650> what<00:04:01.799> we're<00:04:01.919> actually<00:04:02.069> doing

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
any stage but what we're actually doing

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.110 
any stage but what we're actually doing
is<00:04:02.669> making<00:04:02.939> this<00:04:03.659> arielle<00:04:04.290> someone<00:04:05.129> else's<00:04:05.459> so

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
is making this arielle someone else's so

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.409 
is making this arielle someone else's so
it's<00:04:06.329> always<00:04:06.569> a<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:07.879> can't<00:04:08.879> really<00:04:09.060> think<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.299> a

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
it's always a I can't really think of a

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.539 
it's always a I can't really think of a
reason<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:09.780> need<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.169> other<00:04:10.259> ones<00:04:10.560> for<00:04:11.430> this

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
reason you need the other ones for this

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.520 
reason you need the other ones for this
specific<00:04:11.790> purpose<00:04:12.780> of<00:04:12.989> replacing<00:04:13.769> files<00:04:14.430> over

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
specific purpose of replacing files over

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.439 
specific purpose of replacing files over
but<00:04:16.530> I'm<00:04:16.620> sure<00:04:16.769> there<00:04:16.949> will<00:04:16.979> be<00:04:17.070> other<00:04:17.280> reasons

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
but I'm sure there will be other reasons

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.439 
but I'm sure there will be other reasons
later<00:04:18.449> I'll<00:04:19.079> make<00:04:19.229> tutorials<00:04:19.470> on<00:04:19.769> those<00:04:20.449> so

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
later I'll make tutorials on those so

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.540 
later I'll make tutorials on those so
now<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.870> choose<00:04:22.229> what<00:04:22.740> stage<00:04:23.130> you<00:04:23.279> want<00:04:23.460> to

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
now you choose what stage you want to

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.850 
now you choose what stage you want to
replace<00:04:23.849> and<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.349> nice<00:04:25.349> thing<00:04:25.380> about<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.800> is

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
replace and the nice thing about this is

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.990 
replace and the nice thing about this is
it<00:04:26.159> doesn't<00:04:26.190> reset<00:04:26.729> every

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
it doesn't reset every

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.700 
it doesn't reset every
time<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.270> do<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.390> so<00:04:28.080> if<00:04:28.170> you<00:04:28.260> watch<00:04:28.410> we<00:04:28.590> can

final destination it could be
another<00:06:41.160> subspace<00:06:41.490> emissary<00:06:41.700> stage<00:06:42.270> it<00:06:42.810> can

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
another subspace emissary stage it can

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.210 
another subspace emissary stage it can
be<00:06:43.020> a<00:06:43.050> two<00:06:43.200> dimensional<00:06:43.590> stage<00:06:43.800> whatever<00:06:44.130> you

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
be a two dimensional stage whatever you

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.920 
be a two dimensional stage whatever you
want<00:06:44.370> just<00:06:44.580> rename<00:06:45.480> it<00:06:45.600> to<00:06:45.630> STG<00:06:46.290> donkey<00:06:47.930> enter

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
want just rename it to STG donkey enter

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.440 
want just rename it to STG donkey enter
right<00:06:49.920> click<00:06:50.190> drag<00:06:50.910> it<00:06:51.060> over<00:06:51.120> here<00:06:51.830> copy<00:06:52.830> here

copy<00:06:54.450> into<00:06:54.690> place<00:06:54.990> and<00:06:55.550> now<00:06:56.550> your<00:06:57.210> SSC<00:06:58.140> stage

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
copy into place and now your SSC stage

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.340 
copy into place and now your SSC stage
is<00:06:58.710> over<00:06:59.130> 75<00:06:59.730> meter<00:06:59.940> and<00:07:00.630> when<00:07:00.750> you<00:07:00.840> select<00:07:01.050> it

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350 
is over 75 meter and when you select it

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.110 
is over 75 meter and when you select it
in<00:07:01.560> game<00:07:01.800> you<00:07:02.400> will<00:07:02.520> actually<00:07:02.940> be<00:07:03.060> playing<00:07:03.360> on

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
in game you will actually be playing on

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.760 
in game you will actually be playing on
that<00:07:06.120> stage<00:07:06.960> that<00:07:07.140> you<00:07:07.260> replaced<00:07:07.590> it<00:07:07.740> with

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
that stage that you replaced it with

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.030 
that stage that you replaced it with
whatever<00:07:08.700> stage<00:07:09.030> that<00:07:09.270> may<00:07:09.420> be<00:07:09.480> as<00:07:10.010> always<00:07:11.010> I

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
whatever stage that may be as always I

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.070 
whatever stage that may be as always I
recommend<00:07:11.460> keeping<00:07:11.610> a<00:07:11.820> backup<00:07:12.150> I've<00:07:12.330> done<00:07:12.930> so

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
recommend keeping a backup I've done so

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.290 
recommend keeping a backup I've done so
here<00:07:13.290> with<00:07:13.440> every<00:07:13.650> stage<00:07:13.860> I've<00:07:14.010> replaced<00:07:14.370> with

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
here with every stage I've replaced with

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.770 
here with every stage I've replaced with
the<00:07:16.250> ethics<00:07:17.250> original<00:07:18.440> always<00:07:19.440> a<00:07:19.470> good<00:07:19.650> idea<00:07:19.710> I

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780 
the ethics original always a good idea I

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.090 
the ethics original always a good idea I
