head but when I'm saying it's not making
much<00:03:48.880> sense<00:03:48.910> anymore<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:50.800> looks<00:03:50.950> like

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
much sense anymore so it looks like

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.399 
really hard to distinguish between a
good<00:06:07.469> destiny<00:06:08.469> pulse<00:06:08.860> rifle<00:06:09.340> and<00:06:09.550> a<00:06:09.879> bad<00:06:10.150> one

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
good destiny pulse rifle and a bad one

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.930 
good destiny pulse rifle and a bad one
because<00:06:11.409> all<00:06:11.590> of<00:06:11.620> them<00:06:11.860> are<00:06:11.919> pretty<00:06:12.310> solid

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
because all of them are pretty solid

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.290 
because all of them are pretty solid
like<00:06:13.210> there's<00:06:13.900> not<00:06:14.139> I<00:06:14.529> don't<00:06:15.490> where<00:06:15.940> I<00:06:15.969> rarely

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
like there's not I don't where I rarely

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.450 
like there's not I don't where I rarely
ever<00:06:16.599> pick<00:06:16.870> up<00:06:16.990> a<00:06:17.169> pulse<00:06:17.680> my<00:06:17.830> phone<00:06:18.069> thing<00:06:18.310> oh

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
ever pick up a pulse my phone thing oh

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.329 
ever pick up a pulse my phone thing oh
my<00:06:18.759> god<00:06:18.909> this<00:06:19.150> gun<00:06:19.360> is<00:06:19.539> terrible<00:06:20.139> in<00:06:20.349> general

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:21.339 
my god this gun is terrible in general

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.820 
my god this gun is terrible in general
they<00:06:21.610> all<00:06:21.789> tend<00:06:22.150> to<00:06:22.300> be<00:06:22.449> pretty<00:06:22.900> solid<00:06:23.440> weapons

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
they all tend to be pretty solid weapons

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.059 
they all tend to be pretty solid weapons
so<00:06:24.400> the<00:06:24.699> all<00:06:24.819> fate<00:06:25.060> is<00:06:25.300> a<00:06:25.779> pretty<00:06:26.259> solid<00:06:26.560> weapon

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:27.069 
so the all fate is a pretty solid weapon

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:29.219 
so the all fate is a pretty solid weapon
and<00:06:27.279> if<00:06:27.370> you<00:06:27.580> are<00:06:27.909> incapable<00:06:28.419> of<00:06:28.719> getting<00:06:28.900> any

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
and if you are incapable of getting any

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:32.760 
and if you are incapable of getting any
of<00:06:29.319> the<00:06:29.529> other<00:06:30.210> pulse<00:06:31.210> rifles<00:06:31.690> then<00:06:32.409> it<00:06:32.529> may<00:06:32.710> be

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
of the other pulse rifles then it may be

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.640 
of the other pulse rifles then it may be
worth<00:06:33.129> picking<00:06:33.759> up<00:06:34.089> all<00:06:34.479> fate<00:06:34.839> switching<00:06:35.500> up

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
worth picking up all fate switching up

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.559 
worth picking up all fate switching up

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.450 
sure yeah so the 55 ball fate is a pulse
rifle<00:07:27.159> it<00:07:28.150> does<00:07:28.509> damage<00:07:28.889> pretty<00:07:29.889> reliable

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.460 
rifle it does damage pretty reliable

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.430 
rifle it does damage pretty reliable
damage<00:07:30.819> actually<00:07:31.389> at<00:07:31.539> least<00:07:31.750> I<00:07:31.870> got<00:07:31.990> a<00:07:32.050> split

shift<00:07:32.650> to<00:07:32.830> pro<00:07:33.009> this<00:07:33.219> is<00:07:33.400> a<00:07:33.430> this<00:07:33.940> is<00:07:34.000> a<00:07:34.120> moat

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:34.419 
shift to pro this is a this is a moat

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.209 
shift to pro this is a this is a moat
and<00:07:34.690> I<00:07:35.229> think<00:07:35.440> that<00:07:35.560> when<00:07:35.680> the<00:07:35.800> taken<00:07:36.069> King

00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:36.219 
and I think that when the taken King

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:38.459 
and I think that when the taken King
comes<00:07:36.490> out<00:07:36.729> the<00:07:37.419> fall<00:07:37.690> fates<00:07:37.930> gonna<00:07:38.080> be<00:07:38.289> pretty

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:38.469 
comes out the fall fates gonna be pretty

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:40.680 
comes out the fall fates gonna be pretty
good<00:07:38.740> i<00:07:38.919> think<00:07:38.949> the<00:07:39.340> messenger<00:07:39.789> and<00:07:40.180> pulse

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:40.690 
good i think the messenger and pulse

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.939 
good i think the messenger and pulse
rifles<00:07:41.020> like<00:07:41.110> that<00:07:41.319> are<00:07:41.530> gonna<00:07:41.620> still<00:07:41.919> be

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:41.949 
rifles like that are gonna still be

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:43.649 
rifles like that are gonna still be
strong<00:07:42.280> and<00:07:42.430> I<00:07:42.550> think<00:07:42.729> the<00:07:42.819> fast<00:07:43.060> firing<00:07:43.330> pulse

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:43.659 
strong and I think the fast firing pulse

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:45.390 
strong and I think the fast firing pulse
rifles<00:07:44.020> are<00:07:44.110> gonna<00:07:44.229> be<00:07:44.379> even<00:07:44.710> stronger<00:07:44.949> so

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 
rifles are gonna be even stronger so

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.070 
rifles are gonna be even stronger so
