and castra blocks this is definitely a a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.609 
and castra blocks this is definitely a a
weak<00:01:50.610> point<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> buggy<00:01:51.420> because<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:52.409> you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
weak point on the buggy because if you

weak point on the buggy because if you
land<00:01:53.390> wrong<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.649> lot<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.100> times

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
land wrong like I do a lot of the times

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.359 
land wrong like I do a lot of the times
you're<00:01:57.030> gonna<00:01:57.149> end<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:58.020> keep<00:01:58.320> hitting<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.130> this

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
you're gonna end up keep hitting on this

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.760 
you're gonna end up keep hitting on this
piece<00:01:59.700> right<00:01:59.880> here<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.380> breaking<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
piece right here and breaking the the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.590 
piece right here and breaking the the
plastic<00:02:01.979> pieces<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.759> came<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.149> about<00:02:03.420> you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
plastic pieces that came with about you

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.510 
plastic pieces that came with about you
so<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:04.409> will<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.770> fan<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> front

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
so this will just be fan up the front

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.249 
so this will just be fan up the front
the<00:02:05.729> front<00:02:05.850> clip<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.270> here

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the front clip up here

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.780 
the front clip up here
I<00:02:07.580> also<00:02:08.580> replaced<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.330> shock<00:02:09.750> tower<00:02:10.790> which

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
I also replaced the shock tower which

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.400 
I also replaced the shock tower which
actually<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.959> little<00:02:13.230> bit

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
actually is a little bit

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.710 
actually is a little bit
thinner<00:02:13.560> than<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.550> stock<00:02:14.910> one<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.510> comes

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
thinner than the stock one and it comes

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.470 
thinner than the stock one and it comes
with<00:02:15.960> these<00:02:16.080> little<00:02:16.670> spacers<00:02:17.670> right<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.180> here

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
with these little spacers right in here

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.430 
with these little spacers right in here
to<00:02:18.720> take<00:02:19.350> up<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.740> difference<00:02:20.700> in<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.240> size

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
to take up the difference in this size

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.740 
to take up the difference in this size
they<00:02:22.440> went<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.770> with<00:02:22.950> all<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.190> stock<00:02:23.430> hardware

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
they went on with all the stock hardware

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.240 
they went on with all the stock hardware
no<00:02:24.750> additional<00:02:25.110> hardware<00:02:25.170> was<00:02:25.680> needed<00:02:26.010> at<00:02:26.130> all

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
no additional hardware was needed at all

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.880 
no additional hardware was needed at all
for<00:02:26.520> these<00:02:26.660> same<00:02:27.660> thing<00:02:27.840> for<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.380> caster

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
for these same thing for the the caster

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.960 
for these same thing for the the caster
blocks<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.280> steering<00:02:29.490> knuckle<00:02:29.520> no

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
blocks and the steering knuckle no

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.280 
blocks and the steering knuckle no
additional<00:02:30.300> hardware<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.930> hardware

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
additional hardware just the hardware

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.600 
additional hardware just the hardware
that<00:02:31.350> comes<00:02:31.620> with<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.860> kit<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:34.490> really<00:02:35.490> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that comes with the kit the really the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.970 
that comes with the kit the really the
only<00:02:35.820> added<00:02:36.600> thing<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.440> added<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.890> this

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
only added thing that I added to this

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.070 
only added thing that I added to this
thing<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.460> I<00:02:38.670> probably<00:02:39.390> didn't<00:02:39.630> need<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.780> is

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
thing that I probably didn't need to is

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.020 
thing that I probably didn't need to is
I<00:02:40.170> added<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.710> skid<00:02:40.950> plates<00:02:41.250> there's<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
I added the skid plates there's the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.560 
I added the skid plates there's the
front<00:02:42.300> one<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:43.170> some<00:02:43.680> machined<00:02:44.010> aluminum

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
front one just some machined aluminum

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.940 
front one just some machined aluminum
looks<00:02:45.570> really<00:02:45.870> nice<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.410> kind<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.710> matches

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
looks really nice and kind of matches

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.770 
looks really nice and kind of matches
all<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> other<00:02:47.310> parts<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.820> then<00:02:48.450> here's<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
all the other parts and then here's the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.770 
all the other parts and then here's the
rear<00:02:49.050> one<00:02:49.260> as<00:02:49.290> well<00:02:50.270> really<00:02:51.270> really<00:02:51.330> nice

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
rear one as well really really nice

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.090 
rear one as well really really nice
quality<00:02:52.820> CNC<00:02:53.820> machined<00:02:54.320> aluminum<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:55.560> not

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
quality CNC machined aluminum so not

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.830 
quality CNC machined aluminum so not
much<00:02:56.250> thicker<00:02:56.520> than<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.910> stock<00:02:57.300> ones<00:02:57.540> but

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
much thicker than the stock ones but

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.010 
much thicker than the stock ones but
definitely<00:02:58.650> worth<00:02:59.060> the<00:03:00.060> added<00:03:00.330> little<00:03:00.810> I

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
definitely worth the added little I

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.430 
definitely worth the added little I
guess<00:03:01.950> bling<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.640> car<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:04.080> next<00:03:04.290> thing

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
guess bling to the car so the next thing

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.160 
guess bling to the car so the next thing
is<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.740> front<00:03:05.010> chassis<00:03:05.340> brace<00:03:05.900> my<00:03:06.900> thoughts

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
is the front chassis brace my thoughts

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.110 
is the front chassis brace my thoughts
are<00:03:07.350> is<00:03:07.500> whenever<00:03:07.710> you<00:03:07.950> have<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.190> aluminum

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
are is whenever you have a aluminum

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.590 
are is whenever you have a aluminum
chassis

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
chassis

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.990 
chassis
you<00:03:10.440> shouldn't<00:03:10.770> have<00:03:10.830> plastic<00:03:11.430> supporting<00:03:11.910> at

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
you shouldn't have plastic supporting at

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.390 
you shouldn't have plastic supporting at
all<00:03:12.410> so<00:03:13.410> this<00:03:13.560> one<00:03:13.740> comes<00:03:13.890> with<00:03:14.100> this<00:03:14.220> nice

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
all so this one comes with this nice

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.030 
all so this one comes with this nice
little<00:03:14.460> carbon-fiber<00:03:15.150> plate<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:16.650> did<00:03:16.830> come

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
little carbon-fiber plate it did come

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.830 
little carbon-fiber plate it did come
with<00:03:17.130> all<00:03:17.340> new<00:03:17.459> hardware<00:03:17.850> with<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.480> some

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
with all new hardware with this and some

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.460 
with all new hardware with this and some
pretty<00:03:19.620> explicit<00:03:20.220> instructions<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.270> be<00:03:21.959> aware

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
pretty explicit instructions so be aware

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.100 
pretty explicit instructions so be aware
of<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:24.180> then<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.420> does<00:03:24.600> come<00:03:24.810> with<00:03:24.840> this

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
of that and then it does come with this

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.500 
of that and then it does come with this
nice<00:03:25.980> little<00:03:26.010> small<00:03:28.910> aluminum<00:03:29.910> chassis<00:03:30.150> place

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
nice little small aluminum chassis place

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.060 
nice little small aluminum chassis place
so<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.810> just<00:03:30.959> kind<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.170> bolts<00:03:31.410> up<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:31.740> with

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
so it just kind of bolts up to this with

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.540 
so it just kind of bolts up to this with
some<00:03:32.600> hardware<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.870> goes<00:03:34.340> straight<00:03:35.340> through

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
some hardware that goes straight through

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.120 
some hardware that goes straight through
and<00:03:36.090> then<00:03:36.150> some<00:03:37.110> lock<00:03:37.560> nuts<00:03:37.830> on<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.010> bottom

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
and then some lock nuts on the bottom

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.800 
and then some lock nuts on the bottom
and<00:03:38.430> then<00:03:38.820> all<00:03:38.940> new<00:03:39.060> hardware<00:03:39.450> it's<00:03:39.630> just

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
and then all new hardware it's just

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.300 
and then all new hardware it's just
different<00:03:40.020> lengths<00:03:40.500> because<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.950> plastic

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
different lengths because the plastic

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.250 
different lengths because the plastic
one<00:03:41.490> is<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.640> little<00:03:41.850> bit<00:03:41.940> thicker<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.420> these

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
one is a little bit thicker so these

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.660 
one is a little bit thicker so these
these<00:03:43.590> screws<00:03:43.890> are<00:03:44.070> just<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.340> little<00:03:44.459> bit

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
these screws are just a little bit

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.290 
these screws are just a little bit
thinner<00:03:44.940> or<00:03:45.209> I'm<00:03:45.989> sorry<00:03:46.290> shorter<00:03:47.180> other<00:03:48.180> than

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
thinner or I'm sorry shorter other than

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.030 
thinner or I'm sorry shorter other than
that<00:03:48.390> they're<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.810> rear<00:03:49.020> section<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.950> I've

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
that they're the rear section and I've

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.440 
that they're the rear section and I've
left<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.340> motor<00:03:50.520> plate<00:03:50.730> off<00:03:50.880> for<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.090> guys<00:03:51.239> so

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
left the motor plate off for you guys so

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.720 
left the motor plate off for you guys so
you<00:03:51.480> can<00:03:51.600> see<00:03:51.720> everything<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:53.310> rear<00:03:53.489> camber

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
you can see everything the rear camber

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.140 
you can see everything the rear camber
plate<00:03:54.620> which<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.980> kind<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.459> consider<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.000> rear

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
plate which I kind of consider the rear

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.050 
plate which I kind of consider the rear
shock<00:03:57.360> tower<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:58.500> did<00:03:59.220> purchase<00:03:59.700> that<00:03:59.940> in

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
shock tower I did purchase that in

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.750 
shock tower I did purchase that in
aluminum<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.600> probably<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.020> overkill<00:04:01.500> but<00:04:01.760> you

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
aluminum it probably is overkill but you

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.220 
aluminum it probably is overkill but you

know I just wanted to complete out this
set<00:04:04.470> um<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:05.250> don't<00:04:05.489> think<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.790> added<00:04:06.060> too<00:04:06.300> much

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
set um I don't think it added too much

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.510 
set um I don't think it added too much
weight<00:04:06.690> there<00:04:06.870> at<00:04:06.989> all<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.380> then<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.100> the

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
weight there at all and then the the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.810 
weight there at all and then the the
rear<00:04:08.700> chassis<00:04:09.950> brace<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.280> you'll<00:04:11.459> see<00:04:11.670> that

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
rear chassis brace and you'll see that

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.250 
rear chassis brace and you'll see that
one<00:04:12.000> right<00:04:12.239> in<00:04:12.300> there<00:04:12.450> uses<00:04:12.780> all<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.050> stock

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
one right in there uses all the stock

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.979 
one right in there uses all the stock
hardware<00:04:13.500> however<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.640> does<00:04:14.820> give<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.239> fine

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989
