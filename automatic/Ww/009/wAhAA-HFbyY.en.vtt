superheroes Batgirl this is the
all-black<00:00:21.320> version<00:00:22.040> I<00:00:22.160> believe<00:00:22.610> it's

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
all-black version I believe it's

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.660 
all-black version I believe it's
Cassandra<00:00:23.300> Cain<00:00:23.750> under<00:00:24.200> there<00:00:24.470> and<00:00:25.009> I<00:00:25.490> didn't

break<00:01:32.660> up<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.020> all-black<00:01:33.440> so<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:33.890> looks

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
break up the all-black so that looks

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.670 
break up the all-black so that looks
good<00:01:34.400> she's<00:01:34.910> got<00:01:35.060> super<00:01:35.540> oversized<00:01:36.170> pouches

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
good she's got super oversized pouches

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.260 
good she's got super oversized pouches
and<00:01:36.860> belt<00:01:37.010> buckle<00:01:37.400> but<00:01:37.580> that<00:01:37.760> looks<00:01:38.000> pretty

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
and belt buckle but that looks pretty

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.000 
and belt buckle but that looks pretty
good<00:01:38.390> there's<00:01:38.750> some<00:01:38.810> shading<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.530> they

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
good there's some shading and they

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.649 
good there's some shading and they
painted<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.460> buckles<00:01:40.850> on<00:01:41.000> there<00:01:41.270> or<00:01:41.480> the

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
painted the buckles on there or the

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.570 
painted the buckles on there or the
buttons<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:42.140> guess<00:01:42.320> I<00:01:42.470> should<00:01:42.620> say<00:01:42.830> although<00:01:43.550> I

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
buttons I guess I should say although I

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.340 
buttons I guess I should say although I
just<00:01:43.880> realized<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.630> whole<00:01:44.870> belt<00:01:45.140> is

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
just realized that the whole belt is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.830 
just realized that the whole belt is
bronze<00:01:45.800> instead<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.340> just<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.760> buckle<00:01:47.120> so<00:01:47.810> I

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
bronze instead of just the buckle so I

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.180 
bronze instead of just the buckle so I
don't<00:01:48.080> think<00:01:48.290> that's<00:01:48.470> accurate<00:01:48.680> if<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.070> is

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
don't think that's accurate if it is

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.710 
don't think that's accurate if it is
that's<00:01:49.460> good<00:01:49.700> if<00:01:49.880> not<00:01:49.940> then<00:01:50.270> it's<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.480> little

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
that's good if not then it's a little

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.810 
that's good if not then it's a little
bad<00:01:50.870> but<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.440> didn't<00:01:52.100> even<00:01:52.220> notice<00:01:52.370> it<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:52.760> I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
bad but I didn't even notice it so I

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.490 
bad but I didn't even notice it so I
guess<00:01:52.970> it's<00:01:53.150> not<00:01:53.240> horrible

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
guess it's not horrible

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.140 
guess it's not horrible
we<00:01:54.830> have<00:01:54.920> more<00:01:55.100> of<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.340> silver<00:01:55.670> lines<00:01:55.880> going

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
we have more of the silver lines going

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.840 
we have more of the silver lines going
here<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.540> break<00:01:56.720> up<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.290> thigh<00:01:58.250> swivel<00:01:58.640> so

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
here to break up the thigh swivel so

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.040 
here to break up the thigh swivel so
that's<00:01:59.000> pretty<00:01:59.210> nice<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.600> they're<00:01:59.720> painted

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
that's pretty nice and they're painted

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.020 
that's pretty nice and they're painted
well<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:00.590> that's<00:02:00.800> good<00:02:01.040> then<00:02:01.520> we<00:02:01.700> have<00:02:01.850> these

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
well so that's good then we have these

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.050 
well so that's good then we have these
really<00:02:02.390> nicely<00:02:02.990> sculpted<00:02:03.050> bat<00:02:03.860> boots<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:05.000> can

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
really nicely sculpted bat boots you can

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.940 
really nicely sculpted bat boots you can
see<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.420> stitching<00:02:05.840> throughout<00:02:06.290> it's<00:02:06.890> a

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
see the stitching throughout it's a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.229 
see the stitching throughout it's a
shame<00:02:07.220> there's<00:02:07.460> not<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.640> little<00:02:07.970> bit<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
shame there's not a little bit of a

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.089 
shame there's not a little bit of a
variation<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.229> finish<00:02:09.619> on<00:02:09.769> the<00:02:09.890> black

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
variation in the finish on the black

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.890 
variation in the finish on the black
like<00:02:10.310> maybe<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.610> little<00:02:10.700> bit<00:02:10.879> of<00:02:10.970> gloss<00:02:11.150> but

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
like maybe a little bit of gloss but

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.110 
like maybe a little bit of gloss but
they<00:02:12.080> still<00:02:12.349> look<00:02:12.560> really<00:02:13.310> really<00:02:13.700> well<00:02:13.849> done

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
they still look really really well done

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.990 
they still look really really well done
tons<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.659> detail<00:02:15.080> in<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.440> sculpt<00:02:16.000> really

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
tons of detail in that sculpt really

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.449 
tons of detail in that sculpt really
can't<00:02:17.209> ask<00:02:17.330> for<00:02:17.599> too<00:02:17.720> much<00:02:17.750> more<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.159> as<00:02:19.250> far<00:02:19.400> as

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
can't ask for too much more so as far as

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.059 
can't ask for too much more so as far as
articulation<00:02:20.120> goes<00:02:20.300> almost<00:02:21.260> no<00:02:21.500> up-and-down

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.740 
articulation goes almost no up-and-down
really<00:02:22.459> at<00:02:22.550> all<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:23.000> do<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.540> full

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
really at all we do have the full

really at all we do have the full
rotation

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
rotation

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.369 
rotation
and<00:02:24.459> can't<00:02:25.360> really<00:02:25.599> lean<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.959> either<00:02:26.140> from

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
and can't really lean it either from

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.780 
and can't really lean it either from
side<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.590> side<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.159> could<00:02:27.310> definitely<00:02:27.459> be

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
side to side so that could definitely be

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.580 
side to side so that could definitely be
better<00:02:28.000> what<00:02:28.599> are<00:02:28.659> you<00:02:28.720> gonna<00:02:28.810> do

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
better what are you gonna do

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.259 
better what are you gonna do

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
me about 90 degrees you do get a wrist

swivel at the glove ab crunch leans back
a<00:02:39.879> little<00:02:40.120> bit<00:02:40.299> doesn't<00:02:40.569> lean<00:02:40.840> forward<00:02:41.290> so

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
a little bit doesn't lean forward so

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.910 
a little bit doesn't lean forward so
that's<00:02:41.560> disappointing<00:02:42.129> waist<00:02:43.000> swivel<00:02:43.920> you

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
that's disappointing waist swivel you

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.710 
that's disappointing waist swivel you
can<00:02:45.069> technically<00:02:45.459> move<00:02:45.730> either<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.329> top<00:02:46.510> over

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
can technically move either the top over

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.300 
can technically move either the top over
the<00:02:46.840> bottom<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.290> belt<00:02:47.470> can<00:02:47.650> move<00:02:47.920> with<00:02:48.159> either

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
the bottom the belt can move with either

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.680 
the bottom the belt can move with either
one<00:02:48.610> because<00:02:48.700> it's<00:02:48.909> a<00:02:49.000> separate<00:02:49.329> piece<00:02:49.480> so

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
one because it's a separate piece so

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.470 
one because it's a separate piece so
that's<00:02:49.870> good<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.590> hips<00:02:50.829> are<00:02:51.760> pretty<00:02:52.030> standard

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
that's good the hips are pretty standard

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.660 
that's good the hips are pretty standard
for<00:02:52.629> DC<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.049> see<00:02:53.260> style<00:02:53.470> figures<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.459> belt

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
for DC you see style figures the belt

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.190 
for DC you see style figures the belt
gets<00:02:54.879> in<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.120> way<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.239> little<00:02:55.510> bit<00:02:55.659> and<00:02:55.810> but<00:02:56.049> not

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
gets in the way a little bit and but not

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.680 
gets in the way a little bit and but not
a<00:02:56.230> whole<00:02:56.500> lot<00:02:56.709> so<00:02:56.920> that's<00:02:57.099> okay<00:02:57.400> with<00:02:57.579> me<00:02:57.760> again

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
a whole lot so that's okay with me again

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.509 
a whole lot so that's okay with me again
if<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:59.079> swivel<00:02:59.500> right<00:02:59.650> there<00:02:59.859> hidden<00:03:00.069> by<00:03:00.310> those

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
if I swivel right there hidden by those

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.910 
if I swivel right there hidden by those
paint<00:03:00.849> lines<00:03:01.090> single<00:03:01.870> jointed<00:03:02.140> knee<00:03:02.319> give<00:03:02.799> you

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
paint lines single jointed knee give you

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.710 
paint lines single jointed knee give you
a<00:03:02.980> little<00:03:03.280> bit<00:03:03.400> better<00:03:03.549> than<00:03:03.819> 90<00:03:04.120> degrees<00:03:04.480> so

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
a little bit better than 90 degrees so

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.300 
a little bit better than 90 degrees so
posing<00:03:05.260> shouldn't<00:03:05.560> be<00:03:05.650> an<00:03:05.769> option

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
posing shouldn't be an option

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.720 
posing shouldn't be an option
ankle<00:03:07.299> hinge<00:03:07.510> decent<00:03:08.410> not<00:03:08.829> great<00:03:09.159> but<00:03:09.519> not<00:03:09.579> bad

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
ankle hinge decent not great but not bad

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.880 
ankle hinge decent not great but not bad
so<00:03:10.150> that's<00:03:10.269> alright<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.290> then<00:03:11.440> technically

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
so that's alright and then technically

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.250 
so that's alright and then technically
there's<00:03:12.159> a<00:03:12.220> little<00:03:12.579> bit<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.879> an<00:03:13.269> ankle<00:03:13.840> rocker

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
there's a little bit of an ankle rocker

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.990 
there's a little bit of an ankle rocker
so<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.709> can<00:03:14.829> definitely<00:03:15.129> get<00:03:15.430> some<00:03:15.609> posing

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
so you can definitely get some posing

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.550 
so you can definitely get some posing
out<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:16.390> figure<00:03:16.720> this<00:03:17.140> doesn't<00:03:17.440> have<00:03:17.530> the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
out of this figure this doesn't have the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.430 
out of this figure this doesn't have the
greatest<00:03:17.799> range<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.549> motion<00:03:18.909> but<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.299> would<00:03:20.260> say

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
greatest range of motion but I would say

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.690 
greatest range of motion but I would say
it's<00:03:20.560> good<00:03:20.739> enough<00:03:20.950> so<00:03:21.159> I'm<00:03:21.220> going<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.430> pose

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
it's good enough so I'm going to pose

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.220
