00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.169
 emp 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.739
 I don't know what will happen to me 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.089
 I believe that they are afraid of something 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.660
 what they have 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.170
 fear of constant mobilization 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.920
 I believe they are afraid of the waking state 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.400
 of citizens 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.040
 more citizens 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.980
 possible 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.980
 and then it came to me naturally 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.530
 choose for this reading a song that many 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.090
 probably they will know but I have to say whenever I happen to 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.110
 reread it I get excited the same way before reading or pro I want 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.630
 say again 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.489
 two words 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.160
 this law 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.090
 get a twofold result so how can I say insightful coordinate 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.500
 convergent 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 disruption of available investigative tools 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 the judicial police and magistrates 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.350
 devastation of control 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.390
 of public opinion through free information on the exercise of powers 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.310
 regardless of the fact 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.880
 which this exercise involves as nooo 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.710
 the commission of crimes 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.970
 I only remember 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.560
 that these two points are the qualifying parties of a document that has become 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.270
 rather famous thirty years ago 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.780
 keyra the document drafted by the venerable maestro licio gelli as a program 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.550
 of the propaganda lodge 2 which included top officials 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.220
 go find the relationship anselmi on the internet or anything else 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.340
 of the current government 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.850
 and the majority 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.039
 but I believe that what we are by law is relevant is very relevant 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.109
 and may it be blessed to steal it 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:16.430
 manuscript of Gramsci published in 1917 number cunico beautiful future city 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.729
 the socialist youth newspaper is not beautiful that fiji we have a 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:20.949
 newspaper like that 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.579
 in the 70s you too a 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.089
 very beautiful evocation of a future city other than that 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.089
 in which metaphorically the cycle does not see now 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.119
 i hate the indifferent 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.959
 I believe how federico is because living means being partisan 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.640
 only men cannot exist 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.809
 strangers to the city 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:47.089
 those who truly live cannot but be citizens to side with 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.569
 indifference is abulia, 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.569
 idyllic rihanna parasitism is not life 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.569
 i hate the indifferent 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.379
 indifference is the dead weight of history 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.749
 and the lead ball for innovator the inert matter in which they often drown 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.659
 the most brilliant enthusiasm 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:05.969
 and the swamp 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.079
 that surrounds the old city 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.189
 and he defends it better than the strongest walls better than the sins of his own 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.609
 warriors because they swallow mercy of moves 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:15.819
 the assailants 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.129
 he tithes I finish now 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.129
 sometimes it makes me desist from the enterprise 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.359
 indifference operates powerfully in history 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.419
 passively known work 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:27.799
 the fatality 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.290
 and what cannot be counted on what upsets the programs that it reverses 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.059
 Viviani better constructed and brute matter 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.029
 that intelligence rebels 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.039
 the throttle 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.279
 what happens to the evil that comes down on everyone 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:45.509
 it is not so much due to the initiative of the few who operate as much 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.989
 to indifference to the absenteeism of the dead 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.529
 what happens does not happen so much because some want it to happen 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:55.709
 as because the mass of men applies his will 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:57.559
 let it be 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:01.149
 let the troops tear which only the sword can cut 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.599
 let the laws be communicated 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.179
 which then only the revolt to repeal 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.549
 lets men come to power, but only mutiny can 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:11.939
 pour over 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.250
 the fatality that seems to dominate history is nothing else. that appearance 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.260
 illusory of this indifference and absenteeism 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.139
 in fact, a few hands mature in the shade, not only did he have any control over them 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.259
 they weave the fabric of collective life 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:27.779
 blade signboard 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.969
 because he doesn't care 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.879
 the destinies of an age are manipulated according to the missions respect of the 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.360
 immediate goals of the ambitions and personal passions of small groups 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.360
 active and the mass of men now because they don't care 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.400
 but the facts that have matured come to annoy but the web woven in the shadows 

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.139
 comes to fruition 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.539
 and then it seems to be the fatality that overwhelms everything and everyone seems to 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.400
 history has only one enormous natural phenomenon 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.830
 an emotion an earthquake of which everyone is the victim 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.210
 who wanted and who did not want 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.449
 who knew who didn't know 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.229
 who had been active and who was indifferent 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.229
 and the latter gets irritated he would like to avoid the consequences 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.540
 he would like to make it clear that he did not want to 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.680
 he is not responsible 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.270
 some whining pitifully others we blaspheme obscene mind but no one I have 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.059
 few wonder 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:22.839
 if I had done my duty myself 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.009
 if I had tried to enforce my will my advice would be 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.289
 what happened happened 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.289
 but nobody or a few blames themselves for their indifference 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.130
 of the gold skepticism for not having given their arm and their business those 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.559
 groups of citizens 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:40.379
 which precisely to avoid that sea fights 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.839
 i provide that much good is proposed 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:47.229
 the more of them, on the other hand, prefer to talk about accomplished events 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:48.639
 ideal failures 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.320
 of programs that have finally collapsed, likewise the pleasures begin again 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.909
 thus their absence from any responsibility 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.169
 eat that you don't see 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:57.669
 clear in things 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.210
 and that sometimes we are not able to envisage beautiful solutions of the 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.520
 more urgent problems 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.650
 I have of those who also request preparation time will be 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.969
 however equally urgent 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.399
 but this solution remains in this contribution to the collective life 

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:14.610
 it is not animated by any moral light 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.219
 product of curiosity 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.960
 not a pungent sense of historical responsibility 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.559
 who wants everyone active in life 

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:24.949
 that does not admit agnosticism 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.949
 indifference 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.589
 the indifferent 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:33.900
 also because their whining of eternal nut gives me trouble 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.430
 I ask how much each of them has done the task that life has 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.850
 affixed he poses 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.599
 daily basis 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.599
 of what he did especially 18 that he didn't 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:47.460
 and I feel I can be inexorable, 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.680
 to not have to waste my world pity is to share mine with them 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.740
 tears 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.569
 I am a partisan 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:58.179
 I feel already in the consciousness of my part ponza relativity of the city 

00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:02.499
 future that my part is building vinessa the social chain 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:04.270
 does not weigh on a few 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.750
 graft everything that happens is not due to chance the fatality but 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.469
 intelligent work of the citizens 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:12.330
 there is no one in them 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.319
 look at the window while the few sacrifice their system in the 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:17.729
 sacrifice 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.610
 and those who are at the window lurking want to take advantage of the little good that 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.819
 the activity of a few prosecutors vent their disappointment of protecting sacrificed 

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:26.809
 lost was born 

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:29.809
 because he failed in his intent 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:33.210
 I am a partisan 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.050
 therefore I hate those who do not support 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.749
 I hate the indifferent thanks to everyone
