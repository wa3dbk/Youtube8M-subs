00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:30.120
 the place before for me is an agile fun 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.099
 model in trainer look over too 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.050
 Behavior is very good natured with 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.340
 solid elevator, you can do that 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.740
 Still controlling the model well 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.510
 it is enough to just a gas shock and 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.570
 The engine pulls the hard foam plane 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 sovereign sky in rome area 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.470
 already installed all the servus 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.150
 they are fast strong and fast 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.610
 Brushless out-runner is enough 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:59.730
 however, vertical lift flights are required 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:02.280
 not up to the standard limit 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.320
 aerobatics figures such as roll back flight 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.400
 or turn are a child game and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.400
 succeed very easily 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.870
 that too is the low takeoff weight 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.410
 and a strong drive make it 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.870
 possible 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.360
 which are at the steering of the tiller 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.100
 thoughtful and robust with a flap 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.890
 on the bottom of the hull is the battery bay 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.930
 accessible to the eleven times 8 inch propeller 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.490
 is very well matched to the drive 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.440
 slow close maneuvers near the ground 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.440
 already require a little skill 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.240
 by therefore symmetrical profile lies 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.240
 the jva in the back flight extremely neutral 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.220
 even with relatively strong william wind 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.869
 you can still fly well with the model 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.700
 At first glance, he dares 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.530
 trainer- like airplane not at all 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.570
 but also knife flight succeed 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:13.120
 playful by the relative 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.520
 focuses arranged wheels tends 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.290
 the place before like to head was what I was 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.580
 usually only by energetic elevator 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.580
 prevent use
