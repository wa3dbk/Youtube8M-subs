00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.279
 now we are all in one in my 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.580
 channel and had a lot without recording 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.710
 but this time what I want to bring you 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.660
 are the games were the ones I play and 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.049
 I think there are a lot of people that 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.049
 Question 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:24.700
 then are the ene efe sg fra 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:26.860
 minecraft survival game the game of 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.689
 hungry but really this is called and 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.750
 survival game so it can not break 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.640
 blocks for difference 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.460
 so here we have in the servers 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.500
 the official page 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.560
 I 'm going to leave the page of the 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.990
 servers in the description 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.020
 in trace on the servers and here 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.580
 would put in Europe the rest of servers 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.890
 You can also enter but maybe you 're going 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.490
 a little more tilted then to play 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.990
 in ones that scratch fairly well 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.520
 enter those of Europe in which 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.180
 it will surely be very very well from 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.480
 software enough times 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.610
 and what you have to do is phenomenal 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.820
 it is here you see that these are contrasting 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.290
 you have three sentences this is with life 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.790
 some callo flain good then in those of 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.520
 lobbies are where you would have to 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.220
 I recommend that you look for 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.840
 those that there are very few people or if not to 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.130
 Sometimes you can enter the three starting 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.360
 because just the one who is 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.170
 repositioning things and so on 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.630
 is when you start enter in that is going to 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.120
 wait until you can enter 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.910
 many times and you will be on your own 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.480
 because they come in premium and that 's a game 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.600
 A lot is worth it a lot of times I do not know if 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.590
 I recommend against the premium that with 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.810
 this page I do not have any relation 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.760
 but if you buy premium it is assumed that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.110
 It's like you give directly to 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.750
 others you will have a preference of 2 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.130
 then the bar I will enter with friends 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.030
 and you're going to have a little raw boss 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.560
 because success is filled right away and 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.420
 Well, nothing just to tell you that 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.830
 tell you that I do not know if I'm going to go up 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.640
 many videos until summer in summer 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.649
 as I bought already well and I hope that I have 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.330
 served this information so we 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.570
 We see you next video and I hope it 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.570
 nothing
