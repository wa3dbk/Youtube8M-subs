this<00:00:30.849> achievement<00:00:31.210> is<00:00:31.420> more<00:00:31.630> about<00:00:31.779> timing

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
this achievement is more about timing

as<00:00:40.660> well<00:00:40.840> however<00:00:41.370> phase<00:00:42.370> one<00:00:42.610> is<00:00:42.790> all<00:00:42.940> about

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
as well however phase one is all about

as well however phase one is all about
spark<00:00:43.540> control<00:00:43.930> you<00:00:44.470> need<00:00:44.620> to<00:00:44.769> hold<00:00:44.890> three

sparks<00:00:45.550> in<00:00:45.670> place<00:00:45.879> somehow<00:00:46.150> the<00:00:46.750> easiest<00:00:47.170> way

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
sparks in place somehow the easiest way

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.369 
sparks in place somehow the easiest way
is<00:00:47.500> with<00:00:47.620> three<00:00:47.890> druids<00:00:48.449> bring<00:00:49.449> two<00:00:49.690> decays<00:00:50.110> so

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
is with three druids bring two decays so

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.840 
is with three druids bring two decays so
they<00:00:50.500> can<00:00:50.680> coordinate<00:00:51.040> chain<00:00:51.370> gripping<00:00:51.760> a

a rotation ahead of time so they know
