00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.700
 say mexico 4 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:23.939
 also say the brand plays for the first 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:25.560
 again his theory shoots 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:45.840
 nice minute why we bring 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:49.710
 actually only in frame if it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.870
 I stood on the second day too hey you 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.309
 I'm constantly saying I was in the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.079
 Display would have been comfortable at the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.399
 tag returns vibram and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.170
 suddenly you are friend kate major 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.439
 andreas sidon ramon to play I say there 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.780
 only 30 seconds have no time kainz 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.740
 and can look for weapons 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.360
 and yes that makes me a lot of fun my 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.470
 favorite 30 seconds after that is always 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.470
 a little bit that they are not big 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.799
 drum is in the terminal with cocaine too 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.799
 Throw away weapons 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.150
 I'm in the East and I'm mine 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.440
 together with slabs the helper got 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.910
 not seen what to do 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.430
 yes he laughs already should I believe is 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.620
 every trader hello times to that too 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.760
 completely completely unknown, however 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.460
 if you is already distributed thee 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:58.310
 I think so in rastede I think 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.350
 Also that you know how to watch 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.740
 many players are that is only one 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.110
 strater brandl we are both connecting 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.310
 okay then the ear with what if 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.520
 We now guiltily butcher 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.500
 get power then if you yes 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.810
 exactly third time works then you see 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.580
 your came in 2000 came to know exactly how 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.750
 So less cameraman has 200 km 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:27.170
 has fewer hours still makes 20 percent 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:28.670
 less does not hurt and no more 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.100
 the whole time moves like that and 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.890
 especially both have only one 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:51.860
 Piste and you have him such a good weapon 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:55.220
 that means clearly that to 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.510
 example I knew that now should 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.709
 we could not trust me 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.709
 others brought 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.680
 Do not have to be catholic again 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.700
 how do you see performance running? 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.680
 you almost get it funny 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.590
 that you too mega creepy the guests 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:56.320
 i'm guilty oksana what not 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:56.320
 I will times are short but to the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.790
 no ammunition a 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:21.579
 I'm so bad 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:22.030
 the weapon is right that already 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.570
 again 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:31.270
 For the first time I believed three man 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:38.020
 there now and some and get one 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:41.490
 round in the frame makes white without fun 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.990
 not a bit strong man 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.100
 its as that's all we talk about and 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:52.860
 talk and talk and talk and talk or 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.419
 not quite by talking in the case already 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:04.510
 okay what zander i tell you you see 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:08.470
 You see, the price is playing 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.729
 to look the first time 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.139
 I am her and only takes one 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.800
 elaborate care that grad new 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.210
 passport comes thanks to the human with 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.900
 his fast is here comes one 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:39.030
 new sequence of ttg in here in the room 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:39.030
 and since there is experience 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:59.880
 the stop stop loss between with lighter 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:06:01.830
 Check if you as a trader in it already okay 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.720
 I would see it as a trader yes who 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.880
 what ali a match here you do not come 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.380
 through the global economy have no 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.370
 Weapon and I have a weapon I think 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.430
 You want to look around 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.420
 but I have therefore does brown here 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.800
 just as fast as me , that we will do it again 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.750
 new has made the download 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.830
 Well, I've stopped over and over again 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:25.980
 has to the last one percent 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.270
 really, really trust me 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.990
 trust more in his mother 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:37.010
 I trusted the pistol 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:45.630
 no matter has with the disparaging master 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:46.890
 So of course okay to exactly when 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.220
 I have to say quite honestly 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:55.110
 now a little misjudged so dena de 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.700
 Lucia, where do you want something I do not want 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.450
 microphone jews we have no weapons 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:02.300
 throw it away 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.300
 with q , of course, is logical 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:17.420
 yes yes but you were yours from judith 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:24.550
 and that's why I trusted it yes 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:24.550
 that was so clear that this is expected
