00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.690 

so<00:00:10.080> let's<00:00:10.290> look<00:00:10.440> at<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.860> question<00:00:11.040> question

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
so let's look at this question question

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.520 
so let's look at this question question
one<00:00:11.940> what<00:00:12.240> chemical<00:00:12.750> reaction<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.349> taking

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
one what chemical reaction is taking

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.970 
one what chemical reaction is taking
place<00:00:13.740> when<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> dipeptide<00:00:15.170> becomes<00:00:16.170> two<00:00:16.560> amino

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
place when a dipeptide becomes two amino

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.859 
place when a dipeptide becomes two amino
acids<00:00:17.400> relatively<00:00:18.359> straightforward

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
acids relatively straightforward

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.269 
acids relatively straightforward
question<00:00:19.230> all<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.529> need<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.800> know<00:00:19.980> that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
question all you need to know that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.290 
question all you need to know that
dipeptide<00:00:21.150> here<00:00:21.359> die<00:00:21.720> means<00:00:22.410> two<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.400> then

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
dipeptide here die means two and then

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.740 
dipeptide here die means two and then
two<00:00:25.230> amino<00:00:25.529> acids<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.269> obviously<00:00:27.269> two<00:00:27.480> amino

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
two amino acids is obviously two amino

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.189 
two amino acids is obviously two amino
acids<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.609> peptide<00:00:30.420> which<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.990> of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
acids so we have a peptide which is of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.740 
acids so we have a peptide which is of
two<00:00:31.380> amino<00:00:31.619> acids<00:00:32.040> lengths<00:00:32.309> long<00:00:32.820> becoming

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
two amino acids lengths long becoming

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.510 
two amino acids lengths long becoming
two<00:00:34.020> separate<00:00:34.410> amino<00:00:34.649> acids<00:00:34.980> that's<00:00:35.280> just

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
two separate amino acids that's just

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.280 
two separate amino acids that's just
breaking<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.000> apart<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.870> every<00:00:37.050> time<00:00:37.230> you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
breaking it apart but every time you

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.020 
breaking it apart but every time you
think<00:00:37.559> about<00:00:37.680> breaking<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> apart<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:39.000> have

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
think about breaking it apart you have

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.600 
think about breaking it apart you have
to<00:00:39.210> think<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.809> word<00:00:39.989> lysis<00:00:40.590> because<00:00:41.160> lysis

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
to think of the word lysis because lysis

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.850 
to think of the word lysis because lysis
actually<00:00:41.969> means<00:00:42.210> breaking<00:00:42.629> apart<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.739> this

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
actually means breaking apart so in this

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.299 
actually means breaking apart so in this
case<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> correct<00:00:44.489> answer<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:44.910> B<00:00:46.129> let's<00:00:47.129> look

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
case the correct answer is B let's look

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.920 
case the correct answer is B let's look
at<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.460> other<00:00:47.579> answers<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.239> look<00:00:48.690> at<00:00:48.809> why

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
at the other answers and look at why

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.139 
at the other answers and look at why
they're<00:00:49.140> wrong<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:50.149> condensation

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
they're wrong so a condensation

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.090 
they're wrong so a condensation
condensation<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> opposite<00:00:52.920> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
condensation is actually the opposite of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400 
condensation is actually the opposite of
a<00:00:53.850> hydrolysis<00:00:54.600> reaction<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:55.140> when<00:00:55.320> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
a hydrolysis reaction it's when you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.450 
a hydrolysis reaction it's when you
combine<00:00:55.890> two<00:00:56.190> things<00:00:56.670> together<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.270> then<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
combine two things together and then it

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.150 
combine two things together and then it
gives<00:00:59.460> off<00:00:59.699> water<00:01:00.320> whereas<00:01:01.320> hydrolysis<00:01:01.980> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
gives off water whereas hydrolysis is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.219 
gives off water whereas hydrolysis is
using<00:01:02.670> water<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.149> break<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.809> two<00:01:03.960> things

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
using water to break the two things

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.609 
using water to break the two things
apart

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
apart

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.700 
apart
that's<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:06.290> denaturation<00:01:07.290> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that's not a denaturation so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.649 
that's not a denaturation so
denaturation<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> change<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> shape<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
denaturation is a change in the shape of

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.170 
denaturation is a change in the shape of
an<00:01:10.470> enzyme<00:01:10.830> usually<00:01:11.790> either<00:01:11.909> by<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
an enzyme usually either by a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.810 
an enzyme usually either by a
temperature<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.110> by<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.560> pH<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.340> too<00:01:14.490> acidic

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
temperature or by a pH it's too acidic

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.300 
temperature or by a pH it's too acidic
or<00:01:15.000> too<00:01:15.150> basic<00:01:15.570> therefore<00:01:16.409> causing<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.950> change

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
or too basic therefore causing a change

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.960 
or too basic therefore causing a change
in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> function<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.900> denaturation

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
in the function so it's not denaturation

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.550 
in the function so it's not denaturation
finally<00:01:20.970> finally<00:01:21.540> polymerization

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
finally finally polymerization

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.760 
finally finally polymerization
poly<00:01:23.070> poly<00:01:23.640> means<00:01:23.970> many<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.840> polymer<00:01:25.320> means

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
poly poly means many so polymer means

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.819 
poly poly means many so polymer means
that<00:01:25.920> you're<00:01:26.070> creating<00:01:26.610> lots<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.829> you're

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that you're creating lots of you're

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
that you're creating lots of you're
making<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.520> more<00:01:29.700> complex<00:01:30.860> chain<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.750> molecules

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
making a more complex chain of molecules

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.020 
making a more complex chain of molecules
out<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.320> simple<00:01:34.619> molecules<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.700> actually

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
out of simple molecules and we actually

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.490 
out of simple molecules and we actually
don't<00:01:36.150> opposite<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:36.869> we're<00:01:37.020> making<00:01:37.380> our

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
don't opposite here we're making our

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.020 
don't opposite here we're making our
complex<00:01:37.920> molecule<00:01:38.400> into<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> simple<00:01:39.689> molecule

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
complex molecule into a simple molecule

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.310 
complex molecule into a simple molecule
so<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.360> actually<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.689> opposite<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.200> it's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
so it's actually the opposite so it's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.219 
so it's actually the opposite so it's
not<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:44.630> let's<00:01:45.630> look<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> next

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
not this one here let's look at the next

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:46.609 
not this one here let's look at the next
question

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
question

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
question
which<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> following<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> function<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
which of the following is a function of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.200 
which of the following is a function of
cellulose<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.439> plants<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.549> cellulose<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
cellulose in plants so cellulose is a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.100 
cellulose in plants so cellulose is a
green<00:01:52.310> complex<00:01:53.310> carbohydrate<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.750> found

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
green complex carbohydrate that is found

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
green complex carbohydrate that is found
in<00:01:55.350> plant<00:01:55.799> cell<00:01:56.250> walls<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.060> when<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:58.130> ingest

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
in plant cell walls and when we ingest

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.709 
in plant cell walls and when we ingest
that<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.430> humans<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.149> can't<00:02:00.420> actually

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
that as humans that we can't actually

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.700 
that as humans that we can't actually
digest<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
digest that

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.010 
digest that
okay<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:03.850> let's<00:02:04.240> look<00:02:04.360> go<00:02:04.540> through<00:02:04.780> some<00:02:04.990> of

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
okay so let's look go through some of

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.990 
okay so let's look go through some of
the<00:02:05.170> answers<00:02:05.500> is<00:02:05.680> that<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:06.040> storage<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.760> fat

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
the answers is that a storage of fat

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.330 
the answers is that a storage of fat
well<00:02:07.450> no<00:02:07.930> not<00:02:08.200> really<00:02:08.319> so<00:02:08.649> this<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:08.979> that's<00:02:09.250> a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
well no not really so this is that's a

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.610 
well no not really so this is that's a
red<00:02:09.580> herring<00:02:09.910> answer<00:02:10.450> because<00:02:11.319> it's<00:02:11.500> got

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
red herring answer because it's got

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.319 
be a bit challenging but the bottom line
is<00:03:05.290> let's<00:03:05.980> look<00:03:06.160> at<00:03:06.280> number<00:03:06.489> one<00:03:06.640> first<00:03:06.910> so

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
is let's look at number one first so

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.789 
is let's look at number one first so
number<00:03:07.570> one<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.810> giving<00:03:08.079> us<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.500> ring

number one is giving us this ring

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.380 
number one is giving us this ring
structure<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.489> we<00:03:09.549> have<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.820> count<00:03:10.090> the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390

five<00:03:16.480> six<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:17.140> know<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.769> this<00:03:17.860> one<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.070> have

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
five six I know that this one is have

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.590 
five six I know that this one is have
oxygen<00:03:18.459> but<00:03:18.730> if<00:03:18.820> we<00:03:18.880> just<00:03:19.030> ignore<00:03:19.329> that<00:03:19.360> for

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
oxygen but if we just ignore that for

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.229 
oxygen but if we just ignore that for
now<00:03:19.660> it's<00:03:19.959> one<00:03:20.200> two<00:03:20.470> three<00:03:20.829> four<00:03:21.040> five<00:03:21.400> six<00:03:21.670> you

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
now it's one two three four five six you

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.080 
now it's one two three four five six you
can<00:03:22.360> also<00:03:22.510> count<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.140> total<00:03:23.350> number<00:03:23.709> of

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
can also count the total number of

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.850 
can also count the total number of
carbohydrates<00:03:25.260> excuse<00:03:26.260> me<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:26.530> could<00:03:26.650> also

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
carbohydrates excuse me you could also

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.380 
carbohydrates excuse me you could also
count<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.340> number<00:03:27.579> of<00:03:27.610> carbons<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.239> oxygens

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
count the number of carbons and oxygens

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.660 
count the number of carbons and oxygens
and<00:03:28.840> hydrogen's<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.620> what<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.070> find<00:03:30.400> is<00:03:30.640> that

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
and hydrogen's and what you find is that

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.770 
and hydrogen's and what you find is that
this<00:03:30.880> would<00:03:31.090> give<00:03:31.269> c6<00:03:34.110> h-12<00:03:35.110> o-6

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.750 

which<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.829> our<00:03:38.950> chemical<00:03:39.370> formula<00:03:39.730> for

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
which is our chemical formula for

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.840 
which is our chemical formula for
glucose<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.920> straight<00:03:42.250> away<00:03:42.280> we<00:03:42.459> know<00:03:42.700> that

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
glucose so straight away we know that

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.259 
glucose so straight away we know that
one<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.269> glucose<00:03:43.690> we<00:03:43.900> can<00:03:44.049> rule<00:03:44.200> out<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:45.040> C

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
one is glucose we can rule out a and C

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.910 
one is glucose we can rule out a and C
so<00:03:46.269> C<00:03:46.299> then<00:03:46.540> one<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.720> these<00:03:46.870> two<00:03:47.049> so<00:03:47.650> how<00:03:47.769> about

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
so C then one of these two so how about

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.610 
so C then one of these two so how about
number<00:03:48.100> two<00:03:48.430> what<00:03:48.730> does<00:03:48.820> that<00:03:48.880> show<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.810> so

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
number two what does that show and so

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.670 
number two what does that show and so
this<00:03:50.920> is<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.130> classic<00:03:51.640> structure<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.840> fatty

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
this is a classic structure of a fatty

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.470 
this is a classic structure of a fatty
acid<00:03:53.799> and<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.700> suppose<00:03:54.910> like<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.180> bit<00:03:55.329> of<00:03:55.420> a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
acid and I suppose like a bit of a

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.090 
acid and I suppose like a bit of a
tricky<00:03:55.840> way<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.079> get<00:03:56.440> through<00:03:56.650> this<00:03:56.799> is<00:03:57.070> to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
tricky way to get through this is to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.400 
tricky way to get through this is to
show<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.000> that<00:03:58.120> see<00:03:58.900> how<00:03:59.019> this<00:03:59.170> little

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
show you that see how this little

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.220 
show you that see how this little
there's<00:03:59.859> an<00:03:59.950> in<00:04:00.190> there<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:01.540> n<00:04:01.810> means<00:04:02.109> that

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
there's an in there that n means that

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.620 
there's an in there that n means that
there's<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.470> n<00:04:02.829> number<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.209> there<00:04:04.450> might<00:04:04.600> be

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
there's a n number so there might be

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.110 
there's a n number so there might be
three<00:04:04.959> or<00:04:05.079> seven<00:04:05.739> or<00:04:05.890> nine<00:04:05.920> number<00:04:06.910> of<00:04:07.000> these

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
three or seven or nine number of these

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.990 
three or seven or nine number of these
ch2<00:04:07.750> molecules<00:04:08.170> anytime<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:08.799> see<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.220> N<00:04:09.430> and

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
ch2 molecules anytime you see that N and

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.830 
ch2 molecules anytime you see that N and
that<00:04:10.209> means<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:10.660> it's<00:04:10.840> fatty<00:04:11.139> acid

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.080 

okay<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.410> that's<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.620> fatty<00:04:16.890> acid<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:17.700> therefore

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
okay so that's a fatty acid so therefore

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.250 
okay so that's a fatty acid so therefore
we<00:04:18.180> know<00:04:18.300> that<00:04:18.330> the<00:04:18.570> correct<00:04:18.810> answer<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.200> d

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
we know that the correct answer is d

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.490 
we know that the correct answer is d
well<00:04:20.220> how<00:04:20.520> about<00:04:20.610> I'm<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:21.270> an<00:04:21.600> amino<00:04:21.959> acid<00:04:22.050> what

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
well how about I'm a an amino acid what

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.560 
well how about I'm a an amino acid what
would<00:04:22.620> an<00:04:22.770> amino<00:04:23.160> acid<00:04:23.190> look<00:04:23.670> like<00:04:23.880> well<00:04:24.420> that

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
would an amino acid look like well that

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.840 
would an amino acid look like well that
would<00:04:24.720> look<00:04:24.750> something<00:04:25.320> like<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:25.800> we<00:04:26.700> have

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
would look something like this we have

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.750 
would look something like this we have
the<00:04:26.940> r<00:04:27.150> group<00:04:27.420> at<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.630> top<00:04:27.780> as<00:04:28.470> well<00:04:28.680> as<00:04:28.920> c<00:04:29.490> and

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
the r group at the top as well as c and

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.020 
the r group at the top as well as c and
we<00:04:30.720> also<00:04:30.870> have<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.740> carboxylic<00:04:32.430> acid<00:04:32.760> on<00:04:32.850> one

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
we also have the carboxylic acid on one

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.800 
we also have the carboxylic acid on one
side<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.870> h<00:04:34.080> here<00:04:34.530> as<00:04:34.650> well<00:04:35.190> as<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.810> nh-2

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
side the h here as well as the nh-2

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.020 
side the h here as well as the nh-2
group<00:04:37.530> on<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.770> other<00:04:37.800> side<00:04:38.220> so<00:04:38.610> that's<00:04:38.790> what

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
group on the other side so that's what

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.670 
group on the other side so that's what
now<00:04:39.150> an<00:04:39.210> amino<00:04:39.570> acid<00:04:39.900> would<00:04:40.140> look<00:04:40.320> like<00:04:40.470> which

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
now an amino acid would look like which

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.080 
now an amino acid would look like which
is<00:04:40.800> very<00:04:41.070> different<00:04:41.460> from<00:04:41.550> our<00:04:41.730> structure<00:04:42.060> a

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
is very different from our structure a

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.030 
is very different from our structure a
year<00:04:42.330> two<00:04:42.480> so<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.140> correct<00:04:43.380> answer<00:04:43.500> is<00:04:43.770> d
