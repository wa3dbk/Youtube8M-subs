00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
requested a video on how we feed our

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.450 
requested a video on how we feed our
parish<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.440> thought<00:00:13.769> I'd<00:00:13.920> get<00:00:14.070> everything

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
parish so I thought I'd get everything

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.130 
parish so I thought I'd get everything
together<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.030> just<00:00:15.389> give<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> little<00:00:15.719> overview

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.310 

parrot<00:00:19.140> health<00:00:19.380> can<00:00:20.369> be<00:00:20.400> complicated<00:00:20.930> but<00:00:21.930> it

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
parrot health can be complicated but it

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.439 
parrot health can be complicated but it
can<00:00:22.650> also<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.890> pretty<00:00:23.189> straightforward

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
can also be pretty straightforward

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.810 
can also be pretty straightforward
they're<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:25.260> know<00:00:25.550> they're<00:00:26.550> creatures

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
they're just you know they're creatures

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.470 
they're just you know they're creatures
with<00:00:27.180> needs<00:00:27.449> just<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:27.869> humans<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.500> needs

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
with needs just like humans have needs

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.880 
with needs just like humans have needs
unfortunately<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> lot<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.840> people<00:00:31.019> eat<00:00:31.560> junk

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
unfortunately a lot of people eat junk

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.040 
unfortunately a lot of people eat junk
food<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.550> things<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.300> aren't<00:00:33.540> as<00:00:33.630> healthy

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
food and things that aren't as healthy

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.979 
food and things that aren't as healthy
for<00:00:34.800> them<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.969> they<00:00:36.000> might<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.960> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
for them and so they might have a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.049 
for them and so they might have a
tendency<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.620> feed<00:00:37.980> their<00:00:38.190> parents<00:00:38.670> similar

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
tendency to feed their parents similar

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.549 
tendency to feed their parents similar
types<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.510> food<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.410> remember

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
types of food but you have to remember

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.100 
types of food but you have to remember
that<00:00:42.440> these<00:00:43.440> are<00:00:43.620> long-lived<00:00:44.040> creatures<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
that these are long-lived creatures and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.500 
that these are long-lived creatures and
they<00:00:46.110> need<00:00:46.590> nutrients<00:00:47.129> they<00:00:47.430> need<00:00:47.510> clean

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
they need nutrients they need clean

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.049 
they need nutrients they need clean
water<00:00:48.539> um<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:50.100> your<00:00:50.280> vet<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:50.789> be<00:00:50.910> able

water um you know your vet will be able
to<00:00:51.360> tell<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.559> exactly<00:00:53.550> what<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.629> might<00:00:54.809> be

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to tell you exactly what they might be

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.740 
to tell you exactly what they might be
missing<00:00:55.399> during<00:00:56.399> am<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.210> check-up<00:00:57.600> or

missing during am a check-up or
something<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:58.520> just<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.640> generalities<00:01:00.890> as<00:01:01.890> we

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
something but just in generalities as we

something but just in generalities as we
can<00:01:02.789> see<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.000> Bunsen<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.899> happily<00:01:04.379> eating

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
can see here Bunsen is happily eating

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.420 
can see here Bunsen is happily eating
his<00:01:04.860> pellets<00:01:05.570> we<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.780> feed<00:01:07.409> our<00:01:07.680> boys<00:01:07.920> pellets

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
his pellets we do feed our boys pellets

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.620 
his pellets we do feed our boys pellets
we<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.060> giving<00:01:09.330> them<00:01:09.420> organic<00:01:09.869> pellets<00:01:10.549> and

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
we like giving them organic pellets and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.760 
we like giving them organic pellets and
yes<00:01:12.630> Marcus<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.170> talking<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> background

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
yes Marcus is talking in the background

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.600 
yes Marcus is talking in the background
but<00:01:15.320> anyway<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.890> given<00:01:17.130> them<00:01:17.250> organic

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
but anyway so we like given them organic

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.060 
but anyway so we like given them organic
pellets<00:01:17.970> as<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> base<00:01:19.310> we<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.549> give<00:01:21.150> them<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
pellets as a base we do give them a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.690 
pellets as a base we do give them a
fancy<00:01:23.180> I<00:01:24.650> don't<00:01:25.650> want<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> call<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> seed<00:01:26.400> mix

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
fancy I don't want to call a seed mix

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.780 
fancy I don't want to call a seed mix
but<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.270> has<00:01:28.080> dehydrated<00:01:28.770> fruits<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.340> veggies

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
but it has dehydrated fruits and veggies

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.230 
but it has dehydrated fruits and veggies
and<00:01:30.150> seeds<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.079> pellets<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.100> things<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:33.090> get

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and seeds and pellets and things we get

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
and seeds and pellets and things we get
it<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:35.490> very<00:01:36.180> nice<00:01:36.420> bird<00:01:37.200> store<00:01:37.500> online<00:01:37.770> but

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
it at a very nice bird store online but

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.670 
it at a very nice bird store online but
I<00:01:38.670> kind<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.150> reserve<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> treat

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
I kind of reserve that as a treat

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.880 
I kind of reserve that as a treat
basically<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:44.280> base<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.790> pallets<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.509> then

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
basically the base is pallets and then

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.670 
basically the base is pallets and then
green<00:01:46.890> vegetables<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:49.140> giving<00:01:49.320> them

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
green vegetables I like giving them

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.020 
green vegetables I like giving them
collard<00:01:50.520> greens<00:01:51.950> thibault<00:01:52.950> likes<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
collard greens thibault likes the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.920 
collard greens thibault likes the
collards<00:01:54.840> he<00:01:54.960> likes<00:01:55.579> spinach<00:01:56.990> he<00:01:57.990> likes<00:01:59.930> you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
collards he likes spinach he likes you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.690 
collards he likes spinach he likes you
know<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.290> any<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> big<00:02:01.979> leafy<00:02:02.399> greens

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
know just any of the big leafy greens

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.539 
know just any of the big leafy greens
Marcus<00:02:03.270> eats<00:02:03.479> him<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.649> read<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:04.920> too

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
Marcus eats him I have read that too

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.340 
Marcus eats him I have read that too
much<00:02:05.670> spinach<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.360> interfere<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.899> calcium

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
much spinach can interfere with calcium

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.139 
much spinach can interfere with calcium
absorption<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.190> parrots<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.729> you'd<00:02:08.879> want<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
absorption and parrots so you'd want to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.570 
absorption and parrots so you'd want to
keep<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.390> maybe<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.739> lesser<00:02:11.099> side<00:02:11.340> of

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
keep that maybe on the lesser side of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.500 
keep that maybe on the lesser side of
the<00:02:11.700> green<00:02:11.879> leafy<00:02:12.239> vegetables<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:13.080> there's

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the green leafy vegetables but there's

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.429 
the green leafy vegetables but there's
certainly<00:02:13.810> very<00:02:14.290> important<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:17.260> of

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
certainly very important and then of

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:21.089 
certainly very important and then of
course<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:17.890> have<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.400> proteins<00:02:19.769> I've<00:02:20.769> read

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
course we have the proteins I've read

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.339 
course we have the proteins I've read
that<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.579> Indian<00:02:21.909> ringnecks<00:02:22.599> need<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.959> little

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
that the Indian ringnecks need a little

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.929 
that the Indian ringnecks need a little
bit<00:02:23.470> more<00:02:23.620> protein<00:02:24.099> than<00:02:24.129> some<00:02:24.579> of<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.790> other

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
bit more protein than some of the other

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.110 
bit more protein than some of the other
parrots<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.799> tipple<00:02:26.799> isn't<00:02:27.129> crazy<00:02:27.340> about<00:02:27.549> egg

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
parrots so tipple isn't crazy about egg
