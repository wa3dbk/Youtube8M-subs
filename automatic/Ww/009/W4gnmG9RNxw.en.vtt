their snowboards and a snowboard that to
me<00:01:15.929> is<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.500> much<00:01:16.530> more<00:01:17.100> than<00:01:17.399> a<00:01:17.490> group<00:01:17.670> of

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:17.819

me is so much more than a group of
circles<00:01:18.179> I<00:01:19.190> find<00:01:20.190> that<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.429> donek<00:01:20.729> boards

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
circles I find that the donek boards

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.490 
circles I find that the donek boards
have<00:01:21.209> an<00:01:21.360> awesome<00:01:21.750> character<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.380> it's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
have an awesome character but it's

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.380 
have an awesome character but it's
really<00:01:22.740> snappy<00:01:23.159> around<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> gates<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.209> can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
really snappy around the gates and I can

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.779 
really snappy around the gates and I can
get<00:01:24.569> the<00:01:24.690> turn<00:01:24.899> around<00:01:25.190> all<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.310> fees<00:01:26.490> for
