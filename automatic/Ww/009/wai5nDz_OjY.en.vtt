better community areas so that we
actually<00:00:14.219> can<00:00:14.549> reclaim<00:00:14.910> our<00:00:15.089> communities

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
actually can reclaim our communities

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.980 
actually can reclaim our communities
that's<00:00:16.350> what's<00:00:16.650> decimated<00:00:17.160> by<00:00:17.190> city<00:00:17.550> life

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
that's what's decimated by city life

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.029 
that's what's decimated by city life
that's<00:00:18.990> mission<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.439> our<00:00:19.560> culture<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:19.920> our

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
peaceful I've never seen a plant which

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.800 
peaceful I've never seen a plant which
war<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:50.350> vegan<00:01:50.800> and<00:01:51.790> because<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.630> I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
war and vegan and because of that I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.200 
war and vegan and because of that I
think<00:01:53.260> that<00:01:53.410> things<00:01:53.650> are<00:01:53.830> really<00:01:54.210> important

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
think that things are really important

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.440 
think that things are really important
part<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.540> everybody's<00:01:56.700> space<00:01:57.700> because<00:01:58.330> you

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
part of everybody's space because you

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.359 
part of everybody's space because you
can't<00:01:58.660> just<00:01:58.869> have<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.410> diet<00:01:59.710> that<00:01:59.860> doesn't

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
can't just have a diet that doesn't

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.390 
can't just have a diet that doesn't
involve<00:02:01.020> their<00:02:02.020> space<00:02:02.260> that<00:02:02.470> you're<00:02:02.619> in<00:02:02.800> they

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
involve their space that you're in they

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.740 
involve their space that you're in they
show<00:02:03.610> us<00:02:03.760> how<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:03.910> be<00:02:04.000> peaceful<00:02:04.510> and<00:02:04.540> how<00:02:04.690> to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
show us how to be peaceful and how to

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.210 
show us how to be peaceful and how to
really<00:02:05.020> grow<00:02:05.350> with<00:02:05.590> community<00:02:06.070> with<00:02:06.190> the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
really grow with community with the

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.590 
really grow with community with the
earth<00:02:06.429> if<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.820> just<00:02:07.030> follow<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.450> natural

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
earth if you just follow the natural

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.529 
earth if you just follow the natural
cycles<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.350> what<00:02:08.590> plants<00:02:09.039> do<00:02:09.310> in<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.149> earth<00:02:10.270> we

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
cycles of what plants do in the earth we

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.300 
cycles of what plants do in the earth we
can<00:02:10.690> learn<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.110> much<00:02:11.290> on<00:02:11.500> how<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:11.770> build<00:02:12.130> our

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
can learn so much on how to build our

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.220 
can learn so much on how to build our
own<00:02:12.340> communities<00:02:12.970> as<00:02:13.180> humans<00:02:13.570> if<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.780> just

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
own communities as humans if we just

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.820 
own communities as humans if we just
look<00:02:14.950> at<00:02:15.100> plant<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.790> look<00:02:16.000> at<00:02:16.120> how<00:02:16.240> they<00:02:16.540> grow

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
look at plant and look at how they grow

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.040 
look at plant and look at how they grow
it<00:02:17.830> makes<00:02:18.100> people<00:02:18.310> feel<00:02:18.490> really<00:02:19.480> important<00:02:19.900> I

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
it makes people feel really important I

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.140 
it makes people feel really important I
think<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.920> be<00:02:21.040> able<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.370> give<00:02:21.520> people<00:02:21.730> food

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150
