hi<00:00:05.819> it's<00:00:05.970> Charles<00:00:06.180> with<00:00:06.359> CRC<00:00:06.839> plumbing<00:00:07.170> and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
hi it's Charles with CRC plumbing and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.230 
hi it's Charles with CRC plumbing and
we're<00:00:07.620> here<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.859> dream<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.250> water<00:00:09.030> heater

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
we're here to dream this water heater

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.669 
we're here to dream this water heater
which<00:00:09.480> should<00:00:09.660> be<00:00:09.809> done<00:00:09.960> annually<00:00:10.349> as

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
which should be done annually as

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.459 
which should be done annually as
suggested<00:00:11.670> by<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.820> manufacturer<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:13.349> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
suggested by the manufacturer so the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.720 
suggested by the manufacturer so the
reason<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.889> want<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.160> drain<00:00:14.340> these<00:00:14.519> water

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
reason you want to drain these water

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.400 
reason you want to drain these water
heaters<00:00:14.849> out<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.599> get<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.839> sediment<00:00:16.320> and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
heaters out is to get the sediment and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.830 
heaters out is to get the sediment and
the<00:00:16.470> hard<00:00:16.650> water<00:00:16.830> out<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.310> tank<00:00:17.840> that

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
the hard water out of the tank that

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.929 
the hard water out of the tank that
attacks<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.320> metal<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.800> shortens<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.789> life

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
attacks the metal and shortens of life

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.359 
attacks the metal and shortens of life
by<00:00:21.750> thinning<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> metal<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:22.859> definitely

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
by thinning the metal so we definitely

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.189 
by thinning the metal so we definitely
want<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.609> get<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.880> calcium<00:00:24.300> quite<00:00:24.930> water

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
want to get that calcium quite water

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
want to get that calcium quite water
deposits<00:00:25.769> out<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> bottom<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.580> tank

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
deposits out at the bottom of that tank

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.130 
deposits out at the bottom of that tank
so<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:27.449> we're<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.960> we're<00:00:28.050> going

driver on there could be a thumb turn
open<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:38.270> your<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.509> movement<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
open that up your little movement and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.260 
open that up your little movement and
tell<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.619> let<00:01:40.829> some<00:01:41.369> air<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> system<00:01:42.119> as

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
tell you let some air in the system as

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.609 
tell you let some air in the system as
we<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.869> letting<00:01:43.140> your<00:01:43.229> finger<00:01:43.500> off<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
we know like letting your finger off the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
we know like letting your finger off the
straw<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.250> going<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> drain<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.939> now<00:01:45.420> we

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
straw it's not going to drain so now we

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.670 
straw it's not going to drain so now we
have<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:45.899> some<00:01:46.020> air<00:01:46.170> movement<00:01:46.350> going

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
have to get some air movement going

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.670 
have to get some air movement going
there's<00:01:47.280> two<00:01:47.460> ways<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
there's two ways to do it if you have a

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.350 
there's two ways to do it if you have a
pressure<00:01:49.680> relief<00:01:50.130> valve<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:51.180> into

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
pressure relief valve that's going into

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.810 
pressure relief valve that's going into
your<00:01:51.540> pan<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.350> situation<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:53.640> can

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
your pan like in this situation you can

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.560 
your pan like in this situation you can
pop<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:56.759> hear<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> air<00:01:57.149> movement

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
pop this and you hear the air movement

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.630 
pop this and you hear the air movement
there

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
there

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.250 
there
the<00:02:00.640> nice<00:02:00.790> feature<00:02:00.820> about<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.690> is<00:02:01.960> is<00:02:02.140> you

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
the nice feature about that is is you

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.780 
the nice feature about that is is you
don't<00:02:02.290> have<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.680> disconnect<00:02:03.160> it<00:02:03.340> at<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.580> top

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
don't have to disconnect it at the top

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.360 
don't have to disconnect it at the top
if<00:02:04.030> your<00:02:04.360> drain<00:02:05.020> line<00:02:05.290> is<00:02:05.440> going<00:02:05.590> outside<00:02:05.890> and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
if your drain line is going outside and

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.219 
if your drain line is going outside and
it's<00:02:06.490> trapped<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:07.420> won't<00:02:07.660> let<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:07.990> happen

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
it's trapped it won't let this happen

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.870 
it's trapped it won't let this happen
then<00:02:08.710> you're<00:02:08.860> gonna<00:02:08.950> have<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.160> disconnect<00:02:09.729> at

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
then you're gonna have to disconnect at

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.050 
then you're gonna have to disconnect at
the<00:02:10.000> very<00:02:10.179> top<00:02:10.740> one<00:02:11.740> of<00:02:11.860> these<00:02:11.980> nuts<00:02:12.310> in<00:02:12.700> order

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
the very top one of these nuts in order

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.000 
the very top one of these nuts in order
to<00:02:13.270> get<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.600> air<00:02:13.750> movement<00:02:14.050> same<00:02:14.620> theory

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
to get the air movement same theory

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.610 
to get the air movement same theory
allows<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.940> here<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.330> one<00:02:16.570> here<00:02:16.840> is

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
allows you here this one here is

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.850 
allows you here this one here is
draining<00:02:18.040> on<00:02:18.520> its<00:02:18.700> own<00:02:18.880> now<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.140> do<00:02:20.320> go<00:02:20.560> to

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
draining on its own now if you do go to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.830 
draining on its own now if you do go to
trip<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.820> get<00:02:21.970> your<00:02:22.120> air<00:02:22.270> movement<00:02:22.750> in

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
trip this to get your air movement in

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.510 
trip this to get your air movement in
there<00:02:23.050> when<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.440> go<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.680> put<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:23.950> back<00:02:24.190> it's<00:02:24.400> a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
there when you go to put it back it's a

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.910 
there when you go to put it back it's a
spring-loaded<00:02:24.940> valve<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.959> let<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.680> lever

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
spring-loaded valve just let the lever

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.970 
spring-loaded valve just let the lever
down<00:02:27.190> it's<00:02:27.580> nice<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.940> give<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.209> tap<00:02:28.890> kind<00:02:29.890> of

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
down it's nice to give it a tap kind of

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.670 
down it's nice to give it a tap kind of
seats<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.610> valve<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.690> after<00:02:31.959> you've<00:02:32.170> hooked

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
seats the valve so after you've hooked

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.260 
seats the valve so after you've hooked
your<00:02:32.770> hose<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.310> drain<00:02:33.520> valve<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.060> got

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
your hose to the drain valve and you got

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.510 
your hose to the drain valve and you got
that<00:02:34.420> draining<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.470> need<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.770> come<00:02:36.010> up<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.310> the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
that draining you need to come up to the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.090 
that draining you need to come up to the
top<00:02:36.700> here<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.209> either<00:02:38.140> either<00:02:38.530> side<00:02:38.860> will

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
top here and either either side will

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.500 
top here and either either side will
work<00:02:39.280> we<00:02:39.580> just<00:02:39.760> have<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.970> get<00:02:40.060> air<00:02:40.239> into<00:02:40.360> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
work we just have to get air into the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.780 
work we just have to get air into the
system<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:41.080> let<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.350> drain<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:41.920> here<00:02:42.580> I'm<00:02:42.700> going

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
system to let it drain so here I'm going

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.880 
system to let it drain so here I'm going
to<00:02:42.850> come<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.300> cold<00:02:43.540> side<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.530> also<00:02:44.830> I'm

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
to come to the cold side and also I'm

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.190 
to come to the cold side and also I'm
going<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.040> do<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.340> on<00:02:45.550> this<00:02:45.670> nut<00:02:45.970> here<00:02:46.209> this<00:02:46.360> top

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
going to do is on this nut here this top

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.620 
going to do is on this nut here this top
nut<00:02:47.470> I'm<00:02:47.980> gonna<00:02:48.130> loosen<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.640> up<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.600> can

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
nut I'm gonna loosen that up and you can

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.500 
nut I'm gonna loosen that up and you can
actually<00:02:52.870> hear<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.200> sucking<00:02:53.530> air<00:02:53.680> now<00:02:53.830> I

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
actually hear it sucking air now I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.850 
actually hear it sucking air now I
wouldn't<00:02:55.510> pull<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.810> off<00:02:55.959> just<00:02:56.410> go<00:02:56.560> ahead<00:02:56.739> and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
wouldn't pull it off just go ahead and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.190 
wouldn't pull it off just go ahead and
loosen<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.520> here<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.760> draw<00:02:57.940> air<00:02:58.209> that

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
loosen it to you here to draw air that

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.020 
loosen it to you here to draw air that
way<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.739> can<00:02:59.890> just<00:02:59.920> tighten<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.400> back<00:03:00.520> up<00:03:00.580> nice

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
way you can just tighten it back up nice

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.289 
way you can just tighten it back up nice
easy<00:03:01.300> thing<00:03:01.630> done<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:03.250> it's<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.730> good<00:03:03.880> idea<00:03:04.150> to

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
easy thing done and it's a good idea to

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.820 
easy thing done and it's a good idea to
put<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.450> five-gallon<00:03:05.019> bucket<00:03:05.350> at<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.620> end<00:03:05.739> of

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
put a five-gallon bucket at the end of

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.020 
put a five-gallon bucket at the end of
your<00:03:05.890> hose<00:03:06.010> because<00:03:06.459> then<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.730> can<00:03:06.880> see

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
your hose because then you can see

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.500 
your hose because then you can see
what's<00:03:07.209> actually<00:03:07.360> coming<00:03:07.720> out<00:03:07.989> of<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:09.510> this

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
what's actually coming out of it this

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.630 
what's actually coming out of it this
one's<00:03:10.720> in<00:03:10.870> Thousand<00:03:11.290> Oaks<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.799> it's<00:03:11.950> not<00:03:12.160> been

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
one's in Thousand Oaks and it's not been

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.280 
one's in Thousand Oaks and it's not been

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
horrible if you look at the situation we

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.100 
horrible if you look at the situation we
have<00:03:23.950> on<00:03:24.100> tape<00:03:24.310> here<00:03:24.730> oh<00:03:24.880> it's<00:03:25.360> insane<00:03:25.780> the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
have on tape here oh it's insane the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.220 
have on tape here oh it's insane the
water<00:03:26.530> quality<00:03:26.799> is<00:03:27.130> just<00:03:27.400> very<00:03:27.970> low<00:03:28.900> and

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
water quality is just very low and

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.830 
water quality is just very low and
there's<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.100> lot<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.519> stuff<00:03:30.820> in<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.630> water

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
there's a lot of stuff in it the water

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.660 
there's a lot of stuff in it the water
that's<00:03:32.079> coming<00:03:32.170> out<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.650> this<00:03:32.799> tank<00:03:33.160> here<00:03:33.489> is

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
that's coming out of this tank here is

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.780 
that's coming out of this tank here is
incredibly<00:03:34.540> bad<00:03:34.930> filthy<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:35.950> it's<00:03:36.400> an<00:03:36.519> older

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
incredibly bad filthy and it's an older

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.400 
incredibly bad filthy and it's an older
tank<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:37.269> you'll<00:03:37.420> see<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.750> difference<00:03:38.110> if<00:03:38.260> we

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
tank so you'll see the difference if we

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.050 
tank so you'll see the difference if we
were<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.620> drain<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.100> on<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.310> regular<00:03:39.670> basis

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
were to drain this on a regular basis

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.910 
were to drain this on a regular basis
this<00:03:40.360> could<00:03:40.600> not<00:03:40.810> happen<00:03:41.079> but<00:03:41.380> as<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.680> see

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
this could not happen but as you see

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.620 
this could not happen but as you see
from<00:03:42.100> what's<00:03:42.340> coming<00:03:42.489> out<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.850> this<00:03:43.000> it's

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
from what's coming out of this it's

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.330 
from what's coming out of this it's
horrible<00:03:44.260> it's<00:03:44.440> just<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.890> should<00:03:45.100> have<00:03:45.220> been

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
horrible it's just it should have been

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.009 
horrible it's just it should have been
done<00:03:45.519> more<00:03:45.579> and<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.450> wouldn't<00:03:46.780> be<00:03:46.900> here

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019

the top clockwise tighten it again if
your<00:04:03.079> flexes<00:04:03.560> old<00:04:03.769> might<00:04:04.280> be<00:04:04.459> a<00:04:04.489> good<00:04:04.760> idea<00:04:04.870> to

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
your flexes old might be a good idea to

your flexes old might be a good idea to
replace<00:04:06.019> it<00:04:06.560> this<00:04:06.799> is<00:04:06.950> your<00:04:07.099> water<00:04:07.280> flex<00:04:07.700> as<00:04:08.390> I

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
and now we're just going to cycle it

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.469 
and now we're just going to cycle it
through<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:40.220> tank<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:40.910> get<00:04:41.030> rid<00:04:41.210> of<00:04:41.300> any

through the tank and get rid of any
loose<00:04:42.199> setup<00:04:42.620> at<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:42.889> there<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:45.099> I<00:04:46.099> just

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
loose setup at this there and I just

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.719 
loose setup at this there and I just
tend<00:04:46.699> to<00:04:46.789> run<00:04:46.970> that<00:04:47.150> for<00:04:47.330> five<00:04:48.139> minutes

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
tend to run that for five minutes

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.270 
tend to run that for five minutes
approximately<00:04:50.380> all<00:04:51.380> right<00:04:51.530> now<00:04:51.710> we've<00:04:51.949> cycled

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
approximately all right now we've cycled

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.060 
approximately all right now we've cycled
the<00:04:52.639> water<00:04:53.300> heater<00:04:53.539> tank<00:04:53.840> for<00:04:54.080> five<00:04:54.590> seven

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
the water heater tank for five seven

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.129 
the water heater tank for five seven
minutes<00:04:55.099> just<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.120> get<00:04:56.270> anything<00:04:56.660> loose<00:04:56.870> out

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
minutes just to get anything loose out

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.430 
minutes just to get anything loose out
so<00:04:57.620> we're<00:04:58.400> good<00:04:58.720> go<00:04:59.720> ahead<00:04:59.930> and<00:05:00.110> shut<00:05:00.260> this

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
so we're good go ahead and shut this

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:10.080 
so we're good go ahead and shut this
valve<00:05:00.500> off<00:05:00.949> here<00:05:03.099> pull<00:05:04.099> unconnect<00:05:04.580> arose<00:05:06.130> and

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.340 

anytime<00:05:11.090> you<00:05:11.300> disconnect<00:05:11.960> any<00:05:12.140> of<00:05:12.260> these

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
anytime you disconnect any of these

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.680 
anytime you disconnect any of these
connections<00:05:12.710> and<00:05:13.040> reconnect<00:05:13.520> them

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
connections and reconnect them

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.580 
connections and reconnect them
definitely<00:05:14.690> make<00:05:14.870> sure<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.170> check<00:05:15.410> your

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
definitely make sure you check your

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.530 
definitely make sure you check your
connections<00:05:16.100> twice<00:05:16.400> if<00:05:16.640> not<00:05:16.730> three<00:05:16.880> or<00:05:17.300> four

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
connections twice if not three or four

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.450 
connections twice if not three or four
times<00:05:17.810> because<00:05:18.440> the<00:05:18.680> leak<00:05:18.860> is<00:05:19.010> a<00:05:19.040> big<00:05:19.250> problem

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
times because the leak is a big problem

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.160 
times because the leak is a big problem
you<00:05:19.730> can<00:05:19.880> have<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.210> as<00:05:20.510> soon<00:05:20.570> as<00:05:20.750> you've<00:05:20.960> turned

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
you can have it as soon as you've turned
