you<00:01:34.940> would<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:36.590> gain<00:01:36.860> one<00:01:37.430> action<00:01:37.850> token<00:01:38.180> and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
you would you gain one action token and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.330 
you would you gain one action token and
your<00:01:38.840> opponent<00:01:39.049> who's<00:01:39.380> going<00:01:39.649> second<00:01:40.009> gets<00:01:40.220> an

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
you will be on your problem deck we'll

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.180 
you will be on your problem deck we'll
have<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.760> stricter<00:02:45.480> requirement<00:02:46.110> than<00:02:46.590> what

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
have a stricter requirement than what

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.500 
have a stricter requirement than what
your<00:02:47.310> opponent<00:02:47.490> would<00:02:47.730> have<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.000> do<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.270> also

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
your opponent would have to do to also

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.050 
your opponent would have to do to also
solve<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.840> problem<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:50.490> i<00:02:50.520> would<00:02:50.700> suggest<00:02:50.790> on

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
solve the problem so i would suggest on

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.490 
solve the problem so i would suggest on
the<00:02:51.120> first<00:02:51.270> turn<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.570> just<00:02:51.780> play<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:51.990> friend<00:02:52.350> on

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
the first turn to just play a friend on

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.450 
the first turn to just play a friend on
one<00:02:52.710> of<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.890> two<00:02:53.010> problems

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.540 

so<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.120> put<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.510> back<00:02:58.690> into<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.930> middle

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
so you put that back into the middle

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.810 
so you put that back into the middle
heat<00:03:00.550> rainbow<00:03:01.300> dash's<00:03:01.510> in<00:03:01.810> play<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.550> you'd

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
heat rainbow dash's in play so you'd

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.670 
heat rainbow dash's in play so you'd
play<00:03:04.030> out<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.240> your<00:03:04.360> hand<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.870> cost<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.320> cards

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
play out of your hand the cost of cards

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.710 
play out of your hand the cost of cards
is<00:03:05.860> this<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:06.970> number<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.180> action<00:03:07.450> totems

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
is this is the number of action totems

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.870 
is this is the number of action totems
it<00:03:07.840> takes<00:03:08.020> to<00:03:08.230> play<00:03:08.440> them<00:03:08.620> some<00:03:09.400> cards<00:03:09.700> may

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
it takes to play them some cards may

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.790 
it takes to play them some cards may
have<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.090> prerequisite<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.230> have<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.590> have

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
have a prerequisite you have to have

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.650 
have a prerequisite you have to have
it's<00:03:12.400> not<00:03:12.580> really<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.820> cost<00:03:13.090> but<00:03:13.300> you<00:03:13.390> have<00:03:13.540> to

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
it's not really a cost but you have to

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.350 
it's not really a cost but you have to
already<00:03:13.840> have<00:03:14.020> in<00:03:14.440> plate<00:03:14.800> at<00:03:15.100> least<00:03:15.160> this<00:03:15.850> many

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
already have in plate at least this many

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.770 
already have in plate at least this many
loyalty<00:03:17.430> would<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.640> technically<00:03:19.210> do<00:03:19.450> because

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
loyalty would you technically do because

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.500

Rainbow Dash counts as providing anyone
loyalty<00:03:22.900> from<00:03:23.110> very<00:03:23.350> beginning<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:25.000> you

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
loyalty from very beginning so you

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.790 
loyalty from very beginning so you
probably<00:03:25.120> play<00:03:25.660> either<00:03:25.870> star<00:03:26.350> hunter<00:03:26.680> or

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
probably play either star hunter or

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.040 
probably play either star hunter or
cloud<00:03:27.010> chaser<00:03:27.250> down<00:03:30.840> okay

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
cloud chaser down okay

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.530 
cloud chaser down okay
it<00:03:33.590> goes<00:03:33.830> so<00:03:34.400> no<00:03:34.610> problems<00:03:34.940> are<00:03:35.030> solved<00:03:35.360> it

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
fulfills both of the Apple requirements

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.199 
fulfills both of the Apple requirements
and<00:04:09.430> then<00:04:09.519> you'll<00:04:09.640> just<00:04:09.700> have<00:04:09.879> to<00:04:09.939> get<00:04:10.060> one

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
and then you'll just have to get one

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.849 
and then you'll just have to get one
more<00:04:10.239> character<00:04:10.689> so<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:10.870> costs<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.260> one<00:04:11.500> and

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
more character so that costs you one and

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.610 
more character so that costs you one and
one<00:04:12.299> so<00:04:13.299> you're<00:04:13.450> done<00:04:13.599> it<00:04:14.109> goes<00:04:14.230> back<00:04:14.379> to<00:04:14.439> you

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
one so you're done it goes back to you

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:25.330 
one so you're done it goes back to you
you<00:04:14.890> get<00:04:15.069> one<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:16.320> draw<00:04:17.320> card

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.830 

so<00:04:25.880> you<00:04:25.940> probably<00:04:26.150> could<00:04:26.389> just<00:04:26.540> get<00:04:26.630> another

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
so you probably could just get another

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.960 
so you probably could just get another
character<00:04:27.260> down<00:04:27.440> over<00:04:28.010> here<00:04:29.440> yep<00:04:30.639> so<00:04:31.639> still

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
character down over here yep so still

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.390 
character down over here yep so still
nothing<00:04:32.270> is<00:04:32.389> solved<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:33.139> take<00:04:33.979> your<00:04:34.010> next

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
nothing is solved you take your next

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:42.250 
nothing is solved you take your next
turn<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:39.590> draw<00:04:39.740> card<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.910> get<00:04:41.060> one<00:04:41.360> so

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
turn you draw card and you get one so

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.590 
turn you draw card and you get one so
that's<00:04:42.410> a<00:04:42.500> resource<00:04:42.889> card<00:04:43.190> if<00:04:43.820> this<00:04:44.000> was<00:04:44.330> like

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
that's a resource card if this was like

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.930 
that's a resource card if this was like
magic<00:04:45.320> i<00:04:45.740> would<00:04:45.889> say<00:04:46.040> resources<00:04:46.580> are<00:04:46.699> kind<00:04:46.880> of

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
magic i would say resources are kind of

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.300 
magic i would say resources are kind of
like<00:04:47.060> enchantments<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:48.260> play<00:04:48.500> them<00:04:48.680> on<00:04:48.830> two

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
like enchantments you play them on two

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.590 
like enchantments you play them on two
characters<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:51.340> they<00:04:52.340> either<00:04:53.150> provide<00:04:53.540> a

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
characters and they either provide a

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.560 
characters and they either provide a
benefit<00:04:54.110> or<00:04:54.290> a<00:04:54.800> drawback<00:04:55.160> in<00:04:55.340> this<00:04:55.490> case<00:04:55.699> must

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
benefit or a drawback in this case must

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.930 
benefit or a drawback in this case must
keep<00:04:56.810> bucking<00:04:57.130> you<00:04:58.130> play<00:04:58.310> it<00:04:58.400> on<00:04:58.490> hair'<00:04:58.729> spear

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
keep bucking you play it on hair' spear

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.240 
keep bucking you play it on hair' spear
and<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.210> reduces<00:04:59.389> their<00:04:59.930> power<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.350> zero<00:05:03.250> yeah

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
and it reduces their power to zero yeah

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.440 
and it reduces their power to zero yeah
he<00:05:04.729> says<00:05:04.970> grab<00:05:05.240> one<00:05:05.450> just<00:05:07.300> said<00:05:08.300> something

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
he says grab one just said something

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.800 
he says grab one just said something
every<00:05:08.750> she<00:05:08.900> played<00:05:09.110> that

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.690 

probably<00:05:13.530> just<00:05:13.650> like<00:05:13.710> put<00:05:14.010> like<00:05:14.040> diamond<00:05:14.520> mint

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
probably just like put like diamond mint

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.150 
probably just like put like diamond mint
or<00:05:14.820> something<00:05:14.850> downs<00:05:15.600> metal<00:05:16.050> finish<00:05:16.470> it<00:05:16.620> costs

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
or something downs metal finish it costs

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.920 
or something downs metal finish it costs
you<00:05:17.280> one<00:05:17.460> you<00:05:17.940> have<00:05:18.060> now<00:05:18.090> solved<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.570> problem

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
you one you have now solved the problem

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.379 
you one you have now solved the problem
so<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:20.040> score<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.639> bonus<00:05:20.940> point<00:05:21.180> since

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
so you score the bonus point since

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.610 
so you score the bonus point since
you're<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.540> first<00:05:21.810> step<00:05:21.990> solve<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.290> problem

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
you're the first step solve the problem

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.300 
you're the first step solve the problem
and<00:05:23.360> you<00:05:24.360> also<00:05:24.540> score<00:05:24.900> a<00:05:25.169> victory<00:05:25.200> put<00:05:25.830> just<00:05:26.220> a

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
and you also score a victory put just a

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.070 
and you also score a victory put just a
victory<00:05:26.550> point<00:05:26.790> because<00:05:27.389> you<00:05:27.750> have<00:05:27.930> the

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
victory point because you have the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.080 
victory point because you have the
problem<00:05:28.380> solved<00:05:28.770> and<00:05:28.970> you'll<00:05:29.970> continue

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
problem solved and you'll continue

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.610 
problem solved and you'll continue
getting<00:05:30.450> that<00:05:30.570> victory<00:05:30.930> point<00:05:31.139> as<00:05:31.260> long<00:05:31.290> as

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
getting that victory point as long as

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.140 
getting that victory point as long as
you<00:05:31.680> have<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:31.830> problem<00:05:32.130> solved<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:32.700> as<00:05:32.910> long

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
you have that problem solved and as long

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.150 
you have that problem solved and as long
as<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:34.560> problem<00:05:34.800> remains<00:05:35.070> out<00:05:35.430> on<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.700> table

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
as the problem remains out on the table

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.580 
as the problem remains out on the table
so<00:05:38.160> it<00:05:38.220> goes<00:05:38.340> back<00:05:38.490> over<00:05:38.639> to<00:05:38.790> you<00:05:39.290> now<00:05:40.290> she<00:05:40.350> has

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
so it goes back over to you now she has

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.920 
so it goes back over to you now she has
to<00:05:40.950> victory<00:05:41.310> points<00:05:41.730> yes<00:05:42.540> she<00:05:42.690> could<00:05:42.780> also

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
to victory points yes she could also

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.330 
to victory points yes she could also
solve<00:05:43.169> it<00:05:43.350> in<00:05:43.440> which<00:05:43.560> case<00:05:43.590> you<00:05:43.889> face<00:05:44.130> off

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
solve it in which case you face off

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.730 
solve it in which case you face off
against<00:05:44.730> each<00:05:44.820> other<00:05:45.000> which<00:05:45.900> completes<00:05:46.560> the

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
against each other which completes the

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.500 
against each other which completes the
problem<00:05:47.160> and<00:05:47.310> whoever<00:05:47.700> wins<00:05:47.790> the<00:05:48.120> faceoff

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
problem and whoever wins the faceoff

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.830 
problem and whoever wins the faceoff
Reese<00:05:48.870> kors<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.290> bonus<00:05:49.530> point<00:05:50.300> on<00:05:51.300> your<00:05:51.600> turn
