class<00:00:13.549> one<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.730> classes<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.240> hate<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> most

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
class one of the classes I hate the most

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.710 
class one of the classes I hate the most
but<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.920> also<00:00:17.070> helps<00:00:17.400> me<00:00:17.520> kill<00:00:17.850> other<00:00:18.119> stompers

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
but I also helps me kill other stompers

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.170 
but I also helps me kill other stompers
because<00:00:19.220> since<00:00:20.220> I'm<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> stomper<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.820> could<00:00:21.060> go

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
because since I'm a stomper I could go

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.640 
because since I'm a stomper I could go
up<00:00:21.270> there<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.630> get<00:00:21.869> them<00:00:22.020> without<00:00:22.260> having<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
up there and get them without having to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.920 
up there and get them without having to
worry<00:00:22.830> about<00:00:22.890> getting<00:00:23.220> hit<00:00:24.150> down<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.689> dying

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
worry about getting hit down and dying

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.080 
worry about getting hit down and dying

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
but whatever as you could see this

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.789 
but whatever as you could see this
gameplay<00:02:52.129> is<00:02:52.400> shorter<00:02:53.239> than<00:02:53.269> normal<00:02:53.799> it's

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
gameplay is shorter than normal it's

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.899 
gameplay is shorter than normal it's
like<00:02:55.010> seven<00:02:55.760> minutes<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:57.639> that<00:02:58.639> is<00:02:58.760> because

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
like seven minutes and that is because

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.210 
like seven minutes and that is because
I'm<00:02:59.480> able<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.870> kill<00:03:00.049> all<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.440> towers<00:03:00.620> early
