a wig cap to make sure that it is
positioned<00:03:38.340> right<00:03:38.730> now<00:03:39.299> because<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.870> a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
positioned right now because this is a

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.550 
positioned right now because this is a
glueless<00:03:40.380> wig<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:41.040> had<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.670> secure<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:43.230> hair

because<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.160> was<00:03:47.430> kind<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.790> like<00:03:47.940> flappy<00:03:48.810> if

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
because it was kind of like flappy if

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.500 
because it was kind of like flappy if
that<00:03:49.829> makes<00:03:50.040> any<00:03:50.190> sense<00:03:50.340> so<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:51.000> wind<00:03:51.299> was
