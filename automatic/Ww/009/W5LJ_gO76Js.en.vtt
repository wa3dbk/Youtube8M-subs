have<00:02:39.930> all<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.170> your<00:02:40.380> hair<00:02:40.560> pulled<00:02:40.890> up<00:02:41.220> and

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
have all of your hair pulled up and

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.250 
have all of your hair pulled up and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
you're holding on to it you want to use

you're holding on to it you want to use
an<00:02:43.709> elastic<00:02:43.980> band<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.940> am<00:02:45.360> using<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.989> headband<00:02:46.440> in

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
an elastic band I am using a headband in

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.520 
an elastic band I am using a headband in
this<00:02:46.830> case<00:02:47.069> just<00:02:47.370> because<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.970> allows<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.260> for

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
this case just because it allows you for

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.820 
this case just because it allows you for
a<00:02:49.590> looser<00:02:50.190> look<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.780> what<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.019> like<00:02:52.290> about<00:02:52.470> that

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
a looser look and what I like about that

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.650 
a looser look and what I like about that
is<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.310> also<00:02:53.430> doesn't<00:02:53.940> pull<00:02:54.180> your<00:02:54.390> hair

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
is that it also doesn't pull your hair

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.660 
is that it also doesn't pull your hair
you<00:02:55.230> want<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.500> be<00:02:55.590> careful<00:02:55.860> with<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.400> course

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
you want to be careful with of course

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.640 
you want to be careful with of course
your<00:02:56.850> real<00:02:57.090> hair<00:02:57.330> out<00:02:57.930> around<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.500> perimeter

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
your real hair out around the perimeter

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.800 
your real hair out around the perimeter
and<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.340> doing<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.700> looser<00:03:00.030> ponytail<00:03:00.510> helps

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
and so doing the looser ponytail helps

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:18.260 
and so doing the looser ponytail helps
to<00:03:00.930> protect<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.950> integrity<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.549> your<00:03:02.700> hair

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
once you've got that elastic band around

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.180 
once you've got that elastic band around
you<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.300> now<00:03:21.480> start<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:22.110> smoothing<00:03:22.650> process

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
you can now start the smoothing process

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.300 
you can now start the smoothing process
