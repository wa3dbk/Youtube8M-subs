00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.090 
talent that's on that team but we shot
poorly<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> first<00:02:03.570> half<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:04.260> had<00:02:04.470> shots<00:02:04.800> we

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
poorly in the first half we had shots we

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.680 
poorly in the first half we had shots we
had<00:02:05.220> opportunities<00:02:05.820> they<00:02:05.940> did<00:02:06.090> fall<00:02:06.330> for<00:02:06.570> us

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
had opportunities they did fall for us

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.810 
had opportunities they did fall for us
so<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.500> know<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:07.830> went<00:02:08.009> 1<00:02:08.130> for<00:02:08.310> 13<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
so you know we went 1 for 13 in the

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.340 
so you know we went 1 for 13 in the
first<00:02:09.030> quarter<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:09.869> they<00:02:09.960> weren't<00:02:10.170> bad

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
first quarter so and they weren't bad

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.570 
first quarter so and they weren't bad
shots<00:02:10.619> those<00:02:10.800> are<00:02:10.920> shots<00:02:11.070> we<00:02:11.190> take<00:02:11.340> all<00:02:11.490> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
shots those are shots we take all the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.910 
shots those are shots we take all the
time<00:02:11.730> they<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.450> sit<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.870> hit<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.350> they<00:02:13.860> were

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
time they just sit in hit and they were

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.830 
time they just sit in hit and they were
pretty<00:02:14.250> much<00:02:14.400> hitting<00:02:14.580> everything<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.330> there

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
pretty much hitting everything so there

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.180 
pretty much hitting everything so there
was<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:15.990> lot<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.320> different<00:02:16.680> things<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.980> are

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
was a lot of different things that are

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.460 
was a lot of different things that are
going<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.660> but<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.690> think<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.080> second<00:02:19.380> half

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
going on but I think in the second half

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.199 
going on but I think in the second half
our<00:02:19.650> girls<00:02:19.860> came<00:02:20.010> out<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> lot<00:02:20.430> more<00:02:20.640> aggressive

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
our girls came out a lot more aggressive

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.120 
our girls came out a lot more aggressive
and<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.480> lot<00:02:21.600> more<00:02:21.860> Southside<00:02:22.860> style

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
and a lot more Southside style

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.480 
and a lot more Southside style
basketball<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:24.120> helped<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.380> we<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.650> done

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
basketball that helped but we just done

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.830 
basketball that helped but we just done
ourselves<00:02:26.640> too<00:02:27.090> big<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.390> hole<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.600> we're

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
ourselves too big of a hole and we're

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.810 
ourselves too big of a hole and we're
really<00:02:27.990> making<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.620> make<00:02:28.830> us<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.190> challenge

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
really making it make us a challenge

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.050 
really making it make us a challenge
against<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.300> team<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.850> works

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
against a team like that that that works

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.090 
against a team like that that that works
you<00:02:33.750> know<00:02:33.840> equally<00:02:34.200> as<00:02:34.290> hard<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.770> it's<00:02:34.890> very

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
you know equally as hard and it's very

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:49.520 
you know equally as hard and it's very
it's<00:02:35.610> very<00:02:35.670> talented

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.540 

Portwenn<00:02:50.530> itself<00:02:50.860> what<00:02:51.010> did<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.250> learn<00:02:51.370> it

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
Portwenn itself what did you learn it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.410 
Portwenn itself what did you learn it
the<00:02:51.700> first<00:02:51.910> time

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
the first time

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.420 
the first time
playing<00:02:52.960> against<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.350> time<00:02:53.800> there<00:02:54.040> they're

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
playing against a time there they're

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.100 
playing against a time there they're
athletic<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:55.090> think<00:02:55.480> they<00:02:55.630> can<00:02:55.750> get<00:02:55.840> up<00:02:55.960> and

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
athletic I think they can get up and

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.130 
athletic I think they can get up and
down<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.320> floor<00:02:57.480> number<00:02:58.480> 22

and<00:05:25.430> we've<00:05:25.850> seen<00:05:26.060> what<00:05:26.180> we've<00:05:26.300> had<00:05:26.420> to<00:05:26.510> do

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
and we've seen what we've had to do

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.690 
and we've seen what we've had to do
obviously<00:05:27.260> we<00:05:27.620> haven't<00:05:27.740> had<00:05:27.980> you<00:05:28.370> know<00:05:28.490> that

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.190 
obviously we haven't had you know that
experience<00:05:29.180> in<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.360> last<00:05:29.510> four<00:05:29.750> months<00:05:30.050> so

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
experience in the last four months so

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.150 
experience in the last four months so
that<00:05:30.470> you<00:05:31.190> know<00:05:31.340> isn't<00:05:31.700> the<00:05:32.090> same<00:05:32.360> but<00:05:32.750> we<00:05:33.560> know

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
that you know isn't the same but we know

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.710 
that you know isn't the same but we know
what<00:05:34.430> kind<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:34.640> havoc<00:05:34.790> it<00:05:35.060> has<00:05:35.180> caused<00:05:35.480> in<00:05:35.630> the

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
what kind of havoc it has caused in the

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.940 
what kind of havoc it has caused in the
past<00:05:35.750> whenever<00:05:36.200> we<00:05:36.410> have<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:36.740> opportunity

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
past whenever we have that opportunity

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.940 
past whenever we have that opportunity
