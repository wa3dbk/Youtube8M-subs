00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:11.500
 Hello, 0 if it is now a little bored sseudaga a book in a book a while ago 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:15.059
 I'm going to give you a moment to talk about it. 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.080
 How can most people write my book? 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.270
 You do. 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:26.199
 I have more than 1.2 billion won of books 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:30.880
 I still give birth to my 10 years of introduction to the book Now I just started to leave the book now 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:35.620
 What I did have a little fun, why shoot to replace the subject 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:41.800
 I wrote a book on classics, a social commentary, and a number. 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:47.370
 The skull must be fun itself in this way . 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:53.129
 But now if you like this book, usually when I write in the first 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:58.440
 The whole point about how to write in this way is that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:04.860
 It has also started to plan something like this book, If I have a little change hair 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:09.479
 I just figured out after I roughly got a plan, and I need to go to Burns. 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.830
 Do you think so ? This book is about hair removal economics. 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.220
 than 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:20.039
 That such a lot of literary background 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:25.950
 Because it is a book, it is difficult to get such a fine plan from the beginning . 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:30.899
 But once you start taking measures, even if you write a long life 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.320
 Still I want to start something new is always in his heart 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:37.890
 I mean , the country has a tattoo. 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.929
 Haetguyo I think that in the future continue to write as soon as the book written 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:47.429
 Well, what you need to slow down a little, and yet it could 'cause smoke a little lazy 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:49.979
 When the desire to write such a conflict is always quite so perhaps I see 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:55.229
 I heard a lot of old forward 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:02:00.660
 Writing the word become almost impossible, even if he is older 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:05.009
 Such a request and then to the necessity that it should be written in our hearts to put 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:08.489
 Do you think you need to do that? 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:13.500
 The conflict between desires is just as equals 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:19.709
 But a little self-focused and have a two-hour lecture 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:24.270
 Now began the day at dawn fits him now writes a preface to the next one 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:29.190
 I am writing the first nipple of one sheet 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.890
 Here again, the important part is that there is a lot of first start 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.440
 At the dawn when it's very important 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:40.709
 I wrote it in front of it, and wrote it, and it is worthless as it is written in its inability. 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.310
 I will write a book about this in the future. 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:49.080
 Like a kind of boy culture , about yourself 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:52.080
 But now you have to go into concrete one and two, 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:58.530
 Kind of project 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:03.120
 So when you start to do something, it always happens that you do not have the first step 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.540
 It is important that now the broadcast that you are broadcasting now is very 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.630
 Now, I'm pouring it now and I'm a bit bored. 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:14.700
 Have some fun and examples Tower eopgetda 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.819
 I 'm making a video like this anyway, 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.510
 Even if it's not a concrete, heavy topic 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.290
 But this theory comes to mind first when I see him is a joke to you 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.640
 Let's do it. 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:30.180
 When necessary, I'll be happy to yireonge Your Word came to do so 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.800
 When you watch this video 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.850
 I have just taken lightly worked on which to wearing one in wooduri 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.950
 With you 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:45.060
 I'm giving you the word. I want you to keep it that way. 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:49.410
 Such natural spirits coming from these places can be 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.910
 I wish there was such a development not in your life or work. 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.910
 Thank you very much. Thank you.
