00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
building and if you're pretty good shot

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.049 
building and if you're pretty good shot
you<00:00:46.289> should<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:47.070> able<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.340> take<00:00:47.520> them<00:00:47.670> out<00:00:47.789> with

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
one shot each and i did that but i guess

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
one shot each and i did that but i guess
i<00:00:52.620> didn't<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:53.520> i<00:00:53.789> had<00:00:53.820> gotten<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> first

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
i didn't think i had gotten the first

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.729 
i didn't think i had gotten the first
guy<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.079> first<00:00:55.350> time<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.010> i<00:00:56.039> shy<00:00:56.430> again<00:00:57.739> after

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
soldiers go ahead of me so

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.459

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
most of this because it's me not dealing

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.000 
most of this because it's me not dealing
