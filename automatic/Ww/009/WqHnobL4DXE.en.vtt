00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
way you pull the lever to move forward

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.850 
way you pull the lever to move forward
and<00:01:23.479> try<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.540> reach<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.020> end<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.500> leap<00:01:25.680> off

but this time you have to be careful
because<00:01:27.540> there<00:01:28.110> are<00:01:28.170> now<00:01:28.860> zingers<00:01:29.400> block

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
because there are now zingers block

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.310 
because there are now zingers block
either<00:01:29.850> way<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.180> unlike<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.720> ghosts<00:01:31.259> from

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the previous levels they won't disappear

the previous levels they won't disappear
if<00:01:33.600> they<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.290> stay<00:01:34.530> still<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.310> stayed

if they if you stay still if I stayed

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.210 
if they if you stay still if I stayed
still<00:01:36.030> makes<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.390> an<00:01:36.509> easy<00:01:36.659> target<00:01:37.220> although

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
still makes you an easy target although

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.920 
still makes you an easy target although
how<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.400> said<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.150> don't<00:01:39.479> pull<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
how I said that if you don't pull the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.310 
how I said that if you don't pull the
lever<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:42.000> here<00:01:42.570> you'll<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.899> able

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
lever you can then here you'll be able

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.380 
lever you can then here you'll be able
to<00:01:43.439> move<00:01:43.590> back<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.280> might<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.610> able<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.880> use

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to move back so you might be able to use

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.230 
to move back so you might be able to use
it<00:01:46.020> as<00:01:46.229> some<00:01:46.409> kind<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.619> evasion<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.280> course<00:01:48.119> you

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it as some kind of evasion of course you

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.179 
it as some kind of evasion of course you
could<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:48.990> what<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.170> did<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> few<00:01:49.560> seconds<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.009> go

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
could do what I did a few seconds and go

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.590 
could do what I did a few seconds and go
and<00:01:50.369> smack<00:01:50.670> them<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.180> face<00:01:51.360> but

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and smack them right in the face but

see a bit later gear but yeah you've got
these<00:03:52.319> several<00:03:52.709> circling<00:03:53.370> pegs<00:03:53.669> which<00:03:54.060> me

either basically means all of your jumps

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.020 
either basically means all of your jumps
have<00:03:57.599> to<00:03:57.720> be<00:03:57.840> timed<00:03:58.519> extremely<00:03:59.519> carefully

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
have to be timed extremely carefully

these<00:04:00.599> thing<00:04:01.259> also<00:04:01.470> goes<00:04:01.889> saw<00:04:02.159> the<00:04:02.220> grabs<00:04:02.699> when

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
these thing also goes saw the grabs when

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.009 
these thing also goes saw the grabs when
you're<00:04:03.090> trying<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.329> move<00:04:03.479> onto<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.780> next<00:04:03.840> peg

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
you're trying to move onto the next peg

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.589 
you're trying to move onto the next peg
and<00:04:07.250> here<00:04:08.250> we<00:04:08.370> are<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.790> spiral<00:04:09.239> warp<00:04:09.389> and

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
and here we are the spiral warp and

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.140 
and here we are the spiral warp and
frank<00:04:09.959> philly<00:04:10.259> yet<00:04:10.530> there's<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.549> loophole

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
frank philly yet there's a loophole

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.999 
frank philly yet there's a loophole
there<00:04:12.449> so<00:04:12.569> we<00:04:12.659> could<00:04:12.750> just<00:04:12.810> jump<00:04:13.139> on<00:04:13.409> through

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:14.009 
there so we could just jump on through

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:17.920 
there so we could just jump on through
that

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.499

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
and back we go to the real world back to

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:28.020 
and back we go to the real world back to
the<00:04:23.660> future<00:04:23.900> but<00:04:24.650> other<00:04:24.800> futures<00:04:25.190> reality

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
great variety about as many kids but

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.689 
great variety about as many kids but
this<00:04:57.500> one's<00:04:57.710> slightly<00:04:57.979> different<00:04:58.460> each<00:04:58.550> and

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
different size of boughs let us could

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.409 
different size of boughs let us could
see<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.750> got<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.020> pretty<00:05:03.259> small<00:05:03.650> wad<00:05:03.949> so<00:05:04.280> most<00:05:05.270> of

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
see I got a pretty small wad so most of

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.350 
see I got a pretty small wad so most of
the<00:05:05.479> bowels<00:05:05.870> of<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.669> most<00:05:07.669> of<00:05:07.789> the<00:05:07.849> bananas

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
the bowels of the most of the bananas

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.629 
the bowels of the most of the bananas
what<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.050> bounced<00:05:09.320> off<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.590> bowel<00:05:09.919> so<00:05:10.250> you

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
what it bounced off the bowel so you

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.159 
what it bounced off the bowel so you
won't<00:05:10.880> be<00:05:11.000> able<00:05:11.120> to<00:05:11.300> get<00:05:11.389> as<00:05:11.539> many<00:05:11.660> lives<00:05:11.990> as

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
won't be able to get as many lives as

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.939 
won't be able to get as many lives as
you<00:05:12.229> could<00:05:12.470> do<00:05:12.680> if<00:05:12.889> you<00:05:12.919> got<00:05:13.729> a<00:05:13.970> gigantic<00:05:14.539> bowel

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
you could do if you got a gigantic bowel

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.520 
you could do if you got a gigantic bowel
now<00:05:15.949> this<00:05:16.940> may<00:05:17.180> be<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.449> last<00:05:17.479> time<00:05:18.020> you<00:05:18.320> see
