00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
for this for a long time I think we've

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.399 
for this for a long time I think we've
been<00:02:03.549> pretty<00:02:04.000> strong<00:02:04.270> this<00:02:04.450> year<00:02:04.630> but<00:02:04.840> we've

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
been pretty strong this year but we've

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.980 
been pretty strong this year but we've
been<00:02:05.530> unable<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.830> finish<00:02:06.159> first<00:02:07.119> because<00:02:07.600> of

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
been unable to finish first because of

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.040 
been unable to finish first because of
some<00:02:08.470> mechanical<00:02:09.340> issue<00:02:09.630> some<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.959> other

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
some mechanical issue some of the other

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.199 
some mechanical issue some of the other
and<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:12.069> rabble<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.430> doing<00:02:12.610> pretty<00:02:12.700> good<00:02:12.940> I

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
and this rabble is doing pretty good I

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.550 
and this rabble is doing pretty good I
think<00:02:14.160> it's<00:02:15.160> it's<00:02:15.730> been<00:02:15.910> pretty<00:02:16.560> consistent

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
think it's it's been pretty consistent

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.710 
think it's it's been pretty consistent
from<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.800> start<00:02:18.280> as<00:02:18.670> far<00:02:18.880> as<00:02:19.030> our<00:02:19.120> group<00:02:19.330> n<00:02:19.510> was

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
from the start as far as our group n was

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.350 
from the start as far as our group n was
concerned<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.230> think<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:20.860> did<00:02:21.040> good<00:02:21.819> times<00:02:22.090> and

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
concerned I think we did good times and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.380 
concerned I think we did good times and
I'm<00:02:23.260> pretty<00:02:23.410> happy<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:29.550> rally<00:02:30.550> Queensland<00:02:31.239> has
