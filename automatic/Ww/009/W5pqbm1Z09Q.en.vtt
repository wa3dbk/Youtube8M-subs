00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.089
 do not 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.280
 with people here we are in 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.160
 good indianÃ¡polis has finished the race 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.900
 many photos many interviews but 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.700
 now I have the time to be calm and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.930
 be all for you for clues 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.630
 argentinas and for all argentina 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.030
 the truth an incredible warrior had 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.410
 a lot of faith since the end of 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.800
 week that could be given a very good 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.380
 career 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.970
 same as yesterday we won the engine but we 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.349
 it lacked a little power we charge 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.079
 from behind they penalized us by starting 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.480
 last he also had a lot of faith for 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.280
 that I wrote on my twitter comes the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.909
 historical comeback because really 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.680
 ascended and good was given so I am a 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.690
 fantastic claw from behind 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.120
 I had to use much strategy to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.949
 head 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.440
 winning many positions at the beginning 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.840
 after a red flag I'm leaving 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.449
 seventh and when the renewal of 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.129
 the race suffered a little bit with food 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.379
 of tail half of race three quarters 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.629
 so I remembered the words of the 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.949
 engineer that told me came the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.720
 we gave ourselves races in the last five 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.210
 laps except the rubbers and good was what 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.830
 what I did I kept patience in the fifth 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.460
 place and the last five laps the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.909
 self stabilized better I could have a 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.259
 good good alliances the straight ones create 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.509
 important so the curve was going 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.729
 fast back and well the car was 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.280
 Stable could advance up to fourth and 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.170
 third second and good in the last 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.750
 two turns a greater outside I could 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.940
 give the first position in a cute 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.060
 maneuver and they will win the 100 miles of 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.340
 Indianapolis so you can imagine what 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.950
 happy that I am grateful to all the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.780
 Argentine people who came here to see me in 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.700

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.759

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.260
