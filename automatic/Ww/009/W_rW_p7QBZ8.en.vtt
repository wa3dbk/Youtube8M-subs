00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.609
 hello how will you have heard rowing big te 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.650
 makes you lose weight without stopping eating 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.990
 we want to explain briefly how 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.450
 works the energy that our body 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.980
 you need to do your activities you 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.440
 produces thanks to mitochondria 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.780
 of each of our cells take out 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.300
 benefit of carbohydrates proteins 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.160
 and fats that we consume daily at 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.960
 produce this energy are released 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.990
 harmful molecules for our body 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.699
 called free radicals however 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.590
 these are neutralized by the 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.809
 natural antioxidants of our 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.579
 body that cover our cells with 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.069
 a layer that protects them so that 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.319
 free radicals do not kill them with the 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:43.600
 the passage of time as we get older and 

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:46.030
 we have bad eating habits and a 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.399
 sedentary life the body decreases the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.870
 production of antioxidants and therefore 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.329
 the protection of our cells 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.760
 generating important changes in our 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.100
 metabolism facilitating the appearance of 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.649
 diseases such as obesity and 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.989
 diabetes you knew that seven of each 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.809
 ten Mexicans suffer from overweight and 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.610
 Obesity is why we supplement or 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.220
 help the body to restore 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.920
 levels 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.690
 and oxidants is of paramount importance 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.420
 even becoming a necessity 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.220
 for our health I removed that is a 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.440
 product based on antioxidants 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.750
 which helps to supplement 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.950
 antioxidants to our body for 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.440
 that the cells of our body 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.420
 work correctly 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.880
 antioxidants that contains remove 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.860
 after several weeks they will help 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.770
 our body use its reserves of 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.780
 fat and sugars I removed that will help 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.060
 that our cells burn these fats 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.430
 and these sugars one more way 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.800
 efficient so they can be used 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.380
 to produce energy can reach 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.690
 feel a slight warm sensation of 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.550
 this way little by little it will burn 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.280
 the fat stored in our body 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.790
 managing to reduce measures and weight in little 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.960
 time now that you know how it works 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.960
 what are you waiting for?
