00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.110
 So the guys in this video I'm going 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.610
 showing next metalcore pedal and one 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.510
 pedal for who wants to get a sound 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.309
 heavy 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.500
 I do not think it is criminal for the public 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.110
 Heavy metal some things called me 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.900
 attention in this criminal is that you have 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.660
 two very distinct voices follow the voice 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.000
 no and voice two were not one you go 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.130
 have a team rich in minerals and voice 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.599
 2, will you have a coffee in that? 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.520
 frequency and averages 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.380
 another cool thing is you have the function 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.350
 all and locke where you can be 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.550
 saving your configuration also calls 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.470
 Special attention 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.510
 the fact that when work is earned 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.060
 underneath it behaves quite nicely 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.850
 generally chemically blood 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.130
 metal pedals when you work with 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.470
 gain low they get very compressed 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.150
 the sound becomes very bad and the 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.830
 metalcore I think it's cool that he 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.670
 still managed to maintain a balanced and well- 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.860
 interesting 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.550
 that's it folks we're going to hear the sound 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.550
 of Spanish then 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:14.070
 and that's it 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.070
 it is 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 is 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 is 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.470
 it's mine and mine 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.060
 and it is also 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.130
 i 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.650
 is the 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.740
 is 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.050
 is 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.099
 is 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.680
 i 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.970
