00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.610
 hello still all welcome once again 

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:05.290
 this channel is this time I want you 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.230
 do a review give my opinion on 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.620
 this base of puyol who are called god the 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.620
 6 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.440
 because this mass came out a few months ago in 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.240
 one of the collections that is over already 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.050
 that is continuously taking news 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.730
 You already know and well you know that I 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.590
 like a lot huelva in the brand 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.330
 let's say chanel white has a lot 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.000
 connection with them and that I notice it in 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.820
 Regarding quality 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.290
 this base is born with the concept of skin 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.210
 naked let's say the feeling of not 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.340
 carry nothing on the skin and a bag for 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.620
 so super light and has a 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.910
 texture of this type of texture already 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.460
 has previously tested in another type of 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.350
 base on other brands and to me is a 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.470
 texture that I like a lot what 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.199
 happens is that it tends to cover little and 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.300
 it also tends to mark as not 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.550
 we extend well may tend to mark a 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.559
 little what are the pores and wrinkles 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.470
 expression lines then a basis 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.710
 that in my opinion so first would not go 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.270
 very very well in dry skins in skins 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.560
 mixed fats I think these textures 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.280
 they go very well indeed when I have 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.410
 had the most oily skin that now the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.060
 mousse the bases in mousse were going very 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.520
 very good really well I already tell you that 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.780
 it cost some of these textures and 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.580
 they have always worked well for me 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.890
 apart from the light ones that are 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.050
 I like how they spread out easy and I 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.720
 like that they are bases that tend to 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.140
 be a little bit more dull and not 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.420
 They bring weight to the skin 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.979
 the base apart from matching the tone of the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.090
 skin that I will now talk about the coverage 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.070
 has smoothing technology then 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.470
 smoothes the texture of the skin a little 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.760
 smoothes what the pores are and smoothes the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.800
 small line of expression 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.750
 that yes in very dry skins when it takes 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.580
 a little while it costs I think it tends to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.770
 get a bit of danger because the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.080
 feeling that gives me for my skin goes 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.970
 great I have mixed skin and for me the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.440
 feeling is very very very nice 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.270
 nothing heavy very good aspect that yes me 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.570
 missing a point of coverage to me that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.820
 I have spots the most fat spot 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.410
 let's say no of the covers then yes 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.670
 I tell you that it is modulable then I 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.010
 What I do is that he applied a second layer 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.660
 or in the most conflictive areas what 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.010
 I do that he applied a little touch to 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.410
 that there is a little more product left and 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.940
 cover me even more so the spots that 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.410
 I have in this area that I have left 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.810
 during pregnancy they are now a 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.370
 little bit so visible 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.080
 I need a separate proofreader to 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.459
 can cover them but what are the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.019
 spots of the upper lip area 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.550
 and such that it covers me giving in that 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.350
 area a little touches instead of extending 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.870
 more than the account for 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.490
 what other products applied and so 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.770
 So much so, it covers a little bit more. 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.620
 without giving heavy skin feeling or 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.450
 recharged on my skin is a base that does not 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.520
 it dried up this tells me in advertising 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.470
 It does not dry up and I tell you that in my 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.900
 skin does not dry up I do not even notice 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.880
 I do not even have a skin with 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.410
 tight feeling or anything but also 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.110
 true that he has not tried on skins 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.550
 dry I still do not have to prove it in 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.800
 my mother what I do with all these 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.220
 things to know how such ivory is dry 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.550
 Anyway , dry skin 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.130
 I say it because I have proof that 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.140
 dry skin does not support this 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.820
 type of bases in mousse otherwise not 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.500
 I speak from experience for nothing 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.680
 because my skin is not dry I tell you 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.990
 then but that's what the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.400
 brand advertising also tell you 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.400
 that do not comedogenic that this I what 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.380
 question there are many people or is it not going 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.110
 to clog pores 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.510
 and there are four shades of these bases there 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.840
 four tones this is the third let's say 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.210
 there are two more clear this and a fourth one 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.530
 little bit darker and even though I 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.240
 I always get the lighter shades 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.280
 As you can see, this is what I have left right now 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.650
 quite natural although it would give me a 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.750
 tonito let's say I think a torito more 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.640
 of mine but now for summer it's going 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.770
 great and the hand work dark because yes 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.750
 with a little bit of sun that I ground them but 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.790
 good to go mixing but this is the 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.860
 I'm wearing it right now and as you see 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.810
 Well, it's quite natural for me 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.030
 applied so you can see how it is and 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.920
 right now it took it as it falls without 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.390
 powders the only thing that I've put a 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.280
 little bit of corrector in this area like 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.140
 I told you that it does not cover me well but what 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.880
 you will see how it is applied and how much 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.880
 covers leaves you with that bit of video 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.420
 never kill you 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.240
 How are you going to ask me if you have 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.340
 led dimethicone silicone is something 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.440
 that does not take away my sleep either 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.170
 hot yes but 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.790
 I have read a lot about this and I know that 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.440
 silicones leading cosmetics 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.320
 today more what are the means 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.020
 minimum are polymers that do not clog 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.390
 the pores that if they are not well then but 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.240
 that if they are neither I am going to put myself 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.030
 very bad or anything with that topic and also 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.220
 then dimethicone what makes the 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.050
 skin is smooth let's say the feeling 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.320
 optics that the skin is smooth and that 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.780
 pores and fine lines as 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.350
 they are made and they are not noticed so much so 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.969
 if you have dimethicone and well I'll 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.839
 teach how it is 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.399
 well in a plastic cart but 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:57.029
 pretty hard on the glass of its lid 

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:59.279
 plastic and it's rock would open like 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:01.979
 threads and has a texture like demos 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:04.080
 as you can see here very very very light 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.610
 and I explain if it is 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.610
 it extends very easily 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.080
 and I like to apply it with a 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:16.580
 brush type kabuki or with a sponge 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.580
 of makeup if I want more coverage 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.410
 I'm going to leave photos and all the rest 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:37.730
 information on the blog 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.620
 in the photos you can see more clearly 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.139
 exactly the coverage and you can see 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.340
 the tone there is a little more detail 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.660
 so I leave everything in the little box 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.730
 information and also takes us there 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.889
 where can you buy it where I have 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.090
 I found the best price and nothing else 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:51.650
 which I hope would have resulted 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.900
 interesting if he was living it 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.639
 strangers you asked that such and nothing else 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.360
 Thank you so much for watching me see you 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:58.360
 the next video
