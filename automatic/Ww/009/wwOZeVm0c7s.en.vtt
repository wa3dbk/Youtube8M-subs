interfaces of any computer game that you

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.550 
interfaces of any computer game that you
can<00:01:09.790> imagine<00:01:10.030> because<00:01:10.660> all<00:01:10.930> you<00:01:11.080> really<00:01:11.229> do<00:01:11.530> is

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
can imagine because all you really do is

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.320 
can imagine because all you really do is
the<00:01:11.920> players<00:01:12.190> you<00:01:12.490> just<00:01:12.520> move<00:01:13.119> your<00:01:13.270> mouse

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
the players you just move your mouse

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.270 
the players you just move your mouse
over<00:01:13.690> something<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.320> you<00:01:14.380> click<00:01:14.590> on<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:14.830> and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
over something and you click on it and

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.740 
over something and you click on it and
we<00:01:15.550> haven't<00:01:15.729> changed<00:01:16.180> that<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.650> at<00:01:17.830> all<00:01:17.979> so

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
we haven't changed that that at all so

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.150 
we haven't changed that that at all so
what<00:01:19.750> we've<00:01:19.960> really<00:01:20.260> done<00:01:20.410> actually<00:01:20.680> is<00:01:20.979> we've

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
what we've really done actually is we've

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.950 
what we've really done actually is we've
condensed<00:01:21.790> some<00:01:21.970> of<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.180> interactions<00:01:22.780> so

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
condensed some of the interactions so

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.900 
condensed some of the interactions so
that<00:01:23.140> when<00:01:23.260> you<00:01:23.350> click<00:01:23.590> on<00:01:23.740> something<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:24.490> you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
that when you click on something and you

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.609 
that when you click on something and you
look<00:01:25.090> at<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.360> menu<00:01:25.690> of<00:01:25.840> possibilities

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
look at the menu of possibilities

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.040 
look at the menu of possibilities
there's<00:01:27.610> fewer<00:01:27.940> for<00:01:28.270> any<00:01:28.420> given<00:01:28.750> thing<00:01:28.900> that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
there's fewer for any given thing that

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.050 
there's fewer for any given thing that
you<00:01:29.140> click<00:01:29.380> on<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.490> there<00:01:30.640> they're

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
you click on and and there they're

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.969 
you click on and and there they're
really<00:01:31.869> especially<00:01:32.320> in<00:01:32.619> terms<00:01:32.770> of

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
really especially in terms of

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.190 
really especially in terms of
socializing<00:01:33.760> it's<00:01:34.060> more<00:01:34.330> about<00:01:34.540> emotion<00:01:35.050> and

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
socializing it's more about emotion and

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.740 
socializing it's more about emotion and
less<00:01:35.410> about<00:01:35.740> choosing<00:01:36.460> specific<00:01:37.060> features

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.410 

when<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.899> play<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.320> sims<00:01:44.530> 3<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:46.000> know<00:01:46.090> as<00:01:46.240> a

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
when you play the sims 3 you know as a

when you play the sims 3 you know as a

town will develop like real people and
that's<00:01:53.439> really<00:01:53.740> part<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.130> appeal<00:01:54.729> of<00:01:54.789> the

that's really part of the appeal of the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.560 
that's really part of the appeal of the
game<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.649> that<00:01:56.679> the<00:01:57.640> town<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.119> play<00:01:58.360> in

for you we you know we we've got
artificial<00:02:16.989> intelligence<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.709> drives<00:02:18.370> all

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
artificial intelligence that drives all

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.880 
artificial intelligence that drives all
of<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.970> other<00:02:19.090> characters<00:02:19.599> for<00:02:19.840> work<00:02:20.049> so<00:02:20.590> that

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
of the other characters for work so that

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.740 
of the other characters for work so that
you<00:02:21.400> never<00:02:21.580> have<00:02:21.849> these<00:02:22.060> breaks<00:02:22.540> and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
you never have these breaks and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.280 
you never have these breaks and
continuity<00:02:23.410> where<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.849> so<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.840> all<00:02:26.049> of<00:02:26.080> the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
continuity where and so that all of the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.900 
continuity where and so that all of the
stories<00:02:27.069> you're<00:02:27.190> trying<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.549> tell<00:02:27.730> are

something that you have seen before in

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.390 
something that you have seen before in
games<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:23.360> really<00:03:23.900> what<00:03:24.050> we've<00:03:24.170> done<00:03:24.380> is<00:03:24.709> every

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
games so really what we've done is every

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.000 
games so really what we've done is every
feature<00:03:25.580> that<00:03:25.970> we've<00:03:26.180> put<00:03:26.480> into<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.810> game<00:03:27.020> is

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
feature that we've put into the game is

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.680 
feature that we've put into the game is
part<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.489> an<00:03:28.580> attempt<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:28.970> make<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.450> place

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
part of an attempt to make the place

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.990 
part of an attempt to make the place
that<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.080> live<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:31.400> stories<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.790> you

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
that you live and the stories that you

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.690 
that you live and the stories that you
can<00:03:32.180> create<00:03:32.420> as<00:03:32.690> complete<00:03:33.200> as<00:03:33.350> possible<00:03:33.700> so

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
can create as complete as possible so

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.460 
can create as complete as possible so
that<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.910> have<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.630> completely<00:03:36.170> believable

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
that you have a completely believable

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.680 
that you have a completely believable
fiction<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.250> that<00:03:37.340> you're<00:03:37.520> entirely<00:03:37.910> in

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
fiction and that you're entirely in

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.090 
fiction and that you're entirely in
control<00:03:39.290> as<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.650> player<00:03:39.920> so<00:03:41.380> so<00:03:42.380> that's<00:03:42.590> really

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
control as a player so so that's really

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.070 
control as a player so so that's really
the<00:03:43.280> reason<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:44.030> reasoning<00:03:44.330> behind<00:03:44.420> the

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
the reason the reasoning behind the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.949 
the reason the reasoning behind the
things<00:03:45.260> you'll<00:03:45.440> find<00:03:45.470> in<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.860> game<00:03:46.040> and

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
things you'll find in the game and

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.690 
things you'll find in the game and
you'll<00:03:47.959> really<00:03:48.170> find<00:03:48.350> a<00:03:48.470> blend<00:03:48.709> of<00:03:48.950> kind<00:03:49.640> of

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
you'll really find a blend of kind of

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:58.620 
you'll really find a blend of kind of
the<00:03:49.790> best<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:51.440> previous<00:03:51.830> Sims<00:03:52.040> games

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.720 

you<00:03:59.630> know<00:03:59.720> in<00:03:59.870> fact<00:04:00.080> I<00:04:00.230> think<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.710> because<00:04:01.610> of

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
you know in fact I think that because of

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.180 
you know in fact I think that because of
some<00:04:01.940> of<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.240> new<00:04:02.630> features<00:04:03.590> we've<00:04:03.800> added<00:04:03.920> to

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
some of the new features we've added to

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.090 
some of the new features we've added to
the<00:04:04.280> sims<00:04:04.520> 3<00:04:04.610> that<00:04:05.510> there's<00:04:05.750> actually<00:04:06.100> almost

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
the sims 3 that there's actually almost

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.130 
the sims 3 that there's actually almost
like<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.400> deeper<00:04:07.910> richer<00:04:08.090> kind<00:04:08.720> of<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.870> humor

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
like a deeper richer kind of a humor

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.440 
like a deeper richer kind of a humor
that's<00:04:09.320> possible<00:04:09.830> so<00:04:10.150> because<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.300> can

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
that's possible so because you can

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.420 
that's possible so because you can
create<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:12.320> personalities<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.190> your

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
create the personalities of your

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.670 
create the personalities of your
characters<00:04:13.880> with<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:14.330> much<00:04:14.510> detail<00:04:14.750> now<00:04:15.470> it's

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
characters with so much detail now it's

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.319 
characters with so much detail now it's
possible<00:04:16.220> for<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.579> create<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:17.030> situation

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
possible for you to create a situation

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.220 
possible for you to create a situation
like<00:04:18.230> a<00:04:18.260> writer<00:04:18.650> would<00:04:18.859> in<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.130> book<00:04:19.310> or<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:20.989> TV

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
like a writer would in a book or in a TV

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.070 
like a writer would in a book or in a TV
play<00:04:22.160> or<00:04:22.430> in<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.640> screenplay<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.390> you<00:04:23.810> can<00:04:23.930> put

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
play or in a screenplay and you can put

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.570 
play or in a screenplay and you can put
those<00:04:24.230> characters<00:04:24.680> into<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.070> world<00:04:25.280> and

those characters into the world and

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.100 
those characters into the world and
incredibly<00:04:26.330> funny<00:04:26.540> things<00:04:26.810> will<00:04:26.990> happen

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
incredibly funny things will happen

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.030 
incredibly funny things will happen
between<00:04:27.440> them<00:04:27.800> so<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:30.140> very<00:04:30.440> slapstick

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
between them so the the very slapstick

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.070 
between them so the the very slapstick
humor<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.610> very<00:04:31.760> obvious<00:04:31.940> humor<00:04:32.450> is<00:04:32.630> still

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
there but there's actually a much deeper

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.150 
there but there's actually a much deeper
