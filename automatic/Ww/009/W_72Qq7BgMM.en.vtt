gas<00:02:52.420> but<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:53.019> don't<00:02:53.290> think<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.769> all<00:02:53.920> quite

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
gas but I don't think that all quite

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.300 
gas but I don't think that all quite
work<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:56.110> as<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.530> see<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.860> is<00:02:57.010> an

work but as you can see it is an
absolutely<00:02:57.910> awesome<00:02:58.330> trampoline<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.680> I

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
absolutely awesome trampoline that I

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.820 
absolutely awesome trampoline that I
felt<00:03:00.130> with<00:03:00.340> these<00:03:00.580> gravitational<00:03:01.830> pistons

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
felt with these gravitational pistons

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.550 
felt with these gravitational pistons
and<00:03:03.010> they<00:03:03.400> are<00:03:03.580> free<00:03:03.910> thanks<00:03:04.870> daddy<00:03:05.230> another

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
and they are free thanks daddy another

and they are free thanks daddy another
thing<00:03:05.769> I'm<00:03:05.890> going<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.100> show<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.400> about<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.790> ma

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
thing I'm going to show you about the ma

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.720 
thing I'm going to show you about the ma
just<00:03:07.239> very<00:03:07.480> quickly<00:03:07.860> just<00:03:08.860> go<00:03:09.100> outside<00:03:09.250> from

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
just very quickly just go outside from

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.039 
just very quickly just go outside from
the<00:03:09.760> trampoline<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.480> then<00:03:10.600> we'll<00:03:10.720> get<00:03:10.840> have

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
the trampoline and then we'll get have

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.009 
the trampoline and then we'll get have
some<00:03:11.260> more<00:03:11.440> fun<00:03:11.650> with<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:12.010> don't<00:03:12.190> worry<00:03:13.019> why

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
some more fun with it don't worry why

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.340 
some more fun with it don't worry why
would<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:14.320> not<00:03:14.530> have<00:03:14.829> fun<00:03:15.190> with<00:03:15.489> that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
would we not have fun with that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.539 
would we not have fun with that
seriously<00:03:17.350> I'm<00:03:17.799> going<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.010> be<00:03:18.070> spawning<00:03:18.310> some

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
seriously I'm going to be spawning some

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.039 
seriously I'm going to be spawning some
mushrooms<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.209> there<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.570> stuff<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:19.959> it's

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
mushrooms in there and stuff so it's

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.380 
mushrooms in there and stuff so it's
going<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.200> be<00:03:20.320> pretty<00:03:20.620> dang<00:03:21.160> awesome<00:03:21.340> but<00:03:22.239> the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
going to be pretty dang awesome but the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.590 
going to be pretty dang awesome but the
mod<00:03:22.630> also<00:03:22.870> gives<00:03:23.380> these<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:26.040> I'll<00:03:27.040> get<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.880> whole

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
mod also gives these so I'll get a whole

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.970 
mod also gives these so I'll get a whole
stack<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:28.930> each<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.120> can<00:03:31.390> show<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:32.500> this

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
stack of each so I can show you so this

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.350 
stack of each so I can show you so this
is<00:03:33.340> basically<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:36.010> have<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.430> normal<00:03:36.730> places<00:03:37.120> in

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
is basically you have a normal places in

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.210 
is basically you have a normal places in
the<00:03:37.450> sticky<00:03:37.870> piston<00:03:38.350> for<00:03:38.590> each<00:03:38.680> variation

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
the sticky piston for each variation

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.410 
the sticky piston for each variation
which<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:39.970> pretty<00:03:40.390> dang<00:03:40.930> awesome<00:03:41.140> i<00:03:41.530> think<00:03:41.829> and

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
which is pretty dang awesome i think and

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
which is pretty dang awesome i think and
basically<00:03:43.420> if<00:03:43.780> i<00:03:43.870> get<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.049> whole<00:03:44.260> lot<00:03:44.290> of

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
basically if i get a whole lot of

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.340 
basically if i get a whole lot of
leavers<00:03:44.829> or<00:03:45.250> something<00:03:47.100> okay<00:03:48.420> leave<00:03:49.420> us<00:03:49.660> okay

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
leavers or something okay leave us okay

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.580 
leavers or something okay leave us okay
so<00:03:51.340> this<00:03:51.760> one<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.480> double<00:03:52.870> piston<00:03:53.079> because

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
so this one is a double piston because

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.979 
so this one is a double piston because
it<00:03:53.709> goes<00:03:53.890> two<00:03:54.280> blocks<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.150> this<00:03:55.269> is<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.480> sticky

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
it goes two blocks and this is a sticky

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.069 
it goes two blocks and this is a sticky
one<00:03:56.140> this<00:03:57.040> one<00:03:57.280> goes<00:03:57.430> free<00:03:57.970> blocks<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:58.720> this

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
one this one goes free blocks and this

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.550 
one this one goes free blocks and this
one<00:03:59.380> goes<00:03:59.820> for<00:04:00.820> blocks<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.450> basically<00:04:02.260> these

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
one goes for blocks and basically these

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.199 
one goes for blocks and basically these
are<00:04:02.620> just<00:04:02.980> sticky<00:04:03.310> one<00:04:03.609> so<00:04:03.850> they<00:04:04.000> are

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
are just sticky one so they are

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.539 
are just sticky one so they are
absolutely<00:04:05.019> awesome<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:05.890> I'm<00:04:05.980> gonna<00:04:06.280> lie

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
absolutely awesome and I'm gonna lie

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.710 
absolutely awesome and I'm gonna lie
that<00:04:07.359> is<00:04:07.690> going<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.959> make<00:04:09.120> pistons<00:04:10.120> absolutely

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
that is going to make pistons absolutely

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.619 
that is going to make pistons absolutely
awesome<00:04:10.930> so<00:04:11.320> those<00:04:11.590> are<00:04:11.920> I<00:04:12.400> don't<00:04:13.330> know<00:04:13.420> how<00:04:13.569> to

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
awesome so those are I don't know how to

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.430 
awesome so those are I don't know how to
actually<00:04:14.290> crash<00:04:14.800> them<00:04:15.190> which<00:04:15.670> is<00:04:16.440> slightly

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
actually crash them which is slightly

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.960 
actually crash them which is slightly
annoying<00:04:17.919> I<00:04:18.220> know<00:04:18.280> but

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
annoying I know but

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.720 
annoying I know but
maybe<00:04:19.420> I'm<00:04:19.690> showcasing<00:04:19.989> is<00:04:20.769> this<00:04:21.100> quite

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
maybe I'm showcasing is this quite

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.570 
maybe I'm showcasing is this quite
awesome<00:04:22.330> trampoline<00:04:22.620> which<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.770> just<00:04:24.010> built<00:04:24.250> in

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
awesome trampoline which I just built in

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.880 
awesome trampoline which I just built in
mic<00:04:24.820> mere<00:04:25.300> seconds<00:04:25.900> with<00:04:26.170> worldedit<00:04:26.560> and

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
mic mere seconds with worldedit and

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.990 
mic mere seconds with worldedit and
stuff<00:04:27.130> so<00:04:27.340> it's<00:04:27.490> not<00:04:27.820> that<00:04:28.510> hard<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.900> do<00:04:29.170> and

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
stuff so it's not that hard to do and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.390 
stuff so it's not that hard to do and
I'm<00:04:31.000> just<00:04:31.180> gonna<00:04:31.360> spawn<00:04:32.320> some<00:04:32.650> mushrooms<00:04:33.160> in

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
I'm just gonna spawn some mushrooms in

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.400 
I'm just gonna spawn some mushrooms in
here<00:04:33.670> good<00:04:34.480> mushrooms<00:04:35.110> even<00:04:35.620> mushrooms<00:04:37.410> yeah

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.310 
use mushroom now you're just gonna find
the<00:04:52.690> idea<00:04:52.960> for<00:04:53.200> the<00:04:53.500> ID<00:04:54.480> mushroom<00:04:55.480> cow<00:04:55.840> you<00:04:55.900> see

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
the idea for the ID mushroom cow you see

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.280 
the idea for the ID mushroom cow you see
there<00:04:56.530> we<00:04:56.620> go<00:04:56.770> i<00:04:56.800> mean<00:04:57.190> i<00:04:57.540> would<00:04:58.540> never<00:04:59.140> have

there we go i mean i would never have
guessed<00:04:59.500> that<00:04:59.710> at<00:05:00.010> all<00:05:00.360> mushroom<00:05:01.360> cow<00:05:03.690> thirsty

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
guessed that at all mushroom cow thirsty

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.930 
guessed that at all mushroom cow thirsty
there<00:05:05.140> we<00:05:05.350> go<00:05:05.560> that's<00:05:06.250> what<00:05:06.430> we're<00:05:06.550> talking
