00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.409
 collapsed and an internet user told me from the 21st century maybe to 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.559
 you this video is very very old it happens saying fashionable but for the people 

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:21.779
 of my time this was something 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.859
 published designed the chopper and developer 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.460
 not on June 5, 2008, by a young Peruvian 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.570
 the language that dominates 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.460
 It's not Spanish 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.460
 public since the 21st century after Christ 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.750
 today I will talk about the existence of extraterrestrials and their men 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.730
 I tell you that this video is totally legal it does not surprise me that those ships 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.370
 flying are created by the human being 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.100
 to the question is this we, more than 200 years ago, did not know it was 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
 a television, let alone the computer 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.760
 everything has evolved flatly 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.680
 no wonder that I did about five thousand years maybe more maybe less the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.720
 man has created a time machine like the one we see on the screen the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.810
 which is shaped like a spaceship when created to navigate the universe 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.759
 is that perhaps 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.160
 they do not realize that time is passing 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.550
 it's us but we come from a very distant future so is this 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.000
 affirmative then UFOs are nothing more than our creations but that 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 they came to our newspaper from another time from a much more advanced time 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.200
 of the year 54,600 after Christ we would have to wait fifty thousand 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.070
 years to know that japan has designed an exclusive flying device 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.930
 for the NASA that would serve to further exploit the universe and also 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.270
 analyze our past time in summary how will heavey with our 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.020
 21st century 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.730
 the image is accidental year 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.460
 and traveling in one of those personalized portal careers and to top it all you have 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.550
 the ease of doing his universal history tasks I can only speak to him 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.180
 to the machine 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.570
 she who came to say what you want 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.610
 we have examples 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.540
 based on this that is happening in the 200th century after Christ in your 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.990
 body that exist flying cars computer within facility 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.559
 of watching television they communicate home from 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.579
 will last more than five thousand miles 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.839
 it's a true boom 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.229
 Now imagine you had 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.979
 also the company in which he works has finished the project of all his 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.889
 life the creation of spaceships with the ease of traveling through time 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.059
 but you only have these rules of use that nobody knows anything well 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:38.169
 dcns of the 21st century and for your parents up heads in a bay along with your 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:42.849
 mate down those strange people in men of that age you marvel 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.249
 you come back to your time 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.540
 that's what happens really we live in a world 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.360
 point where every day something new is discovered it does not surprise me that from here 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.620
 in a few years we can travel with the universe to see how the planets are 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.100
 active and live and that that is totally normal for us not me 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.310
 strange that in five thousand years we have learned to fly by 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.490
 the heavens although we have developed a flying ship with a strange shape 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.880
 which is totally foreign to the people of this era 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.379
 the lifting 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.639
 it's easy god created the entire universe we had to go through a lot 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.029
 tests put by the inti so we come to the 20th century 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.409
 n &amp; p - many facilities that do not 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.329
 a man on this planet had 200 years ago and after the year 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.629
 in the 32 thousand 220 we are taking flying cars to get home the cars 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.009
 of this century they became extinct 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:43.339
 they still continue with their investigations but we already have the facility to travel through the 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.849
 time and even know what the galaxy really is like 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:52.279
 nobody is the author of this nobody has the right to steal my idea if you are going to create 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:56.949
 a book about that documentary, believe it as it is and give me the credits and 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.779
 that they 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:03:59.860
 good 20th century 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.860
 1 I am the true author of these words and video 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.729
 the people of my time I took for crazy but these facts 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.719
 you will see 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.180
 thank you so much for listening to my words
