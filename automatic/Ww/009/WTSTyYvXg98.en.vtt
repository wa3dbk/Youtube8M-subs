so first day we ended up going out in
let's<00:01:47.280> describe<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.030> went<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
let's describe I think we went to a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.780 
let's describe I think we went to a
shisha<00:01:48.750> bar<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.960> couple<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.500> pubs<00:01:49.740> ended<00:01:50.670> up

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
shisha bar a couple of pubs ended up

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
shisha bar a couple of pubs ended up
coming<00:01:51.060> around<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.509> around<00:01:51.810> twelve<00:01:52.079> o'clock

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
coming around back around twelve o'clock

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.590 
coming around back around twelve o'clock
or<00:01:52.500> something<00:01:52.770> because<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.479> because<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
or something because and because the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.910 
or something because and because the
tube<00:01:54.810> stop<00:01:55.020> running<00:01:55.290> around<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.799> he

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
tube stop running around then so he

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.530 
tube stop running around then so he
needs<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.159> get<00:01:56.250> back<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.549> always<00:01:56.850> caught<00:01:57.060> so

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
needs to get back to always caught so

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.780 
needs to get back to always caught so

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.089 
of drinks which was really good fun
quite<00:03:10.750> quite<00:03:11.049> quiet<00:03:11.409> night<00:03:11.620> actually<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.010> think

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
quite quite quiet night actually I think

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.710 
quite quite quiet night actually I think
we<00:03:12.310> went<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.519> had<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> burger<00:03:13.120> somewhere<00:03:13.510> and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
we went to had a burger somewhere and

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.629 
we went to had a burger somewhere and
then<00:03:13.810> came<00:03:14.019> back<00:03:14.260> but<00:03:14.530> Saturday<00:03:15.220> was<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.430> day

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
then came back but Saturday was the day

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.920 
then came back but Saturday was the day
we<00:03:15.790> were<00:03:15.880> expecting<00:03:16.299> to<00:03:16.359> have<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.510> really<00:03:16.810> heavy

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
we were expecting to have a really heavy

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.150 
we were expecting to have a really heavy
night<00:03:17.139> so<00:03:17.319> I<00:03:17.380> think<00:03:17.440> we<00:03:17.620> were<00:03:17.709> all<00:03:17.739> saving

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
night so I think we were all saving

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.190 
night so I think we were all saving
ourselves<00:03:18.250> for<00:03:18.579> that<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.000> obviously<00:03:19.840> we<00:03:20.049> went

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
ourselves for that and obviously we went

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.930 
ourselves for that and obviously we went
on<00:03:20.349> the<00:03:20.440> Saturday<00:03:20.859> met<00:03:21.340> up<00:03:21.459> with<00:03:21.639> actually

people there to play against and it was
like<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.060> something<00:04:32.660> that<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:32.930> had<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.139> chance<00:04:33.440> to

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
like a something that I had a chance to

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.930 
like a something that I had a chance to
do<00:04:33.770> because<00:04:34.040> we<00:04:34.160> were<00:04:34.280> at<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.490> casino

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
do because we were at the casino

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.280 
do because we were at the casino
Bateson's<00:04:35.360> like<00:04:35.510> yeah<00:04:35.690> we'll<00:04:35.870> jump<00:04:36.050> on<00:04:36.200> the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
Bateson's like yeah we'll jump on the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.650 
Bateson's like yeah we'll jump on the
table<00:04:36.590> together<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:37.090> we'll<00:04:38.090> go<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.360> limits

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
table together and we'll go the limits

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.720 
table together and we'll go the limits
were<00:04:38.870> probably<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.350> bit<00:04:39.800> too<00:04:39.830> high<00:04:40.340> for<00:04:40.610> me<00:04:40.700> I

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
were probably a bit too high for me I

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.070 
were probably a bit too high for me I
thought<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.330> sort<00:04:41.570> of<00:04:41.630> pushed<00:04:41.810> me<00:04:41.930> out<00:04:41.960> of

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
thought that it sort of pushed me out of

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.930 
thought that it sort of pushed me out of
my<00:04:42.139> comfort<00:04:42.320> zone<00:04:42.530> in<00:04:42.830> some<00:04:43.010> ways<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.430> thought

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
my comfort zone in some ways I thought

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.640 
my comfort zone in some ways I thought
it<00:04:44.000> was<00:04:44.150> worthwhile<00:04:44.389> because<00:04:44.900> I<00:04:45.200> would<00:04:45.350> get<00:04:45.500> my

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
it was worthwhile because I would get my

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.080 
it was worthwhile because I would get my
chance<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:46.010> actually<00:04:46.130> finally<00:04:46.669> play<00:04:46.850> on<00:04:47.060> a

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
chance to actually finally play on a

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.790 
chance to actually finally play on a
table<00:04:47.510> which<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.169> know<00:04:48.290> I<00:04:48.320> don't<00:04:48.500> get<00:04:48.710> the

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
table which you know I don't get the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.530 
table which you know I don't get the
opportunity<00:04:48.860> too<00:04:49.550> often<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:49.970> I<00:04:50.030> had<00:04:50.210> so<00:04:50.510> much

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
opportunity too often and I had so much

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.260 
opportunity too often and I had so much
fun<00:04:50.750> there<00:04:51.200> it<00:04:51.500> was<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:51.889> good<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:53.180> be

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
fun there it was so good and to be

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.670 
fun there it was so good and to be
honest<00:04:53.540> I<00:04:53.630> had<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:53.810> really<00:04:54.020> good<00:04:54.230> game<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:54.440> so

I think he really wants to put up

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.580 
I think he really wants to put up
because<00:06:14.600> he<00:06:14.720> never<00:06:14.840> shows<00:06:15.139> his<00:06:15.260> face<00:06:15.320> on

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
because he never shows his face on

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.409 
because he never shows his face on
