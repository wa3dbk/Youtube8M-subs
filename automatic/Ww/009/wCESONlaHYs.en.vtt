00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:18.140
 in this video I will show you how 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:22.759
 build a cobb liston generator 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:26.720
 automatic in the sense that this here 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:32.090
 it looks like a strip of gravel almost 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:39.410
 destroyed a few blocks this honors me 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:41.239
 friends automatically creates them and given that 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.609
 the usual coast generator is not 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.059
 very uncomfortable because I know 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:51.289
 you drop the drop in the lava or stuff of the 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.239
 kind here might have been useful 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.429
 now let's see how it's done 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:01.910
 really bullshit 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:06.800
 then you need 4 vitra repeaters 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:12.980
 red from a bucket with suggest the 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.450
 red stone not even the pieces a torch 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.200
 of terrarossa and material from 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.200
 construction 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.660
 then make a built timer 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.140
 if you don't know what it is, that's what I do 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:38.210
 which you must now place you must 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:43.040
 worse than adverse repeaters and then of 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.030
 connect with red stone no 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.030
 sorry 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.759
 you put a torch on the ridge 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:02:00.500
 immediately and as you see the mechanism turns 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:03.439
 now do a little further 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.789
 make a goblin stone generator 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:11.220
 always if you don't know how to do it 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:18.090
 I'm doing it now then yes you have to 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:20.670
 make a structure of this kind in the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.450
 hole by one put the lava then the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.250
 cover if not it will catch fire around and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.980
 in the hole 2 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.269
 put the water from that from this 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.610
 collar which, however, if not maybe the degree 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.290
 in Castilian and pan casino now see 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.000
 if you want to destroy this block of 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.640
 fund sites as well as tax now vi 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.860
 sorry no piston too 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.500
 sticky because with that sticky 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.510
 there is and it is a casino anyway you want 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.299
 destroy this block maybe not if 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.840
 prefer do it first and put a behind 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.840
 piston the municipality will activate a 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.630
 automatic if it happens to you like me type 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.760
 the piston but too fast then the la 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.920
 couple stan does not have time to recreate 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.620
 you can simply slow down the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.420
 mechanism by clicking on the pistons like 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.850
 could have been slower and longer than the co 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:30.510
 bressan to create now has stopped 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.590
 because the piston does not make it tighten 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.519
 I don't know more than 15 blogs 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.870
 however you want to continue 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:44.400
 destroy I know here for the continues a 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.290
 pushing should be a mechanism 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.019
 what a profit then put I like it 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.810
 will add invented favorites 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.800
 sign up and use this mechanism 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.560
 why 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:05.319
 I demand is not the cat 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.240
 too difficult to build into 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.319
 survival are not difficult to 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.319
 find these materials 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.069
 ok 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.580
 and go well yes hello to everyone to the next 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.580
 video
