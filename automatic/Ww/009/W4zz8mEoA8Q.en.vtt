00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello today we have a tablet 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.570
 sonix model 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:19.220
 and to 888 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:26.390
 -28 the problem is that it does not turn on 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:33.679
 I think that does not happen for this 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.679
 remove the back cover and slightly opened 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:46.530
 the situation is what is coming topman and 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:50.090
 MIC will need to solder Debra jo 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:01:06.150
 and first look 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:01:13.610
 the battery is alive they are not there so you see 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.610
 yes dredge weiss alone solid love 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:27.470
 need to be afraid we have recharging 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 the scholarship is written here dc 5 volts 2 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:55.460
 amps and so heat up the soldering iron 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:55.460
 unsolder contacts contacts 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:06.659
 for what your repeat will imitate 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:10.229
 with power supply for and for but when 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.009
 soldering iron soldered 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.009
 contact 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:40.200
 soldered so far I put on charge 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:56.709
 continues and so have connected the power 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:03:02.379
 minus the built-go charging like 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:11.700
 some time will charge i soldered 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:11.700
 truth check we can show 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.799
 minus plus 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:23.889
 so four volts is why 4 because 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:26.680
 that imitated a long time just to check 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:31.060
 This will turn it on and turn on for the problem. 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.870
 still somewhere lurking so still we whispered 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.870
 door brace 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.250
 so here while we are involved from 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.250
 well look to continue 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.750
 but for now something is loading 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:21.750
 but how the lollipops tablet turned on 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:23.780
 working on it and everything is so simple 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.040
 repairs 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.040
 Cheats on the channel for everyone
