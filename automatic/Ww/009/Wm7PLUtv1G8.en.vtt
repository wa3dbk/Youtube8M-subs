00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
and press it in then the fall out isn't

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.640 
and press it in then the fall out isn't
quite<00:04:09.630> as<00:04:09.810> bad<00:04:09.989> so<00:04:10.230> there<00:04:10.350> are<00:04:10.470> ways<00:04:10.590> to

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
quite as bad so there are ways to

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.690 
quite as bad so there are ways to
minimize<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.880> sort<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.269> fall<00:04:12.540> out<00:04:13.580> but<00:04:14.580> yeah<00:04:14.670> I

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
minimize the sort of fall out but yeah I

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.520 
minimize the sort of fall out but yeah I
think<00:04:15.000> they're<00:04:15.150> really<00:04:15.360> good<00:04:15.540> quality<00:04:15.660> these

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
think they're really good quality these

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.719 
think they're really good quality these
were<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.739> really<00:04:17.010> good<00:04:17.130> price<00:04:17.370> there<00:04:17.700> is

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
were a really good price there is

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.280 
were a really good price there is
actually<00:04:18.120> sort<00:04:18.330> of<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.510> natural<00:04:18.690> colored<00:04:19.140> one

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
actually sort of a natural colored one

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.780 
actually sort of a natural colored one
but<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.620> think<00:04:19.799> that's<00:04:19.950> around<00:04:20.190> sixteen<00:04:20.640> or

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
but I think that's around sixteen or

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.150 
but I think that's around sixteen or
seven

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
seven

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.490 
seven
pants<00:04:21.550> and<00:04:22.300> might<00:04:22.510> invest<00:04:22.900> in<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.170> I<00:04:23.200> might

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
pants and might invest in that I might

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.900 
pants and might invest in that I might
not<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:23.740> mean<00:04:23.890> I've<00:04:24.040> got<00:04:24.160> plenty<00:04:24.310> of<00:04:24.490> natural

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
not I mean I've got plenty of natural

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.940 
not I mean I've got plenty of natural
colors<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:25.420> didn't<00:04:26.140> have<00:04:26.290> lots<00:04:26.470> of<00:04:26.650> bright

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
colors I didn't have lots of bright

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.920 
colors I didn't have lots of bright
colors<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.610> really<00:04:27.910> enjoy<00:04:28.270> using<00:04:28.570> bright

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
colors and I really enjoy using bright

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.260 
colors and I really enjoy using bright
colors<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.440> neons<00:04:30.010> are<00:04:30.310> very<00:04:30.550> very<00:04:30.820> hard<00:04:31.090> to

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
colors and neons are very very hard to

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.170 
colors and neons are very very hard to
find<00:04:31.510> actually<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:33.220> look<00:04:33.370> used<00:04:33.670> to<00:04:33.760> sell<00:04:33.970> the

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
find actually you look used to sell the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.820 
find actually you look used to sell the
individual<00:04:34.900> ones<00:04:35.140> and<00:04:35.380> he<00:04:35.440> can<00:04:35.650> buy

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
individual ones and he can buy

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.950 
individual ones and he can buy
individual<00:04:36.430> ones<00:04:36.730> but<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.390> don't<00:04:37.810> know

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
individual ones but I don't know

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.630 
individual ones but I don't know
anywhere<00:04:38.350> near<00:04:38.620> me<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:39.070> actually<00:04:39.370> sells

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
anywhere near me that actually sells

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.120 
anywhere near me that actually sells
stargazer<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:40.690> think<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.740> there<00:04:41.860> might<00:04:41.980> be<00:04:42.010> a

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
stargazer I think that there might be a

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.380 
stargazer I think that there might be a
little<00:04:42.220> shop<00:04:42.490> in<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.670> galleries<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.240> in

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
little shop in the galleries and the in

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.210 
little shop in the galleries and the in
shops<00:04:43.690> that<00:04:43.870> still<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.140> she<00:04:44.260> sells<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.830> single

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
shops that still a she sells the single

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.950 
shops that still a she sells the single
ones<00:04:45.430> I<00:04:45.640> have<00:04:45.820> to<00:04:45.970> have<00:04:46.060> a<00:04:46.120> look<00:04:46.330> maybe<00:04:46.690> and<00:04:46.810> see

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
ones I have to have a look maybe and see

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.480

if<00:04:47.050> they<00:04:47.170> do<00:04:47.230> because<00:04:48.040> they<00:04:48.130> do<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.250> lot<00:04:48.340> of

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
if they do because they do a lot of

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.010 
if they do because they do a lot of
bright<00:04:48.790> colors<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.300> interesting<00:04:49.720> colors

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
bright colors and interesting colors

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.690

that<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:50.320> just<00:04:50.470> can't<00:04:50.740> get<00:04:50.860> anywhere<00:04:51.190> else<00:04:51.250> I

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
that you just can't get anywhere else I

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.670 
that you just can't get anywhere else I
did<00:04:52.150> struggle<00:04:52.330> for<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.660> long<00:04:52.840> time<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.290> find<00:04:53.530> a

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
did struggle for a long time to find a

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.310 
did struggle for a long time to find a
really<00:04:53.920> good<00:04:54.040> red<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:55.330> that<00:04:55.540> was<00:04:55.720> part<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:56.140> why

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
really good red and that was part of why

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.230 
really good red and that was part of why
I<00:04:56.350> got<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.980> initial<00:04:57.310> palette<00:04:57.820> because<00:04:58.000> I

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
I got the initial palette because I

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.680 
I got the initial palette because I
really<00:04:58.660> wanted<00:04:58.900> a<00:04:59.020> nice<00:04:59.170> red<00:04:59.560> but<00:05:00.690> actually

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
really wanted a nice red but actually

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.270 
really wanted a nice red but actually
swatch<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.080> purebred<00:05:02.410> together<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:03.070> never

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
swatch the purebred together I never

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.950 
swatch the purebred together I never
thought<00:05:03.460> to<00:05:03.640> do<00:05:03.790> that<00:05:09.330> so<00:05:10.330> there<00:05:10.510> you<00:05:10.570> can<00:05:10.750> see

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
thought to do that so there you can see

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.230 
thought to do that so there you can see

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
palette just this one should I just do a

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:58.980 
palette just this one should I just do a
few<00:05:50.350> swatches<00:05:50.950> of<00:05:51.070> that<00:05:51.220> one<00:05:55.770> so<00:05:56.770> I<00:05:57.990> came
