00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
I it's hard to say I cross tekken

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.970 
I it's hard to say I cross tekken
graphics<00:03:23.879> looked<00:03:24.150> really<00:03:24.659> really<00:03:24.989> good<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.799> I

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
graphics looked really really good and I

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.910 
graphics looked really really good and I
I<00:03:26.159> I<00:03:26.609> can't<00:03:27.510> imagine<00:03:27.689> it<00:03:28.109> was<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.409> game<00:03:28.620> but

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
I I can't imagine it was in game but

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.360 
I I can't imagine it was in game but
they<00:03:29.219> say<00:03:29.430> it's<00:03:29.640> in<00:03:29.790> game<00:03:30.680> better<00:03:31.680> be<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.129> game

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
they say it's in game better be in game

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.750 
they say it's in game better be in game
then<00:03:33.290> I'm<00:03:34.290> pretty<00:03:34.650> sure<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:34.950> was<00:03:35.129> in<00:03:35.310> Game<00:03:35.519> ton

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
then I'm pretty sure it was in Game ton

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.059 
then I'm pretty sure it was in Game ton
but<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.599> looked<00:03:36.930> like<00:03:37.230> really<00:03:37.920> really

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
but it looked like really really

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.379 
but it looked like really really
cinematic<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.930> yeah<00:03:40.829> I<00:03:41.430> actually<00:03:41.819> I<00:03:42.090> was

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
cinematic so yeah I actually I was

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.399 
cinematic so yeah I actually I was
waiting<00:03:42.870> for<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:43.170> proper<00:03:44.010> like<00:03:44.219> gameplay<00:03:44.730> video

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
waiting for a proper like gameplay video

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.740 
waiting for a proper like gameplay video
maybe<00:03:46.409> it<00:03:46.560> was<00:03:46.790> hoping<00:03:47.790> for<00:03:47.819> too<00:03:48.090> much<00:03:48.239> just

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
maybe it was hoping for too much just

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.440 
maybe it was hoping for too much just
want<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.170> say<00:03:49.319> let's<00:03:49.709> see<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:50.159> some<00:03:51.060> footage

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
want to say let's see like some footage

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.300 
want to say let's see like some footage
behind<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.019> car<00:03:52.230> like<00:03:52.560> classic<00:03:53.010> need<00:03:53.159> for

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
behind the car like classic need for

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.649 
behind the car like classic need for
speed<00:03:53.519> games<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:54.739> hopefully<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:55.829> has<00:03:56.040> also

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
speed games and hopefully it has also

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.409 
speed games and hopefully it has also
cockpit<00:03:57.659> view<00:03:57.840> also<00:03:58.169> and<00:03:58.909> you<00:03:59.909> could<00:04:00.120> blame

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
cockpit view also and you could blame

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.379 
cockpit view also and you could blame
with<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.930> wheel<00:04:01.139> and<00:04:01.709> maybe<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.790> hope<00:04:03.239> the

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
with the wheel and maybe I hope the

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.569 
with the wheel and maybe I hope the
handling<00:04:03.840> is<00:04:04.019> like<00:04:04.859> a<00:04:05.430> pro<00:04:05.939> street<00:04:06.419> or<00:04:06.810> maybe

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
handling is like a pro street or maybe

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.509 
handling is like a pro street or maybe
shift<00:04:08.629> because<00:04:09.629> I<00:04:09.840> like<00:04:10.019> this<00:04:10.260> ship<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:11.069> like

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
shift because I like this ship I like

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.569 
shift because I like this ship I like
these<00:04:11.700> simulation<00:04:12.450> or<00:04:12.599> cake<00:04:12.840> games<00:04:13.579> anyway

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
these simulation or cake games anyway

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.069 
these simulation or cake games anyway
