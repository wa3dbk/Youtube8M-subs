00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.800
 hollande repeating the samsung galaxy 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.050
 s 5 arrived from the 9 ball congress 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.300
 of Barcelona since 2014 we have had the 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.250
 opportunity to take a first look 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.920
 in terms of design it is clear that 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.320
 remember its predecessor the galaxy s 4 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.450
 especially if we look at it in front of 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.130
 turn it if we are going to notice in the part 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.320
 rear a change the housing is 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.260
 Made of matte plastic and presents 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.090
 a rough texture with points here 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.700
 we have the camera and the flash 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.620
 ld without any newness the body in its 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.110
 set is more square and not so 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.730
 round as in the previous model in the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.060
 top we have the sensor of 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.609
 infrared down the usb port 3.0 to 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.190
 same as in the galaxy know 3 the samsung 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:52.010
 galaxy s 5 is water resistant though 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.390
 we have not yet been able to verify this 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.579
 quality does not prevent the housing 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.260
 can remove and also the battery that 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.949
 as you can see, it's quite bigger and has 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.780
 a capacity of 2800 milliamps a 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.810
 of the most rumored functions was the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.120
 Fingerprint scanner exists and 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.910
 is located on the home button at 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.740
 just like on iphone 5 is the use of 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.840
 this sensor is routed for 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.250
 authentication of paypal payments and 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.730
 also to unlock the phone 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.090
 sliding your finger like this 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.460
 the application has been redesigned and now 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.200
 The sensor has a new function 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.090
 heart rate found in 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.790
 the back side next to the flash and give 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.410
 a look at the software shows the 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.720
 Samsung's intentions to explore 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.640
 new paths the settings menu and the 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.130
 notification bar has been changed 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.750
 totally as you can appreciate we have 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.820
 new rounded icons and 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.790
 different colors this new language 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.290
 of design not only has not been born of 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.630
 consistent with the rest of the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.310
 user interface where on the screen 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.200
 start and application panel let's 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.880
 to find the same icons but more 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.549
 blueprints 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.079
 let's talk about the camera as a novelty ls 5 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.149
 It is the first smartphone that shows a 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.789
 Real-time preview image of the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.920
 photos in hdr the camera menu 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.200
 It has also been redesigned and shows the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.550
 modes on a lower line fits 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.980
 emphasize that the approach is really 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.150
 fast being able to take photos without 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.489
 any delay 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.650
 in a direct comparison with the s4 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.540
 we see that the s5 is bigger more 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.790
 square and with a much more screen 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.129
 wide if we pay attention to the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.989
 touchwiz user interface we see that 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.810
 regarding the menu of settings and bars 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.040
 notification the change is very remarkable 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.170
 let's hope they dare to expand it 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.329
 by the home screen and the panel 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.519
 applications up here in our 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.220
