00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and pretty much what they are is you put

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
and pretty much what they are is you put
them<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.490> picture<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.970> put

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
them like like in this picture you put

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.780 
them like like in this picture you put
them<00:01:24.360> underneath<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:25.350> pouf<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.100> makes<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
them underneath your pouf and makes a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.679 
them underneath your pouf and makes a
stay<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.240> this

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
stay like this

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.340 
stay like this
so<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.439> hair<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.540> clips<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
so it's hair and it clips on and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.840 
so it's hair and it clips on and
everything<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:34.070> think<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.220> even<00:01:35.430> shows<00:01:35.670> you
