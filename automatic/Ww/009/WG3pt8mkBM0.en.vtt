00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.180
 second part of our series 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.849
 Today I show you how you paypal 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.679
 I will set up the apple with the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.809
 So I 'll use it for you 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.670
 setup on an iphone 5 show 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.250
 First, we open the original 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.770
 panel app which here for free from the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.350
 app store gets after we get on 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.600
 started and must have pressed there 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.060
 we connect the apple to the iphone 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.640
 To do this, we will switch the first time 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.320
 paypal watch a 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.950
 This happens when you stay on one 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.780
 The heads should now be the paypal 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.030
 watch us as a bluetooth device 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.620
 to be available 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.210
 after you have chosen the paypal 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.190
 you have to on both devices still the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.870
 Confirm bluetooth connection and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.530
 already is your paypal with the iphone 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.620
 connected 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.480
 Next, the app checks on the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.160
 panel of the latest software stand 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.110
 is and should not be the case 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.260
 be a case like ours will be a new one 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.329
 update on the pelples played this can 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.289
 therefore, some games take time 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.289
 I'm a little bit ahead now 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.200
 after the update is completed 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.580
 restart the paypal and it should open 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.890
 be the latest firmware 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.840
 with one click on one of the four 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.020
 buttons come the first time in the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.090
 main menu of our pavel watch we already 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.780
 See there are some categories like 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.390
 music set alarm bot races or settings 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.140
 with a click on back we come 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.019
 from the main menu to the clocks interface 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.860
 but now again back to the app 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.450
 apparently he has not recognized 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.370
 that the update succeeds 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.370
 but that should be done in 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.500
 fixed later versions 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.510
 we break the update process in the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.470
 app now once and connect that 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.660
 iphone has apple now he recognizes that the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.640
 latest firmware has been installed 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.739
 and we can continue with the setup 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.569
 First we have to paypal 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.430
 allow that on our contacts 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.220
 allowed to access so we know who 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.140
 call us or write us an sms 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.209
 However, we even report to the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.560
 we have to get the next pebble 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.230
 follow steps 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.390
 the app shows us in a few 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.390
 picture how we adjust the whole 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.710
 We'll leave the app once 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.710
 then bypass the settings 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.230
 bluetooth then we will use our paypal 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.590
 and put the slider on 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.140
 message in a dazzling way and as 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.150
 Next we go back to go 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.130
 Messages 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.190
 There we select our news 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.550
 and set at the bottom of the lock screen 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.050
 once up and then up again and now 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.730
 we can already do the settings 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.670
 leave again and the paypal app 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.590
 should start everything should have worked 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.459
 you in the status now the paypal which 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.650
 connected is 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.030
 Now we go back to the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.530
 main menu and still look at the 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.720
 other features of the app 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.940
 you can once emails the clearest thing 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.360
 at the moment unfortunately only with imap 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.320
 or e-mail accounts is possible 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.239
 also you can watch each other 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.670
 faces about the app on the paypal 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.739
 play and now we come to the big one 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.930
 test works everything has the 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.870
 facility works we try it 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.209
 the app offers us the function from the app 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.120
 sms or a phone call once too 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.280
 simulate as you see the opens 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.640
 message on the paypal and show you 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.690
 the sender and the text or the content 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.270
 the sms 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.580
 with a telephone call leads you too 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.100
 which contact calls and you 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.000
 can additionally accept the call or 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.979
 reject 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.840
 As you can see , the whole thing works 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.320
 We are all right 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.940
 to test this in practice too 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.270
 That's why I send one to me 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.070
 Imessage as soon as it has been sent 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.590
 it does not take long to them on the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.919
 iphone arrives and immediately thereafter 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.660
 also on the panel we can already see 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.790
 here, in contrast to the test 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.970
 function of the app also contacts name 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.650
 of the sender displayed yes that 's it 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.050
 then again with the setup and 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.090
