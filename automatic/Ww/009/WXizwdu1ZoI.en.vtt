removing the scale mold from the scale

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.790 
removing the scale mold from the scale
box<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:08.550> was<00:00:08.790> quite<00:00:09.059> an<00:00:09.150> ordeal<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.840> guess<00:00:10.620> it

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
box it was quite an ordeal I guess it

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.320 
box it was quite an ordeal I guess it
would<00:00:10.920> probably<00:00:11.070> I'd<00:00:11.610> say<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.969> probably<00:00:12.090> took

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
would probably I'd say it probably took

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.890 
would probably I'd say it probably took
me<00:00:12.389> about<00:00:12.889> 20<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.009> 30<00:00:14.190> minutes<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.820> take<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.780> out

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
me about 20 to 30 minutes to take it out

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.370 
me about 20 to 30 minutes to take it out
so<00:00:17.630> it<00:00:18.630> was<00:00:18.869> quite<00:00:19.350> eventful<00:00:20.990> you<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.140> see

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
broken mess that was my scale box there

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.560 
broken mess that was my scale box there
was<00:00:30.630> some<00:00:30.900> damage<00:00:31.109> involved<00:00:32.090> with<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> mold

looks<00:00:41.790> pretty<00:00:42.030> good<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.930> until<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.440> get<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
looks pretty good and until you get to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.410 
looks pretty good and until you get to
the<00:00:43.770> top<00:00:44.059> it's<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.149> sad<00:00:45.360> day<00:00:46.039> I<00:00:47.090> mean<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.149> try

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.170 
the top it's a sad day I mean you try
and<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.660> around<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.340> sorry

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
and get around it so you can see sorry

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.010 
and get around it so you can see sorry
my<00:00:51.270> step<00:00:51.480> around<00:00:51.750> him<00:00:53.270> you<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
my step around him you can see that the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.500 
my step around him you can see that the
top<00:00:55.320> part<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:55.980> damaged<00:00:56.930> right<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:59.510> am

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
top part was damaged right in here I am

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.090 
top part was damaged right in here I am
hoping<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.670> I'll<00:01:02.670> only<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
hoping that I'll only have to go to the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.300 
hoping that I'll only have to go to the
second<00:01:05.489> row<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:06.900> that's<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.320> case<00:01:07.500> then

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
second row and if that's the case then

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.030 
second row and if that's the case then
everything<00:01:09.030> should<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.210> okay

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
everything should be okay

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.640 
everything should be okay
but<00:01:11.040> I'll<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.729> clean<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.530> get<00:01:13.530> all

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
but I'll have to clean this up get all

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.850 
but I'll have to clean this up get all
the<00:01:13.710> pieces<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.600> see

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
the pieces out of it but as you can see

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.429 
the pieces out of it but as you can see
the<00:01:16.860> rest<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.310> came<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:17.939> pretty<00:01:18.210> well<00:01:21.439> this

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the rest of it came out pretty well this

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.660 
the rest of it came out pretty well this
is<00:01:22.590> actually<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> first<00:01:23.130> time<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.460> really

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
is actually the first time I'm really

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.170 
is actually the first time I'm really
looking<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:25.009> see<00:01:26.009> some<00:01:26.250> encapsulation

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
looking at it I see some encapsulation

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.410 
looking at it I see some encapsulation
occurred<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:28.229> some<00:01:28.710> areas

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.110 

right<00:01:33.420> here<00:01:34.190> there<00:01:35.190> was<00:01:35.310> some<00:01:35.340> encapsulation

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
right here there was some encapsulation

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.780 
right here there was some encapsulation
there<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:37.440> it's<00:01:37.620> not<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.890> clean<00:01:38.220> there's<00:01:38.670> some

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
there see it's not as clean there's some

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.740 
there see it's not as clean there's some
undercuts<00:01:39.950> but<00:01:40.950> overall<00:01:42.110> looks<00:01:43.110> pretty<00:01:44.100> good

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
undercuts but overall looks pretty good

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.620 
undercuts but overall looks pretty good
so<00:01:45.980> hopefully<00:01:46.980> you<00:01:47.820> turn<00:01:48.120> it<00:01:48.210> back<00:01:48.330> round<00:01:48.540> so

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
so hopefully you turn it back round so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.940 
so hopefully you turn it back round so
you<00:01:48.690> can<00:01:48.780> kind<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.260> a<00:01:49.440> little<00:01:50.280> better

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
you can kind of see it a little better

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.330 
you can kind of see it a little better
yeah

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.460 

so<00:01:58.070> hopefully<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.820> won't<00:02:00.119> need<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> use<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
so hopefully we won't need to use the

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.530 
so hopefully we won't need to use the
entire<00:02:02.040> sheet<00:02:02.430> hopefully<00:02:03.030> I'll<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.180> able<00:02:03.390> to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
entire sheet hopefully I'll be able to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.190 
entire sheet hopefully I'll be able to
use<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.220> barely<00:02:05.220> a<00:02:05.670> full<00:02:05.970> sheet<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.899> cover

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
use just barely a full sheet to cover

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.130 
use just barely a full sheet to cover
everything<00:02:07.970> but<00:02:09.110> yay<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.500> finally<00:02:10.950> done<00:02:12.140> so

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
everything but yay it's finally done so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.600 
everything but yay it's finally done so
I'll<00:02:13.680> keep<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.950> guys<00:02:14.069> updated<00:02:14.310> and

I'll keep you guys updated and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.190 
I'll keep you guys updated and
everything<00:02:14.880> else<00:02:15.000> next<00:02:15.780> step

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
everything else next step

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.370 
everything else next step
cleaning<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.220> mold<00:02:17.959> hopefully<00:02:18.959> with<00:02:19.080> some

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
cleaning the mold hopefully with some

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.800 
cleaning the mold hopefully with some
soap<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.980> water<00:02:20.580> but<00:02:20.970> I'll<00:02:21.239> be<00:02:21.420> doing<00:02:21.569> a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
soap and water but I'll be doing a

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.930 
soap and water but I'll be doing a
little<00:02:21.930> bit<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.200> an<00:02:22.349> investigation<00:02:23.130> on<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
little bit of an investigation on the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.570 
little bit of an investigation on the
best<00:02:24.180> ways<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.480> do<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.590> think<00:02:25.920> what<00:02:26.430> we

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
best ways to do that but I think what we

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.970 
best ways to do that but I think what we
found<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:27.030> soap<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.330> water<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:27.840> do<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.799> little

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
found with soap and water so do a little

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.949 
found with soap and water so do a little
more<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.430> I'll<00:02:29.730> let<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.000> guys<00:02:30.060> know<00:02:30.120> thanks
