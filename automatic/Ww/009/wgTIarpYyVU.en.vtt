00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
where you may hit it just for a second

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.390 
where you may hit it just for a second
turn<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.750> off<00:01:36.840> hit<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> back<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:38.189> really

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
