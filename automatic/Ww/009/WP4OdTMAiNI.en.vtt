00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.210
 Hello everyone today at the request of 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.460
 antonella following me from germany 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.310
 with its splendid blue villa 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.500
 I propose the soft macaroons are 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.410
 very simple sweets from 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.020
 make sugar-based almonds 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.440
 usually for the preparation of desserts 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.230
 based on almond paste is recommended 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.100
 rest of the pasta after made the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.570
 sweet for a whole night and me 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.030
 so I did 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.880
 however being very curious in the kitchen I have 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.100
 wanted to try to cook even after 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.450
 an hour of rest and then I'll show you 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.680
 the result 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.360
 let's see below 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.140
 ingredients that will run down to 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.140
 achieve them 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.640
 I took 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.030
 ser why I will go in the meantime to whisk the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.540
 almonds and almonds must be 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.390
 peeled and better go to use the 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.410
 almonds rather than the flour of 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.900
 almonds because we ca n't know if it is 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.600
 pure I put the almonds inside the 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.330
 mixer I'm going to put sugar 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:37.810
 granulated 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:39.640
 after that I go to blend or chop 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.560
 for a minute a minute and a half now 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.750
 I'll show you the net result 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.229
 almonds with minced sugar in a 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.229
 container 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.410
 here I show you the consistency 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.490
 even if there is some piece 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:03.910
 slightly bigger, okay anyway 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:08.920
 now I put the aromas I'm going to put the 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:18.940
 rome of bitter almond roma di 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:23.170
 vanilla and an album and I'm going to mix 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.680
 all vague to mix until the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.640
 compound will not be involved 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.330
 here is that the mixture is compacted 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:44.370
 vague to admit icing sugar on 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:44.370
 worktop and roll it over 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:57.569
 going just to compress it with the 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:03:00.239
 hands now I can make the 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.310
 macaroons I'm going to get some little ones 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.469
 I go to pieces of dough 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.340
 crush this way because if you do them 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:13.500
 I'm going to roll up then they fall apart 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.310
 the vat goes to crush so to give way 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:24.239
 to amaretto to compact well then 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:27.199
 I can go and roll it up and pass 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.199
 in icing sugar 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:35.730
 to give you an indication of the size 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.540
 I'm going to weigh the amaretto 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.049
 here is more or less 15 to 17 grams 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.469
 each one proceeds and the realization 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:50.519
 of macaroons until everything is finished 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:52.439
 I finished all the dough 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.829
 the macaroons with the qualities I have given you 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.509
 I have come 20 or arranged 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.919
 spaced out on a baking sheet 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:05.699
 covered with parchment paper and go to them 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:10.069
 crush lightly by exercising 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.069
 just a slight pressure 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:19.079
 now they will have to rest 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.479
 rest because the almond paste will 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.509
 it will have to dry before cooking 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.310
 otherwise to put them in the oven now 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.130
 there is the risk that they do not keep the 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.280
 shape so we leave them to dry a 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.000
 room temperature in the air for one 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.789
 night 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.740
 I made him rest all night 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.720
 Amaretti biscuits 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.930
 here you see how beautiful they are 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.750
 hard beautiful compact dry 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:50.610
 now I can go to bake 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:53.790
 finally at 160 degrees for 10 12 minutes 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.970
 in short it depends that a little from the oven in 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:00.170
 static oven you go to extract it 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:10.350
 when they begin to brown slightly 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:12.660
 at the base and this is the result of the 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.770
 macaroons that I let stand for 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.200
 a whole night 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.120
 I'll show you how I'm underneath 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.450
 network 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.790
 please don't take them off the le 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:29.670
 he used to sing kiln if you didn't 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:31.770
 cool yourself completely and since I am 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.280
 very curious in the kitchen 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.020
 now I'm going to bake some macaroons 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.690
 I'll get ready on the spot 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.690
 rest only an hour on the dripping pan 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.940
 from the bottom before going to bake 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:48.419
 always at 160 degrees for 12 minutes 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:51.840
 let's see how the result will be now vi 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:54.780
 I make a comparison between the two husbands 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.729
 those who have rested for one 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.970
 whole night and those who have 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:03.300
 rested for only an hour 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.520
 look at the result those who have 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:13.610
 rested only an hour are softer 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:16.140
 they are more inflated, they are more crunchy 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.880
 while others who have rested for 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:23.370
 a whole night is a lot more 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:26.070
 compacts drier if I have to tell you a 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.919
 my personal opinion I prefer to 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.300
 long the macaroons those who have less 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.300
 rest compared to the others 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.240
 and those who are ready with macaroons 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.200
 or cooked after a night of rest e 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.600
 those that are baked after baking 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.650
 rest as I have already told you 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.930
 I prefer those cooked to rest 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.170
 because they are softer more 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.480
 softer crunchy even though they tend to 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.660
 don't keep the shape very much but I do it 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.060
 I prefer to keep them in a box 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.210
 magical for cookies and also for different ones 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.010
 days I send a big hug a big kiss 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.260
 great to antonella who asked me 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.800
 the recipe for his wonderful baby 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:16.240
 blue a big kiss to all and to 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.240
 next recipe hello
