you're styling your hair you don't want

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.490 
you're styling your hair you don't want
it<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.090> be<00:03:20.239> fixated<00:03:20.660> because<00:03:21.140> you<00:03:21.200> want<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.440> to

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
it to be fixated because you want it to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.199 
it to be fixated because you want it to
be<00:03:21.680> able<00:03:21.799> to<00:03:21.950> move<00:03:22.190> around<00:03:22.370> if<00:03:22.760> you're<00:03:22.880> doing

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
be able to move around if you're doing

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.180 
be able to move around if you're doing
like<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.420> curl<00:03:23.810> or<00:03:24.049> something<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.890> just<00:03:25.040> want

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
like a curl or something you just want

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.949 
like a curl or something you just want
it<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.280> move<00:03:25.519> with<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.910> for<00:03:26.120> ease<00:03:26.299> of<00:03:26.330> styling

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
it to move with you for ease of styling

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.920 
it to move with you for ease of styling
so<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.040> goes<00:03:28.220> up<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.549> 200<00:03:29.090> Celsius<00:03:29.360> as<00:03:29.750> it's

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
so it goes up to 200 Celsius as it's

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.930 
so it goes up to 200 Celsius as it's
said<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:31.070> don't<00:03:31.130> really<00:03:31.430> think<00:03:31.610> that<00:03:31.700> that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
said and I don't really think that that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.070 
said and I don't really think that that
is<00:03:32.000> hot<00:03:32.390> at<00:03:32.570> all<00:03:32.810> because<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:35.090> just<00:03:35.360> isn't<00:03:35.690> that

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
is hot at all because it just isn't that

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.750 
is hot at all because it just isn't that
hot<00:03:36.380> to<00:03:36.590> me<00:03:36.739> anyway

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
hot to me anyway

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.900 
hot to me anyway
I<00:03:37.959> like<00:03:38.959> this<00:03:39.170> as<00:03:39.410> well<00:03:39.680> because<00:03:40.070> you<00:03:40.280> know<00:03:40.310> it

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
I like this as well because you know it

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.580 
I like this as well because you know it
when<00:03:41.299> you're<00:03:41.480> doing<00:03:41.720> your<00:03:41.870> hair<00:03:42.049> you<00:03:42.260> can't

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
when you're doing your hair you can't

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.750 
when you're doing your hair you can't
really<00:03:42.860> touch<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.430> change<00:03:43.640> your

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
really touch it and change your

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.910 
really touch it and change your
temperature<00:03:44.269> because<00:03:44.600> that's<00:03:45.470> all<00:03:45.680> like

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
temperature because that's all like

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.740 
temperature because that's all like
compacted<00:03:46.880> in<00:03:47.000> there<00:03:47.239> so<00:03:47.450> what<00:03:47.570> you're<00:03:47.720> doing

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
compacted in there so what you're doing

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.170 
compacted in there so what you're doing
you're<00:03:48.110> hanging<00:03:48.380> just<00:03:48.560> doing<00:03:48.829> your<00:03:48.920> hair<00:03:49.180> so

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
you're hanging just doing your hair so

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.390 
you're hanging just doing your hair so
overall<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.290> think<00:03:51.470> these<00:03:51.920> are<00:03:51.980> good

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
overall I think these are good

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.690 
overall I think these are good
straighteners<00:03:53.799> they<00:03:54.799> worked<00:03:55.070> well<00:03:55.340> for<00:03:55.370> my

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
straighteners they worked well for my

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.810 
straighteners they worked well for my
hair<00:03:56.030> but<00:03:56.750> as<00:03:56.989> for<00:03:57.200> my<00:03:57.320> sisters<00:03:57.829> here's<00:03:58.670> the

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
hair but as for my sisters here's the

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.240 
hair but as for my sisters here's the
thing<00:03:59.170> you<00:04:00.170> know<00:04:00.320> how<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.530> natural<00:04:00.709> hair<00:04:01.130> is

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
thing you know how the natural hair is

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.490 
thing you know how the natural hair is
hard<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.640> straighten<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.360> ends<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:02.959> that's

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
hard to straighten the ends and that's

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.680 
hard to straighten the ends and that's
why<00:04:03.680> I<00:04:03.709> finally<00:04:04.160> be<00:04:04.280> straighteners<00:04:04.910> it's<00:04:05.450> not

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
why I finally be straighteners it's not

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.780 
why I finally be straighteners it's not
that<00:04:05.930> I<00:04:06.200> don't<00:04:06.739> know<00:04:06.799> whether<00:04:06.980> extra<00:04:07.579> heat

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
that I don't know whether extra heat

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.220 
that I don't know whether extra heat
would<00:04:07.910> have<00:04:08.060> helped<00:04:08.390> I<00:04:08.510> try<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:08.870> use<00:04:09.110> the

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
would have helped I try to use the

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.050 
would have helped I try to use the
technique<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:09.799> like<00:04:10.040> combing<00:04:10.489> it<00:04:10.610> down<00:04:10.850> the

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
technique of like combing it down the

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.690 
technique of like combing it down the
chaser<00:04:11.600> method<00:04:12.019> or<00:04:12.140> when<00:04:12.320> you<00:04:12.470> have<00:04:13.070> a<00:04:13.130> combing

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
chaser method or when you have a combing

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.230 
chaser method or when you have a combing
you

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
you

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.090 
you
you<00:04:14.510> know<00:04:14.630> chase<00:04:15.020> with<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.500> straight<00:04:15.770> a<00:04:15.800> lot

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
you know chase with the straight a lot

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.890 
you know chase with the straight a lot
and<00:04:16.340> come<00:04:16.550> yes<00:04:16.760> and<00:04:16.970> it's<00:04:17.090> harder<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.780> get

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
and come yes and it's harder to get

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.600 
and come yes and it's harder to get
there<00:04:18.080> and<00:04:18.260> straighten<00:04:18.739> so<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.190> don't<00:04:19.489> know

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
there and straighten so I don't know

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.580 
there and straighten so I don't know
whether<00:04:19.910> that's<00:04:20.209> you<00:04:20.450> know<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.900> could<00:04:21.470> be

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
whether that's you know that could be

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.610 
whether that's you know that could be
one<00:04:21.770> Accord<00:04:22.600> but<00:04:23.600> overall<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.140> really<00:04:24.320> like<00:04:24.590> a

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
one Accord but overall I really like a

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.070 
one Accord but overall I really like a
straight<00:04:25.070> line<00:04:25.310> I<00:04:25.370> would<00:04:25.730> recommend<00:04:26.300> if<00:04:26.840> you

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
straight line I would recommend if you

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.990 
straight line I would recommend if you
want<00:04:27.260> something<00:04:27.470> that's<00:04:27.800> reasonably<00:04:28.400> priced

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
want something that's reasonably priced

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.450 
want something that's reasonably priced
then<00:04:29.510> this<00:04:30.140> is<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.440> one<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.800> go<00:04:30.980> for<00:04:31.250> because

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
then this is the one to go for because

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.480 
then this is the one to go for because
it's<00:04:31.880> it's<00:04:32.330> I<00:04:32.630> think<00:04:32.690> it's<00:04:33.050> about<00:04:33.320> up<00:04:33.890> to<00:04:34.130> 20

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
it's it's I think it's about up to 20

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.610 
it's it's I think it's about up to 20
pounds<00:04:34.790> or<00:04:34.820> under<00:04:34.880> 20<00:04:35.510> pounds<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:36.200> don't<00:04:36.470> really

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
pounds or under 20 pounds I don't really

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.320 
pounds or under 20 pounds I don't really
need<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:37.040> go<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.220> spend<00:04:37.520> your<00:04:37.820> money<00:04:37.880> on<00:04:38.120> me

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
need to go and spend your money on me

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.960 
need to go and spend your money on me
it's<00:04:38.510> an<00:04:38.630> army<00:04:39.170> or<00:04:39.470> whatever<00:04:40.040> I<00:04:40.220> mean<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:40.640> don't

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
it's an army or whatever I mean I don't

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.580 
it's an army or whatever I mean I don't
see<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.330> point<00:04:41.570> of<00:04:41.720> doing<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.170> because<00:04:42.350> I

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
see the point of doing that because I

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.230 
see the point of doing that because I
already<00:04:42.860> straighten<00:04:43.430> my<00:04:43.550> head<00:04:43.670> once<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:44.030> year

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
already straighten my head once a year

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.700 
already straighten my head once a year
and<00:04:44.510> I<00:04:44.630> don't<00:04:44.690> really<00:04:45.110> like<00:04:45.200> straight<00:04:45.680> hair

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
and I don't really like straight hair

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.800 
and I don't really like straight hair
with<00:04:45.980> me<00:04:46.130> anyway<00:04:46.760> because<00:04:47.000> I<00:04:47.240> just<00:04:47.510> don't<00:04:47.690> like

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
with me anyway because I just don't like

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.020 
with me anyway because I just don't like
the<00:04:47.960> look<00:04:48.140> anymore<00:04:48.440> well<00:04:49.070> these<00:04:49.280> ones<00:04:49.550> try

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
the look anymore well these ones try

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.460 
the look anymore well these ones try

Amazon eBay you know it's decently

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.530 
Amazon eBay you know it's decently
priced<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:55.010> it<00:04:55.160> does<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.490> job<00:04:55.520> it's<00:04:56.090> just<00:04:56.420> a
