 hi friends from youtube I'm ruiz here 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.670
 7.861 and today I bring you a new tutorial 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.520
 this tutorial is about how to eliminate or 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.200
 Block the advertising of your android without 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.200
 more let's start with the video 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.140
 and good friends today I come to 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.350
 teach how to remove advertising from your 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.290
 android if basically when we 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.600
 we put an application or a game we 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.760
 advertising appears that we do not want to see and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.170
 that bothers us pretty good we're going to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.180
 remove all that with an application 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.460
 called the way 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.400
 Huawei that I will be leaving in the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.500
 description of the video here we have the 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.250
 application and how can and how we can 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.630
 see below an ad appears 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.780
 taco el crispi chicken advertising and 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.330
 I do not know how good these things are 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.090
 we do not want to see are the ones we want 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.100
 remove here is the adobe app and 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.100
 all we do is install it 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.590
 We install and install it will be 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.609
 installing ready says it's already 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.359
 installed 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.359
 we give in open 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.780
 well it 's obvious that you have to be root to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.070
 to be able to use this application 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.659
 you have to be youtube users to 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.289
 to be able to use this application because 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.200
 obviously the best applications and 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.509
 the applications that serve better and everything 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.850
 the good thing about android is used when 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.670
 one is a root user why because 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.130
 root user is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.940
 it's the best there is, I can not tell you 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.209
 another way well so being already 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.459
 inside the adobe application we see 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.980
 that we see two little things says 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.200
 disabled downloading files and 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.730
 apply advertising block all 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.400
 hotz files from sources 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.440
 specified have been downloaded 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.110
 merged with their own own stuff 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.600
 lists and installed as a single file 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.099
 hotz in your system and a little bit says 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.180
 disable advertising lock the 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.100
 state was the hotz file 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.690
 predetermined system that means 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.420
 this when we no longer want 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.610
 use the application or do not know 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.140
 any reason we just give it there 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.360
 where it says disable and they will remain 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.280
 normally as if we had never 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.200
 has installed the application so let's go 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.050
 to give in downloading files and we are going to 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.330
 wait for the files to download 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.520
 and well as we see here it says applied 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.620
 successfully the changes were applied with 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.450
 success it may be necessary to restart 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.540
 android for the changes surtan 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.400
 effect I wanted to start to avoid 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.500
 data loss make sure there is not 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.070
 no application using the card 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.690
 sd right now so well I'm going to 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.260
 restart and all that to see the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.750
 change so in a moment I see them and 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.660
 well I had already started my phone and 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.930
 all that, so let's focus on 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.940
 that the application really works 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.450
 let's put in the same place as I 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.790
 I got in before and we saw the publicity 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.280
 I am within the application of art 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.250
 file manager which I use for my 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.550
 things and we see that abajito no longer appears 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.950
 no advertising is white as 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.200
 we see is white does not appear advertising 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.200
 nothing appears I'm here 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.870
 enough time and nothing appears 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.420
 normally when one enters a 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.700
 application the advertising lasts on 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.380
 appear about 10 seconds and have already 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.050
 passed more than 10 seconds if it does not appear 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.840
 nothing I'm connected to the internet like 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.940
 we can see most of the 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.240
 advertising that appears is because we are 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.910
 connected to the internet either data or 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.400
 wifi and still nothing appears so 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.680
 we see that adware really works and 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.780
 it works and they put me in any 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.960
 application that is not going to appear 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.150
 no advertising so well that 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.850
 I would be everything I hope you liked it 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.920
 this video and 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.170
 if you did not know in the application good 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.070
 talk they know already know what it is that 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:38.530
 does because some people do not know 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.360
 how to remove android advertising and 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.950
 because there are other ways of 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.080
 remove advertising not only with 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.050
 this application there are other ways 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.540
 more but with this application we can 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.760
 do we can remove it altogether we can 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.220
 be sure that we really take away 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.770
 all side either with or without internet 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.650
