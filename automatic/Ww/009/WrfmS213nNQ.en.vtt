00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.589
 hello to all I introduce myself chain 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.740
 young I am a physical trainer and 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.449
 I discovered the stand up paddle 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.400
 thanks to nat nat squale girl i 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.949
 found this extraordinary sleeve and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.949
 I tried to combine my profession my 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.690
 job with this activity trying 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.190
 to bring elastics on this 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.440
 board between us we find a system 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.970
 to increase the resistance on each 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.949
 exercise I have the honor to meet 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.980
 the whole swimming team that I would have 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.900
 proposed this idea there they loved 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.210
 the idea today 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.660
 we go from launching first concept 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.430
 first stand-up paddle boards 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.930
 dedicated to 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.210
 at the training 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.230
 on the so a big thank you to any 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.230
 the team for this beautiful adventure 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.470
 hi my name is bruno welcome and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.930
 you are talking about a new activity 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.670
 we put up on a stand up 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.909
 paddle 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.259
 the goal being to work 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.869
 the stabilizer and all the muscles 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.999
 engines by adding resistance with 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.369
 elastic could move on the board 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:23.469
 in order to use different points 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.250
 home to work because 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.250
 the popular ones 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.220
 in the interest of this work there 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.480
 regardless of whether 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.370
 paddle and to be outdoors and from 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.430
 to oxygenate of course to use the price 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.300
 as an unstable object to rework 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.920
 its stability 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.480
 a physical quality we tend a 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.090
 little bit neglected triceps biceps 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.930
 thighs abs glutes to stand sitting 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.760
 knees on the board 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.860
 so welcome to all the curious 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.860
 a try it's great 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.170
 Yes
