00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
season two she'll be in a lot of

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.420 
season two she'll be in a lot of
episodes<00:02:09.599> she's<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.229> enough<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> series

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
episodes she's not enough to be a series

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.120 
episodes she's not enough to be a series
regular<00:02:11.700> that's<00:02:12.420> what<00:02:12.599> I'm<00:02:12.720> thinking

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
regular that's what I'm thinking

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.410 
regular that's what I'm thinking
I<00:02:13.160> still<00:02:13.670> think<00:02:13.700> she's<00:02:13.910> gonna<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.270> vital

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
I still think she's gonna be a vital

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.210 
I still think she's gonna be a vital
part<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.870> series<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.440> hope<00:02:15.920> she<00:02:16.130> gets

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
part of the series I hope she gets

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.580 
part of the series I hope she gets
bumped<00:02:16.610> up<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.760> see<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.210> series<00:02:17.540> regular<00:02:17.690> if<00:02:18.170> she

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
bumped up to see a series regular if she

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.410 
bumped up to see a series regular if she
makes<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:19.070> up<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.310> season<00:02:19.610> four<00:02:19.910> because<00:02:20.330> I

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
makes it up to season four because I

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.450 
makes it up to season four because I
think<00:02:20.630> they<00:02:20.990> should<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.260> bumped<00:02:22.010> her<00:02:22.100> up<00:02:22.160> for

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
think they should have bumped her up for

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.160 
think they should have bumped her up for
this<00:02:22.640> season<00:02:23.060> but<00:02:23.300> depending<00:02:23.810> on<00:02:23.930> how<00:02:24.050> much

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
this season but depending on how much

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.810 
this season but depending on how much
they're<00:02:24.380> going<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.590> use<00:02:24.770> her<00:02:24.950> maybe<00:02:25.310> shot<00:02:25.580> that

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
they're going to use her maybe shot that

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.370 
they're going to use her maybe shot that
be<00:02:26.270> utilized<00:02:26.720> more<00:02:26.990> for<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.140> League<00:02:27.290> of

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
be utilized more for the League of

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.750 
be utilized more for the League of
Assassins<00:02:27.860> we<00:02:28.010> don't<00:02:28.190> know<00:02:28.250> exactly<00:02:28.370> why

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
Assassins we don't know exactly why

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.490

she's back but just happy to see sour
back<00:02:30.830> because<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.160> think<00:02:31.340> she's<00:02:31.490> interesting

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
back because I think she's interesting

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.510

character<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.080> overall<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.800> liked<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.250> trailer

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
character so overall I liked the trailer

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.010 
character so overall I liked the trailer
again<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.880> think<00:02:35.030> there's<00:02:35.360> some<00:02:35.600> missing

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
again I think there's some missing

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.410 
again I think there's some missing
things<00:02:36.290> again<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.340> amalgam<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.150> could<00:02:38.330> have

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
things again the amalgam I could have

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.640 
things again the amalgam I could have
seen<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.600> little<00:02:38.810> bit<00:02:38.990> more<00:02:39.200> bets<00:02:39.470> because

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
seen a little bit more bets because

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.570 
seen a little bit more bets because
they're<00:02:39.890> probably<00:02:40.040> not<00:02:40.250> gonna<00:02:40.370> be<00:02:40.460> in<00:02:40.520> the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
they're probably not gonna be in the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.670 
they're probably not gonna be in the
first<00:02:40.760> episode<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.540> mean<00:02:42.080> second<00:02:42.470> episode

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
first episode I mean second episode

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.830 
first episode I mean second episode
hopefully<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.520> second<00:02:43.820> episode<00:02:43.880> because

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
hopefully the second episode because

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.750 
hopefully the second episode because
that's<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.290> storyline<00:02:45.650> I'm<00:02:45.980> totally<00:02:46.370> looking

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
that's a storyline I'm totally looking

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.920 
that's a storyline I'm totally looking
forward<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:47.150> probably<00:02:47.450> storming<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
forward to probably storming the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.240 
forward to probably storming the
storyline<00:02:48.320> I'm<00:02:48.440> most<00:02:48.650> looking<00:02:48.800> forward<00:02:48.980> to

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
storyline I'm most looking forward to

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.550 
storyline I'm most looking forward to
but<00:02:49.940> we<00:02:50.030> do<00:02:50.150> get<00:02:50.300> see<00:02:50.480> some<00:02:50.690> Hong<00:02:50.870> Kong<00:02:51.170> stuff

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
but we do get see some Hong Kong stuff

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.620 
but we do get see some Hong Kong stuff
and<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:51.980> does<00:02:52.280> look<00:02:52.490> interesting<00:02:52.730> it's<00:02:53.390> it's

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
and that does look interesting it's it's

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.390 
and that does look interesting it's it's
better<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.230> they're<00:02:54.560> off<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.860> island<00:02:55.040> I

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
better that they're off the island I

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.730 
better that they're off the island I

Kord<00:05:30.410> even<00:05:30.740> though<00:05:30.830> they've<00:05:31.010> been

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
Kord even though they've been

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.700 
Kord even though they've been
referencing<00:05:31.640> him<00:05:31.850> since<00:05:32.120> season<00:05:32.390> one<00:05:32.720> so<00:05:33.289> I

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
referencing him since season one so I

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.110 
referencing him since season one so I
don't<00:05:33.919> think<00:05:34.250> we'll<00:05:34.310> see<00:05:34.370> him<00:05:34.580> this<00:05:34.700> season<00:05:34.880> I

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.120 
don't think we'll see him this season I
have<00:05:35.419> a<00:05:35.450> feeling<00:05:35.900> legal<00:05:36.620> things<00:05:36.860> might<00:05:37.100> work

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
have a feeling legal things might work

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.210 
have a feeling legal things might work
out<00:05:37.490> in<00:05:37.789> future<00:05:38.600> seasons<00:05:38.780> I<00:05:39.110> think<00:05:39.140> maybe<00:05:39.979> has

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
out in future seasons I think maybe has

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.310 
out in future seasons I think maybe has
to<00:05:40.340> do<00:05:40.460> with<00:05:40.580> Gotham<00:05:41.090> ork<00:05:41.330> on<00:05:41.510> scene<00:05:41.780> that's

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
to do with Gotham ork on scene that's

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.040 
to do with Gotham ork on scene that's
why<00:05:42.500> they<00:05:42.680> can't<00:05:42.919> use<00:05:43.160> him<00:05:43.400> but<00:05:44.050> looking

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
why they can't use him but looking

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.110 
why they can't use him but looking
forward<00:05:45.080> to<00:05:45.380> seeing<00:05:45.560> what<00:05:45.770> arrow<00:05:45.979> does<00:05:46.370> so
