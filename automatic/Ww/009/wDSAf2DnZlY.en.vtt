is<00:00:19.619> putting<00:00:19.920> up<00:00:20.010> massive<00:00:20.490> amounts<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.789> power

horrible run I mean what can you expect
from<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.140> scarfs<00:01:27.590> too<00:01:28.520> much<00:01:28.640> power<00:01:28.850> for<00:01:28.880> the

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
from the scarfs too much power for the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.730 
from the scarfs too much power for the
rear<00:01:29.329> wheels<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:29.869> doesn't<00:01:30.350> give<00:01:30.439> you<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.560> all

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
rear wheels and doesn't give you the all

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.580 
rear wheels and doesn't give you the all
wheel<00:01:30.860> drive<00:01:31.100> option<00:01:31.549> so

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
wheel drive option so

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.380 
wheel drive option so
I<00:01:32.740> don't<00:01:33.250> know<00:01:33.310> if<00:01:33.399> they<00:01:33.520> just<00:01:33.670> don't<00:01:33.820> like<00:01:33.939> no

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
I don't know if they just don't like no

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.510 
I don't know if they just don't like no
Corvettes<00:01:34.960> or<00:01:35.140> something<00:01:35.590> but<00:01:35.799> you<00:01:36.369> just

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
Corvettes or something but you just

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.930 
Corvettes or something but you just
can't<00:01:36.700> put<00:01:36.939> a<00:01:37.140> all-wheel<00:01:38.140> drive<00:01:38.350> on<00:01:38.530> them

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.480 

yeah<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.780> trying<00:01:43.290> again<00:01:43.650> maybe<00:01:43.980> see

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
yeah I was just trying again maybe see

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.130 
yeah I was just trying again maybe see
if<00:01:44.550> I<00:01:44.640> can

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
if I can

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.690 
if I can
I<00:01:46.290> did<00:01:46.830> manage<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> little<00:01:47.490> better

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
I did manage to get a little better

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.520 
I did manage to get a little better
lunch<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.270> here

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.250 

this<00:01:56.130> car<00:01:56.340> does<00:01:56.549> take<00:01:56.760> the<00:01:56.790> cake<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.780> I

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
this car does take the cake for the I

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.670 
this car does take the cake for the I
guess<00:01:58.530> scariest<00:01:58.979> car<00:01:59.190> I've<00:01:59.340> driven<00:01:59.369> so<00:02:00.060> far<00:02:00.680> 16

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
guess scariest car I've driven so far 16

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.559 
guess scariest car I've driven so far 16
16<00:02:02.580> 56<00:02:03.710> km<00:02:04.710> dr.<00:02:04.920> Moore<00:02:05.100> 16<00:02:05.580> 5<00:02:05.790> 6<00:02:06.030> 7<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:07.970> mean<00:02:08.970> so

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
16 56 km dr. Moore 16 5 6 7 I mean so

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.940 
16 56 km dr. Moore 16 5 6 7 I mean so
this<00:02:09.720> isn't<00:02:09.990> like<00:02:10.170> really<00:02:10.410> breaking<00:02:10.679> any

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
this isn't like really breaking any

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.030 
this isn't like really breaking any
records<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:12.200> even<00:02:13.200> if<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.380> wants<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.739> spend<00:02:13.950> a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
records here even if I wants to spend a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.680 
records here even if I wants to spend a
while<00:02:14.160> turning<00:02:14.489> on<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.940> I'm<00:02:15.230> probably<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.440> old

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
while turning on it I'm probably be old

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.300 
while turning on it I'm probably be old
not<00:02:18.690> much<00:02:18.930> faster<00:02:19.560> that's<00:02:19.770> all<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.010> could<00:02:20.100> say

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
not much faster that's all I could say

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.550 
not much faster that's all I could say
it<00:02:20.430> won't<00:02:20.550> be<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.760> much<00:02:21.000> faster<00:02:21.569> just

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
it won't be that much faster just

this<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:27.510> will<00:02:27.750> spin<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> gear<00:02:28.980> length<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.519> all

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
this one will spin a gear length and all

this one will spin a gear length and all
that<00:02:29.790> mess<00:02:29.970> it's<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.950> lot<00:02:31.950> of

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
that mess it's just a lot of

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
wound up awfully quick and then the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.870 
wound up awfully quick and then the
front<00:03:49.530> tires<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.920> didn't<00:03:50.220> take<00:03:50.370> too<00:03:50.520> long<00:03:50.700> I

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
front tires I didn't take too long I

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.310 
front tires I didn't take too long I
think<00:03:50.910> right<00:03:51.300> around<00:03:51.450> here<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.870> whenever<00:03:52.110> they

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
think right around here is whenever they

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.640 
think right around here is whenever they
really<00:03:52.950> were

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.949 

the<00:04:01.129> car<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.610> was<00:04:01.730> chasing<00:04:02.090> down<00:04:02.420> on<00:04:02.720> this

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
the car that I was chasing down on this

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.240 
the car that I was chasing down on this
track<00:04:03.319> was<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.799> Viper

no no no the srt 10 is the srt t invited
so<00:04:15.220> go<00:04:15.370> figure<00:04:15.549> it's<00:04:15.879> another<00:04:16.090> vet<00:04:16.359> versus<00:04:16.690> a

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
so go figure it's another vet versus a

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.660 
so go figure it's another vet versus a
viper<00:04:17.109> battle

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.530 

right<00:04:23.240> here<00:04:23.420> I'm<00:04:23.630> nowhere<00:04:23.870> near<00:04:24.020> so<00:04:24.650> no

I<00:04:25.630> said<00:04:26.170> just<00:04:26.400> concentrating<00:04:27.400> more<00:04:27.550> on

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
I said just concentrating more on

a fast lap on the next upcoming section
here

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.100 

balls<00:04:41.760> to<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:41.970> walls<00:04:42.030> out<00:04:42.480> here<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:42.750> wasn't

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
balls to the walls out here I wasn't

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.930 
balls to the walls out here I wasn't
holding<00:04:43.200> back

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.400 

unfortunately<00:04:48.940> I<00:04:49.000> did<00:04:49.389> not<00:04:49.419> beat<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.050> Viper

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
unfortunately I did not beat the Viper

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.159 
unfortunately I did not beat the Viper
time<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:50.830> came<00:04:51.040> like<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.760> think<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:52.720> 10<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.139> a

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
time I came like I think to 10 to a

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.710 
time I came like I think to 10 to a
second<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:54.250> just<00:04:54.580> had<00:04:54.729> more<00:04:55.030> grip<00:04:55.360> than<00:04:55.389> this

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
second it just had more grip than this

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.750 
second it just had more grip than this
car<00:04:56.020> had<00:04:56.229> so<00:04:56.770> it<00:04:57.010> was<00:04:57.100> really<00:04:57.220> not<00:04:57.430> much<00:04:57.580> I

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
car had so it was really not much I

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.330 
car had so it was really not much I
could<00:04:57.820> have<00:04:58.030> done<00:04:58.180> about<00:04:58.210> it

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
could have done about it

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.490 
could have done about it
but<00:04:59.970> for<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.330> most<00:05:00.510> part<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:00.900> was<00:05:00.990> staying<00:05:01.260> with

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
but for the most part I was staying with

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.170 
but for the most part I was staying with
them<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:01.889> even<00:05:02.130> passed<00:05:02.400> them<00:05:02.669> here<00:05:02.910> on<00:05:03.030> this

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
them I even passed them here on this

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.230 
them I even passed them here on this
upcoming<00:05:03.690> section<00:05:04.669> of<00:05:05.669> course<00:05:05.910> y'all<00:05:06.060> can't

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.420 
upcoming section of course y'all can't
see<00:05:06.449> exist<00:05:06.780> just<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.080> ghost

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.220 

right<00:05:11.060> here<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.420> transition<00:05:11.960> into<00:05:12.080> the

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
right here the transition into the

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.790 
right here the transition into the
bridge<00:05:13.360> actually<00:05:14.360> was<00:05:14.930> ahead<00:05:15.110> of<00:05:15.290> them<00:05:15.530> for<00:05:15.770> I

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
bridge actually was ahead of them for I

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.530 
bridge actually was ahead of them for I
guess<00:05:16.100> maybe<00:05:16.340> a<00:05:16.460> brief<00:05:16.760> second<00:05:17.240> or<00:05:17.360> two<00:05:17.510> and

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
guess maybe a brief second or two and

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.879 
guess maybe a brief second or two and
then

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
then

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.219 
then
ended<00:05:19.430> up<00:05:19.520> pulling<00:05:19.699> ahead<00:05:19.939> of<00:05:20.210> me<00:05:20.300> at<00:05:20.419> the<00:05:20.569> next

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
ended up pulling ahead of me at the next

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:27.700 
ended up pulling ahead of me at the next
corner

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.470 

I<00:05:27.860> think<00:05:28.580> it<00:05:28.640> was<00:05:28.700> just<00:05:28.790> a<00:05:28.970> little<00:05:29.180> flick<00:05:29.390> of

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
I think it was just a little flick of

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.120 
I think it was just a little flick of
the<00:05:29.510> throttle<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.050> you<00:05:30.200> can<00:05:30.350> bring<00:05:30.680> that<00:05:30.740> tail

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
the throttle and you can bring that tail

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:37.740 
the throttle and you can bring that tail
end<00:05:31.370> out<00:05:31.720> right<00:05:32.720> here<00:05:32.900> he<00:05:33.110> poured<00:05:33.590> ahead<00:05:33.830> of<00:05:33.950> me

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.720
