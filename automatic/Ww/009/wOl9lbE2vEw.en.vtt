Hey guys welcome back to Mimeiku

00:00:09.703 --> 00:00:11.453
Sorry the vid is a bit washed out 
 this time - I'm working on it!!!

00:00:11.453 --> 00:00:16.670
So a while back me and one of 
 my favourite YouTube friends did a swap!

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.004
Of course I'm talking about KimDao! :) 

00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:24.866
So I'm going to show you what she generously gave me!!! 

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:30.108
You can check out the stuff I gave Kim 
 on her channel (mostly Japanese products!) 

00:00:30.108 --> 00:00:31.941
check her out because she is AMAZING.

00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:37.278
I told Kim I was interested in Elf products 
 and she got me this lip stain! 

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:40.776
When you say lip stain I can't help but 
 think of the super-popular Revlon Lip Balm Stain

00:00:41.365 --> 00:00:44.540
But the cool thing about this is...

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.411
it looks and feels just like a felt tip pen!!!!!

00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:49.260
It isn't that pigmented, just a very light pink.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.835
Next up: eyes!

00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:52.797
Milani was another brand I was interested in

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:56.194
And this is really interesting packaging!

00:00:56.647 --> 00:00:59.638
I haven't used it yet but the neutral shades look perfect for everyday!

00:00:59.638 --> 00:01:01.568
BYS Spring Bouquet eyeshadow 

00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:05.963
This is a cool Australian brand that also sells in 
 Japan (but is way more expensive here) 

00:01:05.963 --> 00:01:07.706
I really love purple eyeshadow so thank you so much Kim!

00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:10.852
Of course I was dying to try one of these! 

00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:13.738
I've heard so much about Maybelline's Color Tattoo Eyeshadows 

00:01:13.738 --> 00:01:16.742
But they haven't come to Japan yet!!!

00:01:20.197 --> 00:01:23.357
I really really wanted this so very happy! 

00:01:23.357 --> 00:01:25.396
And I REALLY like it, too! I NEED MOARRRR.

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:30.051
Next is another BYS product, eye shadow mousse in brown 

00:01:32.387 --> 00:01:35.500
I saw this in 109 but they only had the 
 tester!! So Kim bought it for me in Oz!

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.259
Really perfect if you want a bit of a daring 
 night-out look! Love how pretty it is :D

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.470
Next up!

00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:43.760
This is another eyeshadow that's packaged interestingly!

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:48.440
From the Australian brand Chi Chi

00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:59.750
And it oil-free, talc-free, fragrance-free, etc.! Which is great 
 if you have sensitive skin like me! 

00:02:00.218 --> 00:02:01.460
Next up, blusher!

00:02:03.183 --> 00:02:06.510
This is a Milani Illuminator 

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:11.160
The pattern stamped into the powder is just TOO PRETTY

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.650
Physician's Formula is another brand I really wanted to 
 try and these are seriously adorable 

00:02:14.654 --> 00:02:23.460
Happy Booster in Natural and Light Bronzer

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:27.460
Aside from being too freaking cute for this world 

00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:30.250
the design is really great, especially if you want to carry it around!

00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:35.020
There's a mirror and a brush stacked in :D

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:40.270
I see TONNES of cute and innovative blushers in 
 Japan but nothing quite like this 

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:43.690
Aside from which they are very pretty colours! 

00:02:44.035 --> 00:02:47.080
So here's something else I was dying to try

00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:52.110
Elf's St Lucia 

00:02:54.493 --> 00:03:04.130
I saw so many blogs and vlogs saying this 
 was a great dupe for Nars blushers

00:03:04.131 --> 00:03:05.410
so I really really wanted to try it

00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:11.280
The blush has a very pretty shimmery gold in it and is super-pigmented 

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:14.290
and I do really like it, it's a great colour for Autumn 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.720
Last up Chi Chi blush!

00:03:18.471 --> 00:03:24.550
This is also a Real Minerals type? Brand? Collection? 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.140
And the pigmentation is, like, almost TOO good

00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:29.500
Let's take a look

00:03:29.495 --> 00:03:32.060
Oooooh it's all spilling 

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:37.060
You can see that you REALLY have to 
 use a light hand with this one

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:41.080
and this also has a pretty shimmer to it

00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:43.160
THANK YOU SO MUCH KIM!

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:52.970
Check out Kim's channel!

00:03:52.974 --> 00:03:53.960
See ya!
