00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.299
 yes 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.500
 we are in a new channel that as I already 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 You have seen the title because I know that 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.850
 you are very savvy and you will know that my 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.489
 son calls of the faith the laboratory and 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.309
 it's a kind of party game like in 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.230
 pixel but here different 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.720
 let's play three mini games that are 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.790
 three experiments which is going to 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.250
 propose a doctor that you will now see here 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.260
 the super animation that cool a lot and the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.850
 that is better than those three 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.320
 experiments will gain more atoms and the one that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.339
 earn more atoms because they will be the best 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.420
 lab guinea pig and well then 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.040
 enjoy the intro because I think 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.400
 that is very very very currada to be 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.400
 Minecraft 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.920
 already 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.829
 plus 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.829
 yes 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.830
 As you can see, he's very, very handsome 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.830
 preparations 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.590
 you have seen that peak in the particles 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.560
 all the text music erpac is 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.460
 too good, so it's worth in this 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.110
 minigame that we have to do is 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.110
 we have a color that we will now see what 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.840
 is and we have to worry about trying 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.110
 be the one that our cross the most 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.700
 which is more 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:57.510
 and I'll come back to it, I 'm going to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.250
 devote to that wall there and a 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.950
 recommendation that I do to you is that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.530
 paint is the roof of roofing the damn 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.979
 key 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.959
 the law leader as you see the high fringes 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.340
 because most people do not know 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.340
 perkata of the high zones 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.940
 It's worth, it's worth, it's worth, you see, there's another 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.440
 boy who does know and has crossed out 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.280
 all the roof but I now with the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.280
 I recover it 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.960
 first 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.810
 to these walls that are not touched I am 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.810
 the dark green and is winning and winning 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.590
 ok let's paint that from there 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.590
 that we have repainted 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.650
 therefore both all of us are going to 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.820
 paint this that nobody has painted it 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.820
 we can take advantage of this wall 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.980
 it is worth we must prevent us 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.470
 take away what was painted by us 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.460
 if we do not lose points 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.930
 and paint more things around here 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.579
 the day and I do not know what 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.579
 I would be going to know what color has 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.350
 to take it off you know 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.210
 voucher voucher 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.080
 I leave amount the first I do not know how much 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.830
 time is six seconds come I have 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.950
 to continue this well 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.410
 voucher of gualeguay 3 we have 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.890
 got three three atoms and pissing 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.020
 about six mind there and huawei at the moment 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.260
 I do not know, I'd like to know who the other one is 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.910
 Uncle is worth football, this is a kind of 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.030
 paintball that from my point of view 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.280
 it's a little bit wrong because you can 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.490
 you can change pretty well that is 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.030
 if a guy stands in front of me for now 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.830
 You will see how people change 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.260
 people were advancing by the euro looking at 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.269
 others to shoot waves 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.940
 and that's the way he tends 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.710
 get points 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.350
 so it's a bit boring but good 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.950
 I do not know if I hit you 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.710
 it is said they remove points I do not know 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.870
 increase here the one that gets the most 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.120
 it is the one who stays who stays 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.379
 still 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.379
 pointing to another 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.709
 shoot this and aunt did not shoot me 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.210
 because I do not know if it will remove points but 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.210
 maybe for this way people 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.930
 to this one is clear I will not get 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.969
 any point as this because yes 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.519
 yes they are a team of two 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:42.870
 it gets more between them and it's done 

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:46.290
 the clear question that no point 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.520
 unfortunately but well nothing happens 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.760
 I go through this one I have a file di 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.760
 simÃ³ 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.200
 on the other hand 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.510
 titin 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.940
 nothing here I do not think I draw points that 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:05.000
 They have 20 seconds but 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.850
 go to date the max ready 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.960
 nadal or points for carlos castle well 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.070
 with a bit of luck those who are 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.610
 getting the points we have 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.290
 got before and do not get ahead of me young 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.290
 uncle helmet that more than everything 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.879
 is still first tied with taras and 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.289
 thank god no one of those who have 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.670
 got the points we got those from 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.280
 before 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.960
 thank god and it's worth and this is breaking 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.790
 blocks here what we have to do is 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.800
 destroy the machine most of 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.000
 blocks and every time we pick a 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.100
 gold block gives us the tdt 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.890
 and for the blocks some are worth more than 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.470
 others but I do not know what else blocks 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.130
 destroy 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.590
 one here another one around here another one here 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.800
 another over here 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.780
 another one over here and we're going to apply another 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.040
 hit we continue 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:03.060
 another one here and another one ahead 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.060
 and another one over here 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.169
 while we can go breaking for 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:13.120
 continue with the advantage for the first 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.900
 at the beginning of the first game already 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.599
 that I put was to apply everything with the 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.969
 shovel and is not a good idea and I say 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:26.169
 Even if you think you 're super fast, 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:29.440
 It's a good idea about TV, a ticket 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.900
 Well, most likely he wins 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.420
 let's go how things are going is what 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.980
 will happen 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:40.400
 for now that seems like that I need more 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:44.670
 value blocks 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.760
 the blocks of gold the blocks 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:51.200
 OK 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:55.260
 from followed by tdt 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.820
 from here it's worth the failure that I 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.440
 liberated 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.330
 Michael 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.759
 come on we have to break 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.819
 the gentleman calls me do not give me week 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:10.449
 be it for the moment it takes me I'll take 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:14.689
 the victory may be possible that 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:18.680
 we will start and you know if it's worth 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:21.349
 win a new to the exact segment win
