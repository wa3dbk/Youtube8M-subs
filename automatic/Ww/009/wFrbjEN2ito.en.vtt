00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and the dual capacitor mod allows us to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.760

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
ground the top of each pot to a central

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.420 
ground the top of each pot to a central
point<00:01:59.970> I<00:02:00.329> always<00:02:00.810> use<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.350> top<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.100> volume

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
point I always use the top of the volume

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.740 
point I always use the top of the volume
pot<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.790> then<00:02:02.880> from<00:02:03.060> there<00:02:03.240> run<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
pot and then from there run to the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.740 
pot and then from there run to the
ground<00:02:04.020> wire<00:02:04.740> for<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> bridge<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.750> remember

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
ground wire for the bridge and remember

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.889 
ground wire for the bridge and remember
that<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.280> volume<00:02:08.280> pot<00:02:08.489> lug<00:02:08.819> number<00:02:09.149> 3<00:02:09.509> does

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that on the volume pot lug number 3 does

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.319 
that on the volume pot lug number 3 does
need<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.319> grounded<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.639> either<00:02:11.999> use<00:02:12.299> a

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
need to be grounded so either use a

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.299 
need to be grounded so either use a
jumper<00:02:12.959> wire<00:02:13.139> from<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.439> lug<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.859> the<00:02:13.980> top<00:02:14.159> of

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:14.309 
jumper wire from the lug to the top of

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.000 
jumper wire from the lug to the top of
the<00:02:14.370> pot<00:02:14.549> or<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:14.909> bend<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.269> back

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
the pot or just bend it back

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.059 
the pot or just bend it back
okay<00:02:16.760> next<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.269> output<00:02:17.599> wiring<00:02:18.319> as<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.920> can

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
okay next is output wiring as you can

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.470 
okay next is output wiring as you can
see<00:02:19.250> I've<00:02:19.400> kind<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.730> removed<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.090> couple<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.390> the

see I've kind of removed a couple of the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.729 
see I've kind of removed a couple of the
other<00:02:20.569> wires<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.049> keep<00:02:21.200> things<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.500> little<00:02:21.650> bit

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
other wires to keep things a little bit

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.770 
other wires to keep things a little bit
cleaner<00:02:21.980> here<00:02:22.310> we're<00:02:23.209> going<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.450> take<00:02:23.629> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.250 
pot and go to the ring portion of the
jack<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.849> then<00:02:29.450> we're<00:02:29.629> going<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.780> take<00:02:29.930> lug

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
jack and then we're going to take lug

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.410 
jack and then we're going to take lug
number<00:02:30.560> two<00:02:30.799> from<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.220> volume<00:02:31.519> pot<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.970> go<00:02:32.360> to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
number two from the volume pot and go to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.220 
number two from the volume pot and go to
the<00:02:33.349> tip<00:02:33.709> portion<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.459> jack

the tip portion of the jack

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.410 
the tip portion of the jack
now<00:02:36.230> we<00:02:36.290> move<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.739> capacitor<00:02:37.519> wiring<00:02:37.970> this

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
now we move on to capacitor wiring this

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.470 
now we move on to capacitor wiring this
is<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:38.870> same<00:02:39.349> wiring<00:02:39.680> for<00:02:40.160> both<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.970> tone

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
is the same wiring for both of the tone

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.940 
is the same wiring for both of the tone
pots<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:42.049> doesn't<00:02:42.379> matter<00:02:42.530> which<00:02:42.650> one<00:02:42.829> you're

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
pots it doesn't matter which one you're

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.210 
pots it doesn't matter which one you're
working<00:02:43.340> on<00:02:43.489> we<00:02:44.209> are<00:02:44.329> going<00:02:44.720> from<00:02:45.110> lug<00:02:45.799> number

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
working on we are going from lug number

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.690 
working on we are going from lug number
three<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:48.230> ground<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:49.280> you're<00:02:49.400> going<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.549> take

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
three to ground so you're going to take

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.970 
three to ground so you're going to take
one<00:02:49.940> capacitor<00:02:50.599> one<00:02:50.840> end<00:02:51.049> ground<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.799> to<00:02:51.950> the
