00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
caliper it was a 14 millimeter pair of

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.080 
caliper it was a 14 millimeter pair of
bolts<00:01:28.600> there<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:28.960> now<00:01:29.710> I'm<00:01:30.010> going<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.430> take

that<00:01:38.560> was<00:01:38.680> also<00:01:38.980> a<00:01:39.010> 14<00:01:39.460> millimeter<00:01:39.750> they<00:01:40.750> have

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
that was also a 14 millimeter they have

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.260 
that was also a 14 millimeter they have
lock<00:01:41.050> washers<00:01:41.470> on<00:01:41.620> them<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.820> set<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.150> aside

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
lock washers on them just set that aside

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.170 
lock washers on them just set that aside
and<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.250> next<00:01:45.460> step<00:01:45.610> will<00:01:45.760> be<00:01:45.820> pulling

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
and then the next step will be pulling

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.690 
and then the next step will be pulling
the<00:01:46.240> rotor<00:01:46.450> off<00:01:46.690> now<00:01:47.380> in<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.620> rotor<00:01:47.860> it's<00:01:48.490> got

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
the rotor off now in this rotor it's got

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.720 
the rotor off now in this rotor it's got
a<00:01:48.730> lock<00:01:49.390> screw<00:01:49.690> or<00:01:49.870> set<00:01:50.080> screw<00:01:50.320> right<00:01:50.470> here

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
a lock screw or set screw right here

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.520 
a lock screw or set screw right here
just<00:01:51.730> a<00:01:51.820> little<00:01:51.910> Philips<00:01:52.330> take<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.290> screw

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
just a little Philips take that screw

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.070 
just a little Philips take that screw
out<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.950> then<00:01:54.610> this<00:01:54.760> rotor<00:01:55.030> will<00:01:55.180> come<00:01:55.360> off

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.340 

okay

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
okay

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.920 
okay
the<00:02:00.190> screws<00:02:00.550> out<00:02:02.040> remove<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.780> set<00:02:04.780> your

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
the screws out remove that set your

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.080 
the screws out remove that set your
rotor<00:02:05.050> side<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.490> that<00:02:06.970> exposes<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.660> hub<00:02:07.920> now

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
rotor side and that exposes the hub now

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.680 
rotor side and that exposes the hub now
this<00:02:10.090> hub<00:02:10.300> also<00:02:10.569> has<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.940> ring<00:02:13.180> on<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.569> for<00:02:14.140> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
this hub also has the ring on it for the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.300 
this hub also has the ring on it for the
ABS<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.990> think<00:02:17.590> they'll<00:02:17.710> come<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.160> way

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
ABS I think they'll come that way

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.080 
ABS I think they'll come that way
and<00:02:19.450> also<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:21.500> can<00:02:21.650> look<00:02:21.709> at<00:02:21.860> your<00:02:22.090> parking

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
and also you can look at your parking

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.030 
and also you can look at your parking
brake<00:02:23.120> shoes<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:24.410> make<00:02:24.530> sure<00:02:24.680> they're<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:24.890> good

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
brake shoes to make sure they're in good

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.370 
brake shoes to make sure they're in good
shape<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.670> these<00:02:25.760> are<00:02:25.910> okay<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.480> little<00:02:27.140> wear

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
shape and these are okay a little wear

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.830 
shape and these are okay a little wear
on<00:02:27.560> them<00:02:27.680> but<00:02:27.800> that's<00:02:27.860> okay<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.569> next<00:02:29.720> step

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
on them but that's okay so the next step

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.100 
on them but that's okay so the next step
would<00:02:30.080> be<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.410> pull<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.130> 30<00:02:32.060> 32<00:02:32.690> millimeter

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
would be to pull this 30 32 millimeter

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.160 
would be to pull this 30 32 millimeter
nut<00:02:33.319> off<00:02:34.150> remove<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.300> hub<00:02:35.480> which<00:02:35.959> I've

nut off remove the hub which I've
already<00:02:36.410> actually<00:02:36.560> done<00:02:37.360> because<00:02:38.360> here's<00:02:38.599> the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
already actually done because here's the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.580 
already actually done because here's the
old<00:02:38.900> one<00:02:39.819> exactly<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:41.030> same<00:02:41.300> has<00:02:42.019> a<00:02:42.080> ring<00:02:42.440> on

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
old one exactly the same has a ring on

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.030 
old one exactly the same has a ring on
it<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.970> just<00:02:44.060> pull<00:02:44.269> that<00:02:44.390> off<00:02:44.599> and<00:02:45.040> it's

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
it and you just pull that off and it's

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.710 
it and you just pull that off and it's
nothing<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.519> it<00:02:46.670> if<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:46.849> nut<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.630> only

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
nothing to it if that nut is the only

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.870 
nothing to it if that nut is the only
thing<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.019> holds<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:49.120> there<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.150> go<00:02:50.739> so

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
thing and holds it on there you go so

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.180 
thing and holds it on there you go so
once<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.000> pull<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.330> off<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.650> new<00:02:54.830> one<00:02:55.010> this

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
once you pull that off the new one this

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.210 
once you pull that off the new one this
slips<00:02:55.549> right<00:02:55.640> back<00:02:55.910> on<00:02:56.560> tighten<00:02:57.560> down<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.709> 32

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
slips right back on tighten down that 32

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.800 
slips right back on tighten down that 32
millimeter<00:02:58.549> nut<00:02:58.760> in<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.120> case<00:02:59.299> I<00:02:59.420> went<00:02:59.600> right

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
millimeter nut in this case I went right

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.229 
millimeter nut in this case I went right
back<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.950> where<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.310> indication<00:03:01.790> was<00:03:01.940> of

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
back to the where the indication was of

the indent the lock as I talked about

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.059 
the indent the lock as I talked about
another<00:03:04.730> video<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:06.380> then<00:03:06.620> I'll<00:03:06.709> just<00:03:06.799> reverse

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
another video and then I'll just reverse

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.030 
another video and then I'll just reverse

it

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.380 

and<00:03:16.340> there<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.849> I'll<00:03:17.090> put<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:17.300> back

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
and there it is I'll put it back

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.410 
and there it is I'll put it back
