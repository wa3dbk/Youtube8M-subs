00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.619
 very good day everyone introduce me I am 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.710
 super psychotic better known as 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.259
 Trico I am new to this and since this 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.150
 video is a remake of an old clarion 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.310
 once this video does not have the 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.469
 intention to offend someone and to be 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.200
 so I apologize without further ado 

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:33.410
 let's start with the video 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.080
 good naruto versus dragon ball z never 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.360
 I had heard him as everyone will know Naruto and 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.230
 dragon ball z are two series sleeves 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.450
 anime 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.520
 one premiered in the 80s while 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.489
 that the other one premiered in November of 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.830
 year 1999 this clearly implies 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.130
 that the two series are of generations 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.739
 different is like comparing a xbox 360 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.500
 with the ps2 and if it hurts me to say it 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.960
 dragon ball z is an old series 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.140
 although that does not mean it's not good 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.089
 This brings with it many problems already 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.190
 that there are many people who compare them 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.770
 and discussions are generated and among others 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.020
 problems not only in Internet but 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.910
 also in real life this not only gives 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.040
 to understand the degree of immaturity of 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.650
 they argue but also makes them 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.750
 see ridiculous is seriously I remember a 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.240
 once I was browsing calmly 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.520
 internet when I meet a forum 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.530
 on the same subject and a comment was 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.750
 more than enough to start a great 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.750
 discussion the comment said something like that 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.509
 but good is that they do not know that by car 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.610
 he is more powerful than goku and with a racing 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.619
 there you can destroy it if it transforms 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.840
 in four tails kills the poor of today not 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.650
 they can say anything because it really hurts 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.650
 who hurts 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.610
 Of course, the comment contained more 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.670
 things and rudeness but now I do not remember 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.290
 x much as everyone knows is one goku 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.170
 of the most powerful warriors in the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.570
 multiverse comic anime movies series 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.880
 etcetera and I do not say it because it's a 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.310
 fanboy or something similar there is simply 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.010
 that be realistic as for example to me 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.200
 I love the character sony bmg is the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.120
 fastest hedgehog in the world but you have to 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.640
 Accept that flash from dc comics 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.680
 universe is much faster than sonic 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.810
 just like Kratos could be defeated 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.209
 for hold and there are many more examples 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.220
 what I want to imply is that there 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.110
 that being realistic does not work and 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.060
 defend a character so 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.130
 silly and if they are going to do it at least 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.230
 have a solid information that gives them 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.239
 the reason in my opinion I like 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.459
 much more dragon ball z than Naruto 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.680
 but it's my opinion and nobody can 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.480
 force me to change it like I do not 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.209
 I can force anyone to change their 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.280
 opinion this does not mean that I go 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.769
 to land Naruto just because he does not 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.410
 I like it as much as dragon ball z good 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.360
 both series are very good dragon ball 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.250
 z brings good messages 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.710
 excellent animation for its time 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.960
 well done designs full screens of 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.420
 a lot of action history well achieved and 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.460
 among other things and Naruto has a 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.920
 very polished animation designs well 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.780
 achieved good battles although not 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.760
 have as much action as dragon's 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.620
 ball z is compensated with its 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.140
 depth also brings very good 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.780
 messages and it's very entertaining to see 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.030
 another thing is that because they always put 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.590
 they two fighting could not put them 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.690
 together fighting evil 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.030
 wow yeah it would be very epic to see the two 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.250
 universes united to save the world in 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.350
 my opinion I would like much more that 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.030
 see them fighting each other and that 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.340
 then have to do a rush on 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.950
 camera and then leave us without food to 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.170
 all x of better unemployment I'm leaving the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.080
 theme and I get half subnormal x of 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.459
 well we have reached the final point and I can 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.459
 say well that the winner is 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.740
 us because we are the ones who 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.540
 we can decide what we want to see and 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.790
 when we want to see it that's why there's 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.040
 variety of things so that people 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.960
 can choose they imagine that only 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.090
 there was a thing of each thing and only 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.820
 we could enjoy that thing because the thing 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.519
 that we use not what he talked about like that 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.980
 good in conclusion naruto and dragon ball 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.900
 z are very good series and I do not see the 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.880
 reason why they have to argue for 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.130
 it's like there are people who enjoy 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.620
 seeing more to face others there are also 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.050
 who enjoy watching others laugh good in 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.540
 end i say goodbye thanks for watching the video 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.970

 Fried but home if this is a garden 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.840
 sonic this is a garden with chairs 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.900
 and a good table that they hoped would not 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.060
 was enough to buy me a house and for 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.420
 that you bought the garden if you do not have 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.240
 good house good everything is step by step 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:23.080
 first the garden then the pool then 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.100
 the house and then the world ok not and why 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.490
 do not work do not be lazy if you're not 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.490
 as lin 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.680
 is that apparently no one wants to hire 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.100
 a blue-haired subnormal geek 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.740
 the fried because you put this voice to me 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.570
 I wanted Jorge's because this is my 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.139
 video and I do what I want to play 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.800
 juas juas juas I like my voice I 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.800
 I feel sexy 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.060
 and good that they found the city well 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.520
 I think although everyone is crazy 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.610
 almost everyone speaks the same and you do not know 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.430
 really who is talking and what 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.160
 we arrived here a few hours ago and 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.650
 because the others did not come which 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.870
 you do not have friends and we do not 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.960
 paid to come out in this video and that 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.090
 it seems that it has good sounds I 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.250
 I go I have more important things that 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.100
 do as global seeks to be associated 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:26.430
