00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
don't know that I believe it because I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.660 
don't know that I believe it because I
know<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.320> would<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.710> much<00:02:04.860> more<00:02:04.920> likely<00:02:05.369> to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
know that I would be much more likely to

know<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> lot<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.770> neuro<00:02:08.069> marketing<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:09.179> kind<00:02:09.629> of

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
know a lot of neuro marketing is kind of

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
know a lot of neuro marketing is kind of
its<00:02:10.140> hype

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
its hype

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.930 
its hype
it's<00:02:11.130> not<00:02:11.250> really<00:02:11.400> backed<00:02:11.730> by<00:02:11.910> anything

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
it's not really backed by anything

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.090 
it's not really backed by anything
solidly<00:02:12.720> scientific<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.740> lot<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:13.920> your

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
solidly scientific and a lot of your

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.720 
solidly scientific and a lot of your
research<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.690> contaminated<00:02:15.690> by<00:02:15.780> confounding

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
research is contaminated by confounding

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.370 
research is contaminated by confounding
yeah<00:02:17.730> confounding<00:02:18.210> factors<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:19.110> aren't

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
yeah confounding factors that aren't

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.160 
yeah confounding factors that aren't
really<00:02:19.500> taken<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.340> account<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.420> don't<00:02:21.870> I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
really taken to account so you don't I

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.290 
really taken to account so you don't I
wouldn't<00:02:22.830> put<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.160> most<00:02:23.490> stock<00:02:23.850> into<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
wouldn't put the most stock into the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.710 
wouldn't put the most stock into the
study<00:02:24.570> yeah<00:02:25.050> but<00:02:25.410> let's<00:02:25.680> say<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.580> do<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.270> there

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
study yeah but let's say you do is there

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.330 
study yeah but let's say you do is there
anything<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:28.200> gives<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:28.890> kind<00:02:29.160> of

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
anything that gives you that kind of

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.210 
anything that gives you that kind of
like<00:02:29.870> subversive<00:02:30.870> feeling<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.980> know

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
like subversive feeling like you know

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.380 
like subversive feeling like you know
it's<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:34.340> like<00:02:35.340> liking<00:02:35.760> something<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.360> a

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
it's of like liking something for a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.970 
it's of like liking something for a
reason<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.900> shouldn't<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.590> for<00:02:37.770> maybe

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
reason you shouldn't like it for maybe

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.460 
reason you shouldn't like it for maybe
yeah<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.910> mean<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.300> think<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.900> but<00:02:40.200> when<00:02:40.290> one

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
yeah I mean I think that but when one

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.290 
yeah I mean I think that but when one
very<00:02:40.680> common<00:02:40.860> thing<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.370> when<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.760> toast<00:02:42.090> a

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
very common thing is when you toast a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.030 
very common thing is when you toast a
marshmallow<00:02:42.450> or<00:02:42.840> whatever<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.650> there<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.010> a

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
that if look if you want to have an

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.950 
that if look if you want to have an
interesting<00:04:29.550> study<00:04:29.729> create<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.360> Cheeto<00:04:30.780> that

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
interesting study create a Cheeto that

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.570 
interesting study create a Cheeto that
tastes<00:04:31.259> the<00:04:31.379> same<00:04:31.620> but<00:04:31.889> does<00:04:32.009> not<00:04:32.129> leave<00:04:32.370> that

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
tastes the same but does not leave that

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.070 
tastes the same but does not leave that
leave<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:32.909> film<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.360> then<00:04:33.449> just<00:04:33.629> see<00:04:33.900> how

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
leave the film and then just see how

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.480 
leave the film and then just see how
people<00:04:34.409> like<00:04:34.560> that<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:34.889> a<00:04:34.919> direct<00:04:35.189> back<00:04:35.370> to

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
people like that and a direct back to

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.279 
people like that and a direct back to
comparison<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.419> don't<00:04:36.780> know<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.990> check<00:04:37.139> she

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
comparison I don't know the check she

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.559 
comparison I don't know the check she
could<00:04:37.469> maybe<00:04:37.680> there's<00:04:37.949> something<00:04:38.219> to<00:04:38.669> the

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
could maybe there's something to the

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.809 
could maybe there's something to the
flavor<00:04:39.900> that<00:04:40.139> is<00:04:40.289> it<00:04:40.530> inherently<00:04:41.039> produces

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
flavor that is it inherently produces

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.179 
flavor that is it inherently produces
that<00:04:41.969> film<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.360> don't<00:04:42.719> know<00:04:42.810> but<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:43.949> think<00:04:44.129> that

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
that film I don't know but I think that

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:45.649 
that film I don't know but I think that
would<00:04:44.550> be<00:04:44.669> interesting<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.180> would<00:04:45.330> say<00:04:45.479> the

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
would be interesting I would say the

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.839 
would be interesting I would say the
grease<00:04:45.900> with<00:04:46.259> the<00:04:46.409> powder<00:04:46.620> yeah<00:04:47.129> moving<00:04:47.729> off

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
grease with the powder yeah moving off

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.369 
grease with the powder yeah moving off
its<00:04:48.120> cross<00:04:48.719> but<00:04:49.169> yet<00:04:49.439> so<00:04:50.419> desirable<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:52.020> some

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
its cross but yet so desirable to some

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.290 
its cross but yet so desirable to some
people<00:04:52.889> is<00:04:53.129> there<00:04:53.310> anything<00:04:53.490> that<00:04:53.669> you<00:04:54.090> feel

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
people is there anything that you feel

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.969 
people is there anything that you feel
that<00:04:54.509> way<00:04:54.569> about<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:54.960> subversive<00:04:55.469> gross

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
that way about a subversive gross
