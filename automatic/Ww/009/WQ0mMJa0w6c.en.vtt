this way for the most part but it's an

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.250 
this way for the most part but it's an
important<00:00:24.210> part<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.480> InDesign<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.019> know<00:00:25.140> about

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
important part of InDesign to know about

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.390 
important part of InDesign to know about
it's<00:00:25.920> called

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
it's called

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.640 
it's called
placing<00:00:27.060> essentially<00:00:27.869> you're<00:00:28.050> placing<00:00:28.560> a

placing essentially you're placing a
file<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:30.060> document<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.109> go<00:00:31.230> file

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
file in this document so we go file

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.689 
you how big it will be and the neat
thing<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.010> keeps<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
thing here is that it keeps the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.700 
thing here is that it keeps the
proportions<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.809> photo<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.260> same<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
proportions of that photo the same it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.350 
proportions of that photo the same it
doesn't<00:01:04.890> stretch<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.519> or<00:01:05.670> squeeze<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.210> or

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
doesn't stretch it or squeeze it or

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.420 
doesn't stretch it or squeeze it or
anything<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.100> release

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
anything like that so I can just release

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.899 
anything like that so I can just release
and<00:01:08.790> now<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.229> photo<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.400> like

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
and now I have that photo there so like

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.850 
and now I have that photo there so like
I<00:01:12.060> said<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:12.960> actually<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.470> easiest

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
I said that's not actually the easiest

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.130 
I said that's not actually the easiest
way<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.970> works<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.509> want<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> do<00:01:15.990> that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
way but it works if you want to do that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.679 
way but it works if you want to do that
but<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.790> cool<00:01:18.000> way<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.420> have

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
but this is the really cool way I have

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
really excited about this part of

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.800 
really excited about this part of
InDesign<00:05:19.100> we're<00:05:19.669> gonna<00:05:19.790> learn<00:05:20.000> all<00:05:20.300> sorts<00:05:20.720> of

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
InDesign we're gonna learn all sorts of

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.170 
InDesign we're gonna learn all sorts of
other<00:05:20.960> stuff<00:05:21.050> but<00:05:21.590> here<00:05:21.979> it<00:05:22.160> is<00:05:22.190> here's<00:05:23.000> the

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
other stuff but here it is here's the

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.600 
other stuff but here it is here's the
power<00:05:23.450> of<00:05:23.600> InDesign<00:05:24.020> here's<00:05:24.680> how<00:05:24.919> it<00:05:25.280> makes

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
power of InDesign here's how it makes

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.670 
power of InDesign here's how it makes
you<00:05:25.760> not<00:05:25.940> only<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:26.389> faster<00:05:27.080> designer<00:05:27.440> because

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
you not only a faster designer because

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.890 
you not only a faster designer because
it<00:05:28.070> is<00:05:28.280> crazy<00:05:28.669> fast<00:05:29.000> to<00:05:29.240> put<00:05:29.389> photos<00:05:29.600> on<00:05:29.780> the

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
it is crazy fast to put photos on the

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.469 
it is crazy fast to put photos on the
page<00:05:30.110> but<00:05:30.890> a<00:05:31.070> better<00:05:31.490> designer<00:05:32.030> because<00:05:32.270> you

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
page but a better designer because you

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.870 
page but a better designer because you
can<00:05:32.660> experiment<00:05:33.260> you<00:05:33.950> can<00:05:34.160> change<00:05:34.490> your<00:05:34.729> mind

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
can experiment you can change your mind

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.570 
can experiment you can change your mind
you<00:05:35.540> can<00:05:35.570> try<00:05:36.050> out<00:05:36.290> four<00:05:36.650> different<00:05:36.830> photos<00:05:37.400> in

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
you can try out four different photos in

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.540 
you can try out four different photos in
a<00:05:37.760> flash<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.630> that<00:05:39.410> way<00:05:39.590> you'll<00:05:39.919> get<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.130> best

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
a flash and that way you'll get the best

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.659 
a flash and that way you'll get the best
one<00:05:40.790> in<00:05:41.030> no<00:05:41.419> time<00:05:41.720> at<00:05:41.870> all<00:05:41.960> so<00:05:42.280> let's<00:05:43.280> move<00:05:43.460> on

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
one in no time at all so let's move on

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.610 
one in no time at all so let's move on
let's<00:05:44.360> learn<00:05:44.570> about<00:05:44.720> frames<00:05:45.110> in<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.410> next

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
let's learn about frames in the next

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.860 
let's learn about frames in the next
video<00:05:45.860> and<00:05:46.660> yeah<00:05:47.660> this<00:05:47.990> stuff<00:05:48.200> is<00:05:48.320> really<00:05:48.560> cool
