00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
ten years and I worked with a lot of

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.260 
ten years and I worked with a lot of
children<00:00:33.050> where<00:00:33.530> there<00:00:33.710> are<00:00:33.770> issues<00:00:34.040> about

go into care what might help the

go into care what might help the
families<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:39.440> help<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.949> children<00:00:40.150> and<00:00:41.150> my

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
families to help the children and my

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.970 
families to help the children and my
research<00:00:42.050> interest<00:00:42.379> really<00:00:42.620> have<00:00:42.710> all<00:00:42.770> grown

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
research interest really have all grown

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.170 
research interest really have all grown
from<00:00:43.250> that<00:00:43.750> I'm<00:00:44.750> a<00:00:45.620> lot<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.250> them<00:00:46.400> were<00:00:46.850> around

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
from that I'm a lot of them were around

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.390 
from that I'm a lot of them were around
pair<00:00:47.540> to<00:00:47.750> misuse<00:00:47.900> drugs<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:48.500> alcohol<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.220> how

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
pair to misuse drugs and alcohol and how

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.490 
pair to misuse drugs and alcohol and how
we<00:00:49.460> can<00:00:49.699> work<00:00:49.850> with<00:00:49.910> those<00:00:50.150> issues<00:00:50.330> and<00:00:51.199> help

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
we can work with those issues and help

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.470 
we can work with those issues and help
the<00:00:51.710> children<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.519> hopefully<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.059> parents

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
the children and hopefully the parents

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.229 
the children and hopefully the parents
as<00:00:53.600> well<00:00:54.070> but<00:00:55.070> I<00:00:55.100> think<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:55.399> last<00:00:55.610> five<00:00:55.940> or<00:00:55.969> six

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
as well but I think the last five or six

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.670 
as well but I think the last five or six
years<00:00:56.390> I've<00:00:56.840> moved<00:00:57.079> to<00:00:57.230> a<00:00:57.260> more<00:00:57.440> general

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
years I've moved to a more general

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.700 
years I've moved to a more general
interest<00:00:58.280> around<00:00:58.840> what<00:00:59.840> works<00:01:00.020> in<00:01:00.500> social

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
interest around what works in social

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.410 
interest around what works in social
work<00:01:01.040> particularly<00:01:01.760> with<00:01:01.969> children<00:01:02.329> and

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
work particularly with children and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.840 
work particularly with children and
families<00:01:03.040> what<00:01:04.040> interventions<00:01:04.399> make<00:01:04.820> a

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
families what interventions make a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.670 
families what interventions make a
difference<00:01:05.300> for<00:01:05.869> families<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:07.280> how<00:01:07.940> you<00:01:08.000> can

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
difference for families and how you can

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.139 
difference for families and how you can
help<00:01:09.680> social<00:01:10.130> workers<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.430> become<00:01:10.729> better<00:01:10.940> at

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
help social workers to become better at

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.210 
help social workers to become better at
what<00:01:11.180> they<00:01:11.390> do<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.050> I'm<00:01:12.200> doing<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.770> lot<00:01:13.100> of

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
what they do so I'm doing a lot of

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.310 
what they do so I'm doing a lot of
research<00:01:13.580> around<00:01:14.320> evidence-based

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
research around evidence-based

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.109 
research around evidence-based
interventions<00:01:16.009> how<00:01:16.399> you<00:01:16.460> can<00:01:16.670> get<00:01:16.789> social

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
interventions how you can get social

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.490 
interventions how you can get social
workers<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.450> use<00:01:17.600> them<00:01:17.840> what<00:01:17.990> difference<00:01:18.320> they

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
workers to use them what difference they

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.620 
workers to use them what difference they
make<00:01:18.710> for<00:01:19.130> children<00:01:19.789> and<00:01:20.259> parents

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.080 

I'm<00:01:26.020> doing<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.740> few<00:01:26.979> different<00:01:27.610> projects<00:01:27.969> in

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
I'm doing a few different projects in

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.969 
I'm doing a few different projects in
fact<00:01:28.299> there<00:01:28.390> were<00:01:28.450> ten<00:01:28.750> recently<00:01:29.530> counted<00:01:29.890> but

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
fact there were ten recently counted but

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.770 
fact there were ten recently counted but
there's<00:01:30.159> a<00:01:30.219> big<00:01:30.399> one<00:01:30.640> which<00:01:31.299> I'll<00:01:31.479> talk<00:01:31.659> about

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
there's a big one which I'll talk about

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.050 
there's a big one which I'll talk about
the<00:01:32.140> most<00:01:32.350> we're<00:01:33.009> doing<00:01:33.310> a<00:01:33.490> randomized

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
the most we're doing a randomized

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.410 
the most we're doing a randomized
control<00:01:34.450> trial<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.610> what<00:01:36.820> we're<00:01:36.970> looking<00:01:37.060> at

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
control trial and what we're looking at

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.389 
control trial and what we're looking at
is<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.990> randomized<00:01:38.439> control<00:01:38.770> trial<00:01:39.039> is<00:01:39.220> where

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
is a randomized control trial is where

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.380 
is a randomized control trial is where
if<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:39.610> really<00:01:39.820> want<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.030> find<00:01:40.179> out<00:01:40.299> when

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
if you really want to find out when

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.999 
if you really want to find out when
something<00:01:40.689> works<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:41.140> randomized<00:01:41.799> some

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
something works you randomized some

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.440 
something works you randomized some
people<00:01:42.280> get<00:01:42.429> it<00:01:42.549> some<00:01:42.759> people<00:01:42.789> don't

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
people get it some people don't

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.749 
people get it some people don't
so<00:01:44.380> what<00:01:44.829> we've<00:01:45.009> done<00:01:45.100> is<00:01:45.250> we've<00:01:45.369> trained<00:01:45.610> half

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
so what we've done is we've trained half

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.520 
so what we've done is we've trained half
the<00:01:45.939> social<00:01:46.299> workers<00:01:46.659> in<00:01:46.929> one<00:01:47.170> local

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
the social workers in one local

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.919 
the social workers in one local
authority<00:01:47.920> in<00:01:48.009> England<00:01:48.340> had<00:01:48.579> to<00:01:48.789> use<00:01:49.600> a

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
authority in England had to use a

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.480 
authority in England had to use a
counseling<00:01:50.500> style<00:01:50.770> called<00:01:50.979> motivational

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
counseling style called motivational

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.490 
counseling style called motivational
interviewing<00:01:52.049> half<00:01:53.049> of<00:01:53.170> them<00:01:53.259> haven't<00:01:53.439> been

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
interviewing half of them haven't been

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.840 
interviewing half of them haven't been
trained<00:01:53.829> yet

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
trained yet

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.270 
trained yet
then<00:01:55.450> we<00:01:55.569> families<00:01:56.380> were<00:01:56.530> allocated<00:01:57.189> to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
then we families were allocated to

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.529 
then we families were allocated to
either<00:01:57.520> get<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.700> social<00:01:58.090> worker<00:01:58.299> who'd<00:01:58.450> be

either get a social worker who'd be

trained in MI or happen and one who
happened<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.659> we're<00:02:01.810> seeing<00:02:02.080> whether<00:02:02.319> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
happened and we're seeing whether the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.370 
happened and we're seeing whether the
training<00:02:02.679> made<00:02:03.009> a<00:02:03.039> difference<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:05.049> believe

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
training made a difference we believe

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.260 
training made a difference we believe
it's<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.679> first<00:02:05.920> randomized<00:02:06.580> control<00:02:06.970> trial

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
it's the first randomized control trial

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.630 
it's the first randomized control trial
looking<00:02:07.689> at<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.310> frontline<00:02:09.310> child

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
looking at the frontline child

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.250 
looking at the frontline child
protection<00:02:09.910> practice<00:02:10.509> certainly<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.049> UK

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
protection practice certainly in the UK

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.030 
protection practice certainly in the UK
we<00:02:11.519> think<00:02:12.519> it<00:02:12.610> may<00:02:12.700> be<00:02:12.730> internationally<00:02:14.040> and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
we think it may be internationally and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.229 
we think it may be internationally and
it's<00:02:15.250> really<00:02:15.430> fascinating<00:02:15.640> because<00:02:16.060> it

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
it's really fascinating because it

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.520 
it's really fascinating because it
brings<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.599> really<00:02:17.019> really<00:02:17.170> close<00:02:17.500> to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
brings you really really close to

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.759 
brings you really really close to
practice<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.870> was<00:02:20.110> involved<00:02:20.319> in<00:02:20.500> training

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
practice and I was involved in training

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.470 
practice and I was involved in training
all<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.099> social<00:02:21.430> workers<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:21.940> providing

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
all the social workers and providing

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.759 
all the social workers and providing
supervision<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.079> that<00:02:23.200> was<00:02:23.319> really<00:02:23.470> really

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
supervision and that was really really

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.699 
supervision and that was really really
interesting<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:25.750> quite<00:02:26.200> apart<00:02:26.440> from<00:02:26.530> the

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
interesting but quite apart from the

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.589 
interesting but quite apart from the
randomized<00:02:27.130> control<00:02:27.610> trial<00:02:27.880> bit<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.360> the

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
randomized control trial bit of it the

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.240 
randomized control trial bit of it the
another<00:02:29.110> bit<00:02:29.349> that's<00:02:29.530> really<00:02:29.739> interesting<00:02:29.859> is

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
another bit that's really interesting is

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.699 
another bit that's really interesting is
we've<00:02:30.430> got<00:02:30.730> what<00:02:31.480> we'll<00:02:31.660> have<00:02:31.810> about<00:02:31.989> 150

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
we've got what we'll have about 150

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.949 
we've got what we'll have about 150
tapes<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.190> actual<00:02:33.519> practice<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.209> we're<00:02:34.840> going

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
tapes of actual practice and we're going

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.150 
tapes of actual practice and we're going
to<00:02:34.989> be<00:02:35.109> able<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.350> relate<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.769> skills<00:02:36.069> that

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
to be able to relate the skills that

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.780 
to be able to relate the skills that
social<00:02:36.519> workers<00:02:36.760> used<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.180> outcomes<00:02:37.690> for

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
social workers used to outcomes for

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.270 
social workers used to outcomes for
families<00:02:39.790> parents<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.540> children<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:42.040> see

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
families parents and children to see

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.559 
families parents and children to see
what<00:02:42.489> works<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:43.060> see<00:02:43.180> what<00:02:43.299> makes<00:02:43.480> a

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
what works to see what makes a

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.590 
what works to see what makes a
difference<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.859> I<00:02:44.920> think<00:02:45.280> that's<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.389> first

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
difference and I think that's the first

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.000 
difference and I think that's the first
time<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.810> has<00:02:47.049> been<00:02:47.230> done<00:02:47.410> on<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.650> scale

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
time that has been done on this scale

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.470 
time that has been done on this scale
and<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.730> provides<00:02:49.030> us<00:02:49.120> with<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.359> real

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
and it provides us with a real

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.210 
and it provides us with a real
opportunity<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:50.230> identify<00:02:50.350> what<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.040> key

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
opportunity to identify what the key

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.729 
opportunity to identify what the key
elements<00:02:51.609> are<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:52.269> good<00:02:52.450> social<00:02:52.810> practice<00:02:53.319> and

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
elements are of good social practice and

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:54.870 
elements are of good social practice and
the<00:02:53.829> implications<00:02:54.280> are<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.459> huge

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
the implications are that a huge

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.699 
the implications are that a huge
obviously<00:02:55.420> there's<00:02:55.989> big<00:02:56.139> implications<00:02:56.650> for

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
obviously there's big implications for

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.289 
obviously there's big implications for
how<00:02:56.829> we<00:02:56.859> train<00:02:57.160> people<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.579> become<00:02:57.760> good

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
how we train people to become good

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.729 
how we train people to become good
social<00:02:58.720> workers<00:02:59.019> but<00:02:59.200> they're<00:02:59.590> also

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
social workers but they're also

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.949 
social workers but they're also
implications<00:03:00.430> for<00:03:00.609> how<00:03:00.760> we<00:03:00.790> recruit<00:03:01.389> social

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
implications for how we recruit social

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.360 
implications for how we recruit social
workers<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.380> Social<00:03:02.650> Work<00:03:02.739> students<00:03:03.220> who

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
workers and Social Work students who

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.680 
workers and Social Work students who
would<00:03:03.519> make<00:03:03.639> a<00:03:03.670> good<00:03:03.910> social<00:03:04.120> worker<00:03:04.299> what

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
would make a good social worker what

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.840 
would make a good social worker what
sort<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:04.959> skills<00:03:05.200> do<00:03:05.380> they<00:03:05.410> need<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:06.519> for<00:03:06.700> me

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
sort of skills do they need so for me

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.630 
sort of skills do they need so for me
it's<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.840> really<00:03:08.079> really

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
it's a really really

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.520 
it's a really really
searching<00:03:08.940> study<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:09.840> unfortunately<00:03:10.410> we've

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
searching study and unfortunately we've

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.040 
searching study and unfortunately we've

some other backgrounds it's a really

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.300 
some other backgrounds it's a really
good<00:03:23.910> project<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.360> be<00:03:24.480> important

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.300 

we're<00:03:29.850> now<00:03:30.030> research<00:03:30.420> then<00:03:30.660> for<00:03:30.920> most<00:03:31.920> people

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
we're now research then for most people

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.520 
we're now research then for most people
would<00:03:32.430> say<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.910> our<00:03:33.170> secret<00:03:34.170> goddess<00:03:34.440> to

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
would say that our secret goddess to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.190 
would say that our secret goddess to
change<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.890> face<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.069> social<00:03:35.730> work<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:37.080> we

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
change the face of social work and we

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.570 
change the face of social work and we
said<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.500> laughingly<00:03:37.860> but<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.190> kind<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.459> is

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
said that laughingly but that kind of is

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.180 
said that laughingly but that kind of is
the<00:03:38.700> goal<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.090> mean<00:03:39.270> obviously<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:41.010> make<00:03:41.160> a

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
the goal I mean obviously you make a

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.440 
the goal I mean obviously you make a
contribution<00:03:41.520> you<00:03:41.970> have<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.180> work<00:03:42.330> with

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
contribution you have to work with

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.520 
contribution you have to work with
others<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.930> idea<00:03:43.170> is<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.350> make<00:03:43.470> a

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
others but the idea is to make a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.590 
others but the idea is to make a
difference<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:44.610> name<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.030> full<00:03:45.180> name<00:03:45.390> of<00:03:45.510> my

think<00:04:49.950> Bedford<00:04:50.460> sure<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:51.210> reason<00:04:51.390> Bedford

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
think Bedford sure the reason Bedford

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.780 
think Bedford sure the reason Bedford
sure<00:04:51.990> is<00:04:52.080> going<00:04:52.320> places<00:04:52.560> in<00:04:52.830> social<00:04:53.190> work<00:04:53.280> is

sure is going places in social work is

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.640 
sure is going places in social work is
because<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.180> top-level<00:04:54.570> commitment<00:04:55.140> to

because of top-level commitment to
supporting<00:04:56.010> social<00:04:56.280> work<00:04:56.580> is<00:04:57.150> part<00:04:57.480> of<00:04:57.570> the

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
supporting social work is part of the

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.090 
supporting social work is part of the
university's<00:04:58.170> broader<00:04:58.410> mission<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.950> make<00:04:59.070> a

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.640 
university's broader mission to make a
difference<00:04:59.520> in<00:04:59.910> society<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:01.110> I<00:05:01.410> think<00:05:01.440> they

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
difference in society and I think they

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.980 
difference in society and I think they
recognized<00:05:02.130> that<00:05:02.660> social<00:05:03.660> work<00:05:03.750> is<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:03.840> real

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
recognized that social work is a real

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.260 
recognized that social work is a real
strength<00:05:04.290> in<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.590> university<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:06.030> so<00:05:06.180> they

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
strength in the university and so they

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.230 
strength in the university and so they
actively<00:05:06.690> support<00:05:07.050> it
