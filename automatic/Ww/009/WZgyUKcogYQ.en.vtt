00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.040
 frank from android next on the us prime 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.690
 time event in munich in my hands 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.619
 i hold the asus transformer ptf 3 0 3 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.449
 Unfortunately, we can not cl and the device 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.089
 Do it because that's the only thing 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.589
 that is here on the event of it and 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.699
 the battery is unfortunately all that means me 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.210
 was high and it will be right back 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.679
 down 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.300
 Anyway we can 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.370
 Nevertheless small impression of the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.440
 hardware convey that is that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.820
 I'll say something of a higher quality 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.710
 processed model of the newly introduced 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.020
 featured asus transformer tablets 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.050
 You see that they are back in the hour though 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.180
 plastic surface but the right one 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.340
 handy softtouch thing actually looks 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.950
 Pretty good comes in blue and after 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.320
 of a different color we carry in 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.550
 which colors are available 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.739
 So the device is relatively thick 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.600
 you can see that here already I have now 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.720
 Unfortunately, no comparison device as the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.310
 that is also a device now 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.530
 I would say middle class 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.850
 we watch us everything again individually to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.130
 up here is the power button 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.950
 on the left side of landscape mode 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.659
 looked here the micro usb connection 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.530
 up here 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.819
 sorry i 've missed that 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.499
 here is the micro usb 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.880
 connection to the probably mini 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:35.549
 hdmi out or something 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.549
 this is the volume rocker 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.210
 the right side of the slot for 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.869
 micro sd cards here is the output for 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.310
 speakers on the bottom 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.700
 Of course we are such a proprietary one here 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.560
 connection for the docking station because 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.179
 that as you know is that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.689
 unique feature of the transformer 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.230
 series 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.690
 there is always one 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.470
 it always gives separately or in change 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.710
 buy a docking station with one 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.000
 integrated keyboard and trackpad and 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.770
 this is usually good 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.360
 Here are the keys really years 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.590
 a very pleasant pressure point must 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.900
 So I say that is a very very 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.480
 nice keyboard on the leaves 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.740
 guaranteed to type well 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.170
 Of course, the question must be allowed 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.150
 how good is android suitable as 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.530
 a productive operating system so how 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.300
 well, you can really type it like that 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.210
 Good that the liquid runs in the 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.830
 browser from the specifications 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.850
 that work there is an intel atom 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:39.050
 oak trail processor qualcomm with 1 3 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.180
 gigahertz in it and I think so in 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.440
 some apps and applications that is 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.420
 certainly practical perhaps 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.850
 not such a productivity productive 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.010
 device like windows 8 laptop but as such 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.860
 useful gimmick gimmick at the key 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.900
 the keyboard is certainly to be considered 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.970
 in contrast to previous models that 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.280
 be mentioned at this point is in 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.700
 This keyboard is no longer a separate battery 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.430
 in it 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.110
 that means that the energy is fed 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.630
 completely off the tablet and it will too 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.500
 not automatically reloaded so much 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.150
 from asus transformer ptf 303 the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.709
 by the way, in two variants besides three 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.350
 Variants actually out to the market 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.050
 comes namely with intel cpu 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.620
 intel-cpu and lte and with a qualcomm 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.450
 snapdragon cpu that's the tlf 303 though 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.300
 you liked the video then unfortunately 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.739
 but please and subscribe to our channel 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.610
