 Above all, it is here 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.450
 important the natural plant of the dog 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.300
 to recognize and we start already with 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.979
 ten eleven twelve days when the dogs 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.450

 to write down dogs learn best 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.649
 when they are very young 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.600
 the early contact with people is 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.550
 important and promotes the construction of a 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.320
 lasting relationship that is social 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.239
 every process is for development 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.489
 not only of services but of 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.090
 worlds in general the most important 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.050
 at all

 they must be allowed to take military service 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.380
 prove that they are willing to learn 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.030
 and the pressure of education has grown 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.650
 are

 for him too are the natural ones 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.670
 Attachments of a dog the key to 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:58.950
 Success, yes, I think so 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:01.920
 that a certain institute drove 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.630
 to look for something and be present 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.910
 got to 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.510
 that is then conditioned conditioned 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.510
 above all 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.890
 That's how you will become now 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.350
 otto kopitzsch undergoes the 14th today 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:29.280
 weeks old lenz a first 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.280
 Fitness test set the ground 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.920
 and once what he is watching 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.920
 from now on 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.040
 The commander simply stops him 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.069
 would like to see if the puppy protects him 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.469
 investigated or go to discovery tour the 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.450
 shows him whether he is self-confident and 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:55.709
 courage or rather shy and 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.450
 anxious place is not afraid 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.329
 He grabs the toy immediately 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.340
 from koppetsch pants courage and own 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.650
 drive are important qualities for 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.019
 a service and in their later life 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.849
 if you are looking for or awake and working 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.400
 they are expected by them 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.319
 act independently and react 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.560
 next , kopitzsch tests like 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.139
 curious lance's marcel judge 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.479
 and in the movement behaves as I said 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.560
 we are also happy that he likes new ones here 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.840
 explored and as many as possible 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.699
 early experience causes the dog 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.690
 learns faster and better later 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.389
 can adapt 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.160
 therefore lance curiosity is a good one 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.669
 sign he is not afraid 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.560
 unknown situation 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.240
 There are two types of dogs which 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.979
 extremely responsive and 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.849
 Enthusiastic and barely too quiet 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.099
 are getting 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.260
 but they take forever the cognitive 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.930
 to set tasks that you give them 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.840
 and then there are the attentive ones very much 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.599
 quiet extremely clever they look 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.710
 on what they happen and get it 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.710
 solve the problem quickly 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.979
 next , otto koppetsch is testing how 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.349
 pronounced the natural hunter of 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.349
 lance is on the right track 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.340
 This can be an essential one 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:16.310
 requirement for the service dogs 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:22.520
 education is also related today 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:25.099
 he wants to be at the task of military or 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.289
 To train working dogs is above all 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:31.280
 the beutetrieb decisively the 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:35.229
 beutetrieb is basically the medium around 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.639
 to wrest the attention of the dog 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.620
 it is mandatory for the training 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.419
 required that the dogs between good 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.159
 and can distinguish evil 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.759
 this is done by going through 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:48.560
 Rewards are conditioned by the 14th 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:51.319
 weeks old belgian shepherd dog amy 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.479
 first learned her dog handler 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.860
 to obey and then a reward too 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.600
 to get 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.270
 many dogs in the military center become too 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.010
 seeking educated since there Belgian 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.470
 shepherd and lighter and more agile than 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.889
 Rottweiler are often helping you as such 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.770
 or rescue dogs at international 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:14.760
 disaster amy today is the 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.720
 make a first step in this direction 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.850
 we are here in one 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.860
 Exercise area for our rescue dogs 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.160
 We can be here with the young dogs 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.510
 but the beginning pleasant materials 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.010
 train to the finished 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:32.110
 Search work by hidden persons 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:34.750
 it's the first time that amy in this 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.520
 the environment trains the instructors 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.510
 watch closely as they do with the 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.340
 unfamiliar conditions 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.350
 your dog handler of that too 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.930
 Efficient is like the three years 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:50.490
 old baby she is one of the best 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.490
 Search dogs of the military 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.490
 only after 14 months begins for the 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:21.680
 dogs training for their actual 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.680
 task as protection or search and 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.700
 the dogs are private 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:31.320
 Dog handlers assigned and make up with him 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.320
 a team for life 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.130
 the relationship between dog and 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.810
 Dog handler is here with us 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.640
 military, of course, a very intense 

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.860
 and it's a lifetime too 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.780
 relationship the dog handlers with theirs 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.040
 dogs have to commit themselves too 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.050
 relatively gladly then also for 

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.120
 foreign assignments where the relationship 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.700
 Of course, even more intense because the 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.310
 a human and dog of the 24 hours on 

00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:00.390
 day lives with common orders 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:02.850
 but until the time has come 

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:06.470
 puppy willing and amy still a few 

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.470
 exhausting years in front of him 

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.840
 always
