00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
characters were much more interesting I

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.050 
characters were much more interesting I
enjoyed<00:01:43.439> learning<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:44.159> lot<00:01:44.369> more<00:01:44.579> about<00:01:44.670> keyed

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.789 
enjoyed learning a lot more about keyed
in<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:46.049> although<00:01:46.350> he<00:01:46.590> wasn't

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
in this one because although he wasn't

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.069 
in this one because although he wasn't
losing<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.310> he<00:01:47.490> wasn't<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.970> min<00:01:48.210> character<00:01:48.720> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
losing it he wasn't a min character and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.649 
losing it he wasn't a min character and
