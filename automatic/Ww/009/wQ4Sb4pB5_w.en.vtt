00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 Welcome to the block 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.810
 rebels in our little ones 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.750
 open-air-party central last time 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.940
 we already have the combination of z1 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.200
 and ipad and my battery operated 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.130
 we have presented ourselves 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.070
 thought we show a bit 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.560
 bigger setup that we just here 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.869
 test to see if it's my s4 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.760
 for example or even shorter 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.220
 controller sets can replace 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.220
 the heart of the whole, it remains the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.040
 small z1 mixer and the brand new one 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.200
 tractor control x1 mks at the start 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.920
 headphones has active boxes here at the back 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.050
 two lead batteries of one type directly the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.860
 12 volt connection of a small break 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.410
 fight 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.320
 The Z1 does not need power when it is 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.520
 hangs on a computer via usb and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.320
 then I have here but quite 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.890
 send car adapter for a arm 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.420
 cigarette lighter 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.149
 I simply cut it off and 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.949
 the cables led out and to the at the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.899
 battery attached and with it we have 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.119
 now here about the inverter there 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.850
 in it is 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.750
 the corresponding stream around the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.590
 Calculator charging tractor 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.450
 you probably do not see anything because of the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.040
 That's why the sun looks so beautiful 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:24.780
 trick control old command and eight does 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.939
 nothing ok and that is under 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.850
 system settings for operating aids 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.310
 The function invert colors was in 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.360
 the old operating system versions always 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.850
 active now you have to first 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.640
 turn on and then you can with apple 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.110
 old control and eight the screen 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.020
 invest when we go back to the program 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.640
 the tractor is bright and you can 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.290
 good trick if you are in the sun 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.710
 hang up because then you see something 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.939
 More so yes the mixer is I think 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.369
 besides, I do not have much anymore 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.310
 say that's just a nice one 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.290
 less two canonical so that kenny 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.880
 chesney medicon control the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.890
 mixer then replaced with a beautiful one 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.530
 powerfully sounding madoff instrument 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 Sound card in it and what really 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.619
 a nice treat is the new x1 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.260
 basically similar to the old one 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.880
 2 channel control for people who do not 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.450
 necessarily supplicants and wheels 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.210
 need 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.090
 but it's really great here 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.710
 is the new touch back and with that 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.750
 you can do a lot and I'll show you 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:37.740
 that's just what I'm doing now 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:39.690
 make you something to play pause and play 4 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.150
 dots four more are heading 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.680
 achievable then the effect china has 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.750
 not changed as far as I am 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.470
 know the same as earlier in the x1 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.470
 I have money on it, for example 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.209
 These are the old features 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:13.120
 she probably is in all know 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.950
 new things are like loops are the same 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.379
 beautifully regulated how often the s4 with 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.379
 scroll wheels with here the ads of 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.060
 just like the s 4 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.709
 What is particularly nice here the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.019
 wheel that has a new function and 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.590
 While capacitively I just have 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:44.290
 touch nothing press and the thing goes 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.379
 automatically in browser mode all the way 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.769
 nice thing so and then we come 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.840
 now to the top of the piece that 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.849
 most beautiful is on the new device and me 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.549
 personally enabled on 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.959
 to waive a controller with jobs 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:06.599
 because it is finally possible the phases 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:06.599
 nice to match and that is 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.659
 not so good right now i can 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.659
 to adjust the phases 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.669
 Now it sounds clean 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:50.520
 so came this beautiful little touch script 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.090
 So you can either adjust the phases 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:57.450
 or if the device is on 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.660
 breaks is then you can here you 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.280
 track search and you can shift completely 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.750
 quickly search through the whole track 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:11.190
 I'm involved with the game 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:13.620
 come that's why the end is good and one 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.210
 very nice feature is that 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.520
 one also has effects and loops about that 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.840
 play can control 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.120
 that is together with the new flux 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.520
 mode is here switched swiftly 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.500
 mode it means a new offer 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.260
 that while you put in loop or a 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.120
 effect the beat mescher that im 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.380
 background of the tune continues to run 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.090
 ie if you back off to the 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.620
 the place would have been if you just 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.180
 no effect would have used what 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.340
 pretty nice thing for short loops 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.880
 so I'll try it 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:45.300
 first you have to hereby in the 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.960
 Press the middle of the touch strip and then 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.680
 activate the loop once 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.680
 and then arrived 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.490
 that works well with others 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:10.449
 very nice effects, such as the 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.449
 beat merscher 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.850
 These are essentially the functions 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.430
 the new x1 and for me that's enough 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.900
 together with the little mix here 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.580
 really nice compact setup at the start 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.610
 to have fits finally all a 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.840
 small plates bag and because you like that 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.190
 a nice battery powered 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.720
 We had a history at the start 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.130
 Of course, just in the meadow 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.760
 Doing music and I do that now 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.760
 also just times
