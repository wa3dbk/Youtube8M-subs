then<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.549> inserted<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.180> top<00:01:27.420> half<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.200> simple

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
then I inserted the top half of a simple

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.830 
then I inserted the top half of a simple
stand<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.729> time<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> simple<00:01:30.420> stand<00:01:30.720> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
stand and on time a simple stand that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.340 
stand and on time a simple stand that
I've<00:01:30.900> got<00:01:31.430> with<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> boom<00:01:32.790> arm<00:01:33.170> time<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
I've got with the boom arm time the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.840 
I've got with the boom arm time the
screws<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.100> nice<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.520> secure<00:01:35.820> so

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
screws up so this is nice and secure so

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.679 
screws up so this is nice and secure so
not<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.240> anywhere

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
not going anywhere

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.800 
not going anywhere
and<00:01:37.079> then<00:01:37.500> luckily<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.729> old<00:01:38.909> Thomas<00:01:39.509> stands

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
and then luckily the old Thomas stands

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.780 
and then luckily the old Thomas stands
seem<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> have<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.829> must<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.189> about<00:01:41.340> 10<00:01:41.610> mil

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
seem to have up must be about 10 mil

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.700 
seem to have up must be about 10 mil
thread<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.210> there<00:01:42.390> which<00:01:43.200> marries<00:01:43.590> up

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
thread on there which marries up

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.590 
thread on there which marries up
perfectly<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.430> video<00:01:44.640> camera<00:01:45.060> mount

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
perfectly with the video camera mount

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.499 
perfectly with the video camera mount
so<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.799> bought<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> wingnut<00:01:47.460> fit<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.030> window<00:01:48.210> on

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
so I bought a wingnut fit to window on

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.450 
so I bought a wingnut fit to window on
over<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> other<00:01:49.140> way<00:01:49.229> large<00:01:49.590> washer<00:01:49.799> time

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
over the other way large washer time
