00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.140 
science ii type non-fiction books i was
someone<00:00:12.420> who<00:00:12.840> never<00:00:13.469> was<00:00:13.980> super<00:00:14.730> interested

someone who never was super interested
in<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> sciences<00:00:15.900> when<00:00:16.289> i<00:00:16.320> was<00:00:16.770> growing<00:00:17.039> up<00:00:17.460> it

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
in the sciences when i was growing up it

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.000 
in the sciences when i was growing up it
kind<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.300> was<00:00:18.600> like<00:00:18.990> vaguely<00:00:19.320> interested<00:00:19.920> in

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
kind of was like vaguely interested in

them but i never really paid much

them but i never really paid much
attention<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.710> but<00:00:22.920> when<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> got<00:00:23.939> into

attention to it but when I got into

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.839 
attention to it but when I got into
college<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:25.109> discovered<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.220> wonderful<00:00:26.670> world

Roach will convince you otherwise the
next<00:01:11.250> book<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.549> kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.939> biographical<00:01:12.320> but

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
next book is kind of biographical but

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.870 
next book is kind of biographical but
also<00:01:13.650> science<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.310> that's<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> Immortal

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
also science and that's the Immortal

Life of Henrietta Lacks this follows
Henrietta<00:01:17.939> Lacks<00:01:18.180> who<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.409> woman<00:01:19.770> whose

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
Henrietta Lacks who is this woman whose

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.390 
Henrietta Lacks who is this woman whose
cells<00:01:20.970> were<00:01:21.330> taken<00:01:21.960> by<00:01:22.259> doctors<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
cells were taken by doctors in like the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.870 
cells were taken by doctors in like the
1950s<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.689> 60s<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.530> before<00:01:25.759> you<00:01:26.759> know

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
1950s or 60s it's like before you know

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.660 
1950s or 60s it's like before you know
people<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:27.540> respected<00:01:28.500> all<00:01:28.799> humans<00:01:29.310> lives

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
people really respected all humans lives

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.450 
people really respected all humans lives
as<00:01:29.970> being<00:01:30.210> important<00:01:31.049> she<00:01:31.470> had<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> tumor<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
as being important she had a tumor and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.190 
as being important she had a tumor and
so<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> doctors<00:01:33.299> took<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.750> cells<00:01:33.930> from<00:01:34.020> her

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
so the doctors took the cells from her

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.350 
so the doctors took the cells from her
tumor<00:01:34.500> because<00:01:34.860> they<00:01:35.159> wanted<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.700> use<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.210> for

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
tumor because they wanted to use it for

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.910 
tumor because they wanted to use it for
scientific<00:01:36.600> purposes<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.890> use

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
scientific purposes they like to use

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.429 
scientific purposes they like to use
tumor<00:01:38.549> cells<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.119> they<00:01:39.390> multiply<00:01:40.170> so

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
tumor cells because they multiply so

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.469 
tumor cells because they multiply so
quickly<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.460> do<00:01:41.520> some<00:01:42.240> sort<00:01:42.450> of

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
quickly so if they do some sort of

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.910 
quickly so if they do some sort of
experiment<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.200> those<00:01:43.380> cells<00:01:43.590> they'll<00:01:43.770> see

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
experiment on those cells they'll see

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.499 
experiment on those cells they'll see
the<00:01:44.070> results<00:01:44.430> faster<00:01:44.820> than<00:01:45.000> they<00:01:45.119> would<00:01:45.299> in

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the results faster than they would in

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.780 
the results faster than they would in
normal<00:01:45.930> cells<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> thing<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.310> hundred

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
normal cells but the thing with hundred

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.190 
normal cells but the thing with hundred
elect<00:01:48.119> cells<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.540> they<00:01:48.659> were<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:49.049> like

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
elect cells is they were just like

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200 
elect cells is they were just like
exponentially<00:01:50.130> faster<00:01:50.700> than<00:01:50.880> any<00:01:51.060> other

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
exponentially faster than any other

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.760 
exponentially faster than any other
cells<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.810> had<00:01:51.899> seen<00:01:52.140> before<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.680> they

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
cells that they had seen before and they

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.830 
cells that they had seen before and they
also<00:01:52.950> preserve<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.240> well<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.630> things

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
also preserve really well and things

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.469 
also preserve really well and things
like<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.740> lot<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.159> times<00:01:56.490> when<00:01:56.850> doctors

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
like that so a lot of times when doctors

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.780 
like that so a lot of times when doctors
are<00:01:57.560> currently<00:01:58.560> doing<00:01:58.860> research<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.549> cells

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
are currently doing research on cells

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.130 
are currently doing research on cells
it's<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.299> very<00:02:00.509> good<00:02:00.689> chance<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.990> they're

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
it's a very good chance that they're

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.620 
it's a very good chance that they're
using<00:02:01.320> these<00:02:01.710> cells<00:02:02.040> we<00:02:02.250> nicknamed<00:02:02.579> uh<00:02:02.790> HeLa

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
using these cells we nicknamed uh HeLa

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.690 
using these cells we nicknamed uh HeLa
cells<00:02:03.899> or<00:02:04.140> hello<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.979> don't<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.310> how<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
cells or hello I don't know how to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.479 
cells or hello I don't know how to
pronounce<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.229> if<00:02:07.560> you've<00:02:07.770> ever<00:02:07.979> been

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
pronounce that but if you've ever been

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.219 
pronounce that but if you've ever been
in<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.759> science

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
in a science

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.930 
in a science
and<00:02:09.470> you've<00:02:09.649> used<00:02:09.920> HeLa<00:02:10.190> cells<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.670> probably

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
and you've used HeLa cells you probably

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.640 
and you've used HeLa cells you probably
learned<00:02:11.120> about<00:02:11.270> it<00:02:11.569> they<00:02:12.080> came<00:02:12.319> from<00:02:12.470> this

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
learned about it they came from this

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.470 
learned about it they came from this
woman<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.340> they<00:02:13.459> took<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.760> without<00:02:14.000> her

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
woman and so they took it without her

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.050 
woman and so they took it without her
consent<00:02:14.629> her<00:02:15.230> knowledge<00:02:15.519> no<00:02:16.519> one<00:02:16.760> in<00:02:16.910> her

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
consent her knowledge no one in her

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.059 
consent her knowledge no one in her
family<00:02:17.090> knew<00:02:17.629> about<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.379> it<00:02:18.560> became<00:02:18.800> heard

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
family knew about it and it became heard

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.740 
family knew about it and it became heard
of<00:02:19.250> these<00:02:19.480> multi-billion<00:02:20.480> dollar

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
of these multi-billion dollar

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.610 
of these multi-billion dollar
pharmaceutical<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:22.610> medical<00:02:22.660> industries<00:02:23.660> so

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
pharmaceutical and medical industries so

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.589 
pharmaceutical and medical industries so
yeah<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:24.920> one<00:02:25.099> is<00:02:25.129> pretty<00:02:25.760> split<00:02:26.090> evenly

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
yeah this one is pretty split evenly

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.290 
yeah this one is pretty split evenly
between<00:02:26.870> her<00:02:27.739> life<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.730> her<00:02:28.819> family's<00:02:29.269> life

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
between her life and her family's life

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.780 
between her life and her family's life
so<00:02:29.750> it's<00:02:29.900> part<00:02:30.230> biographical<00:02:31.099> but<00:02:31.519> it<00:02:31.640> also

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
so it's part biographical but it also

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.880 
so it's part biographical but it also
discusses<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.780> cells<00:02:33.050> in<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.410> cell<00:02:33.620> use

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
discusses the cells in the cell use

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.559 
discusses the cells in the cell use
which<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.280> really<00:02:34.519> interesting<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.269> I<00:02:35.420> think

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
which is really interesting and I think

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.210 
which is really interesting and I think
it's<00:02:35.900> also<00:02:36.049> really<00:02:36.200> interesting<00:02:36.980> just<00:02:37.130> from

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
it's also really interesting just from

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.070 
it's also really interesting just from
like<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.580> legal<00:02:38.030> perspective<00:02:38.330> then<00:02:38.750> there<00:02:38.930> is

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
like a legal perspective then there is

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.839 
like a legal perspective then there is
the<00:02:39.379> emperor<00:02:39.799> of<00:02:39.860> all<00:02:40.099> maladies<00:02:40.129> by

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
the emperor of all maladies by

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.350 
the emperor of all maladies by
Siddhartha<00:02:41.769> mukuri<00:02:42.799> Mukherjee<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.910> always

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
Siddhartha mukuri Mukherjee I always

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.820 
Siddhartha mukuri Mukherjee I always
pronounce<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.870> incorrectly<00:02:45.349> on<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.650> first

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
pronounce that incorrectly on the first

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.920 
pronounce that incorrectly on the first
try<00:02:46.130> this<00:02:46.519> is<00:02:46.700> subtitle<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.239> biography<00:02:47.810> of

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
try this is subtitle a biography of

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.949 
try this is subtitle a biography of
cancer<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:48.860> one<00:02:49.010> it's<00:02:49.280> pretty<00:02:49.790> dense<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:50.660> a

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
cancer this one it's pretty dense it's a

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.080 
cancer this one it's pretty dense it's a
long<00:02:51.170> book<00:02:51.500> but<00:02:51.829> it's<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.280> super<00:02:52.880> interesting

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
long book but it's a super interesting

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.080 
long book but it's a super interesting
book<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.959> really<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.890> subtitle<00:02:55.400> sums<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.030> up

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
book it really the subtitle sums it up

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.580 
book it really the subtitle sums it up
perfectly<00:02:56.450> it's<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.750> biography<00:02:57.319> of<00:02:57.410> cancer

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
perfectly it's a biography of cancer

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.710 
perfectly it's a biography of cancer
this<00:02:58.519> was<00:02:58.640> also<00:02:58.880> recently<00:02:59.060> made<00:02:59.390> into<00:02:59.690> a

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
this was also recently made into a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.220 
this was also recently made into a
miniseries<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:01.099> I<00:03:01.130> believe<00:03:01.400> on<00:03:01.730> PBS<00:03:02.690> if<00:03:03.079> you

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
miniseries and I believe on PBS if you

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.900 
miniseries and I believe on PBS if you
live<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.709> United<00:03:04.010> States<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.790> have

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
live in the United States and you have

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.180 
live in the United States and you have
access<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.360> PBS<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.840> feel<00:03:06.349> like<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:06.650> aired

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
access to PBS I feel like it just aired

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.460 
access to PBS I feel like it just aired
like<00:03:07.459> this<00:03:07.910> past<00:03:08.180> week<00:03:08.420> or<00:03:08.630> two<00:03:08.840> but<00:03:09.290> yeah<00:03:09.380> it

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
like this past week or two but yeah it

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.100 
like this past week or two but yeah it
just<00:03:09.530> goes<00:03:09.769> over<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.849> history<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.329> cancer<00:03:11.780> how

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
just goes over the history of cancer how

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.590 
just goes over the history of cancer how
its<00:03:12.290> involved<00:03:12.680> how<00:03:12.980> learning<00:03:13.819> about<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.420> and

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
its involved how learning about it and

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.720 
its involved how learning about it and
also<00:03:15.170> trying<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.560> treat<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.310> deal<00:03:16.489> with<00:03:16.519> it

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
also trying to treat it and deal with it

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.940 
also trying to treat it and deal with it
has<00:03:17.359> changed<00:03:17.930> over<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.319> years<00:03:18.560> it's<00:03:18.859> really

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
has changed over the years it's really

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.970 
has changed over the years it's really
really<00:03:19.549> thorough<00:03:19.850> really<00:03:20.690> engaging<00:03:21.049> I<00:03:21.620> would

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
really thorough really engaging I would

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.860 
really thorough really engaging I would
say<00:03:22.130> don't<00:03:22.370> make<00:03:22.489> this<00:03:22.609> your<00:03:22.670> first<00:03:23.000> jump<00:03:23.420> into

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
say don't make this your first jump into

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.240 
say don't make this your first jump into
the<00:03:23.989> science<00:03:24.350> here<00:03:24.440> um<00:03:24.650> unless<00:03:24.920> you're<00:03:25.100> really

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
the science here um unless you're really

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.680 
the science here um unless you're really
interested<00:03:25.549> in<00:03:25.819> cancer<00:03:25.970> just<00:03:26.209> because<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.569> is

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
interested in cancer just because it is

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.449 
interested in cancer just because it is
so<00:03:26.870> dense<00:03:27.109> this<00:03:27.560> one<00:03:27.739> might<00:03:27.980> take<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:28.430> a

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
so dense this one might take you a

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.069 
so dense this one might take you a
little<00:03:28.579> bit<00:03:28.910> longer<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:29.299> I<00:03:29.510> don't<00:03:29.870> want<00:03:30.019> people

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
little bit longer so I don't want people

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.140 
little bit longer so I don't want people
who<00:03:30.319> don't<00:03:30.590> normally<00:03:30.950> read<00:03:31.130> science<00:03:31.639> books<00:03:31.940> to

jump into this one because you might get

jump into this one because you might get
discouraged<00:03:34.400> by<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.940> size<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.569> density

of it but if you read a couple science
books<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.569> you're<00:03:38.690> kind<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:38.959> in<00:03:39.079> that<00:03:39.319> mindset

books and you're kind of in that mindset
then<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:40.459> definitely<00:03:40.850> think<00:03:41.000> this<00:03:41.090> one<00:03:41.269> is

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
then I definitely think this one is

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.030 
then I definitely think this one is
worth<00:03:41.540> picking<00:03:41.780> up<00:03:41.989> because<00:03:42.139> it's<00:03:42.380> super

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
worth picking up because it's super

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.490 
worth picking up because it's super
interesting<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:43.850> my<00:03:44.000> own<00:03:44.209> personal<00:03:44.930> sub

are<00:03:48.260> books<00:03:48.470> about<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.799> brain<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.459> first

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
are books about the brain so the first

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:50.979 
are books about the brain so the first
one<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.970> read<00:03:50.180> was<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.450> brain<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:50.930> changes

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
one I read was the brain that changes

we can try to prevent things what

patterns<00:04:18.049> things<00:04:18.290> like<00:04:18.440> that<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.980> thing

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
patterns things like that the thing

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.830 
patterns things like that the thing
about<00:04:19.400> brain<00:04:19.700> books<00:04:19.970> is<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.150> lot<00:04:20.360> of<00:04:20.480> times<00:04:20.660> they

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
about brain books is a lot of times they

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.540 
about brain books is a lot of times they
focus<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.230> lot<00:04:21.380> on<00:04:21.410> memories<00:04:21.950> for<00:04:22.220> obvious

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
focus a lot on memories for obvious

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.800 
focus a lot on memories for obvious
reasons<00:04:22.910> because<00:04:23.060> that's<00:04:23.210> such<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.390> huge<00:04:23.630> part

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
reasons because that's such a huge part

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.420 
reasons because that's such a huge part
of<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:23.990> brain<00:04:24.200> but<00:04:24.800> like<00:04:24.950> for<00:04:25.130> me<00:04:25.250> personally

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
of the brain but like for me personally

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.640 
of the brain but like for me personally
I'm<00:04:25.910> not<00:04:26.120> necessarily<00:04:26.720> interested<00:04:26.930> in<00:04:27.350> like

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
I'm not necessarily interested in like

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.710 
I'm not necessarily interested in like
bettering<00:04:28.220> my<00:04:28.400> own<00:04:28.610> memory<00:04:29.060> although<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.600> is

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
bettering my own memory although that is

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.960 
bettering my own memory although that is
something<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.230> do<00:04:30.290> work<00:04:30.770> on<00:04:30.980> when<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.340> read<00:04:31.640> brain

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
something I do work on when I read brain

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.640 
something I do work on when I read brain
books<00:04:32.210> I'm<00:04:32.360> really<00:04:32.630> just<00:04:32.750> interested<00:04:32.960> in<00:04:33.380> how

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
books I'm really just interested in how

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.920 
books I'm really just interested in how
the<00:04:33.710> brain<00:04:34.250> works<00:04:34.280> because<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.510> brain<00:04:35.780> is

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
the brain works because the brain is

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.590 
the brain works because the brain is
such<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.110> complex<00:04:36.680> muscle<00:04:37.280> in<00:04:37.490> our<00:04:37.580> body<00:04:37.730> and<00:04:38.450> it

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
such a complex muscle in our body and it

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.630 
such a complex muscle in our body and it
does<00:04:38.840> so<00:04:39.200> much<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.800> we<00:04:39.890> know<00:04:40.040> so<00:04:40.250> little<00:04:40.280> about

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
does so much and we know so little about

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.000 
does so much and we know so little about
it<00:04:40.970> so<00:04:41.360> I<00:04:41.420> love<00:04:41.630> just<00:04:41.990> reading<00:04:42.350> things<00:04:42.710> about

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
it so I love just reading things about

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.710 
it so I love just reading things about
the<00:04:43.190> brain<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.640> what<00:04:43.790> we<00:04:43.910> do<00:04:44.090> know<00:04:44.300> about<00:04:44.330> it

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
the brain and what we do know about it

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.390 
the brain and what we do know about it
and<00:04:44.900> what<00:04:45.020> people<00:04:45.410> are<00:04:45.650> trying<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:46.070> figure<00:04:46.310> out

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
and what people are trying to figure out

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.340 
and what people are trying to figure out
about<00:04:46.820> it<00:04:47.030> and<00:04:47.150> things<00:04:47.300> like<00:04:47.420> that<00:04:47.480> so<00:04:47.930> this

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.540 
one is super super engaging super
interesting<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.350> I<00:04:51.560> feel<00:04:51.770> like<00:04:51.890> it's<00:04:52.070> made<00:04:52.340> me

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
interesting and I feel like it's made me

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.480 
interesting and I feel like it's made me
understand<00:04:53.150> how<00:04:53.570> my<00:04:54.140> own<00:04:54.350> brain<00:04:54.890> works<00:04:55.310> a

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
understand how my own brain works a

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.310 
understand how my own brain works a
little<00:04:55.670> bit<00:04:55.850> better<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.660> then<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:56.960> next<00:04:57.200> one

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
little bit better and then the next one

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.230 
little bit better and then the next one
that<00:04:57.350> I<00:04:57.500> read<00:04:57.770> was<00:04:58.070> Proust<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.820> squid<00:04:59.060> the

by Mary Ann Woolf this one talks

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.900 
by Mary Ann Woolf this one talks
specifically<00:05:03.320> about<00:05:03.440> how<00:05:04.010> reading<00:05:04.430> affects

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
specifically about how reading affects

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.390 
specifically about how reading affects
our<00:05:05.090> brain<00:05:05.390> not<00:05:05.930> like<00:05:06.290> visually<00:05:07.070> what<00:05:07.220> we're

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
our brain not like visually what we're

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.280 
our brain not like visually what we're
seeing<00:05:07.700> but<00:05:07.910> like<00:05:08.150> what<00:05:08.510> it's<00:05:08.660> physically

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
seeing but like what it's physically

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.740 
seeing but like what it's physically
doing<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:09.830> our<00:05:10.040> brain<00:05:10.310> as<00:05:10.580> well<00:05:11.030> as<00:05:11.270> like<00:05:11.510> how

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
doing to our brain as well as like how

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.170 
doing to our brain as well as like how
that<00:05:12.170> changes<00:05:12.710> how<00:05:12.920> we<00:05:12.980> think<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:13.670> found<00:05:14.090> this

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
that changes how we think I found this

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.660 
that changes how we think I found this
to<00:05:14.300> be<00:05:14.330> fascinating<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.320> I<00:05:15.950> really<00:05:16.340> liked

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
to be fascinating and I really liked

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.300 
to be fascinating and I really liked
what<00:05:17.420> I<00:05:17.450> did<00:05:17.750> pick<00:05:18.020> up<00:05:18.230> in<00:05:18.470> here<00:05:18.740> it's<00:05:19.100> not

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
what I did pick up in here it's not

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.030 
what I did pick up in here it's not
quite<00:05:19.910> as<00:05:20.090> in<00:05:20.360> depth<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:20.990> detail<00:05:21.140> that<00:05:21.620> I<00:05:21.650> was

hoping<00:05:22.400> for<00:05:22.460> but<00:05:22.880> I<00:05:23.090> still<00:05:23.390> found<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:23.930> be

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050
