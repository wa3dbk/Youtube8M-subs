of times trying to really explain it to

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.669 
of times trying to really explain it to
people<00:00:44.519> is<00:00:45.519> really<00:00:45.579> not<00:00:46.059> that<00:00:46.269> easy<00:00:46.569> but<00:00:47.499> what

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
people is really not that easy but what

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.319 
people is really not that easy but what
I'm<00:00:47.769> going<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.039> do<00:00:48.190> rather<00:00:48.489> than<00:00:48.670> give<00:00:48.969> you<00:00:49.120> a

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
I'm going to do rather than give you a

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.500 
I'm going to do rather than give you a
bunch<00:00:49.899> of<00:00:50.139> verbage<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:50.859> a<00:00:50.920> bunch<00:00:51.159> of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
bunch of verbage and a bunch of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.579 
bunch of verbage and a bunch of
instructions<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.989> really<00:00:53.289> don't<00:00:53.440> make

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
instructions that really don't make

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.949 
instructions that really don't make
sense<00:00:53.889> is<00:00:54.549> I'm<00:00:54.819> gonna<00:00:54.999> let<00:00:55.209> you<00:00:55.329> feel<00:00:55.569> your<00:00:55.749> Chi

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:55.959 
sense is I'm gonna let you feel your Chi

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.949 
sense is I'm gonna let you feel your Chi
I'm<00:00:56.709> gonna<00:00:56.859> let<00:00:56.949> you<00:00:57.039> feel<00:00:57.219> my<00:00:57.429> Chi<00:00:57.729> and<00:00:58.030> see<00:00:58.869> if

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:58.959 
I'm gonna let you feel my Chi and see if

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:02.009 
I'm gonna let you feel my Chi and see if
you<00:00:59.079> can<00:00:59.260> actually<00:00:59.469> pick<00:01:00.459> up<00:01:00.609> on<00:01:00.819> it<00:01:00.969> now<00:01:01.389> first

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
you can actually pick up on it now first

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.629 
you can actually pick up on it now first
thing<00:01:02.229> you<00:01:02.319> have<00:01:02.709> to<00:01:02.799> understand<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.369> that<00:01:03.399> you

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
thing you have to understand is that you

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:05.880 
thing you have to understand is that you
you're<00:01:03.999> you're<00:01:04.420> an<00:01:04.510> energy<00:01:04.720> being<00:01:05.199> you're

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
you're you're an energy being you're

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.820 
you're you're an energy being you're

built up of energy everyone has energy

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.950 
built up of energy everyone has energy
some<00:01:09.190> people<00:01:09.400> have<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.520> lot<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:09.760> energy<00:01:10.090> some

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
some people have a lot of energy some

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.390 
some people have a lot of energy some
people<00:01:11.170> have<00:01:11.290> a<00:01:11.350> low<00:01:11.500> level<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:11.920> energy<00:01:12.070> but

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
people have a low level of energy but

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.210 
people have a low level of energy but
you<00:01:12.490> should<00:01:12.730> be<00:01:12.880> able<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.150> feel<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.710> energy<00:01:15.070> if

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
you should be able to feel the energy if

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.460 
you should be able to feel the energy if
you're<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:15.580> relatively<00:01:16.150> good<00:01:16.390> shape<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
you're in relatively good shape you

you're in relatively good shape you
should<00:01:17.500> be<00:01:17.860> you<00:01:18.370> should<00:01:18.400> be<00:01:18.610> able<00:01:18.730> to<00:01:18.850> feel

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
should be you should be able to feel

should be you should be able to feel
everything<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.420> I'm<00:01:19.540> going<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.690> talk<00:01:19.810> about

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
everything that I'm going to talk about

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.290 
everything that I'm going to talk about
if<00:01:20.320> you're<00:01:20.950> in<00:01:21.160> really<00:01:21.490> good<00:01:21.670> shape<00:01:21.850> and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
if you're in really good shape and

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.990 
if you're in really good shape and
you're<00:01:22.630> very<00:01:22.900> sensitive<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.680> energy<00:01:24.160> you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
you're very sensitive to energy you

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.480 
you're very sensitive to energy you
should<00:01:25.210> actually<00:01:25.540> be<00:01:25.930> able<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.350> fill<00:01:26.740> my<00:01:27.190> Chi

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
should actually be able to fill my Chi

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.540 
should actually be able to fill my Chi
now<00:01:28.150> that<00:01:28.330> sounds<00:01:28.750> pretty<00:01:28.810> strange<00:01:29.380> in<00:01:29.770> the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
now that sounds pretty strange in the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.220 
now that sounds pretty strange in the
fact<00:01:30.820> that<00:01:30.910> this<00:01:31.120> is<00:01:31.300> coming<00:01:31.540> across<00:01:31.720> on<00:01:32.200> a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
fact that this is coming across on a

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.050 
fact that this is coming across on a
video<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:32.680> you<00:01:33.010> can<00:01:33.160> be<00:01:33.310> watching<00:01:33.760> this<00:01:33.880> in

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
video and you can be watching this in

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.320 
video and you can be watching this in
Hong<00:01:34.240> Kong<00:01:34.350> Australia<00:01:35.350> in<00:01:35.470> New<00:01:35.620> York<00:01:35.800> City<00:01:36.330> or

Hong Kong Australia in New York City or
the<00:01:37.570> North<00:01:37.810> Pole<00:01:38.110> doesn't<00:01:38.590> really<00:01:38.860> matter<00:01:39.130> the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
the North Pole doesn't really matter the

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.610 
the North Pole doesn't really matter the
fact<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.150> matter<00:01:40.210> is<00:01:40.480> you<00:01:40.930> can<00:01:41.140> feel<00:01:41.410> the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
fact of the matter is you can feel the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.020 
fact of the matter is you can feel the
energy<00:01:41.770> when<00:01:42.160> you're<00:01:42.280> sensitive<00:01:42.700> enough

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
energy when you're sensitive enough

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.030 
energy when you're sensitive enough
that's<00:01:43.630> what<00:01:43.810> we<00:01:43.930> teach<00:01:44.140> people<00:01:44.440> how<00:01:44.650> to<00:01:44.680> do<00:01:44.920> is

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
that's what we teach people how to do is

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.760 
that's what we teach people how to do is
to<00:01:45.159> become<00:01:45.460> sensitive<00:01:46.090> as<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:47.170> develop<00:01:47.650> your

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
to become sensitive as you develop your

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.080 
to become sensitive as you develop your
body<00:01:47.950> just<00:01:48.250> like<00:01:48.400> you<00:01:48.520> would<00:01:48.640> develop<00:01:48.880> your

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
body just like you would develop your

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.180 
body just like you would develop your

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
you'll find that there is

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.150 
you'll find that there is
very<00:02:13.420> much<00:02:13.660> significance<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.470> all<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.890> three

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
very much significance that all of three

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.150 
very much significance that all of three
of<00:02:15.370> those<00:02:15.520> components<00:02:16.140> but<00:02:17.140> we're<00:02:17.890> getting

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
of those components but we're getting

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.470 
of those components but we're getting
ahead<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.370> ourselves<00:02:18.520> let's<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.210> go<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
ahead of ourselves let's just go to the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.060 
ahead of ourselves let's just go to the
cheapo<00:02:19.870> test<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.380> I'll<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.620> give<00:02:20.950> me<00:02:21.010> an

should be able to feel almost like a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.580 
should be able to feel almost like a
magnetic<00:02:45.400> energy<00:02:46.060> if<00:02:46.540> you've<00:02:46.780> ever<00:02:46.960> taken<00:02:47.200> two
