500 Wi-Fi hotspot router we're going to

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.180 
500 Wi-Fi hotspot router we're going to
talk<00:00:14.870> about<00:00:15.049> the<00:00:15.320> compatibility<00:00:15.980> between

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
talk about the compatibility between

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.070 
talk about the compatibility between
that<00:00:16.610> and<00:00:16.789> the<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:17.840> new<00:00:17.960> sprint<00:00:18.470> AC<00:00:19.869> 597<00:00:20.869> from

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
that and the the new sprint AC 597 from

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.519 
that and the the new sprint AC 597 from
Sierra<00:00:21.440> the<00:00:22.189> compass<00:00:23.230> so<00:00:24.230> what<00:00:24.349> we're<00:00:24.439> going

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
Sierra the compass so what we're going

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.320 
Sierra the compass so what we're going
to<00:00:24.619> do<00:00:24.800> is<00:00:25.609> we're<00:00:25.820> going<00:00:25.910> to<00:00:26.000> plug<00:00:26.509> the<00:00:26.689> card<00:00:26.900> in

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
to do is we're going to plug the card in

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.150 
to do is we're going to plug the card in
plug<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:29.480> power<00:00:29.660> in<00:00:29.900> we're<00:00:30.830> going<00:00:30.920> to<00:00:30.980> let<00:00:31.130> it

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
plug the power in we're going to let it

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.070 
plug the power in we're going to let it
initialize<00:00:31.730> here<00:00:32.360> you<00:00:32.540> can<00:00:32.660> see<00:00:32.840> all<00:00:32.870> the

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
initialize here you can see all the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.010 
initialize here you can see all the
power<00:00:33.640> adapters<00:00:34.640> for<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.360> know<00:00:35.480> numerous

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
power adapters for you know numerous

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.300 
power adapters for you know numerous
different<00:00:36.350> countries<00:00:36.710> that<00:00:36.830> operate<00:00:37.190> on

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
different countries that operate on

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.490 
different countries that operate on
different<00:00:37.340> voltages<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:39.020> can<00:00:39.200> use<00:00:39.320> it<00:00:39.410> on

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
different voltages so you can use it on

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.400 
different voltages so you can use it on
just<00:00:39.680> about<00:00:39.770> any<00:00:40.010> country<00:00:40.430> worldwide<00:00:41.410> and

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
just about any country worldwide and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.840 
just about any country worldwide and
we'll<00:00:42.620> go<00:00:42.739> over<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:43.129> connections<00:00:43.579> on<00:00:43.730> the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
we'll go over the connections on the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.819 
we'll go over the connections on the
router<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:44.510> here<00:00:44.719> you<00:00:44.840> have<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:45.140> USB<00:00:45.410> slot

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
router so here you have the USB slot

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.979 
router so here you have the USB slot
obviously<00:00:46.340> where<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.550> cards<00:00:46.789> plugged<00:00:47.059> in<00:00:47.210> the

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
obviously where the cards plugged in the

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.069 
obviously where the cards plugged in the
Wi-Fi<00:00:48.440> on/off<00:00:49.160> switch<00:00:49.670> you<00:00:50.359> have<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.629> land<00:00:50.870> as

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
Wi-Fi on/off switch you have the land as

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.910 
Wi-Fi on/off switch you have the land as
well<00:00:51.530> as<00:00:51.920> way<00:00:52.129> in<00:00:52.190> port<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:53.420> power<00:00:53.829> you<00:00:54.829> have

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
well as way in port the power you have

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.549 
well as way in port the power you have
the<00:00:55.039> reset<00:00:55.510> this<00:00:56.510> is<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.719> signal<00:00:57.109> strength

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
the reset this is a signal strength

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.229 
the reset this is a signal strength
indicator<00:00:57.829> that<00:00:58.160> will<00:00:58.399> show<00:00:58.609> the<00:00:58.910> signal

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
indicator that will show the signal

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.119 
indicator that will show the signal
strength<00:00:59.329> on<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.690> top<00:00:59.930> of<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.140> router<00:01:00.320> do<00:01:01.070> you

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
strength on the top of the router do you

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.970 
strength on the top of the router do you
have<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.340> expresscard<00:01:02.030> slot<00:01:02.679> with<00:01:03.679> a<00:01:03.710> lock

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
have the expresscard slot with a lock

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.910 
have the expresscard slot with a lock
that<00:01:04.309> will<00:01:04.489> lock<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.760> card<00:01:04.970> into<00:01:05.180> place<00:01:05.920> you

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
that will lock the card into place you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.420 
that will lock the card into place you
also<00:01:07.130> have<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.090> Wi-Fi<00:01:09.130> external<00:01:10.130> antenna

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
also have the Wi-Fi external antenna

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.090 
also have the Wi-Fi external antenna
port<00:01:10.729> adapter<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:12.170> on<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.500> top<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:12.710> have<00:01:12.950> all

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
port adapter and on the top you have all

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.570 
port adapter and on the top you have all
the<00:01:13.189> lights<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.729> power<00:01:13.939> the<00:01:14.380> land<00:01:15.380> as<00:01:15.650> well<00:01:16.430> as

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
the lights the power the land as well as

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.570 
the lights the power the land as well as
when<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.390> Wi-Fi<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.259> USB<00:01:18.799> for<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.130> card<00:01:19.369> and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
when the Wi-Fi the USB for the card and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.460 
when the Wi-Fi the USB for the card and
then<00:01:20.150> that's<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.540> Express<00:01:20.869> card<00:01:21.110> light<00:01:21.290> which

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
then that's the Express card light which

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.990 
then that's the Express card light which
is<00:01:21.500> not<00:01:21.770> on<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.130> then<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:22.369> see<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:22.670> signal

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
is not on and then you see the signal

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.719 
is not on and then you see the signal
strength<00:01:23.150> indicator<00:01:24.189> so<00:01:25.189> what<00:01:25.310> we'll<00:01:25.430> do<00:01:25.549> now

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
strength indicator so what we'll do now

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.460 
strength indicator so what we'll do now
is<00:01:25.939> I'm<00:01:26.270> going<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.450> go<00:01:26.540> search<00:01:26.750> for<00:01:27.020> available
