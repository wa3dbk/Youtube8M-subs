another option that people aren't

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
talking about but you know what it's a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.630 
talking about but you know what it's a
sweet<00:00:17.609> device<00:00:17.970> called<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> Commodore<00:00:19.020> 64<00:00:19.640> now

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
sweet device called the Commodore 64 now

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.740 
sweet device called the Commodore 64 now
I<00:00:20.699> know<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:21.060> you're<00:00:21.180> thinking<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.570> couple

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
I know what you're thinking a couple

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.200 
I know what you're thinking a couple
years<00:00:22.109> ago<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.650> did<00:00:23.220> another<00:00:23.430> video<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:23.970> this

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
years ago I did another video like this

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.230 
years ago I did another video like this
but<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.900> wasn't<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.920> fair<00:00:26.220> comparison<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
but it wasn't a fair comparison and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.660 
but it wasn't a fair comparison and
that's<00:00:27.480> because<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.740> original<00:00:28.859> Commodore

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
that's because the original Commodore

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.910 
that's because the original Commodore
had<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.300> connected<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.410> television

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
had to be connected to a a television

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.459 
had to be connected to a a television
like<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.090> wasn't<00:00:33.390> exactly<00:00:33.480> portable

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
like this so it wasn't exactly portable

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.819 
like this so it wasn't exactly portable
well<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:36.180> year<00:00:36.630> I've<00:00:36.840> got<00:00:37.140> an<00:00:37.320> awesome
