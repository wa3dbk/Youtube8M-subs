 campervideo.nl hello welcome to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.059
 campervideo.nl a weekly 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.740
 inspiring informative and 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.540
 entertaining internet video show for 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.160
 camper in the Netherlands 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.049
 I'm home again today and then I'll go 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.170
 Well think about it I'm guus 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.170
 homestead 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.610
 yes i just got home and it was workshop 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.470
 weed and do better than here for 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.480
 the outside you just get it wet and wet 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.829
 dirty and weird I always had one 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.300
 nice sunshine 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.980
 I just came back from a somewhat longer one 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.860
 Camper trip and then often my house as a 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.659
 an extremely large palace not that bad 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.579
 house waxed went great 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.550
 nature because of that I have a time 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.050
 lived and have little space and so 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.120
 live in the Kempen 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.079
 experience with camper absolutely not like 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.640
 a small space 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.229
 in fact if I stay a camper 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.339
 wouldn't know why I have more space 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.750
 need 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.509
 and then it's just my palace 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.100
 wheels somehow becomes 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.890
 sense of what is needed for one 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.750
 comfortable empty space or living space 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.970
 corrected and adjusts with what you do 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.979
 have what happens now for me and 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.220
 I also enjoy it to the fullest 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.420
 dam and in itself i have my house dear 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.000
 nice view 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.320
 I just got here and the variety 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.630
 again, of course , a clear one works 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.130
 and I am certainly coming to my house 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.009
 the places where I now sometimes delicious 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.479
 is my camper itself has 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.830
 we own everything we take with us 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.479
 permanent place so that it never gets in a way 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.580
 and the space is not always with 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.069
 feel and what she cannot take with her 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.330
 take oil with you 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.039
 although often still way too much 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.959
 medium than strictly necessary and often 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.130
 with intention that we want power supplies 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.349
 going to use 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.789
 and then it appears that it never use and 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.530
 usually also have things brought along 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.239
 from the feeling that you should have it with you 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.340
 so you never know 

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:57.470
 type of stuff based on you can 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.030
 it now have thoughts 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.069
 The point is we have to be satisfied with 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.629
 what we brought and yes what we 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.209
 and have and have most you can 

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:08.500
 buy wherever you are or at one 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.500
 solve it in a creative way 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.030
 if you have been in one place for a little longer 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.470
 I notice that the camper slowly again yes 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.470
 is used in a different way and 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.540
 that more is collected, sometimes the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.459
 washing up such a day out is delayed or 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.930
 that stuff in a different way 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.430
 born to use them was 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.660
 supposedly then quickly accessible again 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.800
 to be 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.750
 but of course also often and 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.980
 visibility is laid and gradually 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.170
 notice the camper 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.849
 after becoming too small ours was of course 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.519
 could manage in principle then not 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.379
 more than before the light alone and 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.330
 sight 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.670
 I have in recent years when eyes 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.099
 I own a few weeks alone 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.019
 with the camper gone the camper was completely 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.060
 at a palace now seemed real 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.920
 I was incredibly big then 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.420
 day sleeper job for the door 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.220
 children are used that I use 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.450
 for all kinds of stuff that crashes near 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.250
 the entrance we have so I said one 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.720
 very large greenhouse me 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.879
 stuff that the garage normally had 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.640
 I lay stuff under the couch 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.450
 I had some extra dream lying there 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.629
 worth it 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.239
 stock such as water or cola or 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.940
 cans of vegetables 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.620
 so then quickly within reach 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.340
 huge luxury of course and a real sea 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.569
 of space and I could even 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.340
 regular polar bear and the camper like me 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.069
 then was thinking or phoning as a cup 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.739
 I know it was a little weird habit 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.269
 but it was nice that I could do it 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.040
 and you know when i was my family of it 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.260
 airport ladies they picked up after one 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.169
 week or five and six was the camper and thinking 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.459
 filled with three extra people and yes like 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.970
 the camper nature a lot smaller 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.220
 and busy getting used to it 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.599
 and indeed it gets used quickly because after one 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.849
 few days everyone has them running 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.959
 found again and and go the rhythm of it 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.790
 again by whatever my name 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.560
 I think it's pledged if I have a number 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.750
 weeks or maybe months 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.859
 who has been with the Kempenweg and I walk 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.660
 from my house 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.669
 who once the camper within I the 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.489
 space like that is small I think it is 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.959
 almost as claustrophobic and me vague 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.200
 also can't imagine me here 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.329
 could stay in for a longer time 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.010
 I can well imagine how 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.180
 outsiders look at the camp 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.370
 life 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.959
 they must think what a misery 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.359
 existed and it was abandoning in such a mind 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.949
 but they don't know what they are missing and we 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.810
 know of course already busy because I would 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.449
 it absolutely for the most luxurious 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.819
 want to exchange a holiday resort 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.370
 and this building was yes some thought 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:31.960
 and an experience I want to share 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.280
 perhaps you experience it very differently me 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.690
 I am also very curious how you do this 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.919
 to experience 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.449
