00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.000
 was one of the figures of colombia the 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:07.609
 selection that played the world sub-20 of 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.860
 2011 and for that reason it lasted little in the city 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.930
 to make the leap to the sporting of lisbon 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.780
 in Portugal where he played for three years 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.900
 to now show your football on the psv 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.029
 holland eindhoven 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.210
 the right side antioqueño santiago 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.550
 arias is 21 years old starts his third 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.349
 season in European football and that's why 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.419
 it's not a big surprise in the middle 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.730
 football fan that is part of the selection 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.580
 because it always appeared as a good 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.710
 alternative that became a reality today 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.540
 unfortunate injury of camilo zúñiga him 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.120
 opened the possibility of among the 27 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.370
 concentrated and arrived with the firm option 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.620
 to be the game in the titular cast 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.870
 of this Friday against chile in a 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.510
 personal fight with stefan medina and juan 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.519
 william square 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.539
 the arrival has been very good while 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:56.760
 also all the companions more than 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.530
 the most experienced is the youngest and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.109
 they have treated me well I think that this is 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 a very beautiful family both of 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.840
 players like fans and the union that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.039
 I think the opportunity comes first 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.799
 that has a side is to defend 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.450
 then try to do it well we pan 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.159
 and I feel with confidence I feel that I can 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.280
 do things well if I have the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.869
 opportunity and if not also 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.580
 well it was not so much surprise because 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.409
 I had an opportunity with the teacher 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.009
 I knew he would follow up then 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.560
 the call for me is excellent because 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.390
 I realize that I am in excellent 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.399
 level now with the psd been playing 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.000
 so it is important that the wta follows 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.430
 active and if I think I'm ready 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.330
 obviously I know it's a match 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.060
 important that you have to leave everything but 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.380
 I'm committed I know what I have to 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.570
 do and well you have to go out and demonstrate 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.700
 like football in europe is much more 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.780
 fast in holland now is happening a 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.030
 good moment 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.180
 the payroll he has is much younger 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.140
 so I think it helps me a lot but 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.509
 we have to be focused 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.720
 we know that we are in our house with 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.280
 our people then we like that 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.380
 they come to leave everything we have to 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.380
 leave the same and here the three points
