really<00:01:56.090> nifty<00:01:56.929> things<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.350> have<00:01:57.530> if<00:01:57.829> you're

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
really nifty things to have if you're

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.550 
really nifty things to have if you're
into<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.429> outdoors<00:01:58.759> lifestyle<00:01:59.299> I<00:01:59.479> use<00:01:59.749> my<00:02:00.380> one

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
into the outdoors lifestyle I use my one

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.899 
into the outdoors lifestyle I use my one
all<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.859> time<00:02:00.889> in<00:02:01.249> the<00:02:01.340> boat<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.729> when<00:02:01.819> I'm

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
all the time in the boat and when I'm

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.029 
all the time in the boat and when I'm
camping<00:02:02.299> it's<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.990> lot<00:02:03.200> more<00:02:03.380> efficient<00:02:03.979> than

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
camping it's a lot more efficient than

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.559 
camping it's a lot more efficient than
just<00:02:04.340> an<00:02:04.460> esky<00:02:04.759> with<00:02:04.909> ice<00:02:05.060> in<00:02:05.240> it<00:02:05.299> you<00:02:05.420> don't

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
just an esky with ice in it you don't

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.270 
just an esky with ice in it you don't
have<00:02:05.689> to<00:02:05.810> worry<00:02:05.990> about<00:02:06.109> the<00:02:06.439> ice<00:02:06.590> melting<00:02:07.130> and

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
have to worry about the ice melting and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.859 
have to worry about the ice melting and
having<00:02:07.759> to<00:02:07.850> get<00:02:07.999> new<00:02:08.030> ice<00:02:08.330> all<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.690> have<00:02:08.810> to

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
having to get new ice all you have to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:09.999 
having to get new ice all you have to
worry<00:02:09.020> about<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.289> having<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.560> decent<00:02:09.860> power

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
worry about is having a decent power

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.000 
worry about is having a decent power
supply<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.900> 12-volt<00:02:11.900> deep-cycle<00:02:12.379> battery<00:02:12.860> like

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
supply a 12-volt deep-cycle battery like

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.530 
supply a 12-volt deep-cycle battery like
this<00:02:13.129> guy<00:02:13.280> here<00:02:13.519> will<00:02:13.640> run<00:02:13.819> this<00:02:14.000> unit<00:02:14.239> for

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
this guy here will run this unit for

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.950 
this guy here will run this unit for
about<00:02:14.629> 12<00:02:14.989> hours

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
about 12 hours

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.150 
about 12 hours
obviously<00:02:16.290> then<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.530> need<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.800> charge<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
obviously then you need to charge the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.860 
obviously then you need to charge the
battery<00:02:17.610> again<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:18.000> you've<00:02:18.120> got<00:02:18.270> 12<00:02:18.540> hours<00:02:18.720> of

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
battery again but you've got 12 hours of

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.710 
battery again but you've got 12 hours of
you<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.380> basically<00:02:20.060> freezer<00:02:21.060> time<00:02:21.360> with

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
you know basically freezer time with

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.040 
you know basically freezer time with
that<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:23.130> maximize<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:24.120> thermal<00:02:24.600> efficiency

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
that to maximize the thermal efficiency

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.390 
that to maximize the thermal efficiency
of<00:02:25.080> these<00:02:25.230> for<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.530> units<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.100> really

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
of these for the units it's a really

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.090 
of these for the units it's a really
good<00:02:26.520> idea<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:27.030> op<00:02:27.990> one<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.410> these<00:02:28.530> accessories

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
good idea to op one of these accessories

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.000 
good idea to op one of these accessories
which<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.400> basically<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.910> it's<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.720> little

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
which is basically a it's a little

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.440 
which is basically a it's a little
blanket<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.130> guess<00:02:32.310> for<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.760> for<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.120> unit

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
blanket I guess for the for the unit

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.530 
blanket I guess for the for the unit
what<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.810> does<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:35.030> maximizes<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.210> thermal

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
what it does is it maximizes the thermal

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.080 
what it does is it maximizes the thermal
efficiency<00:02:36.630> by<00:02:37.530> keeping<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.490> cooling

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
efficiency by keeping the the cooling

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.970 
efficiency by keeping the the cooling
and<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.330> heat<00:02:39.480> out<00:02:39.660> if<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.170> was<00:02:40.320> traveling<00:02:40.560> up

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
and the heat out if I was traveling up

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.980 
and the heat out if I was traveling up
in<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.310> north<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.360> Australia<00:02:42.450> where

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
in the north of Australia where

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.720 
in the north of Australia where
temperatures<00:02:43.380> are<00:02:43.410> quite<00:02:43.620> extreme<00:02:44.100> one<00:02:44.640> of

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
temperatures are quite extreme one of

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.010 
temperatures are quite extreme one of
these<00:02:44.850> things<00:02:45.060> would<00:02:45.240> definitely<00:02:45.630> be<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:45.840> my

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
these things would definitely be on my

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.190 
these things would definitely be on my
