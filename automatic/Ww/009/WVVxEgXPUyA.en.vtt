was<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.730> pitch<00:00:21.619> yeah<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.920> we

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
was it like that on the pitch yeah we we

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.679 
was it like that on the pitch yeah we we
felt<00:00:23.699> confident<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.240> we<00:00:24.330> were<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> win

goes<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.220> think<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.910> sends<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> game<00:00:30.449> up<00:00:30.660> good

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
goes I think that sends the game up good

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.810 
goes I think that sends the game up good

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
we are we have to pick ourselves up and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.650 
we are we have to pick ourselves up and
just<00:00:37.710> make<00:00:38.520> sure<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.700> next<00:00:38.969> next<00:00:39.360> game<00:00:39.510> we

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
just make sure that next next game we

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.540 
just make sure that next next game we
don't<00:00:39.840> make<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:39.989> mistakes<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.010> then

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
don't make the mistakes and and then

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.709

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
again you know we have to be a little

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.569 
again you know we have to be a little
bit<00:00:42.899> more<00:00:43.050> lucky<00:00:43.350> because<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.160> first<00:00:44.399> goal

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
bit more lucky because the first goal

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.060 
bit more lucky because the first goal
obviously<00:00:44.670> wasn't<00:00:45.000> offside<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.980> second<00:00:46.980> go

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so poorly this season yeah again I'd be

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.459 
so poorly this season yeah again I'd be
more<00:00:59.609> worried<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> case<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> being

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
more worried if it was a case of being

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.100 
more worried if it was a case of being
dominated<00:01:02.390> dominated<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> case<00:01:04.080> of

their<00:01:34.140> own<00:01:34.259> ground<00:01:34.950> does<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.310> make<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.579> more

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
their own ground does that make it more

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.800 
their own ground does that make it more
difficult<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.509> visit<00:01:36.780> inside<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:39.119> think<00:01:39.720> we

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
difficult for a visit inside I think we

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.700 
difficult for a visit inside I think we
need<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.170> used<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.590> it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
need to be used to it

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.200

we have good players we have a lot of

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.510 
we have good players we have a lot of
possessions<00:01:43.600> so<00:01:43.900> we<00:01:44.020> need<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.229> be<00:01:44.260> used<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.740> two

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
possessions so we need to be used to two

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.460
