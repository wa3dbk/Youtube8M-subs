00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
now this stones an older stone you can

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.310 
now this stones an older stone you can
see<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.880> dinged<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> face

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
see it's a little dinged up but the face

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.610 
see it's a little dinged up but the face
is<00:00:34.350> good<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> two<00:00:35.399> sided<00:00:35.670> stone<00:00:36.350> one<00:00:37.350> side

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
is good it's a two sided stone one side

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.410 
is good it's a two sided stone one side
is<00:00:37.770> coarse<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:39.059> side<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.570> finer<00:00:41.149> you<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.270> get

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
is coarse one side is finer you can get

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
is coarse one side is finer you can get
smaller<00:00:42.840> stones<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.850> know<00:00:45.079> that<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.320> get

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
smaller stones you know that you can get

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.750 
smaller stones you know that you can get
these<00:00:46.590> pretty<00:00:46.829> much<00:00:46.920> anywhere

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
these pretty much anywhere

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
these pretty much anywhere
the<00:00:48.329> reason<00:00:48.660> I'm<00:00:48.750> starting<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.410> these

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the reason I'm starting with these

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.130 
the reason I'm starting with these
stones<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.190> because<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.210> reason<00:00:51.420> these

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
stones is because of that reason these

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.779 
stones is because of that reason these
are<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.410> probably<00:00:52.770> easiest<00:00:53.100> stone<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.579> get

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
are the probably easiest stone to get

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.529 
are the probably easiest stone to get
and<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:55.440> maintain<00:00:55.620> your<00:00:56.129> knife<00:00:56.309> edge<00:00:56.610> they

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and to maintain your knife edge they

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.680 
and to maintain your knife edge they
work<00:00:57.690> fine<00:00:58.039> if<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.690> into

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
work fine if you want to get into

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.750 
work fine if you want to get into
sharpening<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:01.829> advanced<00:01:02.100> sharpening<00:01:02.670> you

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
sharpening more advanced sharpening you

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.479 
sharpening more advanced sharpening you
can<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.030> into<00:01:03.239> Japanese<00:01:03.780> water<00:01:04.049> stones

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
can get into Japanese water stones

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.719 
can get into Japanese water stones
they're<00:01:05.489> very<00:01:05.729> aggressive<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:07.530> now<00:01:07.729> I'm

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
they're very aggressive but for now I'm

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.710 
they're very aggressive but for now I'm
gonna<00:01:08.909> start<00:01:09.180> with<00:01:09.299> these<00:01:09.450> oil<00:01:09.780> stones<00:01:11.659> next<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
gonna start with these oil stones next I

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.149 
gonna start with these oil stones next I
want<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> talk<00:01:13.049> about<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> angles<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.979> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
want to talk about the angles that you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.679 
want to talk about the angles that you
use<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:16.320> sharpen<00:01:16.770> your<00:01:17.009> knife<00:01:17.400> blade<00:01:17.689> I'm

like this you want to use maybe 18

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.920 
like this you want to use maybe 18
degree<00:01:45.329> edge<00:01:45.770> something<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.869> for<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
degree edge something like this for a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.899 
degree edge something like this for a
thicker<00:01:49.320> edge<00:01:49.590> such<00:01:50.189> as<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> camp<00:01:50.670> knife

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
thicker edge such as a camp knife

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.910 
thicker edge such as a camp knife
something<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:51.899> going<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.229> used<00:01:52.439> really

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
something that's going to be used really

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.030 
something that's going to be used really
heavy<00:01:53.899> you<00:01:54.899> want<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.140> go<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> blade

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
heavy you want to go up with the blade

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.459 
heavy you want to go up with the blade
and<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.719> would<00:01:57.719> probably<00:01:57.990> give<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> more<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and that would probably give you more of

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.709 
and that would probably give you more of
like<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> 30-degree<00:01:59.310> angle<00:02:01.969> but<00:02:02.969> for<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> general

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
like a 30-degree angle but for a general

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.069 
like a 30-degree angle but for a general
cutting<00:02:04.290> edge<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.770> said<00:02:05.719> 20<00:02:06.719> degrees<00:02:07.049> or

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
cutting edge like I said 20 degrees or

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.479 
cutting edge like I said 20 degrees or
so<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.619> fine<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:10.470> next<00:02:10.770> thing<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.009> really

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
so is fine the next thing you really

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.650 
so is fine the next thing you really
want<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> do<00:02:11.910> before<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.300> start<00:02:12.360> sharpening

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
want to do before you start sharpening

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.600 
want to do before you start sharpening
just<00:02:13.840> make<00:02:14.320> sure<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.800> face<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.220> your<00:02:15.310> stone<00:02:15.580> is

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
just make sure the face of your stone is
