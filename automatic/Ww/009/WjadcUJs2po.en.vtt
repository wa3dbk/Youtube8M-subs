00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
now I'm feeling really tired and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.170 
now I'm feeling really tired and
slightly<00:02:13.290> grumpy<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:14.760> sort<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.060> like<00:02:15.150> a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
slightly grumpy this sort of like a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.700 
slightly grumpy this sort of like a
pressure<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.780> my<00:02:15.900> brain<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> little<00:02:16.410> bit<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.650> a

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
pressure in my brain a little bit of a

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.350 
pressure in my brain a little bit of a
headache<00:02:16.890> coming<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.980> I'm<00:02:20.310> drinking<00:02:20.910> to

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
headache coming on so I'm drinking to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.480 
headache coming on so I'm drinking to
make<00:02:21.510> sure<00:02:21.720> i'm<00:02:21.960> not<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.470> know<00:02:22.500> dehydrated<00:02:23.310> or

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
make sure i'm not you know dehydrated or

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.420 
make sure i'm not you know dehydrated or
just<00:02:23.730> not<00:02:23.880> drinking<00:02:24.270> enough<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.310> think

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
just not drinking enough and so I think

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.160 
just not drinking enough and so I think
what<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:26.850> remember<00:02:27.210> last<00:02:27.390> time<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:27.990> have

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170

this<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.810> be<00:02:33.930> expected<00:02:34.670> when<00:02:35.670> you're

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
this is to be expected when you're

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.580 
this is to be expected when you're
eliminating<00:02:36.480> toxins<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:37.230> sort<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.440> like

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
eliminating toxins just sort of like

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.640 
eliminating toxins just sort of like
euphoric<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.670> then<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.660> know<00:02:39.780> you'll<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.530> a

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
euphoric and then you know you'll have a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.200 
euphoric and then you know you'll have a
little<00:02:40.830> downtime<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.550> then<00:02:41.670> you're<00:02:41.790> euphoric

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
little downtime and then you're euphoric

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.560 
little downtime and then you're euphoric
