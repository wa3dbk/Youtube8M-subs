00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.600
 which I will guide you in all that you 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.020
 ask well today we will face a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.750
 topic that many people do not know 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.689
 that a novelty introduced in the last ones 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.820
 minecraft patch ie play the land 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.580
 with your friends 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.670
 well first of all I say that to play 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.100
 that for lan is not meant a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.000
 internet connection as I am at 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.829
 my home 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.710
 my friend is at home and we can 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.410
 play as if it were a server no yes 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.960
 can only do with the same connection 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.660
 I give you an example we have a router 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.430
 a simple router or I don't try a 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.469
 here connection provider i 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.690
 two computers must be connected to 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.559
 same network can be connected either 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.369
 via wi fi or via LAN cable 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.710
 at that point you have to go to start 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.500
 after connecting both computer and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.570
 with the same computer connection 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.830
 because it is a windows 7 operating system 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.159
 or windows vista 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.830
 who instead to windows xp and will be 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.979
