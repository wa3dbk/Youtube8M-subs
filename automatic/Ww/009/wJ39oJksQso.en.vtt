reflective<00:02:23.890> flex<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:25.180> can't<00:02:25.420> really<00:02:25.540> say

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
reflective flex so you can't really say

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.140 
reflective flex so you can't really say
that<00:02:25.810> yeah<00:02:26.470> if<00:02:27.100> you're<00:02:27.250> typing<00:02:28.350> into<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.500> dark

yeah the surgeon get a silicon yeah
jewel<00:03:15.520> malted<00:03:15.820> silicon<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.530> we<00:03:17.680> can<00:03:17.800> actually

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
jewel malted silicon so we can actually

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.220 
jewel malted silicon so we can actually
have<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.610> different<00:03:19.180> color<00:03:19.510> silicon<00:03:19.990> on<00:03:20.140> the

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
do have some that silicon in our

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.390 
do have some that silicon in our
consumer<00:03:34.060> range<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:35.470> we<00:03:35.710> are<00:03:35.950> introducing

and<00:04:44.500> we've<00:04:44.650> developed<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:45.280> mental<00:04:45.789> ray<00:04:45.940> housing

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
and we've developed a mental ray housing

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.020 
and we've developed a mental ray housing
and<00:04:46.539> to<00:04:47.229> say<00:04:47.410> this<00:04:47.590> as<00:04:47.770> well<00:04:47.949> because<00:04:48.850> it's

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
and to say this as well because it's

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.999 
and to say this as well because it's
time<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.389> culture<00:04:49.720> of<00:04:49.750> radical<00:04:50.500> with<00:04:50.979> a

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
time the culture of radical with a

time the culture of radical with a
reflective<00:04:51.490> Fleck<00:04:51.789> all<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.120> way<00:04:52.210> down<00:04:53.130> as<00:04:54.130> the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
reflective Fleck all the way down as the

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:01.320 
reflective Fleck all the way down as the
split<00:04:54.580> of<00:04:54.610> that

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.630 

so<00:05:02.330> with<00:05:02.540> these<00:05:03.070> would<00:05:04.070> they<00:05:04.160> be<00:05:04.250> comfortable

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
so with these would they be comfortable

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.670 
so with these would they be comfortable
to<00:05:04.820> what<00:05:05.090> would<00:05:05.180> they<00:05:05.270> be<00:05:05.300> comfortable<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:06.080> in

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
to what would they be comfortable to in

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.530 
to what would they be comfortable to in
their<00:05:06.950> current<00:05:07.250> line<00:05:07.490> in<00:05:07.940> our<00:05:08.120> current<00:05:08.420> line

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
their current line in our current line

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.990 
their current line in our current line
yeah<00:05:08.750> this<00:05:09.050> would<00:05:09.170> be<00:05:09.200> comparable<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.370> if'

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
yeah this would be comparable to the if'

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.540 
yeah this would be comparable to the if'
70<00:05:11.390> I<00:05:11.420> guess<00:05:11.690> okay<00:05:12.170> yes<00:05:14.800> all<00:05:15.800> right<00:05:15.860> thanks

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
70 I guess okay yes all right thanks

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.180 
70 I guess okay yes all right thanks
no<00:05:16.760> problems
