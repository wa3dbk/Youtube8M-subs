00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
that they put in right here and then get

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.210 
that they put in right here and then get
another<00:00:26.880> care<00:00:27.390> package<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.050> throw<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.010> down

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
another care package and throw it down

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.089 
another care package and throw it down
over<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.000> ground<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:31.470> see<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.920> should

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
over on the ground and you see it should

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.770 
over on the ground and you see it should
go<00:00:32.219> where<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> video<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
go where it is right in the video and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.660 
go where it is right in the video and
once<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.440> there<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.620> hop<00:00:35.010> onto<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.520> and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
once it's there just hop onto it and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.729 
once it's there just hop onto it and
then<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.480> hop<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:36.930> outside<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> map

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
then just hop right outside of the map

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.260 
then just hop right outside of the map
and<00:00:38.010> that's<00:00:38.460> pretty<00:00:38.579> much<00:00:38.700> all<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.180> to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and that's pretty much all you have to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.600 
and that's pretty much all you have to
do<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.440> pretty<00:00:40.559> easy<00:00:40.980> glitch<00:00:41.370> ado

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
do so this is a pretty easy glitch ado

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.760 
do so this is a pretty easy glitch ado
it's<00:00:41.820> an<00:00:41.969> after<00:00:42.270> patch<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.809> trigger<00:00:43.260> kind<00:00:43.680> of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
it's an after patch and trigger kind of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.380 
it's an after patch and trigger kind of
sucks<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.190> patching<00:00:44.640> glitches<00:00:44.969> i<00:00:45.090> guess<00:00:45.239> you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
sucks at patching glitches i guess you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.900 
sucks at patching glitches i guess you
can<00:00:45.510> see<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> good<00:00:46.800> job<00:00:47.010> tracker<00:00:47.460> guess<00:00:47.640> for

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
can see so a good job tracker guess for

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.150 
can see so a good job tracker guess for
not<00:00:48.300> patching<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.200> glitch<00:00:49.440> correctly<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
not patching the glitch correctly and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
allowing us to still get out of the map

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
allowing us to still get out of the map
