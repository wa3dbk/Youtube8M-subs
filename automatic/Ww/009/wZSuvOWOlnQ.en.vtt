was<00:03:19.680> made<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:20.190> 1982<00:03:21.030> by<00:03:21.720> Squaresoft<00:03:22.680> now<00:03:23.430> at

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
was made in 1982 by Squaresoft now at

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.090 
was made in 1982 by Squaresoft now at
the<00:03:24.000> time<00:03:24.470> development<00:03:25.470> teams<00:03:25.650> were<00:03:25.800> really

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
the time development teams were really

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.220 
the time development teams were really
small<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:26.970> believe<00:03:27.330> this<00:03:27.510> game<00:03:27.750> was<00:03:27.959> made<00:03:28.170> by

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
small so I believe this game was made by

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.520 
small so I believe this game was made by
what<00:03:28.830> was<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:29.250> -<00:03:29.519> maybe<00:03:30.180> no<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.959> was<00:03:31.080> made<00:03:31.290> by<00:03:31.500> a

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
what was it - maybe no it was made by a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.759 
what was it - maybe no it was made by a
three<00:03:31.950> people<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.209> was<00:03:33.360> made<00:03:33.600> in<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.260> Tokyo

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
three people so it was made in a Tokyo

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.790 
three people so it was made in a Tokyo
and<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.820> think<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.209> was<00:03:36.360> made<00:03:36.600> in<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.110> third

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
and I think it was made in the third

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.040 
and I think it was made in the third
floor<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.400> an<00:03:38.820> office<00:03:39.030> building<00:03:39.450> yeah<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.900> was

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
floor of an office building yeah it was

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.330 
floor of an office building yeah it was
the<00:03:40.200> third<00:03:40.410> floor<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.739> an<00:03:40.890> office<00:03:41.040> building

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
the third floor of an office building

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.060 
the third floor of an office building
and<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.630> was<00:03:42.720> pretty<00:03:42.989> small<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.530> cramped<00:03:43.769> in

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
and it was pretty small and cramped in

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.500 
and it was pretty small and cramped in
there<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.430> they<00:03:44.549> didn't<00:03:44.820> have<00:03:44.940> much<00:03:45.150> space<00:03:45.480> to

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
there so they didn't have much space to

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.900 
there so they didn't have much space to
work<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:46.110> just<00:03:46.260> some<00:03:46.769> older<00:03:47.100> computers<00:03:47.670> to

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
work in just some older computers to

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.300 
work in just some older computers to
work<00:03:47.940> with<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:49.530> working<00:03:49.860> conditions

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
work with and the working conditions

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.370 
work with and the working conditions
weren't<00:03:50.580> that<00:03:50.700> good<00:03:50.970> because<00:03:51.299> they<00:03:52.049> actually

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
weren't that good because they actually

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.530 
weren't that good because they actually
didn't<00:03:52.709> have<00:03:52.890> any<00:03:53.190> windows<00:03:53.640> on<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.330> third
