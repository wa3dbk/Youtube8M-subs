00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
and to do this we use compression if

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.320 
and to do this we use compression if
you're<00:00:25.289> new<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.500> mixing<00:00:26.099> then<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.789> compressor

take a listen to what's going on with

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.540 
take a listen to what's going on with
the<00:00:44.879> bass<00:00:51.680> all<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.280> DI

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the bass all right this is just a DI

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.779 
bass
I<00:00:54.620> think<00:00:55.620> they<00:00:55.710> recorded<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.250> right<00:00:56.309> into<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
I think they recorded it right into the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.110 
I think they recorded it right into the
audio<00:00:57.090> interface<00:00:57.480> nothing<00:00:58.109> fancy

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.750 

alright<00:01:03.170> not<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> most<00:01:04.470> exciting<00:01:04.830> sound<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
alright not the most exciting sound and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.130 
alright not the most exciting sound and
what<00:01:05.850> we're<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.090> use<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> compressor

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
what we're going to use is a compressor

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.010 
what we're going to use is a compressor
to<00:01:07.610> squash<00:01:08.610> parts<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> signal<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
to squash parts of the signal on the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
to squash parts of the signal on the
bass<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> little<00:01:10.590> bit<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.310> can

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
bass a little bit so that we can

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.880 
bass a little bit so that we can
increase<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.180> overall<00:01:12.270> volume<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.960> parts<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
increase the overall volume of parts of

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.340 
increase the overall volume of parts of
the<00:01:13.979> bass<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.460> we'll<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.729> fatter

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
the bass and we'll get a fatter

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.770 
the bass and we'll get a fatter
more<00:01:16.350> consistent<00:01:17.340> driving<00:01:18.090> bass<00:01:18.360> sound

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
more consistent driving bass sound

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.080 
more consistent driving bass sound
because<00:01:19.200> honestly<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:20.610> your<00:01:20.790> ear

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
because honestly that's what your ear

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
because honestly that's what your ear
wants<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.720> hear<00:01:22.080> most<00:01:22.650> modern<00:01:23.100> music<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.670> by

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
wants to hear most modern music and by

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.899 
wants to hear most modern music and by
modern<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.330> may<00:01:24.509> mean<00:01:24.720> 20<00:01:25.170> 30<00:01:25.439> years<00:01:25.860> we're<00:01:26.670> used

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
modern I may mean 20 30 years we're used

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.200 
modern I may mean 20 30 years we're used
to<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.090> nice<00:01:28.189> consistent<00:01:29.189> volume<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.729> punch<00:01:29.970> on

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
to a nice consistent volume and punch on

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.090 
to a nice consistent volume and punch on
the<00:01:30.299> bass<00:01:30.540> where<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> bass<00:01:31.530> guitar<00:01:31.950> is

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
the bass where a bass guitar is

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.429 
the bass where a bass guitar is
naturally<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> very<00:01:32.790> dynamic<00:01:33.299> instrument<00:01:34.229> your

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
naturally a very dynamic instrument your

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.260 
naturally a very dynamic instrument your
player<00:01:34.740> may<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.130> plucked<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.670> string<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.119> lot

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
player may have plucked one string a lot

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.420 
player may have plucked one string a lot
harder<00:01:36.509> than<00:01:36.689> another<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.799> he<00:01:37.860> may<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.009> soft

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
harder than another and he may be soft

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.219 
harder than another and he may be soft
during<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.759> couple<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.150> notes<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.869> really

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
during a couple of notes it's really

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
during a couple of notes it's really
hard<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.530> get<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> nice<00:01:41.009> consistent<00:01:41.729> pluck<00:01:42.000> just

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
hard to get a nice consistent pluck just

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.090 
hard to get a nice consistent pluck just
like<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.720> good<00:01:42.990> drummer<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> hard<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.770> come<00:01:43.950> by

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
like a good drummer is hard to come by

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.889 
like a good drummer is hard to come by
where<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> nice<00:01:44.729> consistent<00:01:45.090> hit<00:01:45.750> on

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
where you have a nice consistent hit on

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.450 
where you have a nice consistent hit on
the<00:01:45.990> snare<00:01:46.259> or<00:01:46.380> kick<00:01:46.590> every<00:01:46.860> time<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.250> it's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the snare or kick every time it's it's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.130 
the snare or kick every time it's it's
just<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:47.759> hard<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> perfectly<00:01:48.659> so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
just really hard to do it perfectly so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.630 
just really hard to do it perfectly so
compression<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.770> help<00:01:49.979> even<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.310> some<00:01:50.549> of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
compression can help even out some of

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.639

fatter bass guitar what we're going to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
fatter bass guitar what we're going to
do<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.439> slap<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.860> any<00:01:56.100> compressor<00:01:56.579> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
do here is slap on any compressor that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.399 
do here is slap on any compressor that
comes<00:01:57.479> with<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.719> basic<00:01:57.930> DAW

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
comes with your basic DAW

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.170 
comes with your basic DAW
in<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:59.340> case<00:01:59.579> I've<00:01:59.759> got<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.000> free

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
in this case I've got the free

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.469 
in this case I've got the free
compressor<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.780> comes<00:02:00.990> with<00:02:01.140> Pro<00:02:01.320> Tools<00:02:01.560> and

compressor that comes with Pro Tools and

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.670 
compressor that comes with Pro Tools and
what<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.899> tell<00:02:04.049> people<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.350> do<00:02:04.530> is

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
what I like to tell people to do is

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.679 
what I like to tell people to do is
start<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.070> preset<00:02:05.520> I'm<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:06.270> afraid<00:02:06.570> of

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
start with a preset I'm not afraid of

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.540 
start with a preset I'm not afraid of
presets<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.560> teach<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> lot<00:02:08.310> if

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
presets because they teach you a lot if

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.219 
presets because they teach you a lot if
you<00:02:08.670> flip<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.179> preset<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.840> one's<00:02:10.020> called

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
you flip on a preset this one's called

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.040 
you flip on a preset this one's called
bass<00:02:10.530> guitar<00:02:11.009> hey<00:02:11.400> what<00:02:11.730> about<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.020> take<00:02:13.020> a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
bass guitar hey what about that take a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.880 
bass guitar hey what about that take a
look<00:02:13.410> at

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
look at

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.680 
look at
what<00:02:14.010> settings<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.580> shows<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.240> case<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
what settings it shows in this case the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.690 
what settings it shows in this case the
ratio<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.620> attack<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.160> release<00:02:17.190> are

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
ratio and the attack and the release are

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.340 
ratio and the attack and the release are
really<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.209> three<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.510> want<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.840> pay<00:02:18.930> attention

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
really the three I want to pay attention

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.720 
really the three I want to pay attention
to<00:02:19.500> your<00:02:19.740> gain<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.430> your<00:02:20.580> threshold<00:02:21.350> will<00:02:22.350> be

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
to your gain and your threshold will be

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.980 
to your gain and your threshold will be
irrelevant<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.970> your<00:02:24.120> sound<00:02:24.420> source<00:02:24.720> they

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
irrelevant to your sound source they

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.199 
irrelevant to your sound source they
have<00:02:25.020> no<00:02:25.380> idea<00:02:25.709> how<00:02:26.040> loud<00:02:26.340> your<00:02:26.640> bass<00:02:26.819> guitar

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
have no idea how loud your bass guitar

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.790 
have no idea how loud your bass guitar
is<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.170> they<00:02:28.290> don't<00:02:28.440> know<00:02:28.530> where<00:02:28.709> the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
is so they don't know where the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.320 
is so they don't know where the
threshold<00:02:29.220> should<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.550> set<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:29.940> or<00:02:30.120> do<00:02:30.240> they

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
threshold should be set in or do they

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.180 
threshold should be set in or do they
know<00:02:30.480> how<00:02:30.600> much<00:02:30.750> make<00:02:31.050> up<00:02:31.230> gain<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.709> want<00:02:32.010> if

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
know how much make up gain you want if

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.660 
know how much make up gain you want if
any<00:02:32.580> at<00:02:32.850> all<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.660> those<00:02:34.020> are<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.740> guess<00:02:35.100> but

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
any at all so those are just a guess but

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.460 
any at all so those are just a guess but
these<00:02:36.120> are<00:02:36.390> probably<00:02:36.750> going<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.020> be<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.170> good

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
these are probably going to be a good

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.380 
these are probably going to be a good
recommendation<00:02:37.820> for<00:02:38.820> what<00:02:38.850> we're<00:02:39.120> trying<00:02:39.270> to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
recommendation for what we're trying to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.810 
recommendation for what we're trying to
do<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.750> relatively<00:02:40.709> conservative<00:02:40.950> ratio

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
do a relatively conservative ratio

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.580 
do a relatively conservative ratio
meaning<00:02:42.180> we're<00:02:42.300> not<00:02:42.330> really<00:02:42.930> compressing

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
meaning we're not really compressing

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.640 
meaning we're not really compressing
hard<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:44.100> point<00:02:44.370> five<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.850> one<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.530> then<00:02:46.530> it

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
hard to point five to one and then it

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.680 
hard to point five to one and then it
looks<00:02:46.800> like<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:47.010> relatively<00:02:47.610> slow<00:02:47.910> attack<00:02:48.420> and

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
looks like a relatively slow attack and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.229 
looks like a relatively slow attack and
release<00:02:48.840> meaning<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.489> attack<00:02:50.850> is<00:02:51.000> when<00:02:51.120> the

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
release meaning the attack is when the

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.640 
release meaning the attack is when the
compressor<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.019> kick<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.500> it's

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
compressor is going to kick in it's

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.440 
compressor is going to kick in it's
going<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.830> wait<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.130> split<00:02:53.489> second<00:02:54.180> for<00:02:54.300> that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
going to wait a split second for that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.360 
going to wait a split second for that
initial<00:02:54.870> bass<00:02:55.110> guitar<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.769> plucked<00:02:56.160> and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
initial bass guitar to be plucked and

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.460 
initial bass guitar to be plucked and
then<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:56.880> going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.090> start<00:02:57.239> compressing<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
then it's going to start compressing the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.740 
then it's going to start compressing the
resonating<00:02:59.010> baseline<00:02:59.519> same<00:03:00.390> thing<00:03:00.570> with<00:03:00.690> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
resonating baseline same thing with the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.850 
resonating baseline same thing with the
release<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.200> means<00:03:01.380> it's<00:03:01.530> not<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:01.769> to

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
release it means it's not going to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.979 
release it means it's not going to
quickly<00:03:02.280> uncompress<00:03:03.269> it's<00:03:03.450> going<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.660> keep<00:03:03.840> it

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
quickly uncompress it's going to keep it

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.900 
quickly uncompress it's going to keep it
nice<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.260> compressed<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:05.459> what<00:03:05.610> that's<00:03:05.760> going

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
nice and compressed so what that's going

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.790 
nice and compressed so what that's going
to<00:03:05.970> do<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.180> get<00:03:06.300> us<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.540> nice<00:03:06.750> full<00:03:07.110> consistent

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
to do is get us a nice full consistent

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.830 
to do is get us a nice full consistent
volume<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.340> I'm<00:03:08.430> going<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:08.610> press<00:03:08.790> play<00:03:09.030> we'll

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
volume so I'm going to press play we'll

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.449 
volume so I'm going to press play we'll
audition<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.410> compressor<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.310> will

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
audition the compressor and I will

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:32.640 
audition the compressor and I will
adjust<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.880> threshold<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.660> gain
