00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.380 
clams this recommends a point for two
point<00:05:11.030> six<00:05:11.500> milliliters<00:05:12.500> per<00:05:12.770> gallon<00:05:13.490> so<00:05:14.240> this

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
point six milliliters per gallon so this

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.080 
point six milliliters per gallon so this
would<00:05:14.570> translate<00:05:14.690> to<00:05:15.100> 40<00:05:16.100> to<00:05:16.370> 60<00:05:16.790> milliliters
