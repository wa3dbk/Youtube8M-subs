while<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.509> do<00:01:48.570> think<00:01:48.869> he's<00:01:49.079> gonna<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.500> one

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
while but I do think he's gonna be one

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.410 
while but I do think he's gonna be one
of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> main<00:01:50.070> villains<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.579> next<00:01:50.880> season<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.639 
of the main villains for next season and
I<00:01:51.509> think<00:01:51.780> he's<00:01:51.930> gonna<00:01:52.049> start<00:01:52.409> recruiting

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
I think he's gonna start recruiting

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.200 
I think he's gonna start recruiting
other<00:01:52.979> gorillas<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.579> start<00:01:53.790> making<00:01:53.939> them

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
other gorillas and start making them

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.120 
other gorillas and start making them
smarter<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:54.899> who<00:01:55.020> knows<00:01:55.259> when<00:01:55.649> we'll<00:01:55.680> see

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.949 
he basically just stopped that just
shows<00:02:47.519> that<00:02:47.549> Grodd<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:47.940> actually<00:02:48.450> really

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
shows that Grodd is actually really

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.170 
shows that Grodd is actually really
strong<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.860> he<00:02:50.069> can<00:02:50.400> actually<00:02:50.730> take<00:02:50.910> punches

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
strong and he can actually take punches

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.059 
strong and he can actually take punches
from<00:02:51.540> flash<00:02:51.930> bear<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.530> gonna<00:02:52.590> actually<00:02:52.799> have

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
from flash bear is gonna actually have

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.979 
from flash bear is gonna actually have
to<00:02:53.160> use<00:02:53.190> his<00:02:53.310> mind<00:02:53.760> more<00:02:54.180> than<00:02:54.239> his<00:02:54.510> muscle

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
to use his mind more than his muscle

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.720 
to use his mind more than his muscle
because<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.650> doesn't<00:02:55.860> work<00:02:56.100> on<00:02:56.310> Grodd<00:02:56.549> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
because that doesn't work on Grodd and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.059 
because that doesn't work on Grodd and
the<00:02:56.819> CGI<00:02:57.299> on<00:02:57.630> gras<00:02:57.959> was<00:02:58.230> actually<00:02:58.560> well<00:02:58.799> put

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
the CGI on gras was actually well put

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.259 
the CGI on gras was actually well put
together<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.640> thought<00:02:59.849> it<00:02:59.970> looked<00:03:00.000> amazing

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
together I thought it looked amazing

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.660 
together I thought it looked amazing
with<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.200> TV<00:03:01.380> budget<00:03:01.860> they<00:03:01.950> got<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.340> thought<00:03:02.549> it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
with the TV budget they got I thought it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.979 
with the TV budget they got I thought it
looked<00:03:02.700> real<00:03:02.970> enough<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.209> me<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.630> general

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
looked real enough to me the general

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.509 
looked real enough to me the general
knows<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.380> Barry's<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.830> flash<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.400> he

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
knows that Barry's the flash and he

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.949 
knows that Barry's the flash and he
isn't<00:03:05.760> worried<00:03:06.030> about<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.690> know<00:03:06.720> that

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
isn't worried about that you know that

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.479 
isn't worried about that you know that
is<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.140> good<00:03:07.410> main<00:03:07.590> factor<00:03:08.010> because<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.370> means

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
is a good main factor because that means

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.309 
is a good main factor because that means
he's<00:03:08.670> not<00:03:08.819> gonna<00:03:08.910> go<00:03:09.060> after<00:03:09.209> him<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.989> general

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
he's not gonna go after him the general

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.990 
he's not gonna go after him the general
wants<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.620> go<00:03:10.680> after<00:03:10.830> many<00:03:11.190> humans<00:03:11.549> actually

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
wants to go after many humans actually

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.330 
wants to go after many humans actually
cause<00:03:12.510> problems<00:03:13.200> such<00:03:13.349> as<00:03:13.380> Captain<00:03:13.769> Cold<00:03:14.010> heat

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
cause problems such as Captain Cold heat

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.380 
cause problems such as Captain Cold heat
wave<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.670> all<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.910> because<00:03:15.030> they're<00:03:15.330> the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
wave and all that because they're the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.690 
wave and all that because they're the
ones<00:03:15.569> actually<00:03:15.840> cause<00:03:16.230> crime<00:03:16.530> while<00:03:17.069> Barry<00:03:17.340> is

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
ones actually cause crime while Barry is

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.520 
ones actually cause crime while Barry is
actually<00:03:18.359> helping<00:03:18.720> out<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.170> do<00:03:19.290> believe

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
actually helping out but I do believe

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
the same thing what he did in beginning

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.420 
the same thing what he did in beginning
of<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.260> season<00:03:31.440> or<00:03:31.709> does<00:03:31.859> he<00:03:31.980> wanted<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.340> go

of the season or does he wanted to go
back<00:03:32.609> in<00:03:32.760> time<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.359> would<00:03:33.900> say<00:03:34.109> both<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.799> do

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
back in time I would say both I do

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.620 
back in time I would say both I do
believe<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.670> Barry<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.299> reverse-flash

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
believe that Barry and the reverse-flash

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.539 
believe that Barry and the reverse-flash
we're<00:03:37.109> gonna<00:03:37.200> have<00:03:37.380> one<00:03:37.709> last<00:03:38.130> big<00:03:38.519> fight

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
we're gonna have one last big fight

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.099 
we're gonna have one last big fight
throughout<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.239> end<00:03:39.390> of<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.600> season<00:03:39.750> and

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
throughout the end of the season and

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.960 
throughout the end of the season and
they<00:03:40.470> are<00:03:40.620> gonna<00:03:40.739> go<00:03:40.920> back<00:03:41.069> in<00:03:41.220> time<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.910> do

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
they are gonna go back in time and I do

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.059 
they are gonna go back in time and I do
believe<00:03:42.329> that<00:03:42.690> Barry<00:03:43.019> is<00:03:43.260> going<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:43.980> be

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
believe that Barry is going to be

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.160 
believe that Barry is going to be
meeting<00:03:44.310> himself<00:03:44.880> in<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.209> future<00:03:45.540> remember

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
meeting himself in the future remember

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.020 
meeting himself in the future remember
the<00:03:46.620> other<00:03:46.769> flash<00:03:47.100> is<00:03:47.370> stuck<00:03:47.609> in<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.730> Speed

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
the other flash is stuck in the Speed

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.970 
the other flash is stuck in the Speed
Force<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.540> think<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.470> Barry<00:03:49.829> is

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
Force so I think that that Barry is

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.920 
Force so I think that that Barry is
gonna<00:03:50.370> meet<00:03:50.579> Barry<00:03:50.819> funny<00:03:51.329> how<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.540> say<00:03:51.780> that

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
gonna meet Barry funny how you say that

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.330 
gonna meet Barry funny how you say that
right<00:03:52.109> so<00:03:52.260> he's<00:03:52.380> gonna<00:03:52.470> meet<00:03:52.650> his<00:03:52.799> future<00:03:52.980> self

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
right so he's gonna meet his future self

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.550 
right so he's gonna meet his future self
and<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.700> believe<00:03:54.120> bury<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.720> older<00:03:55.019> himself<00:03:55.380> is

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
and I believe bury the older himself is

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.410 
and I believe bury the older himself is
