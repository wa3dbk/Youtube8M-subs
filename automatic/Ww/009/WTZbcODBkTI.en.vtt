 well clear our bathrooms and use song 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.189
 but if we alone the chords 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.230
 then as partners so design 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.880

 the only ones that chords that we're going to 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.320
 need good let's use with re 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.600
 higher and the pace is not 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.640
 you want because as it really is 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.360
 popular information and there's something 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.220
 definite 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.640

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.770
 He chose three radio rooms from 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.430
 ballads that you have in this case I go 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.800
 to use 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.510
 it is not conceived to racing but the sun is 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.530
 top down 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.530
 and let's start 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.090
 one 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.090
 everyone 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.549
 i 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.730
 well let's see the next two 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.530
 seven times 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.890
 now 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.520
 recognizable 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.520
 all right 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.530
 do not 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.140
 super simple good now I'm looking for 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.750
 end of the inn 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.570
 we're going to play the next bigger thing 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.330
 to be technically everything with king and when 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.570
 tell when here behind saints 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.320
 pilgrims green fortune tellers there we go to 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.320
 change seven 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.540
 i 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.890
 two 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.340
 the following when they ask you for a song 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.409
 that you do not have the slightest idea of 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.209
 how four the chords what they have 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:48.030
 what to do is to locate more or less in a 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:50.280
 circle you can use whatever you want ' 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.019
 any will simply serve but there 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.209
 some that are more with some 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.540
 songs that others for example ask you 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.579
 aigÃ¼es sand candle singing and so on 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.620
 ching on, remember then 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.579
 some or less typical to see how it would sound 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.579
 with me 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.860
 i 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.860
 do not 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.750
 but good try 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.230
 and you like more how it sounds so if you go 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.870
 experimenting and you're going to wine pretty much 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.959
 what songs are left which would already be 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.870
 issue for you and it's super good and 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.969
 simple because they shit unsuspecting and 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.670
 you get out of the simple river like a 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:41.610
 accordion with a cycle of any 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.770
 chord or note 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.960
 well I hope you have a happy 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.460
 Christmas and very much expelled 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.970
