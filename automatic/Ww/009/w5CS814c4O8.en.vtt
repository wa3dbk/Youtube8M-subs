00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
location to your new hive so you don't

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.189 
location to your new hive so you don't
have<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.059> worry<00:00:51.180> about<00:00:51.239> bees<00:00:51.570> coming<00:00:51.899> out<00:00:52.050> at

once the Queen is placed in the hive all

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.430 
once the Queen is placed in the hive all
the<00:01:12.980> rest<00:01:13.130> of<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.310> bees<00:01:13.430> will<00:01:13.610> go<00:01:13.730> by<00:01:13.880> her<00:01:14.440> now

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
the rest of the bees will go by her now

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.750 
the rest of the bees will go by her now
in<00:01:15.620> order<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:15.920> get<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.130> Queen<00:01:16.340> out<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:16.640> see

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.910 
in order to get the Queen out you see
this<00:01:16.880> big<00:01:17.090> cluster<00:01:17.480> of<00:01:17.510> bees<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:18.110> all<00:01:18.500> on<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
this big cluster of bees is all on the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.920 
this big cluster of bees is all on the
Queen<00:01:19.160> so<00:01:19.610> in<00:01:19.760> order<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.000> get<00:01:20.180> them<00:01:20.330> on<00:01:20.510> we<00:01:20.810> need

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
Queen so in order to get them on we need

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.080 
Queen so in order to get them on we need
to<00:01:21.050> do<00:01:21.170> is<00:01:21.290> we<00:01:21.410> need<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:21.560> bump<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.010> package<00:01:22.460> and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
to do is we need to bump the package and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.940 
to do is we need to bump the package and
shake<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.450> bees<00:01:23.600> off<00:01:23.870> now<00:01:24.560> I've<00:01:24.650> already

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
shake the bees off now I've already

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.000 
shake the bees off now I've already
given<00:01:25.070> them<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.370> little<00:01:25.580> bit<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.790> sugar<00:01:25.940> spray

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
given them a little bit of sugar spray

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.600 
given them a little bit of sugar spray
just<00:01:28.010> like<00:01:28.220> this<00:01:28.369> here<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:30.440> that<00:01:31.100> gives<00:01:31.430> them

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
just like this here and that gives them

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.670 
just like this here and that gives them
a<00:01:31.700> little<00:01:31.790> something<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.240> eat<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.470> course

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
a little something to eat and of course

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.140 
a little something to eat and of course
it<00:01:33.860> makes<00:01:34.010> it<00:01:34.160> harder<00:01:34.490> for<00:01:34.520> them<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:34.820> fly

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
it makes it harder for them to fly

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.420 
it makes it harder for them to fly
around<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:35.780> when<00:01:35.930> I<00:01:35.960> do<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.320> bump<00:01:36.530> there<00:01:37.250> won't

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
around so when I do the bump there won't

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.180 
around so when I do the bump there won't
be<00:01:37.490> as<00:01:37.610> many<00:01:37.729> bees<00:01:38.119> escaping<00:01:38.840> at<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.740> time<00:01:39.950> so

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
be as many bees escaping at that time so

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.969 
be as many bees escaping at that time so
I'm<00:01:40.280> just<00:01:40.369> gonna<00:01:40.550> take<00:01:40.790> this<00:01:40.940> here<00:01:41.330> and<00:01:41.979> I'll

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
I'm just gonna take this here and I'll

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.010 
I'm just gonna take this here and I'll
get<00:01:43.190> positioned<00:01:43.850> on<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.030> ground<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:44.630> I<00:01:44.660> can<00:01:44.899> do

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
get positioned on the ground so I can do

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.440 
get positioned on the ground so I can do
this<00:01:46.720> alright<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:47.780> here's<00:01:48.649> my<00:01:48.830> clean<00:01:49.070> cage

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450

off of the candy side and then you could

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.039 
off of the candy side and then you could
see<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.769> candy<00:03:37.450> all<00:03:38.450> right<00:03:38.510> that's<00:03:38.810> how<00:03:38.930> you

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049

want<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.290> do<00:03:39.409> it<00:03:39.530> if<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.769> remove<00:03:40.069> the<00:03:40.310> cork<00:03:40.849> on

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
want to do it if you remove the cork on

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.140 
want to do it if you remove the cork on
the<00:03:41.569> non<00:03:41.870> candy<00:03:42.409> side<00:03:42.650> she<00:03:43.640> could<00:03:43.819> release

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
the non candy side she could release

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.660 
the non candy side she could release
into<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.629> hive<00:03:44.840> immediately<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.920> the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
into the hive immediately and the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.580 
into the hive immediately and the
sometimes<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.420> worker<00:03:47.690> bees<00:03:47.959> will<00:03:48.200> reject

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
sometimes the worker bees will reject

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.170 
sometimes the worker bees will reject
her<00:03:48.769> but<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.040> takes<00:03:49.190> about<00:03:49.340> three<00:03:49.700> days<00:03:49.730> and

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
her but it takes about three days and

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.880 
her but it takes about three days and
they<00:03:50.239> get<00:03:50.420> used<00:03:50.599> to<00:03:50.720> her<00:03:50.870> sent<00:03:51.170> her<00:03:51.410> pheromones

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
they get used to her sent her pheromones

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.830 
they get used to her sent her pheromones
and<00:03:52.400> then<00:03:52.670> you're<00:03:52.819> all<00:03:52.910> set<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.390> now<00:03:53.420> what<00:03:53.720> we

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
and then you're all set so now what we

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.530 
and then you're all set so now what we
want<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.049> do<00:03:54.140> is<00:03:54.260> place<00:03:54.500> her<00:03:54.680> in<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.920> high<00:03:55.540> and

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
want to do is place her in the high and

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.330 
want to do is place her in the high and
it's<00:03:57.049> always<00:03:57.230> best<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.709> place<00:03:57.980> her<00:03:58.190> in<00:03:58.310> the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
it's always best to place her in the

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.149 
it's always best to place her in the
hive<00:03:58.989> between<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.019> couple<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.530> frames<00:04:03.159> and

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
hive between a couple of the frames and

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.619 
hive between a couple of the frames and
in<00:04:04.250> this<00:04:04.340> case<00:04:04.549> I'll<00:04:04.730> actually<00:04:05.180> have<00:04:05.390> to

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
in this case I'll actually have to

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.509 
in this case I'll actually have to
remove<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:06.110> frame<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:09.470> Queen<00:04:09.709> will<00:04:10.250> go<00:04:10.370> in

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
remove a frame and the Queen will go in

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.039 
remove a frame and the Queen will go in
the<00:04:10.640> hive<00:04:11.079> screen<00:04:12.079> down<00:04:13.540> okay<00:04:14.540> when<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:14.750> place

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
the hive screen down okay when I place

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.150 
the hive screen down okay when I place
her<00:04:15.200> in<00:04:15.489> now<00:04:16.810> this<00:04:17.810> can<00:04:18.079> be<00:04:18.109> dangerous<00:04:18.769> if<00:04:19.039> you

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160
