that<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.530> mag<00:02:38.830> sig<00:02:39.100> is<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.670> best<00:02:39.910> for

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
that the mag sig is the best for

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.000

starting to get off the cigarettes

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.890 
starting to get off the cigarettes
because<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:42.610> small<00:02:43.300> like<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.570> cigarette

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
because it is small like a cigarette

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.620 
because it is small like a cigarette
slam<00:02:44.470> but<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.130> really<00:02:45.400> powerful<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:46.600> I

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
slam but it is really powerful so I

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.210
