00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
to avoid jumping a whole lot now I know

video but for helping your aim when

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.889 
video but for helping your aim when
you're<00:00:35.340> jumping<00:00:35.760> although<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.300> will<00:00:36.540> help<00:00:36.780> you

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you're jumping although it will help you

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.720 
you're jumping although it will help you
get<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> enemy's<00:00:37.739> fire<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.370> also

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
get out of the enemy's fire it also

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.030 
get out of the enemy's fire it also
gives<00:00:38.910> away<00:00:39.300> your<00:00:39.420> location<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.440> really

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
gives away your location and it's really

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.920 
gives away your location and it's really
hard<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.370> aim<00:00:41.550> at<00:00:41.730> someone<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.270> midair<00:00:42.570> because

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
hard to aim at someone in midair because

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.779 
hard to aim at someone in midair because
your<00:00:43.079> depth<00:00:43.350> perception<00:00:43.469> changes<00:00:44.340> every

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
your depth perception changes every

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.610 
your depth perception changes every
single<00:00:45.120> second<00:00:45.570> because<00:00:45.809> you're<00:00:45.989> moving<00:00:46.410> so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
single second because you're moving so

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.170 
single second because you're moving so
avoid<00:00:46.920> jumping<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.910> aim<00:00:48.030> at

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
avoid jumping when you can to aim at

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
avoid jumping when you can to aim at
enemies<00:00:48.360> easier<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.110> work<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.530> your<00:00:49.649> timing

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
enemies easier and work on your timing

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.740 
enemies easier and work on your timing
for<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> boost<00:00:50.489> jumps<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.030> only<00:00:51.329> use<00:00:51.539> them

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
for the boost jumps and only use them

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.319 
for the boost jumps and only use them
when<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.170> necessary<00:00:52.949> another<00:00:53.760> huge<00:00:54.120> one

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
when they are necessary another huge one

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.970 
when they are necessary another huge one
is<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.690> make<00:00:54.899> sure<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.350> are<00:00:55.500> playing<00:00:55.739> on

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
is to make sure that you are playing on

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160 
is to make sure that you are playing on
the<00:00:56.129> right<00:00:56.430> sensitivity<00:00:57.239> now<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.539> personally

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the right sensitivity now I personally

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.959 
the right sensitivity now I personally
like<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.350> play<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> high<00:00:58.980> 16<00:00:59.489> because<00:00:59.760> for

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
like to play in a high 16 because for

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.790 
like to play in a high 16 because for
the<00:01:00.030> most<00:01:00.059> part<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.660> high-sensitivity<00:01:00.960> gives

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the most part a high-sensitivity gives

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.229 
the most part a high-sensitivity gives
you<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> good<00:01:02.100> advantage<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.000> you're<00:01:03.120> not

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
you a good advantage but if you're not

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.119 
you a good advantage but if you're not
used<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.600> high<00:01:03.750> sensitivity<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.949> could

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
used to a high sensitivity then it could

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.560 
used to a high sensitivity then it could
mess<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.640> aim<00:01:05.760> quite<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> bit<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.540> just

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
mess up your aim quite a bit so just

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.789 
mess up your aim quite a bit so just
make<00:01:06.869> sure<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.049> when<00:01:07.200> you're<00:01:07.439> playing<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
make sure that when you're playing you

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.380 
make sure that when you're playing you
feel<00:01:08.100> comfortable<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.150> really

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
feel comfortable and it's not really

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.210 
feel comfortable and it's not really
right<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.689> say<00:01:09.840> any<00:01:10.049> sensitivity<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.950> better

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
right to say any sensitivity is better

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.859 
right to say any sensitivity is better
than<00:01:11.400> another<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:12.119> I've<00:01:12.210> had<00:01:12.360> friends<00:01:12.630> in

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
than another because I've had friends in

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.870 
than another because I've had friends in
MLG<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.710> played<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.040> four<00:01:14.310> or<00:01:14.430> five<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
MLG that have played on four or five and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.370 
MLG that have played on four or five and
then<00:01:15.060> I've<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.299> others<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.930> played<00:01:16.170> on

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
then I've out others that have played on

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
then I've out others that have played on
max<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.159> sure<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> test<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> bunch<00:01:18.210> of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
max so be sure to test out a bunch of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.969 
max so be sure to test out a bunch of
different<00:01:18.479> sensitivities<00:01:19.320> even<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.860> have

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
different sensitivities even if you have

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.440 
different sensitivities even if you have
to<00:01:20.100> switch<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.670> bunch<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.970> times<00:01:21.210> but

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
to switch it up a bunch of times but

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.090 
to switch it up a bunch of times but
moving<00:01:21.780> right<00:01:21.900> along<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.409> next<00:01:22.680> step<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.920> have

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
moving right along the next step I have

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
play the targeting range bots are a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.510 
play the targeting range bots are a
really<00:01:28.350> good<00:01:28.500> tool<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.829> improve<00:01:29.220> your

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
really good tool to improve your

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.219 
really good tool to improve your
accuracy<00:01:29.790> because<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.570> control<00:01:30.960> how

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
accuracy because you can control how

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.690 
accuracy because you can control how
that<00:01:31.470> they<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:31.740> based<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.369> skill<00:01:32.670> level

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
that they are based on your skill level

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520 
that they are based on your skill level
and<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.630> terrible<00:01:34.049> aim<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.380> can

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and so if you have terrible aim you can

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.350 
and so if you have terrible aim you can
set<00:01:34.740> them<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.950> recruit<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.000> you're<00:01:36.119> good

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
set them to recruit or if you're good

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.640 
set them to recruit or if you're good
but<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.689> want<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> go<00:01:37.020> for<00:01:37.200> something<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
but you want to go for something like a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.380 
but you want to go for something like a
hundred<00:01:37.860> percent<00:01:38.130> accuracy<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.150> may<00:01:39.329> be

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
hundred percent accuracy you may be

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.660 
hundred percent accuracy you may be
interested<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.140> playing<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.619> veteran<00:01:40.920> pots<00:01:41.340> so

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
gaming headset you're going to be at a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.510 
gaming headset you're going to be at a
significant<00:02:37.560> advantage<00:02:37.800> because<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.370> can

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
significant advantage because you can

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.040 
significant advantage because you can
actually<00:02:38.550> hear<00:02:38.940> footsteps<00:02:39.240> so<00:02:39.690> if<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.900> can
