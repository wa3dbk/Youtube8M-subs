00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
sense so that right there might be an

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.620 
sense so that right there might be an
indication<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:24.070> how<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.370> know<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.150> demons

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
indication of how you know the demons

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.090 
indication of how you know the demons
that<00:02:25.720> are<00:02:25.900> inside<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.470> curse<00:02:26.650> gear<00:02:26.920> and

that are inside the curse gear and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.500 
that are inside the curse gear and
everything<00:02:27.160> are<00:02:27.490> formed<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.090> know<00:02:28.180> one

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
everything are formed like I know one

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.820 
everything are formed like I know one
way<00:02:28.540> for<00:02:28.720> something<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.230> know<00:02:29.350> demons<00:02:29.710> to

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
way for something you know demons to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.860 
way for something you know demons to
form<00:02:30.070> is<00:02:30.220> for<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.850> human<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.240> be<00:02:31.360> possessed<00:02:31.720> by

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
form is for the human to be possessed by

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.840 
form is for the human to be possessed by
the<00:02:31.990> curse<00:02:32.230> gear<00:02:32.530> but<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.100> seems<00:02:33.280> like<00:02:33.460> one<00:02:33.820> of

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
the curse gear but it seems like one of

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.730 
the curse gear but it seems like one of
the<00:02:34.000> main<00:02:34.180> methods<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.720> demons<00:02:35.140> being<00:02:35.410> formed

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
the main methods of demons being formed

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.160 
the main methods of demons being formed
as<00:02:35.830> vampires<00:02:36.340> who<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.000> know<00:02:37.150> refuse<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:38.020> drink

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
as vampires who you know refuse to drink

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.110 
as vampires who you know refuse to drink
blood<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.710> I'm<00:02:39.040> curious<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.580> see<00:02:39.730> if<00:02:39.850> that's

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
blood so I'm curious to see if that's

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.630 
blood so I'm curious to see if that's
actually<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.870> case<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.320> if<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.250> might<00:02:42.460> have

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
actually the case and if that might have

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.430 
actually the case and if that might have
implications<00:02:43.270> which<00:02:43.570> no<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.780> sister<00:02:44.200> because
