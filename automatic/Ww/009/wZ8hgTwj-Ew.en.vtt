00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
today I have the review of the 5-11 tdu

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.690 
today I have the review of the 5-11 tdu
double<00:00:06.450> duty<00:00:06.810> belt<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.340> one<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.610> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
double duty belt this is the one and a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.480 
double duty belt this is the one and a
half<00:00:08.880> inch<00:00:09.590> the<00:00:10.590> difference<00:00:10.980> between<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
half inch the difference between the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.060 
half inch the difference between the
double<00:00:12.150> duty<00:00:12.450> tdu<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.290> normal<00:00:13.650> belt<00:00:13.889> is

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
double duty tdu and the normal belt is

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.369 
double duty tdu and the normal belt is
that<00:00:14.490> basically<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.269> just<00:00:15.299> get<00:00:15.660> two<00:00:15.870> colors

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
that basically you just get two colors

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.250 
that basically you just get two colors
and<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.039> believe<00:00:17.400> all<00:00:17.880> they<00:00:18.150> do<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.449> take<00:00:18.630> 2td

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and I believe all they do is take 2td

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.769 
and I believe all they do is take 2td
use<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.680> sew<00:00:19.830> them<00:00:19.980> together<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.550> if<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.359> does

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
use and sew them together so if it does

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.290 
use and sew them together so if it does
appear<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> thicker<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.310> gives<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.000> more

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
appear to be a thicker and gives it more

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.980 
appear to be a thicker and gives it more
rigidity<00:00:25.310> I've<00:00:26.310> had<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.789> belt<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.269> about<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.150 
rigidity I've had this belt for about a
month<00:00:28.260> now<00:00:28.410> because<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> replace<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.300> my

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
month now because I replace just my

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.430 
month now because I replace just my
normal<00:00:32.160> leather<00:00:33.120> belt<00:00:33.480> which<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.870> was<00:00:34.050> using<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
normal leather belt which I was using to

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.030 
normal leather belt which I was using to
carry<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.770> it's

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
carry as you can see it's it's just it's

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.250 
carry as you can see it's it's just it's
become<00:00:38.430> too<00:00:38.700> broken<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.719> lose<00:00:40.020> it

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
become too broken in and to lose it

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.170 
become too broken in and to lose it
can't<00:00:40.500> support<00:00:40.890> any<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> weight<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.969> gun
