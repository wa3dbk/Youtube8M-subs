00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.350
 One 38-year-old woman 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.110
 with which I am currently working as a therapist had voices 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.240
 who ordered her to kill her. 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.349
 We had several sessions behind us 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.180
 and once - she lived with her parents - she wanted me to 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.310
 he also met her mother, who demanded it 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.340
 to come because she had a few things she wanted to tell me. 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.730
 So I told my patient that I would meet her mother 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.250
 and I spend half my time on her session and the other half entertain it. 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.879
 Mother came and it was 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.229
 one of the most nasty and horrible women 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.940
 I've ever seen. I was in control. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.850
 I kept calm. I had fun together. 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.960
 I was kind and polite, 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.589
 and when her half ended, I drove her out. 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.519
 I thanked her for her visit. And then I devoted myself to my patient. 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.720
 I said to her, "Listen, I have to tell you something. 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.540
 Several times in the presence of your mother I felt the taste 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.130
 catch her under the throat 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.340
 and press until her eyes pop out of her sockets. "At that moment, my patient looked at me in fright. 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.450
 and she said, "God! 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.540
 I know what the voice is! It's my own voice 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.750
 commanding me to kill my mother! "I looked at her and said: 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.289
 "I understand." 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.590
 And then it happened, 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.570
 that her voicing voices had vanished. I didn't plan it. 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.780
 I didn't understand them before I said it, but then I understood 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.229
 what is the essence of her prescribing votes. 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.410
 Once it was out, it was clear. 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.229
 My patient felt 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.390
 terrible murderous thoughts toward her mother 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.910
 and she wasn't able to admit it. 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.090
 So she projected them outside 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.530
 and these thoughts became the voice that told her what to do. 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.239
 So she wasn't responsible for that. 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.540
 She has no votes for about a year, and more 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.420
 does not take any medication. Before she came to me 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.070
 she took three different kinds of drugs. 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.290
 She read a lot about them and didn't really want to take them, 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.690
 but every time she tried to drop them, she ended up in the hospital. 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.280
 After this session gradually 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.820
 within six months she was dropping her medication, 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.060
 several times she felt the return of symptoms and the attending physician 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.269
 a little dose increased 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.709
 he left it for a moment, then lowered it carefully. 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.530
 And now he's free of drugs and no hallucinations 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.110
 and works! 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.520
 Was her initial diagnosis of schizophrenia? Yes, she had this 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.460
 diagnosis since childhood. 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.320
 And could it still be classified under this diagnosis? 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.320
 Not exactly. Not exactly. 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:37.550
 What would you say is this story universally valid? 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.830
 If you took everyone 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.070
 diagnosed with schizophrenia and allowed it 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.750
 explore and look at those symptoms or problems he has 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.060
 and what they come from 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.790
 and understand their basis, they would dissolve. 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.070
 Those symptoms would gradually 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.070
 retreated. However, remember that I was very lucky with this patient. 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.080
 I had no idea what would happen. I just told her 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.350
 the truth about what I felt. 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.829
 But I had the opportunity to accept my feelings and she was never allowed to. 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.510
 And when I told her, I gave her the chance to feel it too. 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.580
 And she did. And when she did, 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.610
 she no longer needed the symptoms. Have this way 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.850
 she didn't need to defend herself.
