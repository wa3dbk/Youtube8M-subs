00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
so much growth ah the price is a little

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.870 
so much growth ah the price is a little
steep<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.950> think<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.280> save<00:02:02.460> up<00:02:02.610> for<00:02:02.790> like

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
steep but I think if I save up for like

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.880 
steep but I think if I save up for like
80<00:02:03.090> years<00:02:03.509> i<00:02:03.600> think<00:02:03.840> i<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:03.990> swing<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
80 years i think i can swing it and the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.440 
80 years i think i can swing it and the
six<00:02:05.100> months<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.399> training<00:02:05.549> will<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.090> fun<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
six months of training will be fun I
