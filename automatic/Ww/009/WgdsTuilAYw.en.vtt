00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.229
 teaspoon of salt because we are going to do 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.479
 this is good because then we are going to give it 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.010
 flavor to our portovelo we are going to 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.440
 remove the leg is 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.680
 to penetrate well what we are going to 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.680
 put 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.000
 and now we are in cleaning with a 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.490
 kitchen paper 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.810
 anagrams are never washed on 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.110

 we clean them up let's give as a 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.600
 little bit so that it penetrates 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.150
 that we are going to put him not so much because 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.630
 we can break well they are very very 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.630
 fragile 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.420
 already having this with the mixture that 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.450
 we did we took a shake 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.489

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.430
 varnish the shoulders I'm beating a 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.700
 little bit more than the account because as 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.220
 It has sea salt and it has olive oil 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.770

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.870
 this preparation you did for two 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.770
 buttons overflow degrees for all that if

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.190
 the oil 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.810
 how much time do we leave every two minutes 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.810
 so that they teach a little 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.870
 also from the other side 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.560
 I'm going to learn is to eat because here 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.250
 let's heat the bread to make the 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.250
 burgers 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.640
 but 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.640
 two 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.920

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:47.239
 I'm not going to put the bread here that goes 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.239
