jacking<00:01:28.920> mids<00:01:29.100> usually<00:01:29.970> are<00:01:30.180> high<00:01:30.720> rated<00:01:31.229> if

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
they are passing as well because he's

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.510 
they are passing as well because he's
mainly<00:01:33.509> played<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> striker<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.470> he<00:01:35.159> doesn't<00:01:35.460> a

mainly played a striker and he doesn't a
particular<00:01:35.790> passing<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.930> means<00:01:37.170> he

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
particular passing so that means he

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
attacking mid as his passing it's a lot

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.410

a silver as a center attacking me a lot

a silver as a center attacking me a lot
of<00:01:49.680> people<00:01:49.890> would<00:01:50.009> play<00:01:50.250> him<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> striker<00:01:50.970> so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.530 
hoilett for QPR he's been playing okay I
don't<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.369> he's<00:01:56.640> had<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.149> much<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.479> an

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
don't think he's had that much of an

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.999 
don't think he's had that much of an
impact<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> championship<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.710> much<00:01:58.860> an

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
when he was a Blackburn he did look a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.670 
when he was a Blackburn he did look a
really<00:02:02.610> really<00:02:02.759> nice<00:02:02.939> player<00:02:03.270> has<00:02:03.750> been<00:02:03.780> 77

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
really really nice player has been 77

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.350 
really really nice player has been 77
rated<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.280> has<00:02:05.490> me<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:05.939> he's<00:02:06.180> been<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
rated and has me I think he's been a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.359 
rated and has me I think he's been a
goal<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.810> quite<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> few<00:02:07.079> seasons<00:02:07.350> now<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.220> in

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
goal to quite a few seasons now but in

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.710 
goal to quite a few seasons now but in
my<00:02:08.489> opinion<00:02:08.610> he<00:02:08.879> hasn't<00:02:09.119> been<00:02:09.179> playing<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.539> work

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
my opinion he hasn't been playing a work

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.600 
my opinion he hasn't been playing a work
well<00:02:09.959> enough<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.289> play<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> stairs<00:02:10.770> ago<00:02:11.009> so

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
well enough to play the stairs ago so

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.830 
well enough to play the stairs ago so
it's<00:02:11.790> pretty<00:02:11.910> likely<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.540> could<00:02:12.720> be

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
it's pretty likely that you could be

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.640 
it's pretty likely that you could be
changed<00:02:13.140> into<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.349> seal

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
changed into a seal

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.589 
changed into a seal
and<00:02:13.799> it<00:02:13.920> would<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.129> incredibly<00:02:14.670> no<00:02:14.760> silver<00:02:15.150> it

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
and it would be incredibly no silver it

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.600 
and it would be incredibly no silver it
would<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.810> quite<00:02:15.989> comparable<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.950> Royce<00:02:17.400> and

sharp<00:03:34.980> for<00:03:35.459> Basel<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.239> one<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.599> them<00:03:36.720> as<00:03:36.810> well<00:03:36.989> a

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
sharp for Basel is one of them as well a

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.680 
sharp for Basel is one of them as well a
Swiss<00:03:37.980> centre-back<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.790> he's<00:03:39.090> likely<00:03:39.659> to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
Swiss centre-back and he's likely to

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.629

play really well from this year and

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.170 
play really well from this year and
likelihood<00:03:44.159> is<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.790> probably<00:03:45.000> have

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
likelihood is that you probably have

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.879 
likelihood is that you probably have
similar<00:03:45.419> start<00:03:45.659> to<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:45.900> based<00:03:46.199> on<00:03:46.409> so<00:03:46.620> fever

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
similar start to this based on so fever

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.949 
similar start to this based on so fever
we<00:03:47.340> have<00:03:47.519> about<00:03:47.609> seventy<00:03:48.180> eight<00:03:48.299> pace<00:03:48.540> with

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
we have about seventy eight pace with

we have about seventy eight pace with
really<00:03:49.409> good<00:03:49.560> defense<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:49.949> heading<00:03:50.220> as<00:03:50.340> well

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
really good defense and heading as well

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.659 
really good defense and heading as well
probably<00:03:50.970> upgraded<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.479> a<00:03:51.510> 74<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.340> next

classic sweaty gold Brazilian striker

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.950 
classic sweaty gold Brazilian striker
hasn't<00:04:41.669> been<00:04:41.760> playing<00:04:42.000> as<00:04:42.150> well<00:04:42.360> recently<00:04:42.750> and

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
hasn't been playing as well recently and

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.300 
hasn't been playing as well recently and
I<00:04:43.080> think<00:04:43.290> in<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.530> last<00:04:43.650> few<00:04:43.860> years<00:04:43.950> he's<00:04:44.190> been

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
I think in the last few years he's been

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.010 
I think in the last few years he's been
going<00:04:44.550> on<00:04:44.639> a<00:04:44.700> on<00:04:44.970> loan<00:04:45.270> quite<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.600> few<00:04:45.810> times

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
going on a on loan quite a few times

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.659 
going on a on loan quite a few times
think<00:04:46.560> he<00:04:46.650> currently<00:04:46.830> plays<00:04:47.040> with<00:04:47.280> Spartak

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
think he currently plays with Spartak

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.100 
think he currently plays with Spartak
Moscow<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:48.150> he's<00:04:48.270> gone<00:04:48.450> on<00:04:48.570> loan<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:48.930> quite<00:04:49.080> a

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
Moscow but he's gone on loan to quite a

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.840 
Moscow but he's gone on loan to quite a
few<00:04:49.169> teams<00:04:49.500> gone<00:04:49.740> alone<00:04:49.980> back<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.340> Brazil<00:04:50.639> and

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
few teams gone alone back to Brazil and

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.210 
few teams gone alone back to Brazil and
recent<00:04:51.480> he's<00:04:51.600> gone<00:04:51.780> alone<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.260> Celta<00:04:52.710> Vigo<00:04:52.830> in

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
recent he's gone alone to Celta Vigo in

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.850 
recent he's gone alone to Celta Vigo in
Liga<00:04:53.520> BBVA<00:04:53.550> it's<00:04:54.540> possible<00:04:55.080> that<00:04:55.230> he<00:04:55.410> may<00:04:55.620> end

silly it could be one of the best brazil
silver<00:05:12.300> strikers<00:05:12.570> in<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.840> game<00:05:13.020> next<00:05:13.260> year<00:05:13.410> he

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
silver strikers in the game next year he

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.520 
silver strikers in the game next year he
should<00:05:14.430> probably<00:05:14.610> have<00:05:14.910> about<00:05:14.970> 85<00:05:15.630> page<00:05:15.900> 72<00:05:16.380> to

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
should probably have about 85 page 72 to

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.379 
should probably have about 85 page 72 to
a<00:05:16.560> blink<00:05:16.740> 72<00:05:17.160> shooting<00:05:17.610> as<00:05:17.790> well<00:05:18.210> as<00:05:18.300> the

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
a blink 72 shooting as well as the

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.150 
a blink 72 shooting as well as the
four-star<00:05:18.870> skills<00:05:19.139> and<00:05:19.440> four-star<00:05:19.830> weak<00:05:19.979> foot

four-star skills and four-star weak foot

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.800 
four-star skills and four-star weak foot
so<00:05:20.310> he<00:05:20.340> does<00:05:20.580> get<00:05:20.729> made<00:05:20.910> into<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.150> silver<00:05:21.450> I'm

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
so he does get made into a silver I'm

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.810 
so he does get made into a silver I'm
expecting<00:05:22.320> him<00:05:22.470> to<00:05:22.500> be<00:05:22.650> probably<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.340> best
