is it's a very explorative and
instrument<00:00:30.170> experimental<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:32.090> basically

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
instrument experimental so basically

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.770 
instrument experimental so basically
what<00:00:33.390> one<00:00:34.130> there's<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.460> couple<00:00:36.060> of<00:00:36.210> ways<00:00:36.390> but

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
what one there's a couple of ways but

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.290 
what one there's a couple of ways but
one<00:00:37.079> way<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:38.130> hear<00:00:38.430> what's<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.880> your<00:00:39.090> head

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
one way is you hear what's in your head

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.389 
one way is you hear what's in your head
and<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.720> try<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.930> duplicate<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
and you try to duplicate that on the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.600 
and you try to duplicate that on the
keyboard<00:00:41.899> which<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> longer<00:00:43.530> process<00:00:43.680> but

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
keyboard which is a longer process but

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.299 
keyboard which is a longer process but
if<00:00:44.970> you<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.899> studied<00:00:46.320> your<00:00:46.470> harmonies<00:00:47.010> then

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
if you have studied your harmonies then

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.940 
if you have studied your harmonies then
you<00:00:47.969> will<00:00:48.120> know<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:49.829> you're

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you will know how to do it but if you're

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.200 
you will know how to do it but if you're
just<00:00:50.100> sitting<00:00:50.309> down<00:00:50.579> you're<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:51.030> familiar

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
just sitting down you're not familiar

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.299 
just sitting down you're not familiar
with<00:00:51.570> those<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.559> experiment<00:00:53.250> with

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
with those you just experiment with

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.220 
with those you just experiment with
chords<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.629> do<00:00:58.370> just<00:00:59.370> go

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
chords just you know you do just go

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.279 
chords just you know you do just go
let's<00:01:01.230> try<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> find<00:01:02.420> find<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.719> chord<00:01:04.079> that

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:04.289 
let's try to find find one chord that

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.100 
let's try to find find one chord that
you<00:01:04.469> like<00:01:04.649> let's<00:01:05.009> say<00:01:05.219> we<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.149> this<00:01:06.810> chord

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you like let's say we like this chord

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.680 
you like let's say we like this chord
here

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:17.370 

so<00:01:10.690> once<00:01:11.080> you<00:01:11.200> have<00:01:11.320> one<00:01:11.590> quart<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:16.380> find

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
so once you have one quart then find

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:26.389 
so once you have one quart then find
another<00:01:17.680> card<00:01:18.070> that<00:01:18.340> works<00:01:18.580> with<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:18.970> one

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.609 

okay<00:01:27.399> so<00:01:27.460> I<00:01:28.060> have<00:01:28.479> three<00:01:28.509> chords<00:01:29.170> here<00:01:29.350> let<00:01:29.590> me

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
okay so I have three chords here let me

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:37.469 
okay so I have three chords here let me
start<00:01:29.829> it<00:01:29.920> sit<00:01:30.070> for<00:01:34.979> four<00:01:35.979> well<00:01:36.700> let's<00:01:37.329> say

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
start it sit for four well let's say

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.929 
start it sit for four well let's say
think<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:38.110> going<00:01:38.560> up<00:01:38.920> going<00:01:39.159> down<00:01:39.369> going

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
think of going up going down going

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.609 
think of going up going down going
sideways<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:41.259> was<00:01:41.439> going<00:01:41.770> up<00:01:41.950> right<00:01:43.619> let's

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
sideways that was going up right let's

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.210 
sideways that was going up right let's
go<00:01:44.770> down

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
go down

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.700 
go down
and<00:01:46.730> major/minor

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.010 

okay<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:51.799> that's<00:01:52.189> that's<00:01:52.460> going<00:01:52.789> down<00:01:53.020> so

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
okay so that's that's going down so

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.139 
okay so that's that's going down so
let's<00:01:54.890> see<00:01:55.100> if<00:01:55.189> we<00:01:55.250> can<00:01:55.460> make<00:01:55.640> something<00:01:55.909> else

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
let's see if we can make something else

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.560 
let's see if we can make something else
go<00:01:56.530> jump<00:01:57.530> around

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:10.919 

you

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.989 

you
