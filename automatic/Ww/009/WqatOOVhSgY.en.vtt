00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.390
 We are in the park of Bolivar in the center of Medellin 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.439
 the metropolitan basilica is located and although this place transits 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.470
 daily 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 thousands of very few people know that imposing construction hides one of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.330
 the greatest treasures of religious art of the 17th century 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.700
 you have as a beginning if the creation of the diocese in Medellin 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.990
 then in the decree yes ordered to the construction of a cathedral the bishop 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.850
 from that time he determined 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.710
 if it were a large building 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.710
 that started two years ago 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.130
 I always listen 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.310
 it was still brought petit aliano felipe crosby 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.160
 but the fan and it did not turn out 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.740
 with the capabilities that were expected 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620
 they suspended the works 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.620
 and it would restart again in 1889 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.550
 with him to pay the address of the amount to touch them carrick 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.250
 the contest 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250
 the brick kilns 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.310
 and if they are chaining 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.760
 to different sectors hence the bricks have 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.130
 honors that correspond 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.130
 to the different lands of the city 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.090
 stark is like if I had contributed 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.850
 every day but the team 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.830
 to be able to achieve this unique building 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.990
 reconstruction that we say that I 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.520
 40 and 50 years 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 very delicate downfall of work nor does it consist 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.340
 what nobody knows is that the basilica hides a collection of religious art 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.050
 17th century 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.210
 nobody has had access today 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.020
 we are in this 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.430

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:23.209
 open to the public 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.209

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.550
 the metropolitan basilica of Medellin could keep this great
