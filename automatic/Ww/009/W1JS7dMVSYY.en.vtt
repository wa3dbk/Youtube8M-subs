00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.460
 Rector at the University of Buenos Aires 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.240
 and those who choose them from the elect

 called organs of co - government 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.080
 to the dean the board of directors which is the 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.550
 maximum organ that governs each faculty 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.720
 It is composed of four students 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.340
 four graduates and eight teachers this 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.529
 regulation to the general questions of 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.470
 the life of each academic unit and each 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.300
 four years chooses dean 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.190
 the election of the rector of the university 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.309
 of Buenos Aires is a little more complex 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.870
 and still less democratic let's start 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.940
 saying that the regular organ of 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 The government of the grape is presided by the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.269
 rector is the superior council this is 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.420
 composed of five graduates five 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.839
 students and 18 teachers 13 of the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.760
 which are the deans of each faculty 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:58.010
 this top advice plus the tips 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.800
 directors of each faculty meet 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.170
 every four years in a bad call 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.049
 university assembly this is commissioned 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.850
 to choose the rector and other things so 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.340
 important how to create or delete 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.240
 powers and even modify the statute 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.460
 uba of the problem is that if they make the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.520
 university government account 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.939
 is far from the democratic being the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.560
 students are underrepresented 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.710
 five senior counselors must 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.780
 represent 360,000 students the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.920
 non-teaching workers do not have 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.200
 representation 0 name nothing the cloister 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.340
 of teachers excludes the immense 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.320
 most of the teachers 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.850
 a little over 800 lucky 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.399
 teachers have the right to choose 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.609
 counselors the immense rest that follow 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.609
 participating 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.649
 what is it for us and us? 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.990
 democratize the uba is to establish the 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.060
 single teaching cloister because all and 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.100
 they all share the same task that is 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.100
 the one to teach is to establish the increase 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.750
 of student representation being 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.159
 the majority of the academic community today 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.340
 we are a minority in government 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.810
 is to create a voice and vote for non-teachers 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.440
 who work day by day at the university 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.970
 but they are not part of the decisions 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.799
 democratizing is also demanding more 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.319
 budget for education have 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.090
 access and stay policies 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.799
 eliminate precarious work in the UBA and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.989
 defend our university autonomy 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.410
 but we do not want an island university 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.780
 we want a massive university 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.150
 democratic and popular neither hallyu nor 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.150
