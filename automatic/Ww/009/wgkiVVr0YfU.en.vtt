installed a spike air cleaner and the
pipes<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.349> it<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.400> he<00:00:23.490> brought<00:00:23.669> to<00:00:23.849> us<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.150> get

pipes on it so he brought to us to get

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.419 
pipes on it so he brought to us to get
some<00:00:24.509> jetting<00:00:24.810> done<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.289> some<00:00:25.949> carburetor

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
some jetting done and some carburetor

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.359 
some jetting done and some carburetor
tuning<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:27.689> threw<00:00:27.960> cold<00:00:28.199> Jets<00:00:28.410> at<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.800> made<00:00:29.339> a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
tuning we threw cold Jets at it made a

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.790 
tuning we threw cold Jets at it made a
couple<00:00:29.490> dire<00:00:29.789> runs<00:00:30.089> with<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.659> did<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
couple dire runs with it and did the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.100 
couple dire runs with it and did the
exhaust<00:00:32.430> gas<00:00:32.700> analyzation<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.810> it<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
exhaust gas analyzation on it and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.990 
exhaust gas analyzation on it and
figured<00:00:35.010> out<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> wasn't<00:00:35.790> really

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
figured out that it wasn't really

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.600 
figured out that it wasn't really
exactly<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.990> we<00:00:37.140> adjusted<00:00:37.560> it<00:00:37.740> Verena<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
exactly right so we adjusted it Verena a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.790 
exactly right so we adjusted it Verena a
dyno<00:00:38.880> again<00:00:39.330> and<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.810> spike<00:00:40.230> air<00:00:40.530> cleaner

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
dyno again and with a spike air cleaner

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
dyno again and with a spike air cleaner
and<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.310> band<00:00:41.550> son's<00:00:41.760> exhaust<00:00:42.330> we<00:00:42.600> got<00:00:42.750> 103

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
and the band son's exhaust we got 103

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.610 
and the band son's exhaust we got 103
horsepower<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.040> 117<00:00:44.760> foot-pounds<00:00:45.150> of<00:00:45.210> torque

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620

the<00:00:46.620> customer<00:00:46.980> noticed<00:00:47.310> the<00:00:47.460> SNS<00:00:47.910> duel<00:00:48.120> runner

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the customer noticed the SNS duel runner

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.570 
the customer noticed the SNS duel runner
intake<00:00:49.290> in<00:00:49.470> our<00:00:49.560> shop<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.040> was<00:00:50.160> wondering<00:00:50.490> how

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
intake in our shop and was wondering how

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.520 
intake in our shop and was wondering how
much<00:00:50.730> power<00:00:51.000> he<00:00:51.420> would<00:00:51.750> gain<00:00:51.930> from<00:00:51.960> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
much power he would gain from it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.200 
much power he would gain from it
so<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.100> answer<00:00:53.220> that<00:00:53.400> question<00:00:53.580> we<00:00:53.910> actually

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
so to answer that question we actually

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.250 
so to answer that question we actually
installed<00:00:54.600> these<00:00:55.490> SS<00:00:56.490> duel<00:00:56.850> runner<00:00:57.060> onto<00:00:57.630> his

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
installed these SS duel runner onto his

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.390 
installed these SS duel runner onto his
bike<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:58.710> we're<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.950> run<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
bike and we're going to run out in the

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.920 
bike and we're going to run out in the
dyno<00:00:59.610> and<00:00:59.970> see<00:01:00.060> what<00:01:00.600> kind<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> power

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
dyno and see what kind of power

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.680 
dyno and see what kind of power
differences<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.980> gain<00:01:02.220> with<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.970> SN<00:01:03.480> store

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
differences we gain with the SN store

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:46.260 
differences we gain with the SN store
owner<00:01:03.870> compared<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> spike

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.090 

all<00:01:47.270> right<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.180> max<00:01:50.450> run<00:01:50.780> with<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.410> SNS

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
all right so the max run with the SNS

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.270 
all right so the max run with the SNS
duel<00:01:52.280> runner<00:01:52.490> was<00:01:52.790> 106<00:01:53.420> horsepower<00:01:54.100> 120<00:01:55.100> foot

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
duel runner was 106 horsepower 120 foot

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.580 
duel runner was 106 horsepower 120 foot
on<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.550> torque<00:01:55.820> now<00:01:56.510> previously<00:01:57.380> with<00:01:57.560> the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
spike on there that feat run was 103

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.040 
spike on there that feat run was 103
horsepower<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.580> 117<00:02:01.580> found<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.000> torque<00:02:02.240> so

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
horsepower and 117 found the torque so

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.780 
horsepower and 117 found the torque so
about<00:02:03.380> three<00:02:03.620> horsepower<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.190> three<00:02:04.400> foot

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
about three horsepower and three foot

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.310 
about three horsepower and three foot
pounds<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:05.060> torque<00:02:05.150> that's<00:02:05.480> a<00:02:05.570> pretty<00:02:05.750> pretty

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320
