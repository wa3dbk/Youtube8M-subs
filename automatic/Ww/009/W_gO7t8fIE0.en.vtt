top of there and i'm probably gonna net

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.330 
top of there and i'm probably gonna net
flix<00:04:14.510> for<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.810> little<00:04:14.960> bit<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.380> then<00:04:15.620> do<00:04:16.100> some

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340

protein<00:04:25.730> shake<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.300> use<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.410> plant<00:04:27.680> head

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
protein shake I use the plant head

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.980 
protein shake I use the plant head
protein<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.790> I<00:04:28.940> don't<00:04:29.180> like<00:04:29.419> this<00:04:29.660> very<00:04:29.840> much

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
protein and I don't like this very much

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.510 
protein and I don't like this very much
honestly<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:30.770> I'm<00:04:30.890> just<00:04:31.070> trying<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.340> finish

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
honestly and I'm just trying to finish

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.210 
honestly and I'm just trying to finish
it<00:04:31.820> so<00:04:32.480> i<00:04:32.510> can<00:04:32.750> try<00:04:32.930> something<00:04:33.290> else<00:04:33.440> but<00:04:34.160> i

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
it so i can try something else but i

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.830 
it so i can try something else but i
suppose<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.940> macros<00:04:35.330> in<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.540> back<00:04:35.660> are

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
suppose the macros in the back are

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.650 
suppose the macros in the back are
pretty<00:04:35.990> good<00:04:36.200> it<00:04:36.380> has<00:04:36.650> two<00:04:37.040> grams<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.460> fat<00:04:37.700> 15

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
pretty good it has two grams of fat 15

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.070 
pretty good it has two grams of fat 15
grams<00:04:38.840> of<00:04:39.020> protein<00:04:39.230> as<00:04:39.770> 5<00:04:40.580> grams<00:04:41.120> of<00:04:41.360> carbs<00:04:41.840> and

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
grams of protein as 5 grams of carbs and

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.530 
grams of protein as 5 grams of carbs and
the<00:04:42.620> way<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:42.770> make<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.310> is<00:04:43.700> i<00:04:43.880> just<00:04:43.910> use<00:04:44.300> like<00:04:44.390> one

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
the way I make it is i just use like one

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.920 
the way I make it is i just use like one
cup<00:04:45.050> of<00:04:45.260> almond<00:04:46.040> milk<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.490> then<00:04:47.090> one<00:04:47.480> full

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
cup of almond milk and then one full

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.010 
cup of almond milk and then one full
banana<00:04:48.169> for<00:04:49.100> more<00:04:49.430> carbs<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.060> that's<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:50.870> it's

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
banana for more carbs and that's it it's

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.290 
banana for more carbs and that's it it's
really<00:04:51.770> thick<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.400> I<00:04:52.460> don't<00:04:52.700> like<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.000> flavor

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
really thick and I don't like the flavor

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.460 
really thick and I don't like the flavor
at<00:04:53.480> all<00:04:53.770> but<00:04:54.770> i<00:04:55.100> guess<00:04:55.940> i<00:04:56.180> don't<00:04:56.300> know<00:04:56.480> i<00:04:56.720> need

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
at all but i guess i don't know i need

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.110 
at all but i guess i don't know i need
the<00:04:57.590> extra<00:04:57.860> protein<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.550> carbs<00:04:58.940> and

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
the extra protein and the carbs and

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.180 
the extra protein and the carbs and
there's<00:04:59.630> a<00:04:59.720> really<00:04:59.930> quick<00:05:00.230> way<00:05:00.290> of<00:05:00.530> getting<00:05:01.100> an

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
there's a really quick way of getting an

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.850 
there's a really quick way of getting an
end<00:05:01.340> because<00:05:01.490> I<00:05:01.970> get<00:05:02.150> really<00:05:02.419> full<00:05:02.900> so<00:05:03.500> fast

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
end because I get really full so fast

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.850 
end because I get really full so fast
nowadays<00:05:04.190> so<00:05:05.180> this<00:05:06.140> is<00:05:06.230> just<00:05:06.350> a<00:05:06.500> really<00:05:06.740> quick

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
nowadays so this is just a really quick

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.700 
nowadays so this is just a really quick
way<00:05:06.980> to<00:05:07.520> get<00:05:08.419> it<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:08.720> without<00:05:08.900> having<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.530> chew

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
way to get it and without having to chew

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.220 
way to get it and without having to chew
anything<00:05:10.010> you<00:05:10.760> know<00:05:11.030> what<00:05:11.210> I<00:05:11.240> mean<00:05:11.450> I<00:05:11.690> feel

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
anything you know what I mean I feel

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.840 
anything you know what I mean I feel
like<00:05:12.290> such<00:05:12.590> a<00:05:12.620> child<00:05:12.770> of<00:05:13.280> its<00:05:13.370> own<00:05:13.520> drinking

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
like such a child of its own drinking

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.850 
like such a child of its own drinking
this<00:05:14.000> because<00:05:14.240> I<00:05:14.300> literally<00:05:14.600> try<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:14.930> drink<00:05:15.710> it

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
this because I literally try to drink it

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.420 
this because I literally try to drink it
like<00:05:16.010> medicine

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
like medicine

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.120 
like medicine
and<00:05:17.780> it's<00:05:18.780> really<00:05:18.840> hard<00:05:19.290> because<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.860> make<00:05:20.040> it

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
and it's really hard because I make it

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.680 
and it's really hard because I make it
so<00:05:20.310> thick<00:05:20.580> maybe<00:05:20.850> I<00:05:20.880> should<00:05:21.090> just<00:05:21.120> add<00:05:21.420> water

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
so thick maybe I should just add water

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.930 
so thick maybe I should just add water
to<00:05:22.020> learn<00:05:22.170> something<00:05:22.560> too<00:05:23.160> thin<00:05:23.430> it<00:05:23.580> out<00:05:23.700> but<00:05:23.880> I

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
to learn something too thin it out but I

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.630 
to learn something too thin it out but I
feel<00:05:24.090> like<00:05:24.180> I<00:05:24.240> have<00:05:24.480> more<00:05:24.750> things<00:05:25.230> to<00:05:25.580> try<00:05:26.580> to
