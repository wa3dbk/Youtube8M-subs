another<00:02:10.450> big<00:02:10.630> change<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.500> form<00:02:11.980> factor<00:02:12.250> it

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
another big change is the form factor it

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.309 
another big change is the form factor it
is<00:02:12.760> much<00:02:13.060> thinner<00:02:13.390> than<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.750> older<00:02:13.990> versions

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
is much thinner than the older versions

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.410 
is much thinner than the older versions
and<00:02:14.530> they<00:02:15.069> have<00:02:15.160> made<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.610> back<00:02:15.790> flat<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.330> you

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
and they have made the back flat so you

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.670 
and they have made the back flat so you
can<00:02:16.569> set<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:16.990> flat<00:02:17.230> surface<00:02:17.260> and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
can set it on a flat surface and

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.170 
can set it on a flat surface and
actually<00:02:17.980> type<00:02:18.220> on<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.550> screen<00:02:18.850> which<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.150> a

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
great improvement in my opinion also the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.449 
great improvement in my opinion also the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.030 
entirely sure what the point of moving
it<00:02:28.330> was<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.110> now<00:02:29.290> coordinates<00:02:29.860> with<00:02:30.010> the
