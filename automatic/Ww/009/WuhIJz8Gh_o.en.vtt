00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
injuries and he was kind of wincing a

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.150 
injuries and he was kind of wincing a
little<00:00:43.899> bit<00:00:43.989> at<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.109> fact<00:00:44.379> of<00:00:44.590> you<00:00:44.890> know<00:00:44.980> when

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
little bit at the fact of you know when

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.700 
little bit at the fact of you know when
the<00:00:45.250> swung<00:00:45.760> for<00:00:46.239> something<00:00:46.570> quick<00:00:46.870> is<00:00:47.170> they

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
the swung for something quick is they

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.220 
the swung for something quick is they
just<00:00:47.829> took<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:48.190> fencing<00:00:48.609> mask<00:00:48.820> cut<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:49.840> couple<00:00:50.019> of

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
just took a fencing mask cut a couple of

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.439 
just took a fencing mask cut a couple of
eye<00:00:50.350> holes<00:00:50.620> in<00:00:50.800> it<00:00:50.949> and<00:00:51.309> then<00:00:51.879> gave<00:00:52.059> it<00:00:52.090> to<00:00:52.300> him

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
eye holes in it and then gave it to him

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.360 
eye holes in it and then gave it to him
what<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.870> visualization<00:00:53.530> wasn't<00:00:53.859> quite<00:00:54.340> good

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
what the visualization wasn't quite good

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.639 
what the visualization wasn't quite good
enough<00:00:54.579> with<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.940> fencing<00:00:55.329> mask<00:00:55.539> so<00:00:56.379> they

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
enough with a fencing mask so they

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.979 
enough with a fencing mask so they
developed<00:00:57.129> just<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:58.059> kind<00:00:58.539> of<00:00:58.570> what's<00:00:58.750> looks

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
developed just the kind of what's looks

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:59.910 
developed just the kind of what's looks
are<00:00:59.109> very<00:00:59.140> similar<00:00:59.500> actually<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.859> the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
are very similar actually to the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.240 
are very similar actually to the
modern-day<00:01:00.309> mask<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.780> wire<00:01:02.320> bars<00:01:02.679> going

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
modern-day mask with wire bars going

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.189 
modern-day mask with wire bars going
across<00:01:03.609> almost<00:01:04.059> like<00:01:04.300> a<00:01:04.330> tic<00:01:04.570> tac<00:01:04.720> toe<00:01:04.780> pattern

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
across almost like a tic tac toe pattern

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.050 
across almost like a tic tac toe pattern
but<00:01:05.890> wide<00:01:06.130> enough<00:01:06.340> apart<00:01:06.670> that<00:01:06.760> he<00:01:06.910> could

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
but wide enough apart that he could

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.910 
but wide enough apart that he could
still<00:01:07.300> they<00:01:08.200> catch<00:01:08.380> her<00:01:08.500> still<00:01:08.680> at<00:01:08.770> good

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
still they catch her still at good

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.370 
still they catch her still at good
visualization<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.540> then<00:01:10.720> that<00:01:10.870> mask<00:01:11.140> went

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
visualization and then that mask went

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.780 
visualization and then that mask went
through<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.590> number<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.920> iterations<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.700> the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
through a number of iterations to the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.910 
through a number of iterations to the
present<00:01:13.210> day<00:01:13.240> we're<00:01:14.140> now<00:01:14.320> actually<00:01:14.560> that

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
present day we're now actually that

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.680 
present day we're now actually that
catches<00:01:15.250> mask<00:01:15.490> more<00:01:15.880> closely<00:01:16.150> resembles<00:01:16.660> a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
catches mask more closely resembles a

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.050 
catches mask more closely resembles a
hockey<00:01:16.900> mask<00:01:17.170> than<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.130> old<00:01:18.250> catches<00:01:18.610> massive

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
hockey mask than the old catches massive

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.000 
hockey mask than the old catches massive
you<00:01:19.330> know<00:01:19.420> fifty<00:01:19.750> years<00:01:19.900> ago<00:01:19.960> there<00:01:20.680> was<00:01:20.800> no

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
you know fifty years ago there was no

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.620 
you know fifty years ago there was no
other<00:01:21.160> catcher<00:01:21.460> in<00:01:21.730> the<00:01:21.820> league<00:01:22.030> who<00:01:22.540> was

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
other catcher in the league who was

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.810 
other catcher in the league who was
wearing<00:01:22.870> a<00:01:22.930> face<00:01:23.110> mask<00:01:23.140> we're<00:01:23.770> at<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.550> time

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
wearing a face mask we're at the time

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.180 
wearing a face mask we're at the time
said<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.330> saw<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:26.020> catcher<00:01:26.650> now<00:01:26.980> was

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
said I saw that the catcher now was

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.800 
said I saw that the catcher now was
actually<00:01:27.550> like<00:01:27.700> I<00:01:27.820> said<00:01:28.030> up<00:01:28.210> closer<00:01:28.510> to<00:01:28.720> the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
actually like I said up closer to the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.690 
actually like I said up closer to the
plate<00:01:28.990> receiving<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.070> were<00:01:30.130> less<00:01:30.280> balls<00:01:30.520> in

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
plate receiving the were less balls in

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.980 
plate receiving the were less balls in
the<00:01:30.790> dirt<00:01:30.820> he<00:01:31.210> was<00:01:31.300> receiving<00:01:31.630> them<00:01:31.840> better

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
the dirt he was receiving them better

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.010 
the dirt he was receiving them better
throwing<00:01:32.740> more<00:01:33.090> base<00:01:34.090> runners<00:01:34.420> out<00:01:34.570> at<00:01:34.690> second

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
throwing more base runners out at second

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.290 
throwing more base runners out at second
base<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:35.590> they<00:01:35.800> said<00:01:36.010> hey<00:01:36.160> he's<00:01:37.000> got<00:01:37.210> an

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
base so they said hey he's got an

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.640 
base so they said hey he's got an
advantage<00:01:37.570> over<00:01:37.720> me<00:01:37.930> now<00:01:38.080> so<00:01:38.260> they<00:01:38.350> went<00:01:38.500> from

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
advantage over me now so they went from

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.340 
advantage over me now so they went from
criticizing<00:01:39.370> him<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:40.120> copying<00:01:40.570> them<00:01:40.660> and<00:01:40.840> it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
criticizing him to copying them and it

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.110 
criticizing him to copying them and it
just<00:01:41.500> took<00:01:41.650> off<00:01:41.830> very<00:01:42.070> quickly<00:01:42.160> this<00:01:42.910> was

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
just took off very quickly this was
