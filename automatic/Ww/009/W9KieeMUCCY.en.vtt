just because you know I've had jewelry

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.160 
just because you know I've had jewelry
when<00:02:19.030> I've<00:02:19.239> gotten<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.660> delivered<00:02:20.020> before

when I've gotten it delivered before

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.510 
when I've gotten it delivered before
that's<00:02:20.500> broken<00:02:20.830> because<00:02:21.160> it's<00:02:21.340> not<00:02:21.459> in

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520

thrown<00:02:22.930> into<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:23.260> box<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.709> thought<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:23.890> was

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
thrown into a box so I thought that was

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.320 
thrown into a box so I thought that was
a<00:02:24.130> nice<00:02:24.340> touch<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.610> they<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:24.910> put<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.209> this

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
a nice touch that they do put in this

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.180 
a nice touch that they do put in this
little<00:02:25.540> pouch<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.020> can<00:02:26.200> use<00:02:26.320> this<00:02:26.500> for<00:02:27.040> you

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
little pouch and I can use this for you

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.380 
little pouch and I can use this for you
no<00:02:27.310> more<00:02:27.459> stuff<00:02:27.670> when<00:02:27.790> I'm<00:02:27.880> traveling<00:02:28.270> and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
no more stuff when I'm traveling and

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.910 
no more stuff when I'm traveling and
stuff<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.690> thought<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.959> was<00:02:29.080> really<00:02:29.230> nice

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
stuff so I thought that was really nice

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.130 
stuff so I thought that was really nice
that<00:02:29.980> they<00:02:30.280> did<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.880> now<00:02:31.209> for<00:02:31.870> what's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
that they did that and now for what's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.170 
that they did that and now for what's
inside<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:33.040> pouch<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.489> like<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.700> said<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:34.030> get

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
inside the pouch so like I said to get

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.490 
inside the pouch so like I said to get
three<00:02:34.480> items<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:34.900> they<00:02:34.989> all<00:02:35.080> have<00:02:35.170> three

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
three items so they all have three

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.560 
three items so they all have three
smaller<00:02:35.830> items<00:02:36.070> where<00:02:36.730> I'm<00:02:36.970> assuming<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.480> if

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
smaller items where I'm assuming that if

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.540 
smaller items where I'm assuming that if
I<00:02:37.660> had<00:02:37.840> only<00:02:37.870> gotten<00:02:38.200> two<00:02:38.650> items<00:02:39.040> they<00:02:39.430> would

I had only gotten two items they would

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.830 
I had only gotten two items they would
have<00:02:39.640> been<00:02:39.730> bigger<00:02:39.910> items<00:02:40.120> but<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.570> really

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
especially if you have a lot going on

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.100 
especially if you have a lot going on
with<00:04:53.210> your<00:04:53.300> shirt<00:04:53.510> you<00:04:53.630> can't<00:04:53.810> really<00:04:53.990> have

with your shirt you can't really have

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.230 
with your shirt you can't really have
like<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.380> super<00:04:55.250> lot<00:04:55.550> going<00:04:55.820> off<00:04:55.910> your<00:04:56.090> shirt
