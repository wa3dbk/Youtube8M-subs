you<00:02:02.159> push<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.939> release<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.570> lock<00:02:03.780> like

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
you push it in to release the lock like

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.380 
you push it in to release the lock like
that<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.740> they<00:02:05.520> had<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> push<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.030> off<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
that and they had to push it off at the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.060 
that and they had to push it off at the
same<00:02:06.540> time

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.260 

okay<00:02:10.070> after<00:02:10.310> you've<00:02:11.830> done<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.940> story

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
okay after you've done it the story

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.650 
okay after you've done it the story
billet<00:02:14.450> camera<00:02:14.720> angle<00:02:15.080> guys<00:02:15.910> okay<00:02:16.940> after

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
billet camera angle guys okay after

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.270 
billet camera angle guys okay after
you've<00:02:17.780> pushed<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.260> bottom<00:02:18.560> two<00:02:18.710> clips<00:02:19.010> up

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
you've pushed the bottom two clips up

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.460 
you've pushed the bottom two clips up
and<00:02:19.550> in<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.910> know<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.780> should<00:02:20.960> look<00:02:21.140> like<00:02:21.170> this

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
and in I know it should look like this

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.770 
and in I know it should look like this
on<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.770> top<00:02:21.950> side<00:02:22.180> now<00:02:23.180> they'll<00:02:23.390> only<00:02:23.630> come

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
on the top side now they'll only come

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.990 
on the top side now they'll only come
out<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.140> far<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:25.280> probably<00:02:25.550> can't<00:02:25.730> pull<00:02:25.910> it

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
out so far you probably can't pull it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.480 
out so far you probably can't pull it
right<00:02:26.090> out<00:02:26.230> but<00:02:27.230> when<00:02:27.740> you<00:02:27.860> pull<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:28.250> line

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
right out but when you pull this line

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.400 
right out but when you pull this line
off<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.180> like<00:02:29.480> I'm<00:02:29.540> behind<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.140> right<00:02:30.260> now<00:02:30.350> you

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
off you like I'm behind it right now you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.320 
off you like I'm behind it right now you
don't<00:02:30.680> want<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.920> be<00:02:30.980> in<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.190> soft<00:02:31.550> spot<00:02:31.790> so

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
don't want to be in that soft spot so

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.590 
don't want to be in that soft spot so
I'm<00:02:32.870> gonna<00:02:32.990> get<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.320> other<00:02:33.350> side<00:02:33.980> line<00:02:34.280> off

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
I'm gonna get the other side line off

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.670 
I'm gonna get the other side line off
now<00:02:35.600> I'm<00:02:35.660> going<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.840> pull<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.080> two<00:02:36.230> lines<00:02:36.440> off

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
now I'm going to pull the two lines off

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.830 
now I'm going to pull the two lines off
well<00:02:37.520> I'm<00:02:37.670> not<00:02:37.820> under<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.240> car<00:02:38.420> because<00:02:38.690> it's

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
well I'm not under the car because it's

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.210 
well I'm not under the car because it's
gonna<00:02:38.990> spray<00:02:39.230> fuel<00:02:39.560> all<00:02:39.770> over<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:40.040> place

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
gonna spray fuel all over the place

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.070 
gonna spray fuel all over the place
probably<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:40.880> chances<00:02:41.540> are<00:02:41.660> if<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.870> get<00:02:41.990> it

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
probably and chances are if you get it

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.240 
probably and chances are if you get it
in<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.200> eyes<00:02:42.320> you're<00:02:42.620> not<00:02:42.680> gonna<00:02:42.830> like<00:02:43.040> it

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
in the eyes you're not gonna like it

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.490 
in the eyes you're not gonna like it

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
guys I'm gonna still gonna really do the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.830 
guys I'm gonna still gonna really do the
gas<00:02:48.380> pressure<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.800> get<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:48.980> get<00:02:49.070> this<00:02:49.280> bracket

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
gas pressure I get I get this bracket

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.530 
gas pressure I get I get this bracket
off<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:52.100> bolt<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.610> underneath<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.390> the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
off and the bolt is underneath of the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.620 
off and the bolt is underneath of the
gas<00:02:53.750> line<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:54.320> that's<00:02:54.620> got<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:54.950> come<00:02:55.100> off<00:02:55.630> I'm

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
gas line so that's got to come off I'm

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.300 
gas line so that's got to come off I'm
pretty<00:02:56.990> sure<00:02:58.120> I'll<00:02:59.120> leave<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.540> fuel<00:02:59.780> pressure

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
pretty sure I'll leave the fuel pressure

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.110 
pretty sure I'll leave the fuel pressure
trying<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.370> think<00:03:01.550> you<00:03:01.610> can<00:03:01.730> see<00:03:01.850> how<00:03:02.060> dirty

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
trying to think you can see how dirty

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.080 
trying to think you can see how dirty
that<00:03:02.570> filter<00:03:02.960> is<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:04.160> see<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.400> gasoline<00:03:04.940> is

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
that filter is you see the gasoline is

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.780 
that filter is you see the gasoline is
really<00:03:05.300> dirty<00:03:05.480> coming<00:03:05.870> out<00:03:05.960> of<00:03:06.050> there<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:07.280> it's

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
really dirty coming out of there so it's

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.280 
really dirty coming out of there so it's
a<00:03:07.880> good<00:03:07.970> thing<00:03:08.150> we<00:03:08.270> changed<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:10.960> nasty

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
a good thing we changed it nasty

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.770 
a good thing we changed it nasty
worst<00:03:12.710> part<00:03:12.980> about<00:03:13.160> working<00:03:13.340> with<00:03:13.580> fuels<00:03:14.000> get

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
worst part about working with fuels get

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.560 
worst part about working with fuels get
it<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:15.020> I<00:03:15.050> could<00:03:15.530> burn<00:03:15.710> your<00:03:15.830> skin<00:03:16.070> one<00:03:16.790> are

you have washes three or four times you

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.440 
you have washes three or four times you
never<00:03:25.610> get<00:03:25.820> smell<00:03:26.150> out<00:03:26.330> okay<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:28.300> there<00:03:29.300> is<00:03:29.330> a

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
never get smell out okay so there is a

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.170 
never get smell out okay so there is a
bolt

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
bolt

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.369 
bolt
straight<00:03:32.180> up<00:03:32.329> on<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.480> other<00:03:32.599> side<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.200> hold

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
straight up on the other side the hold

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.800 
straight up on the other side the hold
some<00:03:33.560> bracket<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.249> this<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:35.209> believe<00:03:35.510> it's

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
some bracket to this and believe it's

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.899 
some bracket to this and believe it's
either<00:03:35.989> 10<00:03:36.319> ml<00:03:36.560> or<00:03:36.709> 3/8<00:03:37.159> so<00:03:37.459> we're<00:03:37.670> going<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.849> go

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
either 10 ml or 3/8 so we're going to go

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.489 
either 10 ml or 3/8 so we're going to go
ahead<00:03:37.999> and<00:03:38.209> take<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:38.329> out<00:03:38.510> if<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.109> can<00:03:39.290> if

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:39.499 
ahead and take that out if you can if

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:40.809 
ahead and take that out if you can if
you<00:03:39.590> can't<00:03:39.799> then<00:03:40.099> you're<00:03:40.280> gonna<00:03:40.430> have<00:03:40.549> to<00:03:40.609> cut

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
you can't then you're gonna have to cut

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.789 
you can't then you're gonna have to cut
the<00:03:40.969> bracket<00:03:41.420> with<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.079> fuel<00:03:42.319> filter<00:03:42.650> on<00:03:42.769> it

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
the bracket with the fuel filter on it

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.890 
the bracket with the fuel filter on it
or<00:03:43.040> leave<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.489> there<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.120> put<00:03:44.659> your<00:03:44.810> new

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
or leave that there and put your new

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.839
