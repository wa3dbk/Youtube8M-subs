hoping<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:54.390> has<00:01:54.540> power<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.740> it'll<00:01:56.310> shut

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
hoping that has power on and it'll shut

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.920 
hoping that has power on and it'll shut
off<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.820> soon<00:01:56.939> as<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.090> open<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.360> door<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.810> an

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
off as soon as I open the door like an

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.420 
off as soon as I open the door like an
accessory<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> little<00:01:59.310> bit

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
accessory but you know a little bit

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.639 
accessory but you know a little bit
extra<00:01:59.579> time<00:01:59.820> for<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> door<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:01.229> anyway<00:02:01.500> we're

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
extra time for the door so anyway we're

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.399 
extra time for the door so anyway we're
going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.829> rip<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:01.979> stuff<00:02:02.790> out<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.360> run<00:02:04.229> some

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
going to rip that stuff out and run some

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.740 
going to rip that stuff out and run some
wires<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.670> got<00:02:05.820> all<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> cable<00:02:06.390> actually

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
wires and I got all the cable actually

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.719 
wires and I got all the cable actually
rip<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.290> friend<00:02:07.829> danya's<00:02:08.190> Integra

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
rip this out of friend danya's Integra

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.980 
rip this out of friend danya's Integra
and<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:10.530> took<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:10.950> all<00:02:11.250> the

and I took with it all the
all<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.170> cabling<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.710> wires<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.750> what<00:02:16.750> do<00:02:16.810> I

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
all the cabling and wires so what do I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.950 
all the cabling and wires so what do I
got<00:02:17.050> here<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.260> got<00:02:17.290> signal<00:02:17.800> wires<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.870> got<00:02:19.870> the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
got here I got signal wires I got the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.570 
got here I got signal wires I got the
power<00:02:20.110> cable<00:02:20.620> it's<00:02:20.920> not<00:02:21.070> huge

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
power cable it's not huge

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.550 
power cable it's not huge
I<00:02:21.610> got<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.300> fuse<00:02:22.600> here<00:02:22.750> somewhere<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:24.120> excuse<00:02:25.560> so

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
I got a fuse here somewhere to excuse so

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.720 
I got a fuse here somewhere to excuse so
I'm<00:02:26.650> out<00:02:26.770> this<00:02:26.890> guy<00:02:27.040> up<00:02:27.100> next<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.490> battery

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
I'm out this guy up next to the battery

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.000 
I'm out this guy up next to the battery
and<00:02:28.230> I've<00:02:29.230> been<00:02:29.320> watching<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.650> couple<00:02:29.770> YouTube

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
and I've been watching a couple YouTube

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.550 
and I've been watching a couple YouTube
videos<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.430> see<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.870> batteries<00:02:32.140> over<00:02:32.350> there

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
videos to see the batteries over there

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.960 
videos to see the batteries over there
so<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:32.980> got<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.190> run<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.370> through<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.550> firewall

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
so I got to run it through the firewall

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.420 
so I got to run it through the firewall
into<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.390> back<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:34.900> what<00:02:35.830> time<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.220> now

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
into the back so what time is it now

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.930 
into the back so what time is it now
it's<00:02:36.730> 11:30<00:02:37.480> ish<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.460> let's<00:02:39.460> see<00:02:39.610> how<00:02:39.730> long<00:02:39.880> it

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
it's 11:30 ish and let's see how long it

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.640 
it's 11:30 ish and let's see how long it
takes<00:02:40.090> me<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.270> install<00:02:40.570> this<00:02:40.690> stereo<00:02:41.260> all

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
takes me to install this stereo all

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.930 
takes me to install this stereo all
right<00:02:41.920> well<00:02:42.130> here's<00:02:42.370> our<00:02:42.460> battery<00:02:42.640> we're

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
right well here's our battery we're

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.170 
right well here's our battery we're
going<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.120> run<00:02:43.240> our<00:02:43.330> main<00:02:43.480> power<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.650> if<00:02:44.830> you

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
going to run our main power and if you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.540 
going to run our main power and if you
if<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.330> pop<00:02:46.510> off<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.840> cover<00:02:47.080> here<00:02:47.440> there's<00:02:48.400> a

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
if you pop off this cover here there's a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.610 
if you pop off this cover here there's a
probably<00:02:49.360> two<00:02:49.540> locations<00:02:50.140> well<00:02:50.410> actually

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
probably two locations well actually

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.780 
probably two locations well actually
these<00:02:50.800> refused

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.560 

that's<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.970> 125<00:02:55.840> amp<00:02:56.080> fuse<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:57.850> 250<00:02:58.180> amp<00:02:58.330> fuse

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
that's a 125 amp fuse to 250 amp fuse

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.140 
that's a 125 amp fuse to 250 amp fuse
but<00:02:58.750> fuse<00:02:59.740> I'm<00:02:59.860> running<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.250> don't<00:03:00.280> know<00:03:00.490> how

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
but fuse I'm running I don't know how

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.750 
but fuse I'm running I don't know how
many<00:03:01.240> apps<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:02.190> but<00:03:03.190> it's<00:03:03.310> less<00:03:03.520> than

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
many apps that is but it's less than

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.890 
many apps that is but it's less than
these<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:05.470> even<00:03:05.680> if<00:03:05.770> this<00:03:05.890> fuse<00:03:06.130> blows<00:03:06.750> even<00:03:07.750> if

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
these so even if this fuse blows even if

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.410 
these so even if this fuse blows even if
this<00:03:07.959> fuse<00:03:08.230> blows<00:03:08.470> then<00:03:09.030> then<00:03:10.030> I'm<00:03:10.120> okay<00:03:10.360> so

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
this fuse blows then then I'm okay so

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.490 
this fuse blows then then I'm okay so
I'm<00:03:10.570> probably<00:03:10.690> going<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:10.990> run<00:03:11.080> that<00:03:11.230> right<00:03:11.380> up

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
I'm probably going to run that right up

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.670 
I'm probably going to run that right up
to<00:03:11.770> about<00:03:11.800> there<00:03:13.140> cut<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.200> nice<00:03:14.320> little<00:03:14.500> screw

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
to about there cut the nice little screw

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.979 
to about there cut the nice little screw
down<00:03:15.090> will<00:03:16.090> help<00:03:16.240> you<00:03:16.330> run<00:03:16.510> this<00:03:16.600> along<00:03:16.750> the

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
down will help you run this along the

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.860 
down will help you run this along the
side<00:03:17.140> here<00:03:17.170> tuck<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.709> away<00:03:17.800> all<00:03:17.980> nice<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:19.420> I'll

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
side here tuck it away all nice and I'll

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.840 
side here tuck it away all nice and I'll
probably<00:03:20.110> run<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.410> cable<00:03:20.769> down<00:03:21.310> through<00:03:21.580> here

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
probably run the cable down through here

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.630 
probably run the cable down through here
and<00:03:22.470> just<00:03:23.470> on<00:03:23.800> another<00:03:23.920> video<00:03:24.160> good<00:03:24.400> idea<00:03:24.550> to

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
and just on another video good idea to

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.180 
and just on another video good idea to
run<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.790> loop<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.620> then<00:03:26.620> there's<00:03:26.860> actually<00:03:26.980> a

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
run a loop and then there's actually a

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.790 
run a loop and then there's actually a
little<00:03:27.340> if<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.910> can<00:03:28.060> see<00:03:28.209> it<00:03:28.680> there's<00:03:29.680> this

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
little if you can see it there's this

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.710 
little if you can see it there's this
little<00:03:30.040> rubber<00:03:30.459> plug<00:03:30.760> there<00:03:31.000> I'm<00:03:31.510> probably

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
little rubber plug there I'm probably

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.300 
little rubber plug there I'm probably
going<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:31.989> cut<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.140> hole<00:03:32.350> in<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.709> run<00:03:33.190> my

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
going to cut a hole in and run my

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.380 
going to cut a hole in and run my
cabling<00:03:33.610> through<00:03:33.790> there<00:03:33.910> there's<00:03:34.120> also<00:03:34.239> this

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
cabling through there there's also this

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.630 
cabling through there there's also this
main<00:03:34.600> harness<00:03:34.840> here<00:03:35.160> that's<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.250> lot<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.489> dicker

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
main harness here that's a lot to dicker

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.949 
main harness here that's a lot to dicker
on<00:03:36.850> this<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.180> I<00:03:37.209> don't<00:03:37.360> like<00:03:37.450> digging<00:03:37.720> around

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
on this and I don't like digging around

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.660 
on this and I don't like digging around
so<00:03:38.769> I'll<00:03:38.830> project<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.190> get<00:03:39.280> out<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.459> glovebox

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
so I'll project to get out the glovebox
