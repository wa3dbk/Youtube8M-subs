some of those crazy eggs that bust

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.980 
some of those crazy eggs that bust
through<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.679> brain<00:00:10.920> in<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.340> nearby<00:00:11.639> pan<00:00:12.240> butter

begins to melt

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.849 
begins to melt
incredibly<00:00:14.910> using<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.509> specific<00:00:15.870> tool<00:00:16.560> for

incredibly using a specific tool for
this<00:00:17.010> task<00:00:17.310> we're<00:00:17.970> able<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.390> penetrate<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
this task we're able to penetrate the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.450 
this task we're able to penetrate the
barrier<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:20.220> bread<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.880> create<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
barrier of this bread and create a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.179 
barrier of this bread and create a
circle<00:00:23.460> type<00:00:24.210> environment<00:00:25.140> which<00:00:25.619> will<00:00:25.890> later

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
circle type environment which will later

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.570 
circle type environment which will later
hold<00:00:26.820> our<00:00:27.180> eggs<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.619> could<00:00:28.769> put<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.130> holder

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
hold our eggs you could put that holder

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.429 
hold our eggs you could put that holder
right<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.939> there<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.269> now<00:00:30.420> while<00:00:30.960> we<00:00:31.050> move<00:00:31.170> on

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
right in there for now while we move on
