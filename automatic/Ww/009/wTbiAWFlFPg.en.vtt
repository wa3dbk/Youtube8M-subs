next<00:00:37.839> video<00:00:38.050> is<00:00:38.109> gonna<00:00:38.170> be<00:00:38.289> a<00:00:38.379> different<00:00:38.710> gun

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
next video is gonna be a different gun

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.459 
next video is gonna be a different gun
but<00:00:39.010> I<00:00:39.039> always<00:00:39.579> fall<00:00:39.789> back<00:00:39.850> to<00:00:40.359> the<00:00:40.629> mtar<00:00:41.260> maybe

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
but I always fall back to the mtar maybe

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.739 
but I always fall back to the mtar maybe
it's<00:00:41.649> because<00:00:41.769> the<00:00:42.129> mtar<00:00:42.489> in<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.729> ak-12<00:00:43.059> are

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
it's because the mtar in the ak-12 are

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:45.209 
it's because the mtar in the ak-12 are
the<00:00:43.870> two<00:00:44.079> guns<00:00:44.319> that<00:00:44.499> I<00:00:44.559> always<00:00:44.859> get<00:00:45.039> the

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
the two guns that I always get the

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.369 
the two guns that I always get the
greatest<00:00:45.639> game<00:00:45.879> plays<00:00:46.149> with<00:00:46.389> and<00:00:46.659> that<00:00:47.139> just

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
greatest game plays with and that just

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.049 
greatest game plays with and that just
goes<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.769> fact<00:00:48.010> that<00:00:48.129> i<00:00:48.280> think<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:48.699> mtar

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
goes to the fact that i think the mtar

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.450 
goes to the fact that i think the mtar
is<00:00:49.239> probably<00:00:49.719> the<00:00:49.899> most<00:00:49.929> consistent<00:00:50.769> gun<00:00:51.309> in

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
is probably the most consistent gun in

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.789 
is probably the most consistent gun in
the<00:00:51.549> game<00:00:51.929> personally<00:00:52.929> at<00:00:53.049> least<00:00:53.260> I<00:00:53.379> feel<00:00:53.409> that

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:53.799 
the game personally at least I feel that

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:55.770 
the game personally at least I feel that
it's<00:00:53.979> the<00:00:54.069> most<00:00:54.249> consistent<00:00:54.579> gun<00:00:54.969> it<00:00:55.539> always

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
it's the most consistent gun it always

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.719 
it's the most consistent gun it always
gets<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:56.019> job<00:00:56.229> done<00:00:56.289> for<00:00:56.739> me<00:00:56.889> I<00:00:56.920> always<00:00:57.069> I

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
gets the job done for me I always I

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.819 
gets the job done for me I always I
could<00:00:58.510> rely<00:00:58.839> on<00:00:59.049> it<00:00:59.139> that's<00:00:59.289> the<00:00:59.440> best<00:00:59.620> way<00:00:59.769> to

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
could rely on it that's the best way to

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.469 
could rely on it that's the best way to
put<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.249> entire<00:01:00.519> this<00:01:00.760> is<00:01:00.879> one<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.059> those<00:01:01.209> guns

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
put the entire this is one of those guns

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.599 
put the entire this is one of those guns
I<00:01:01.690> can<00:01:02.109> rely<00:01:02.289> on<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.739> these<00:01:02.949> same<00:01:03.129> goes<00:01:03.370> for

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
I can rely on and these same goes for

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.330 
I can rely on and these same goes for
the<00:01:03.639> ak-12<00:01:04.089> but<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.170> ak-12<00:01:05.619> is<00:01:05.950> an<00:01:06.039> assault

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
you guys do see a lot of em to our

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.240 
you guys do see a lot of em to our
gameplay<00:01:22.960> yeah<00:01:23.170> i<00:01:23.200> use<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.560> vector<00:01:23.859> from<00:01:24.039> time

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
gameplay yeah i use the vector from time

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.340 
gameplay yeah i use the vector from time
to<00:01:24.399> time<00:01:24.430> that's<00:01:25.240> probably<00:01:25.390> like<00:01:25.689> my<00:01:25.869> second

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
to time that's probably like my second

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.529 
to time that's probably like my second
most<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:26.770> submachine<00:01:27.369> gun<00:01:27.549> but<00:01:28.180> i<00:01:28.240> feel<00:01:28.420> like

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
most you submachine gun but i feel like

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:29.789 
most you submachine gun but i feel like
the<00:01:28.659> vector<00:01:29.049> can<00:01:29.289> be<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.439> little<00:01:29.649> bit

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
the vector can be a little bit

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.130 
the vector can be a little bit
unreliable<00:01:30.250> at<00:01:31.030> times<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:31.390> feel<00:01:31.539> like<00:01:31.659> vector

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
unreliable at times I feel like vector

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.529 
unreliable at times I feel like vector
lets<00:01:32.890> me<00:01:33.100> downs<00:01:33.369> in<00:01:33.700> moments<00:01:34.030> like<00:01:34.060> one<00:01:34.329> time

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
lets me downs in moments like one time

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.660 
lets me downs in moments like one time
it'll<00:01:34.750> kill<00:01:35.020> somebody<00:01:35.320> with<00:01:35.619> our<00:01:36.100> like<00:01:36.250> three

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
it'll kill somebody with our like three

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.279 
it'll kill somebody with our like three
shots<00:01:36.909> four<00:01:37.240> shots<00:01:37.570> I<00:01:37.689> don't<00:01:37.840> kill<00:01:38.109> them

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
shots four shots I don't kill them

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.289 
shots four shots I don't kill them
instantly<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.340> I'm<00:01:39.399> like<00:01:39.520> dang<00:01:39.700> like<00:01:39.909> vector

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
instantly and I'm like dang like vector

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.630 
instantly and I'm like dang like vector
good<00:01:40.509> job<00:01:40.689> you<00:01:40.840> just<00:01:40.960> outdid<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:42.039> mtar<00:01:42.460> but

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
good job you just outdid the mtar but

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.039 
good job you just outdid the mtar but
then<00:01:42.759> there's<00:01:42.909> other<00:01:43.090> times<00:01:43.359> where<00:01:43.659> I<00:01:43.719> use<00:01:43.899> the

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
then there's other times where I use the

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.469 
then there's other times where I use the
vector<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.619> it<00:01:45.039> seems<00:01:45.310> like<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.969> enemies<00:01:46.450> are

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
vector and it seems like the enemies are

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.149 
vector and it seems like the enemies are
just<00:01:46.749> eating<00:01:46.929> my<00:01:47.289> bullets<00:01:47.679> like<00:01:47.770> they're<00:01:47.979> just

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
just eating my bullets like they're just

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.039 
just eating my bullets like they're just
chomping<00:01:48.670> on<00:01:48.789> those<00:01:48.939> bullets<00:01:49.359> like<00:01:49.780> it's

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
chomping on those bullets like it's

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.289 
chomping on those bullets like it's
candy<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.740> I'm<00:01:50.799> like<00:01:50.950> really<00:01:51.249> like<00:01:51.609> why<00:01:52.240> you

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
candy and I'm like really like why you

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.849 
candy and I'm like really like why you
gotta<00:01:52.570> do<00:01:52.719> that<00:01:52.749> to<00:01:53.020> me<00:01:53.109> vector<00:01:53.469> and<00:01:53.590> it<00:01:53.649> puts

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
gotta do that to me vector and it puts

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.709 
gotta do that to me vector and it puts
me<00:01:54.039> in<00:01:54.070> these<00:01:54.219> situations<00:01:54.969> where<00:01:55.509> I'll<00:01:55.689> be

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
me in these situations where I'll be

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.419 
me in these situations where I'll be
shooting<00:01:56.049> an<00:01:56.289> enemy<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:56.829> I<00:01:56.950> think<00:01:57.280> this

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
shooting an enemy and I think this

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.069 
shooting an enemy and I think this
should<00:01:57.520> be<00:01:57.640> dead<00:01:57.819> by<00:01:57.850> now<00:01:58.030> so<00:01:58.630> I'll<00:01:58.810> stop

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
should be dead by now so I'll stop

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.200 
should be dead by now so I'll stop
firing<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.829> just<00:02:00.219> kind<00:02:00.429> of<00:02:00.520> turn<00:02:00.759> my<00:02:00.969> body

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
firing and just kind of turn my body

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.630 
firing and just kind of turn my body
away<00:02:01.659> and<00:02:01.840> it<00:02:02.350> gets<00:02:02.469> me<00:02:02.740> these<00:02:03.009> situations

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
away and it gets me these situations

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.300 
away and it gets me these situations
where<00:02:03.759> they<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:03.909> turn<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:04.270> me<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:04.659> I<00:02:04.719> die<00:02:04.780> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
where they just turn on me and I die and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.800 
where they just turn on me and I die and
it's<00:02:06.310> always<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.729> letdown<00:02:06.969> I'm<00:02:07.149> like<00:02:07.270> oh<00:02:07.420> dude

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
it's always a letdown I'm like oh dude

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.660 
it's always a letdown I'm like oh dude
really<00:02:08.170> all<00:02:08.680> I<00:02:08.740> how<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.160> do<00:02:09.340> is

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
really all I how to do is

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.010 
really all I how to do is
a<00:02:09.700> couple<00:02:10.030> more<00:02:10.149> bullets<00:02:10.539> into<00:02:10.750> him<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:10.929> he

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
a couple more bullets into him and he

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.050 
a couple more bullets into him and he
would<00:02:11.140> have<00:02:11.230> been<00:02:11.319> dead<00:02:11.490> but<00:02:12.490> it's<00:02:12.670> just<00:02:12.849> it's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
would have been dead but it's just it's

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.370 
would have been dead but it's just it's
a<00:02:13.120> call<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.390> duty<00:02:13.599> habit<00:02:13.870> if<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.080> guys<00:02:14.230> have

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
a call of duty habit if you guys have

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.630 
a call of duty habit if you guys have
been<00:02:14.470> playing<00:02:14.530> called<00:02:14.920> grief<00:02:15.160> for<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.400> while

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
been playing called grief for a while

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.400 
been playing called grief for a while
you<00:02:16.030> know<00:02:16.150> exactly<00:02:16.870> what<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.110> heck<00:02:17.260> I'm

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
you know exactly what the heck I'm

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.830 
you know exactly what the heck I'm
talking<00:02:17.830> about<00:02:18.040> but<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.849> mtar<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.330> just<00:02:19.540> like

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
talking about but the mtar is just like

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.750 
talking about but the mtar is just like
I<00:02:19.959> said<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.319> very<00:02:20.530> consistent<00:02:21.190> gun<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.550> don't

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
I said a very consistent gun and I don't

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.940 
I said a very consistent gun and I don't
run<00:02:21.910> into<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.239> problem<00:02:22.300> as<00:02:23.020> often<00:02:23.770> you'll

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
run into that problem as often you'll

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.020 
run into that problem as often you'll
see<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.190> every<00:02:24.370> now<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.730> then<00:02:24.819> in<00:02:24.940> my

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
see it every now and then in my

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.820 
see it every now and then in my
gameplays<00:02:25.540> but<00:02:25.840> for<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.110> most<00:02:26.290> part<00:02:26.440> when<00:02:26.800> the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
gameplays but for the most part when the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.970 
gameplays but for the most part when the
mtar<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.819> being<00:02:28.150> used<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.630> doesn't<00:02:29.290> happen<00:02:29.530> as

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
mtar is being used it doesn't happen as

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.979 
mtar is being used it doesn't happen as
much<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.910> that's<00:02:31.060> why<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:31.270> kind<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.600> fall<00:02:31.780> back

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
much so that's why I kind of fall back

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.500 
much so that's why I kind of fall back
to<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.290> gun<00:02:32.530> like<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.340> said<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.700> k-12<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.330> very

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
to that gun like I said a k-12 is very

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.449 
to that gun like I said a k-12 is very
good<00:02:34.750> if<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:34.959> get<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> salt<00:02:35.650> gameplays<00:02:36.190> if<00:02:36.340> I'm

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
good if I get a salt gameplays if I'm

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.430 
good if I get a salt gameplays if I'm
using<00:02:36.640> assault<00:02:37.030> killstreaks<00:02:37.600> which<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.290> also

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
using assault killstreaks which is also

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.530 
using assault killstreaks which is also
kind<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.069> rare<00:02:39.370> because<00:02:39.670> i<00:02:40.150> don't<00:02:40.300> know<00:02:40.360> i

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
kind of rare because i don't know i

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.479 
kind of rare because i don't know i
think<00:02:40.660> going<00:02:41.019> for<00:02:41.290> kem<00:02:41.440> strikes<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:42.069> pretty

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
think going for kem strikes is pretty

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.280 
think going for kem strikes is pretty
fun<00:02:42.819> it's<00:02:43.480> one<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:43.690> those<00:02:43.780> things<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.170> kind

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
fun it's one of those things that kind

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.380 
fun it's one of those things that kind
of<00:02:44.500> brings<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.920> back<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.370> game<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.850> feel

like that's why people went back to

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.220 
like that's why people went back to
modern<00:02:48.040> warefare<00:02:48.160> 3mon<00:02:48.730> over<00:02:48.880> 43<00:02:49.230> terrible

that<00:02:57.760> was<00:02:57.970> really<00:02:58.000> really<00:02:58.660> fun<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.049> go<00:02:59.200> for<00:02:59.470> and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
that was really really fun to go for and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.520 
that was really really fun to go for and
that's<00:03:00.100> kind<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.610> why<00:03:01.060> call<00:03:01.780> duty<00:03:02.019> ghosts<00:03:02.290> is

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
that's kind of why call duty ghosts is

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.259 
that's kind of why call duty ghosts is
still<00:03:02.950> kind<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.400> fun<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.580> play<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:03.819> think<00:03:03.940> that's

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
still kind of fun to play I think that's

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.870 
still kind of fun to play I think that's
why<00:03:04.450> people<00:03:04.480> come<00:03:04.989> back<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:05.980> if<00:03:06.190> it<00:03:06.370> wasn't<00:03:06.670> for

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
why people come back so if it wasn't for

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.289 
why people come back so if it wasn't for
dkm<00:03:07.480> strike<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.959> feel<00:03:08.380> this<00:03:08.560> game<00:03:08.880> would<00:03:09.880> pretty

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
dkm strike I feel this game would pretty

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.690 
dkm strike I feel this game would pretty
much<00:03:10.390> have<00:03:10.870> nobody<00:03:11.680> playing<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.340> because

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
much have nobody playing it because

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.009 
much have nobody playing it because
there's<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.060> lot<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.269> people<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:13.690> don't<00:03:13.840> play

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
there's a lot of people that don't play

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.630 
there's a lot of people that don't play
it<00:03:14.079> as<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:14.410> there's<00:03:15.130> a<00:03:15.190> lot<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.459> people

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
it as it is there's a lot of people

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.430 
it as it is there's a lot of people
drifting<00:03:16.390> away<00:03:16.510> from<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.019> call<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.260> duty

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
drifting away from the call of duty

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.670 
drifting away from the call of duty
franchise<00:03:17.680> now<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.489> it<00:03:19.329> seems<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.780> be<00:03:20.019> slowly

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
franchise now and it seems to be slowly

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.270 
franchise now and it seems to be slowly
dying<00:03:21.280> unfortunately<00:03:22.209> unless<00:03:22.450> somehow<00:03:23.280> in

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
dying unfortunately unless somehow in

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.890 
dying unfortunately unless somehow in
the<00:03:24.400> next<00:03:24.700> call<00:03:24.880> of<00:03:24.910> duty<00:03:25.000> game<00:03:25.299> it<00:03:25.480> does<00:03:25.690> get

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
the next call of duty game it does get

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.360 
the next call of duty game it does get
revived<00:03:26.290> because<00:03:26.650> if<00:03:26.769> they<00:03:26.890> make<00:03:27.070> another

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
revived because if they make another

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.069 
revived because if they make another
game<00:03:27.670> like<00:03:27.880> Call<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.120> Duty<00:03:28.329> ghosts<00:03:28.600> we're

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
game like Call of Duty ghosts we're

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.740 
game like Call of Duty ghosts we're
definitely<00:03:29.560> going<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.430> have<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.670> problem<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.660> I

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
definitely going to have a problem and I

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.150 
definitely going to have a problem and I
think<00:03:31.780> there's<00:03:32.290> going<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.709> be<00:03:32.739> other<00:03:33.040> games

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
think there's going to be other games

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.009 
think there's going to be other games
that<00:03:33.549> are<00:03:33.700> going<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:33.910> surpass<00:03:34.420> call<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.750> duty

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
that are going to surpass call of duty

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.780 
that are going to surpass call of duty
uh<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.829> don't<00:03:36.040> even<00:03:36.130> think<00:03:36.220> it's<00:03:36.430> gonna<00:03:36.519> be<00:03:36.670> bad

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
uh I don't even think it's gonna be bad

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.770 
uh I don't even think it's gonna be bad
awful<00:03:37.030> either<00:03:37.209> because<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.570> feel<00:03:37.750> like

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
awful either because I feel like

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.720 
awful either because I feel like
battlefield<00:03:38.380> is<00:03:38.560> another<00:03:38.829> repetitive<00:03:39.519> game

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
battlefield is another repetitive game

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.640 
battlefield is another repetitive game
along<00:03:40.090> with<00:03:40.120> call<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.540> duty<00:03:40.750> but<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.290> think<00:03:41.560> it's

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
along with call of duty but I think it's

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.199 
along with call of duty but I think it's
gonna<00:03:41.769> be<00:03:41.829> like<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.070> titanfall<00:03:42.609> game<00:03:43.060> or

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
gonna be like a titanfall game or

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.000 
gonna be like a titanfall game or
something<00:03:43.510> that's<00:03:43.570> gonna<00:03:43.780> maybe<00:03:44.440> come<00:03:44.590> about
