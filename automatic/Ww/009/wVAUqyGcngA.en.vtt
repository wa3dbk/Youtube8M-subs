previous<00:00:12.460> videos<00:00:13.180> I'm<00:00:13.799> trying<00:00:14.799> to<00:00:14.950> relay<00:00:15.309> the

previous videos I'm trying to relay the
track<00:00:15.760> so<00:00:16.720> that<00:00:16.750> it<00:00:17.050> runs<00:00:17.230> from<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.980> scenic

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220

curves<00:01:12.160> joined<00:01:13.149> halfway<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:15.130> a<00:01:15.160> curve<00:01:15.460> starts

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
curves joined halfway so a curve starts

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.900

which<00:01:19.149> is<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.539> pure<00:01:19.959> arc<00:01:22.319> become<00:01:23.319> sharper<00:01:23.890> than

which is a pure arc become sharper than

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.029 
which is a pure arc become sharper than
the<00:01:24.160> arc<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:25.830> 45<00:01:26.830> degrees<00:01:27.759> away<00:01:28.599> through

the arc at 45 degrees away through

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.080 
the arc at 45 degrees away through
flattens<00:01:30.039> out<00:01:30.190> in<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.729> middle<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:33.340> sharper

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
flattens out in the middle it's sharper

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.109 
flattens out in the middle it's sharper
than<00:01:34.569> the<00:01:34.750> arc<00:01:35.050> there<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:35.920> tighter<00:01:36.190> aegis<00:01:36.670> and

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
than the arc there so tighter aegis and

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.419 
than the arc there so tighter aegis and
flattens<00:01:37.750> out<00:01:37.869> down<00:01:38.140> there<00:01:38.380> now<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.009> actual

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
flattens out down there now the actual

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.400 
flattens out down there now the actual
distance<00:01:39.910> is<00:01:40.660> such<00:01:40.989> that<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.440> pure<00:01:42.009> arc<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:43.410> 23

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
distance is such that the pure arc is 23

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.260 
distance is such that the pure arc is 23
inches<00:01:45.149> radius<00:01:46.149> so<00:01:46.450> it's<00:01:46.599> a<00:01:46.690> 46<00:01:47.289> inch<00:01:48.270> gap

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
inches radius so it's a 46 inch gap

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.680 
inches radius so it's a 46 inch gap
between<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.860> two<00:01:51.069> sides<00:01:51.550> for<00:01:51.849> the<00:01:51.940> inner<00:01:52.179> most

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
between the two sides for the inner most

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.300 
between the two sides for the inner most
track<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:56.110> such<00:01:56.470> I'm<00:01:56.679> tempted<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.160> just

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
track and as such I'm tempted to just

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.260 
track and as such I'm tempted to just
follow<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:58.000> radius<00:01:58.679> because<00:01:59.679> the<00:02:00.270> transition

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
follow the radius because the transition

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.020 
follow the radius because the transition
between<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:02.050> 23<00:02:02.890> inch<00:02:02.920> radius<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.640> straight

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
between a 23 inch radius and straight

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.330 
between a 23 inch radius and straight
track<00:02:04.300> is<00:02:04.780> quite<00:02:05.080> smooth<00:02:05.500> I'm<00:02:05.920> going<00:02:06.160> to<00:02:06.220> be

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
track is quite smooth I'm going to be

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
using as in this case become flexible

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.510 
using as in this case become flexible
track<00:02:08.819> which<00:02:09.819> if<00:02:10.239> you<00:02:10.599> don't<00:02:11.319> force<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:12.010> would

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
track which if you don't force it would

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.900 
track which if you don't force it would
form<00:02:13.000> some<00:02:13.629> sort<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.900> transition<00:02:14.410> curve<00:02:14.910> but

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
form some sort of transition curve but

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.960 
form some sort of transition curve but
the<00:02:16.000> point<00:02:16.239> here<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.580> from<00:02:18.580> what<00:02:18.790> I've

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
the point here is that from what I've

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.270 
the point here is that from what I've
seen<00:02:19.830> briefly<00:02:20.830> if<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.460> use<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.670> cat<00:02:23.280> approach

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
seen briefly if you use a cat approach

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.020 
seen briefly if you use a cat approach
to<00:02:24.670> trans

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
to trans

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.559 
to trans
curves<00:02:25.480> then<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.890> would<00:02:27.160> have<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.700> slow<00:02:28.120> start

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
curves then you would have a slow start

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.410 
curves then you would have a slow start
at<00:02:28.780> each<00:02:28.930> end<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:30.430> steeper<00:02:30.880> part<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.330> the

comments<00:03:01.410> about<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:03.750> let's<00:03:04.750> call<00:03:05.170> it

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
comments about this let's call it

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.410 
comments about this let's call it
practical<00:03:05.800> way<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:05.980> achieving<00:03:06.340> some<00:03:06.970> sort<00:03:07.269> of

practical way of achieving some sort of

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.479 
practical way of achieving some sort of
transition<00:03:07.870> curve<00:03:08.110> but<00:03:08.890> it's<00:03:09.100> actually<00:03:09.459> a

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
transition curve but it's actually a

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.640 
transition curve but it's actually a
double<00:03:09.610> transition<00:03:10.239> curve<00:03:10.440> using<00:03:11.440> the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
double transition curve using the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.259 
double transition curve using the
flexible<00:03:12.069> track<00:03:12.340> itself<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.970> form<00:03:13.120> a

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
flexible track itself to form a

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.770 
flexible track itself to form a
transition<00:03:13.720> curve<00:03:13.950> or<00:03:15.300> producing<00:03:16.300> something

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
transition curve or producing something

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.710 
transition curve or producing something
which<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.380> more<00:03:17.620> accurate<00:03:18.010> by<00:03:18.489> drawing<00:03:18.880> arcs

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
which is more accurate by drawing arcs

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.410 
which is more accurate by drawing arcs
on<00:03:19.930> different<00:03:20.350> pieces<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.800> paper<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.420> linking

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
on different pieces of paper and linking

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.140 
on different pieces of paper and linking
the<00:03:22.540> arcs<00:03:22.780> together<00:03:23.170> into<00:03:23.800> a<00:03:24.150> transition

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
the arcs together into a transition

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.490 
the arcs together into a transition
curve<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.790> that's<00:03:28.030> really<00:03:28.780> more<00:03:29.110> like<00:03:29.290> an

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
curve so that's really more like an

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.610 
curve so that's really more like an
elliptical<00:03:29.769> shape<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.810> maybe<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:32.260> should<00:03:32.500> have

elliptical shape and maybe I should have
