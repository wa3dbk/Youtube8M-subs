pandemonium<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:23.000> particular<00:02:23.360> level<00:02:23.690> is

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
pandemonium this particular level is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.810 
pandemonium this particular level is
called<00:02:23.959> Dragoon<00:02:24.290> sky<00:02:24.590> boys<00:02:24.890> one<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.730> the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
called Dragoon sky boys one of the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.060 
called Dragoon sky boys one of the
hardest<00:02:26.120> in<00:02:26.209> my<00:02:26.329> opinion<00:02:26.570> I<00:02:27.110> don't<00:02:27.590> know<00:02:27.650> what

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
hardest in my opinion I don't know what

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.470 
hardest in my opinion I don't know what
the<00:02:28.190> actual<00:02:28.370> hardest<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.850> probably<00:02:29.180> storm

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
the actual hardest is probably storm

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.259 
the actual hardest is probably storm
temple<00:02:30.459> but<00:02:31.459> anyways<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:31.940> one<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
temple but anyways this is one of the

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.569 
temple but anyways this is one of the
more<00:02:32.360> iconic<00:02:32.690> levels<00:02:33.049> in<00:02:33.140> my<00:02:33.230> opinion<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.769> I

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
more iconic levels in my opinion and I

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.310 
more iconic levels in my opinion and I
was<00:02:34.820> going<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.060> show<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.239> two<00:02:35.540> levels<00:02:35.900> but<00:02:36.140> as

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
was going to show you two levels but as

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.840 
was going to show you two levels but as
it<00:02:36.739> turned<00:02:36.920> out<00:02:37.010> there's<00:02:37.250> only<00:02:37.370> time<00:02:37.640> enough

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
it turned out there's only time enough

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.910 
it turned out there's only time enough
for<00:02:37.880> one<00:02:38.209> well<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:38.989> mean<00:02:39.230> technically<00:02:39.590> i<00:02:39.709> can

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
for one well I mean technically i can

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.949 
for one well I mean technically i can
upload<00:02:40.310> as<00:02:40.519> long<00:02:40.640> as<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:40.790> want<00:02:41.000> but<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.390> didn't

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
upload as long as I want but I didn't

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.479 
upload as long as I want but I didn't
want<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.109> leave<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.350> too<00:02:42.500> long<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.890> tend<00:02:43.459> to

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
want to leave it too long I tend to

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.310 
want to leave it too long I tend to
stick<00:02:43.700> around<00:02:43.760> like<00:02:44.359> eight<00:02:44.540> minutes<00:02:44.900> or<00:02:45.049> seven

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
stick around like eight minutes or seven

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.680 
stick around like eight minutes or seven
minutes<00:02:45.560> or<00:02:45.650> whatever<00:02:45.769> for<00:02:46.340> these<00:02:46.459> videos<00:02:46.690> so

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
minutes or whatever for these videos so

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.610 
minutes or whatever for these videos so
I<00:02:48.230> thought<00:02:48.500> want<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.799> be<00:02:48.859> enough<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:50.480> also<00:02:50.720> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
I thought want to be enough and also the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.229 
I thought want to be enough and also the
move<00:02:51.769> from<00:02:51.950> pandemonium<00:02:52.250> ones<00:02:52.670> pandemonium

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
move from pandemonium ones pandemonium

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.090 
move from pandemonium ones pandemonium
to<00:02:53.420> yes<00:02:53.959> there<00:02:54.170> was<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.320> sequel<00:02:54.650> believe<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.040> or

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
to yes there was a sequel believe it or

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.090 
to yes there was a sequel believe it or
not<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:56.450> think<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.500> second<00:02:57.799> game<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:58.010> actually

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
not I think the second game is actually

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.009 
not I think the second game is actually
a<00:02:58.280> much<00:02:58.370> better<00:02:58.640> game<00:02:58.700> because<00:02:59.660> it's<00:02:59.840> much

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
a much better game because it's much

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.110 
a much better game because it's much
more<00:03:00.200> balanced<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.799> know<00:03:00.920> this<00:03:01.160> it's

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
more balanced you know this it's

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.099 
more balanced you know this it's
actually<00:03:02.600> possible<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:03.230> what<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.500> mean<00:03:05.109> it's

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
actually possible is what I mean it's

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.780 
actually possible is what I mean it's
yeah<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.890> level<00:03:07.130> is<00:03:07.190> much<00:03:07.220> more<00:03:07.549> interesting

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
yeah the level is much more interesting

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.380 
yeah the level is much more interesting
I<00:03:08.090> think<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:09.190> notice<00:03:10.190> its<00:03:10.370> overall<00:03:10.730> more

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
I think and notice its overall more

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.120 
I think and notice its overall more
enjoyable<00:03:11.780> experience<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.769> can<00:03:12.920> tell<00:03:13.100> that

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
enjoyable experience you can tell that

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.099 
enjoyable experience you can tell that
actually<00:03:13.519> put<00:03:13.640> more<00:03:13.790> effort<00:03:14.060> into<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.420> all

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
actually put more effort into it all

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.229 
actually put more effort into it all
that<00:03:15.260> kind<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.500> stuff<00:03:15.560> but<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.400> mean<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.790> loses

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
that kind of stuff but I mean it loses

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.730 
that kind of stuff but I mean it loses
that<00:03:17.390> feel<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
that feel of the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.140 
that feel of the
an<00:03:18.830> enjoyable<00:03:19.130> game<00:03:19.460> to<00:03:19.640> me<00:03:19.730> I<00:03:19.880> don't<00:03:20.060> know

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
an enjoyable game to me I don't know

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.880 
an enjoyable game to me I don't know
what<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.570> they're<00:03:20.840> just<00:03:21.050> something<00:03:21.800> about

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
what it is they're just something about

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.310 
what it is they're just something about
it<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.190> doesn't<00:03:22.730> appeal<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.030> me<00:03:23.210> as<00:03:23.990> this

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
it that doesn't appeal to me as this

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.880 
it that doesn't appeal to me as this
game<00:03:24.530> does<00:03:24.740> some<00:03:25.730> kind<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.390> weird

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890

level you choose on the lower select
screen<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.830> you<00:04:03.890> can't<00:04:04.130> change<00:04:04.370> within<00:04:05.120> the

screen and you can't change within the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.900 
screen and you can't change within the
level<00:04:05.540> without<00:04:05.660> using<00:04:05.930> cheats<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.730> oh<00:04:07.730> yeah

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
level without using cheats and oh yeah

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.700 
level without using cheats and oh yeah
by<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.090> way<00:04:08.210> before<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.570> known<00:04:08.750> asks<00:04:09.140> I<00:04:09.260> did<00:04:09.590> you

by the way before I known asks I did you

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.350 
by the way before I known asks I did you

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
choose to get extra health points it I

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.030 
choose to get extra health points it I
would<00:04:11.720> not<00:04:11.840> be<00:04:12.050> able<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.290> do<00:04:12.380> on<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.680> default

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
would not be able to do on the default

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.220 
would not be able to do on the default
which<00:04:13.220> is<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.580> health<00:04:13.820> points<00:04:14.180> yeah<00:04:14.930> to

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
which is to health points yeah to

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.289 
which is to health points yeah to
 health<00:04:15.890> points<00:04:16.250> who<00:04:16.430> does<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:16.790> on

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
 health points who does this on

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.150 
 health points who does this on
to<00:04:17.840> health<00:04:18.110> points<00:04:18.730> but<00:04:20.680> yeah<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:21.709> mean<00:04:21.830> Nikki

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
to health points but yeah I mean Nikki

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.680 
to health points but yeah I mean Nikki
and<00:04:22.400> Fargus<00:04:22.730> there<00:04:22.940> is<00:04:23.030> no<00:04:23.180> balance<00:04:23.420> between

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
and Fargus there is no balance between

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.960 
and Fargus there is no balance between
them<00:04:23.960> till<00:04:24.200> nikki<00:04:24.530> is<00:04:24.740> much<00:04:25.430> much<00:04:25.730> better

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
them till nikki is much much better

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.880 
them till nikki is much much better
character<00:04:26.420> she<00:04:26.960> gets<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.230> double<00:04:27.500> jump<00:04:27.740> which

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
character she gets the double jump which

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.640 
character she gets the double jump which
I<00:04:28.040> used<00:04:28.250> frequently<00:04:28.940> miss<00:04:29.420> and<00:04:29.630> father<00:04:30.350> loses

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
I used frequently miss and father loses

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.710 
I used frequently miss and father loses
that<00:04:30.950> but<00:04:31.550> he<00:04:31.640> gains<00:04:31.880> like<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.150> like<00:04:32.690> a

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
that but he gains like a like a

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.450 
that but he gains like a like a
cartwheel<00:04:33.140> attack<00:04:33.560> where<00:04:33.800> he<00:04:33.860> just<00:04:34.040> spins

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
cartwheel attack where he just spins

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.400 
cartwheel attack where he just spins
forward<00:04:34.790> and<00:04:35.000> damages<00:04:35.360> things<00:04:35.540> which<00:04:36.230> you

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
forward and damages things which you

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.020 
forward and damages things which you
know<00:04:36.530> it's<00:04:36.890> not<00:04:37.010> bad<00:04:37.220> I<00:04:37.430> mean<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:37.700> can<00:04:37.850> see

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
know it's not bad I mean you can see

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.610 
know it's not bad I mean you can see
some<00:04:38.240> situations<00:04:38.840> where<00:04:39.020> they'll<00:04:39.140> be<00:04:39.170> useful

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
some situations where they'll be useful

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.560 
some situations where they'll be useful
but<00:04:39.800> it's<00:04:40.430> just<00:04:40.580> nowhere<00:04:40.790> near<00:04:41.060> as<00:04:41.180> useful<00:04:41.360> as

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
but it's just nowhere near as useful as

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.480 
but it's just nowhere near as useful as
the<00:04:41.720> double<00:04:41.990> jump<00:04:42.170> is<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.500> there's<00:04:43.040> no<00:04:43.190> time

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
the double jump is and there's no time

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.280 
the double jump is and there's no time
where<00:04:43.730> you<00:04:43.790> think<00:04:44.000> hmm<00:04:44.570> i<00:04:44.660> wish<00:04:44.870> i<00:04:44.990> was<00:04:45.080> playing

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
where you think hmm i wish i was playing

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.750 
where you think hmm i wish i was playing
as<00:04:45.440> Fargus<00:04:45.830> right<00:04:46.010> now<00:04:46.190> that<00:04:46.550> there<00:04:46.730> just

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
as Fargus right now that there just

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.050 
as Fargus right now that there just
isn't<00:04:47.270> at<00:04:47.390> all<00:04:48.160> they<00:04:49.160> said<00:04:49.370> by<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:49.730> way<00:04:49.910> is

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
isn't at all they said by the way is

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.480 
isn't at all they said by the way is
like<00:04:50.660> a<00:04:50.830> transforming<00:04:51.830> gate<00:04:51.980> as<00:04:52.100> a<00:04:52.220> few<00:04:52.400> of

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
like a transforming gate as a few of

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.160 
like a transforming gate as a few of
these<00:04:52.610> in<00:04:52.670> the<00:04:52.850> game<00:04:53.000> we<00:04:53.660> transform<00:04:54.080> into

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
these in the game we transform into

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.560 
these in the game we transform into
different<00:04:54.500> animals<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.970> dragon<00:04:56.270> is<00:04:56.330> probably

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
different animals the dragon is probably

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.880 
different animals the dragon is probably
the<00:04:56.660> most<00:04:56.810> interesting<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.380> lot<00:04:57.620> but<00:04:57.740> there's

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
the most interesting a lot but there's

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.030 
the most interesting a lot but there's
also<00:04:58.040> a<00:04:58.490> rhino<00:04:59.150> frog<00:05:00.140> and<00:05:00.380> probably<00:05:00.770> something

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
also a rhino frog and probably something

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.160 
also a rhino frog and probably something
else<00:05:01.190> but<00:05:01.310> I<00:05:01.370> can't<00:05:01.580> remember<00:05:01.840> but<00:05:02.840> anyways

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
else but I can't remember but anyways

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.320 
else but I can't remember but anyways
what<00:05:03.590> they're<00:05:03.740> saying<00:05:03.980> oh<00:05:04.160> yeah<00:05:05.060> about<00:05:05.120> the

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
what they're saying oh yeah about the

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.880 
what they're saying oh yeah about the
characters<00:05:06.190> I<00:05:07.540> mean<00:05:08.540> basically<00:05:08.930> yeah<00:05:09.560> there's

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
characters I mean basically yeah there's

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.770 
characters I mean basically yeah there's
no<00:05:10.040> reason<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.400> use<00:05:10.550> fagus<00:05:10.820> in<00:05:11.060> most<00:05:11.240> cases<00:05:11.480> are

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
no reason to use fagus in most cases are

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.420 
no reason to use fagus in most cases are
generally<00:05:12.170> stick<00:05:12.380> to<00:05:12.500> use<00:05:12.590> Nikki

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
generally stick to use Nikki

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.980 
generally stick to use Nikki
you<00:05:14.430> can<00:05:14.580> think<00:05:14.820> of<00:05:14.910> fargas<00:05:15.300> as<00:05:15.480> the<00:05:15.750> meg

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
you can think of fargas as the meg

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.700 
you can think of fargas as the meg
whites<00:05:16.350> of<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.830> pandemonium<00:05:17.130> world<00:05:18.710> but

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
whites of the pandemonium world but

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.230 
whites of the pandemonium world but
again<00:05:19.800> with<00:05:20.160> the<00:05:20.250> second<00:05:20.580> game<00:05:20.730> I<00:05:20.910> think<00:05:20.940> they

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
again with the second game I think they

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.310 
again with the second game I think they
actually<00:05:21.270> balance<00:05:21.780> them<00:05:21.870> out<00:05:21.930> a<00:05:21.990> lot<00:05:22.140> more

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
actually balance them out a lot more

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.320 
actually balance them out a lot more
partially<00:05:23.310> because<00:05:23.430> Nikki's<00:05:23.880> double<00:05:24.150> jump

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
partially because Nikki's double jump

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.480 
partially because Nikki's double jump
isn't<00:05:24.540> anyone<00:05:25.080> there<00:05:25.200> is<00:05:25.230> useful<00:05:25.680> also

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
isn't anyone there is useful also

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.760 
isn't anyone there is useful also
because<00:05:26.930> Fargus<00:05:27.930> games<00:05:28.110> an<00:05:28.260> attack<00:05:28.500> where<00:05:28.650> it

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
because Fargus games an attack where it

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.170 
because Fargus games an attack where it
can<00:05:28.860> actually<00:05:29.070> throw<00:05:29.280> his<00:05:29.520> little<00:05:29.730> boomerang

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
can actually throw his little boomerang

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.050 
can actually throw his little boomerang
thing<00:05:30.450> called<00:05:30.780> seed<00:05:31.170> which<00:05:32.070> is<00:05:32.250> therefore

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
thing called seed which is therefore

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.700 
thing called seed which is therefore
called<00:05:33.390> the<00:05:33.600> pseudo<00:05:33.900> rang<00:05:34.140> in<00:05:34.350> that<00:05:34.500> game<00:05:34.680> I

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
called the pseudo rang in that game I

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.610 
called the pseudo rang in that game I
think<00:05:35.690> you<00:05:36.690> can<00:05:36.810> actually<00:05:36.930> throw<00:05:37.170> that<00:05:37.410> news

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
think you can actually throw that news

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.780 
think you can actually throw that news
as<00:05:37.740> an<00:05:37.830> attack<00:05:38.100> which<00:05:38.220> is<00:05:38.370> pretty<00:05:38.490> cool<00:05:38.730> I

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
as an attack which is pretty cool I

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.760 
as an attack which is pretty cool I
guess<00:05:38.850> so<00:05:39.780> that's<00:05:40.110> another<00:05:40.290> reason<00:05:40.500> why<00:05:40.650> the

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
guess so that's another reason why the

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.230 
guess so that's another reason why the
second<00:05:41.190> game<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.490> actually<00:05:41.640> probably

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
second game is actually probably

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.350 
second game is actually probably
regarded<00:05:42.780> as<00:05:42.900> a<00:05:42.930> better<00:05:43.350> game<00:05:43.760> but<00:05:44.760> again<00:05:45.030> not

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
regarded as a better game but again not

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.560 
regarded as a better game but again not
so<00:05:45.540> enjoyable<00:05:45.930> in<00:05:46.230> my<00:05:46.350> opinion<00:05:47.240> but<00:05:48.240> anyways

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
so enjoyable in my opinion but anyways

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.180 
so enjoyable in my opinion but anyways
yet<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.470> level<00:05:49.710> design<00:05:49.800> is<00:05:49.980> pretty

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
yet the level design is pretty

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.920 
yet the level design is pretty
interesting<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.390> one<00:05:51.600> of<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.750> things

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
interesting that is one of the things

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
interesting that is one of the things
that<00:05:51.990> appeals<00:05:52.290> to<00:05:52.380> me<00:05:52.500> the<00:05:52.620> level<00:05:52.830> design

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
that appeals to me the level design

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.270 
that appeals to me the level design
along<00:05:53.490> with<00:05:53.640> the<00:05:53.730> music<00:05:53.850> that<00:05:54.180> goes<00:05:54.300> with<00:05:54.570> them

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
along with the music that goes with them

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.320 
along with the music that goes with them
this<00:05:56.280> is<00:05:56.400> another<00:05:56.580> one<00:05:56.790> of<00:05:56.820> those<00:05:56.970> games<00:05:57.150> where

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
this is another one of those games where

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.820 
this is another one of those games where
I<00:05:57.480> do<00:05:57.570> actually<00:05:57.780> have<00:05:57.990> music<00:05:58.380> from<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.680> game

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
I do actually have music from the game

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.020 
I do actually have music from the game
in<00:05:59.010> my<00:05:59.160> itunes

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.820 
and I'm afraid if you do play this game
that<00:06:07.180> as<00:06:07.300> a<00:06:07.330> sound<00:06:07.660> you'll<00:06:07.990> get<00:06:08.200> very<00:06:08.530> very

that as a sound you'll get very very

partially<00:06:52.930> because<00:06:53.050> everyone<00:06:53.650> hated<00:06:53.950> this

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.040 
partially because everyone hated this

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.590 
partially because everyone hated this

game too much and partially because well
I<00:06:58.630> don't<00:06:58.900> think<00:06:59.050> anyone<00:06:59.410> would<00:06:59.500> have<00:06:59.590> made<00:06:59.740> it

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
I don't think anyone would have made it

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.000 
I don't think anyone would have made it
past<00:06:59.980> one<00:07:00.130> level<00:07:00.490> to<00:07:00.610> be<00:07:00.730> honest<00:07:01.740> but<00:07:02.740> enough

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.010 
past one level to be honest but enough

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.800 
past one level to be honest but enough
complaining<00:07:03.400> despite<00:07:04.150> everything<00:07:04.360> I've<00:07:04.600> said

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
complaining despite everything I've said

complaining despite everything I've said
I<00:07:05.020> do<00:07:05.230> think<00:07:05.770> that<00:07:05.800> this<00:07:05.950> is<00:07:06.010> a<00:07:06.130> fantastic<00:07:06.370> game

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
I do think that this is a fantastic game

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.330 
I do think that this is a fantastic game
well<00:07:07.750> worth<00:07:07.900> a<00:07:08.050> try<00:07:08.260> and<00:07:08.500> you<00:07:08.920> can<00:07:09.070> probably

well worth a try and you can probably

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.530 
well worth a try and you can probably
