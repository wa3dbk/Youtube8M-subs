00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.260
 audi r8 intercepted title always 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.540
 actually supercar before this was 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.299
 honda nsx which produced 12 years and 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.590
 Now here's the r8 car for 7 years 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.939
 she's just gorgeous yes yes everyone hi 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.730
 this will congratulate me 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.470
 tell yourself about me 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.939
 my name is r8 v10 plus and I am the very room 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.369
 outside the machine received and retouch 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.380
 Exterior new bumpers LEDs 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.910
 although the latter were so 1 branded 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.340
 chips cars there they just became 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.320
 other more modern yet 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.930
 added a couple of new colors for example 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.820
 such a blue is not just blue 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:52.829
 special color and punk blue 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:54.270
 my favorite costume on the main 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.329
 intrigue of course was a new box 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.250
 gears this is not exactly new 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.289
 box with two clutches all as 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.370
 asked the buyer and she looks more like 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.640
 on auto moto 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.560
 urban cars in fact it is even 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.100
 not that s tronic which we know it 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.479
 completely different box 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.759
 Well, this is which side to see 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.430
 do the box anyway the Italians from 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.380
 graciano they are not the purpose of collecting the city just 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.540
 Now problems and spare parts replaced 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.700
 minutes of processes as the skin and observes 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.460
 hard workers from germany dover triples was 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.890
 he was really good he didn't know what 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.500
 similar emphasis but he had some 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.780
 problems unfortunately this is a problem with the loder 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.160
 how are you led for the new gearbox 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.640
 another good question 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.220
 Groner I promise she will cancel 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.410
 due to s-tronic car became faster on 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.619
 four tenths of a second is huge 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.619
 breakthrough 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.020
 this is my favorite exercise in 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.720
 the academy was always the first I can do 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.600
 0 100 kilometers per hour 55 times without getting tired 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.039
 although I can probably even more 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.630
 first thing I certainly believed if 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.170
 here is the manual mode which is not so 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.150
 enough 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.369
 other models rs 7 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.369
 I have it easier is not here 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.030
 still god box something else only 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.040
 the name is the same and I am without manual 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.040
 regime nowhere on the project on 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.900
 I have found another advantage 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.120
 now the box can jump over 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.970
 pass it a very long time for example a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.640
 Transmission overtaking time 7 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.540
 switch to 2 getting just in 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.540
 cannon speaker 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.620
 our car is not just a r8 top 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.110
 motor 5 2 on 10 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.000
 it still is without version + a little more 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.890
 charged so to speak 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.140
 acceleration to one hundred three and a half seconds 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.030
 this is the fastest car on so 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.209
 avtovesti 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.159
 wow a little 550 horses 540 not 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.290
 tones red zone eight and a half 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.290
 thousand revolutions and that's a little 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.840
 Usually these machines no one thinks about 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.000
 fuel consumption probably except engineer 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.150
 so as a bonus, they lowered 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.700
 consumption per 1 liter for every hundred 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.470
 just a trifle 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.079
 cut the gas off like a box right away 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.000
 includes the last seventh gear as 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:33.019
 times to save precious fuel 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.079
 au 98 Teleph machine so you're on the usual 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.079
 the road 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.350
 I do not understand people how to count liters 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.360
 gasoline for a penny 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.260
 when the car itself stands as small 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.260
 Vacation home 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.360
 the change in the cabin is clean here 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.000
 almost nothing decorative 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.730
 changed added new colors different 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.950
 leather trim carbon fiber inserts and all 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.690
 in fact, all this was already a version 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.550
 Ji just got it now 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.640
 final look and not limited 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.500
 circulation my favorite multimedia or 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.959
 the onboard computer display remained 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.550
 the same as it is on the old Skoda 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:17.680
 Octavia but it is here that is completely 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.180
 don't need to know anything for another 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.070
 responsible live and sit here normal 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.150
 they are simply regulated and not just 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.919
 move back and forth 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.440
 while there is even a comfortable side 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.440
 support sit like in cast 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:41.089
 to evaluate all the features of the car 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:45.550
 you came to the race track 

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:48.020
 it's the same car of a different color 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.580
 as well as before 10 brain sport 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.670
 which makes habits cars more 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.970
 racing opening 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.970
 he is mother 

00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:02.859
 rarely brakes couldnâ€™t track them 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.150
 even on wet r8 is amazing 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.159
 listen all thanks to the system 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.620
 stabilization and of course all-wheel drive 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.650
 someone 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.160
 need a little correction wheel to 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.500
 regain control of the car 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.380
 she's great 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:28.220
 200 frames an hour is still nonsense 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.220
 add item 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.210
 they just forced the engine they 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.860
 able to hang it a little lower 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.380
 accordingly the center of gravity converges 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.540
 on gentlemen machine thresholds driven 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.670
 not about everything before me year chased by 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.070
 racing track forcing to drop 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.810
 every extra kilogram I weigh now 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:53.000
 slightly more than half the 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:54.770
 it is centered less than before the decrease 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.240
 the weight of the second important point after the new 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.870
 gearbox body modernized it 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.460
 weighs only two hundred and ten kilograms 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.150
 brake discs become wavy as 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.680
 on a motorcycle 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.270
 even minus 2 kilogram engineers before 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.060
 feel free to use carbon 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.340
 now they split up splitters 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.100
 and rename cal skirt of side mirrors 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.470
 gills kef pattern all of it from winged 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.430
 mothers 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.970
 weight distribution approached 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.380
 perfect 43 on 57 manual mode on 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.180
 the race track is just 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.700
 by the way because sometimes a bunch 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.450
 turns day it makes no sense to switch 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.580
 on raised 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.530
 and stretch the meaning of the bar a little bit in 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.200
 cut-off but drive on the same 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.720
 transfer as if not to waste time true 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.169
 the whole irony is attention 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:48.929
 on manual mode and right now I'm 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:52.979
 drove two laps I do not have different races. 

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:52.979
 car guess what should 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.160
 I don't know how 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.889
 in this as we have charm at work i 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.630
 Turning food digging and honest and faithful 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.139
 jeju yourself comfortable i can catch 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.139
 of this 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.920
 kill help 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.880
 intercourse 5 cards 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.760
 wait a minute I'll show you something else 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:47.010
 honestly did you see the presenter shoot 

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:49.120
 car while here too 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.280
 cosmetic changes were for him 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.500
 very much to face and a new robotic 

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.050
 box made this supercar a bit 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.470
 it is more convenient to think of how 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.470
 storage device
