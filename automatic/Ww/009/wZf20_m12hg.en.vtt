00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.840
 father's day is easy to do 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.179
 Let's go to the material you will need 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.639
 I walk by step 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.619
 Father's day and the child are coming. 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.539
 do not know what to do with parents and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.119
 Sometimes I really like to invent. 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.920
 so I'll help you even an idea 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.350
 What to do for Father's Day? 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.560
 from this portfolio it can be used to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.859
 put document to put cellphone 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.350
 finally there goes from the head of the father how 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.399
 He wants to wear looks pretty and easy. 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.430
 to do here in case I have already cut the mold 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:45.450
 what I want to do about simon already here 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.789
 of 2 pix with stylet or with scissors 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.879
 So much so, I'm going to start building it. 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:01:01.530
 I'm going to take a plunge and I'll take off well 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:03.719
 here I'm going to fuck that rolling a side 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.830
 on the other I'm going to do the same thing 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.830
 on this other side 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.420
 What is going to stay like this now I'll paste 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.829
 This part leaving here I stumbled 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.729
 up 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:33.399
 I'll paste this one down here. 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.380
 I will first begin necklace here 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:40.289
 It's easier that we're going to hit the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.289
 still another part of the bag 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:56.550
 I'll tighten until everything is 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.560
 now I'll paste the side of the column 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.380
 I'm going to need to glue the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:13.950
 few are hitting a little 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:26.640
 glue sure fashion and tighten and I will do 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:33.870
 The same thing here and closes here and I go 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:37.590
 doing the same thing on the other side can 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:42.600
 to do that, it's already stuck there 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.440
 and I'm going to close this part here and 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.380
 I'll paste 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.989
 I'll stick that little tongue here or hold it. 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:57.920
 here to the size where I want to 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.920
 The risk I've already given here will hold 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:10.530
 here none of the tares is crooked and 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:13.220
 I'll paste here first back 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.220
 I'll hold 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.099
 and I'll paste the rest here. 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:44.390

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:55.260

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:56.370
 in this blog here that was like that 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.830
 faith that holds 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:06.060
 I'll pass some glue well. 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:16.739
 here I can take a side and I'm going 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:20.880
 hold so it does not open 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.630
