00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.129
 in the previous chapter of loves 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.590
 crossed a call from the manager of the 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:12.340
 band prevented the kiss between soft and mark 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.620
 I suffered resigned to give life 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.510
 Jennifer and Joey spent one night 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.210
 romantic together 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.920
 and Jennifer invited sophie's cousin to 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.920
 visit her to cheer her up 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 Y 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.920
 Y 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.690
 noon on Saturday had just passed 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.930
 and the cell stop and it did not stop 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.670
 ringing she pretended not to hear him and 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.390
 I used to watch videos on the internet 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.550
 to distract a bit all the time 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.320
 he got calls from dark manager 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.330
 lives that he desperately asked and demanded 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.250
 that he publicly retracted what he 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.350
 he had written on his blog about his 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.990
 unlinking the band and that 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.299
 will present tonight at the show 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.329
 even threatened to initiate actions 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.850
 legal if he did not do it but his end did not 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.979
 was arm twisting to perón and 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.770
 I had called him a couple of times and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.539
 I had even sent him messages 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.930
 asking for forgiveness and telling him that 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.789
 I missed but it was too late 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.560
 Sophia entered the page for the last time 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.679
 of the band and their respective 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.380
 members to see if they had written something 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.229
 about what happened and found something that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.080
 enraged I would say I had written a note 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.750
 about the lack of sophie codes 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.049
 for having abandoned them one day before 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.950
 an important show was just go talking 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.250
 of lack of codes marc by his side 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.170
 he was somewhat listless and went down to do his 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.039
 afternoon exercise routine without 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.039
 Many moods 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.530
 jennifer fold neighbor apartment for 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.330
 tell her what happened and what 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.849
 asked not to make plans for the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.550
 night since I expected everyone to leave 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.260
 the minutes included someone who 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.989
 it would arrive at any time 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.739
 somewhere far from where it would play to give 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.200
 life to extract a little his life he 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.720
 accepted and asked if they should invite 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.720
 marte to which jennifer replied yes 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.870
 together they began to think because it would be the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.970
 ideal place for him and it did not take long 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.239
 in coming to the conclusion of what happens 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.670
 the night and the next day in the forest 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.629
 camping would be the best option a great 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.980
 show and got dressed and went down to the reception 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.110
 I thought I would play the piano for a while 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.870
 calm your anger but when you get to the 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.640
 downstairs he could see through the window that 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.870
 someone was approaching the door of 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.740
 entrance and he peeked out and lips was álex to 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.440
 her cousin and best friend 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.090
 to receive her with a hug and that 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.300
 He asked me to tell him everything there was 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.300
 occurred 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.770
 so they went to the bar while partner 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.140
 he prepared drinks for both he told 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.959
 with a mixture of fury and sadness that 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.110
 her cousin had never seen anything before 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.630
 what had happened since the previous day 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.000
 joey and jennifer went down the stairs 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.400
 to consult with your neighbor the plans 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.250
 at night and as they approached the 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.590
 gym jennifer was expected 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.800
 the voice of sonia and from the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.050
 next room saw the ex the 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.790
 greetings and asked if they were from 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.120
 agreed to go camping that night with 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.480
 the neighbors 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.299
 Sofía initially resisted since the 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.790
 situation with marc was quite uncomfortable 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.840
 but after the family insisted 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.720
 as he agreed outside and invited 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.729
 frame and he said he would accompany them if 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.100
 well I thought Sophie felt nothing 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.430
 because he did not want to miss an opportunity 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.290
 to be with her he said ayoví that 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.290
 unites the new one had a cabin now ni 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.690
 folks walking distance from there so 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.249
 he called him and asked if they could pass 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.259
 the night action 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:36.229
 and told him that he gladly gave 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.050
 keys so marc went straight to 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:42.009
 look for it 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.440
 I'm a little before sunset they arrived 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.810
 the five to the cabin was a place 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.330
 comfortable and perfect to relax and 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.909
 forget about the world many sonisphere 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.770
 I was more than happy that Marc 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:56.199
 he had offered to sweat the swimming to him 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.560
 and they both talked about all that food was 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.509
 prepared with brightness for the first time 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.849
 better I managed to get attention during 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.849
 the autumn after so long 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.520
 I already had a long time 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.520
 talking together 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.610
 sophie meanwhile was entertained 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.610
 playing the guitar in front of the bonfire 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.940
 and in science 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.000
 after dinner everyone stayed 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.789
 talking and drinking until very late and the 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.430
 only one that disappeared almost without anyone 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.810
 I will notice it 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.330
 when the schedule arrived in which to give 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.560
 glass touched he got into a room 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.560
 and went to sleep 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.100
 attack 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.139
 do not 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.379
 the truth 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.629
 and the second to inform when all 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:03.310
 they were now they climbed the stairs 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:06.640
 to go to the room 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.910
 but when he reached the top floor he could not 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.220
 avoid deviating and go to the room in 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.880
 the one who was going to sleep the woman how 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.310
 crazy I fear you did not find him sleeping and 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.460
 he felt like kissing her 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.400
 I did not want to wake her up but I needed 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.610
 be near her so she lay down 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:32.130
 his side in bed and turned off the light and he 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.130
 He stayed there with her for a while
