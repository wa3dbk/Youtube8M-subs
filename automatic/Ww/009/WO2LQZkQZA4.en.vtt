they<00:00:22.079> were<00:00:22.140> always<00:00:22.409> hidden<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.669> only<00:00:23.909> want

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
they were always hidden so I only want

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.179

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:29.909 
width and height an area as the stage so

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.909 
width and height an area as the stage so
I'll<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.239> that<00:00:30.269> by<00:00:30.599> creating<00:00:30.659> a<00:00:31.050> mask<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.739> only

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919

the<00:01:00.180> film<00:01:00.450> matters<00:01:00.810> so<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.110> never<00:01:01.500> use<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> stroke

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the film matters so I never use a stroke

here<00:01:12.030> Green<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:13.080> work<00:01:13.260> pretty<00:01:13.980> well<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.670> I

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
here Green will work pretty well so I

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.030 
here Green will work pretty well so I
have<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.480> rectangle<00:01:16.200> tool<00:01:16.350> selected<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
have my rectangle tool selected and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.370 
have my rectangle tool selected and
instead<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.940> trying<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.479> draw<00:01:18.659> exactly<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
instead of trying to draw exactly the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.560 
instead of trying to draw exactly the
same<00:01:19.620> size<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.070> at<00:01:20.220> stage<00:01:20.490> I'm<00:01:20.940> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.390> draw

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
same size as at stage I'm going to draw

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
same size as at stage I'm going to draw
a<00:01:21.600> rectangle<00:01:21.780> that's<00:01:22.260> any<00:01:22.500> size<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.460> then

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
a rectangle that's any size and then

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370 
a rectangle that's any size and then
I'll<00:01:23.670> use<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.880> align<00:01:24.300> panel<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.930> set<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.260> at

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
I'll use the align panel to set it at

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.100 
I'll use the align panel to set it at
the<00:01:25.470> same<00:01:25.740> size<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.850> stage<00:01:27.120> so<00:01:27.870> I'll<00:01:27.960> use

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the same size as the stage so I'll use

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.780 
the same size as the stage so I'll use
the<00:01:28.229> selection<00:01:28.590> tool<00:01:28.740> I'll<00:01:29.130> select<00:01:29.280> the

the selection tool I'll select the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.990 
the selection tool I'll select the
rectangle<00:01:30.470> open<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> align<00:01:31.799> panel<00:01:31.970> make<00:01:32.970> sure

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
align to stage is checked and then I'm

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.060 
align to stage is checked and then I'm
going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.850> click<00:01:36.090> match<00:01:36.450> width<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.229> height<00:01:37.830> in

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070

the match size section and the rectangle
is<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> same<00:01:40.890> size<00:01:41.190> as<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> stage<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:42.690> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
is the same size as the stage and then I

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.120 
is the same size as the stage and then I
just<00:01:42.900> want<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> align<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.740> center

of<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> stage<00:01:44.580> so<00:01:44.940> I'll<00:01:45.060> click<00:01:45.210> align

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
of the stage so I'll click align

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.870 
of the stage so I'll click align
horizontal<00:01:46.260> Center<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.680> align<00:01:47.190> vertical

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
horizontal Center and align vertical

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.289 
horizontal Center and align vertical
Center<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> now<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.400> big<00:01:50.700> green

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
Center so now I have this big green

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.840 
Center so now I have this big green
rectangle<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.170> remember<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.799> flash<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.430> mask

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
rectangle and remember in flash a mask

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.120 
rectangle and remember in flash a mask
reveals<00:01:54.630> content<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.500> everything<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.040> this

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
reveals content so everything that this

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.640 
reveals content so everything that this
rectangle<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.790> covering<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.290> show

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
rectangle is covering is going to show

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.560 
rectangle is covering is going to show
when<00:01:59.220> this<00:01:59.369> content<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.939> published<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.510> the

the bridge on the overflow section of
the<00:02:14.340> stage<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.940> now

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
the stage is now

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.360 
the stage is now
by<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.209> mask<00:02:16.569> because<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.680> mask<00:02:17.920> didn't

cover the portion of the bridge that's
on<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.269> stage<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:23.260> can<00:02:23.439> tell<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.980> layer

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
on the stage you can tell that a layer

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.059 
on the stage you can tell that a layer
is<00:02:24.519> a<00:02:24.549> mask<00:02:24.969> layer<00:02:25.450> because<00:02:26.109> it<00:02:26.139> has<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.799> mask

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
is a mask layer because it has the mask

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.030 
is a mask layer because it has the mask
icon<00:02:27.609> that's<00:02:27.999> a<00:02:28.209> checkerboard<00:02:28.689> oval<00:02:29.620> with<00:02:30.010> a

by<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.370> mask<00:02:33.730> layer<00:02:34.120> have<00:02:34.659> a<00:02:34.689> checkerboard

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
by the mask layer have a checkerboard

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.709 
by the mask layer have a checkerboard
pattern<00:02:35.439> but<00:02:36.340> are<00:02:36.459> rectangular<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.389> don't

have that black background notice that

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.300 
have that black background notice that
both<00:02:39.969> of<00:02:40.030> these<00:02:40.269> layers<00:02:40.599> are<00:02:40.930> locked<00:02:41.469> if<00:02:41.980> i

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
both of these layers are locked if i

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.490 
both of these layers are locked if i
unlock<00:02:42.579> either<00:02:43.120> one<00:02:43.359> of<00:02:43.389> them<00:02:43.689> then<00:02:44.079> I<00:02:44.109> don't

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
unlock either one of them then I don't

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.890 
unlock either one of them then I don't
see<00:02:44.799> how<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:45.129> mask<00:02:45.489> affects<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.209> content<00:02:46.719> so

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
see how the mask affects the content so

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.289 
see how the mask affects the content so
if<00:02:46.989> you're<00:02:47.109> gonna<00:02:47.230> preview<00:02:47.799> a<00:02:48.010> mask<00:02:48.519> inside<00:02:49.269> a

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
if you're gonna preview a mask inside a

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.330 
if you're gonna preview a mask inside a
flash<00:02:49.629> you'll<00:02:50.200> need<00:02:50.349> to<00:02:50.409> lock<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.799> mask<00:02:51.040> and

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
flash you'll need to lock the mask and

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.399 
flash you'll need to lock the mask and
all<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:52.000> layers<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.329> are<00:02:52.450> being<00:02:52.750> masked<00:02:53.260> I

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
all the layers that are being masked I

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.770 
all the layers that are being masked I
just<00:02:53.919> want<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.159> point<00:02:54.310> out<00:02:54.549> really<00:02:54.819> quick<00:02:55.209> that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
just want to point out really quick that

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.649 
just want to point out really quick that
you<00:02:56.019> can<00:02:56.230> also<00:02:56.439> control<00:02:57.370> masking<00:02:58.090> through<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
you can also control masking through the

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.869 
you can also control masking through the
layer<00:02:58.900> properties<00:02:59.469> dialog<00:02:59.949> box<00:02:59.980> which<00:03:00.639> can<00:03:00.790> be

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
opens up the layer properties dialog so

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.390 
opens up the layer properties dialog so
that<00:03:10.719> was<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.840> double-click<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.769> now<00:03:12.159> I<00:03:12.189> can

change<00:03:12.639> the<00:03:12.879> type<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.299> layer<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.750> if<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:13.930> want

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
change the type of layer so if I want

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.599 
change the type of layer so if I want
this<00:03:14.319> mask<00:03:14.650> layer<00:03:14.859> to<00:03:14.949> be<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.069> normal<00:03:15.459> layer

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.589 
view it as outlines or to change the
layer<00:03:27.099> height<00:03:27.370> not<00:03:27.879> going<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.150> do<00:03:28.239> any<00:03:28.419> of<00:03:28.540> that

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
layer height not going to do any of that

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.909 
layer height not going to do any of that
right<00:03:28.840> now<00:03:28.870> I'm<00:03:29.109> just<00:03:29.199> going<00:03:29.379> to<00:03:29.500> click<00:03:29.650> cancel

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
right now I'm just going to click cancel

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.339 
right now I'm just going to click cancel
so<00:03:30.849> that's<00:03:31.030> how<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.209> control<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.810> masking

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
so that's how you control the masking

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.319 
so that's how you control the masking
for<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.650> layer<00:03:32.889> let's<00:03:33.489> say<00:03:33.639> we<00:03:33.759> wanted<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.090> mask

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
for a layer let's say we wanted to mask

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.199 
for a layer let's say we wanted to mask
multiple<00:03:35.139> layers<00:03:35.319> to<00:03:35.620> do<00:03:36.189> that<00:03:36.459> I'm<00:03:36.699> going<00:03:37.120> to

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
multiple layers to do that I'm going to

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.420 
multiple layers to do that I'm going to
unlock<00:03:37.629> layer<00:03:37.930> 1<00:03:38.199> and<00:03:38.620> I'm<00:03:38.739> going<00:03:38.949> to<00:03:39.040> hide<00:03:39.250> the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
unlock layer 1 and I'm going to hide the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.369 
unlock layer 1 and I'm going to hide the
mask<00:03:39.639> layer<00:03:39.909> so<00:03:40.239> let's<00:03:40.269> say<00:03:40.599> I<00:03:40.629> wanted<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:40.989> mask

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
mask layer so let's say I wanted to mask

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.559 
mask layer so let's say I wanted to mask
the<00:03:41.739> stroke<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.579> outside<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:43.269> I'll<00:03:43.359> select

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
the stroke on the outside so I'll select

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.629 
the stroke on the outside so I'll select
that<00:03:44.079> stroke<00:03:44.560> on<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.799> outside<00:03:45.069> of<00:03:45.159> my<00:03:45.250> artwork

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
that stroke on the outside of my artwork

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.670 
that stroke on the outside of my artwork
I'm<00:03:45.879> going<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.239> cut<00:03:46.599> the<00:03:46.750> artwork<00:03:47.139> and<00:03:47.530> I'll

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
I'm going to cut the artwork and I'll

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.409 
I'm going to cut the artwork and I'll
create<00:03:48.009> a<00:03:48.069> new<00:03:48.129> layer<00:03:48.609> I'll<00:03:49.030> make<00:03:49.239> sure<00:03:49.389> to

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
create a new layer I'll make sure to

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.719 
create a new layer I'll make sure to
drag<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:50.049> layer<00:03:50.319> above<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:50.919> mask<00:03:51.280> so<00:03:51.579> it's

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:51.729 
drag this layer above the mask so it's

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.339 
drag this layer above the mask so it's
not<00:03:51.909> master<00:03:52.329> you<00:03:52.419> can<00:03:52.509> see<00:03:52.599> the<00:03:52.750> normal<00:03:52.989> layer

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
not master you can see the normal layer

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.259 
not master you can see the normal layer
icon<00:03:53.560> there<00:03:54.009> and<00:03:54.189> then<00:03:54.519> I'm<00:03:54.609> going<00:03:54.759> to<00:03:54.909> paste

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
icon there and then I'm going to paste

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.030 
icon there and then I'm going to paste
the<00:03:55.509> stroke<00:03:55.870> using<00:03:56.379> the<00:03:56.590> paste<00:03:56.829> in<00:03:57.009> place

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
the stroke using the paste in place

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.789 
the stroke using the paste in place
command<00:03:57.609> that's<00:03:57.759> shift<00:03:58.060> command<00:03:58.449> V<00:03:58.750> or<00:03:59.019> edit

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
command that's shift command V or edit

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.249 
command that's shift command V or edit
paste<00:04:00.159> in<00:04:00.340> place<00:04:00.400> so<00:04:01.060> now<00:04:01.269> I<00:04:01.299> want<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.959> mask

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:02.259 
paste in place so now I want to mask

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.649 
paste in place so now I want to mask
this<00:04:02.500> layer<00:04:02.799> so<00:04:03.040> all<00:04:03.159> I<00:04:03.189> have<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.400> do<00:04:03.639> is<00:04:03.909> drag

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
this layer so all I have to do is drag

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.479 
this layer so all I have to do is drag
it<00:04:04.719> under<00:04:05.439> the<00:04:05.560> mask<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:06.099> you<00:04:06.159> can<00:04:06.189> see<00:04:06.400> that

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
it under the mask and you can see that

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.089 
it under the mask and you can see that
the<00:04:06.639> layer<00:04:06.879> placement<00:04:07.479> line<00:04:07.719> indents<00:04:08.680> under

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
the layer placement line indents under

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.249 
the layer placement line indents under
the<00:04:09.219> mask<00:04:09.459> which<00:04:10.120> is<00:04:10.269> telling<00:04:10.540> me<00:04:10.810> that<00:04:10.840> this

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:11.259 
the mask which is telling me that this

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.319 
the mask which is telling me that this
layer<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.530> going<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.889> be<00:04:12.039> masked<00:04:12.669> if<00:04:12.879> I<00:04:13.090> release

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
layer is going to be masked if I release

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.909 
layer is going to be masked if I release
my<00:04:13.509> mouse<00:04:13.689> button<00:04:13.750> here<00:04:14.229> so<00:04:14.349> I'll<00:04:14.439> release<00:04:14.739> the

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
my mouse button here so I'll release the

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:15.509 
my mouse button here so I'll release the
mouse<00:04:15.069> button

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
mouse button

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.390 
mouse button
and<00:04:15.639> then<00:04:16.449> layer<00:04:16.690> 3<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:17.229> then<00:04:17.409> masked<00:04:18.099> by<00:04:18.370> the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
and then layer 3 is then masked by the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.120 
and then layer 3 is then masked by the
mask<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.269> can<00:04:19.419> add<00:04:19.570> multiple<00:04:19.870> layers<00:04:20.469> to<00:04:20.829> the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
mask so I can add multiple layers to the

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.279 
mask so I can add multiple layers to the
same<00:04:21.370> mask<00:04:21.669> by<00:04:22.150> dragging<00:04:22.690> them<00:04:22.870> just<00:04:23.139> like

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
same mask by dragging them just like

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.140 
same mask by dragging them just like
this<00:04:23.500> so<00:04:24.010> when<00:04:24.130> they're<00:04:24.250> working<00:04:24.400> with<00:04:24.550> masks

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
this so when they're working with masks

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.839 
this so when they're working with masks
you<00:04:25.510> can<00:04:25.539> reveal<00:04:26.020> content<00:04:26.710> in<00:04:26.860> flash<00:04:27.219> just

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
you can reveal content in flash just

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.820 
you can reveal content in flash just
make<00:04:28.029> sure<00:04:28.210> you're<00:04:28.389> using<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.810> solid<00:04:29.139> color

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
make sure you're using a solid color

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.210 
make sure you're using a solid color
and<00:04:30.159> remember<00:04:31.090> in<00:04:31.270> masks<00:04:32.169> The<00:04:32.440> Strokes<00:04:32.830> don't

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
and remember in masks The Strokes don't

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.490 
and remember in masks The Strokes don't
apply
