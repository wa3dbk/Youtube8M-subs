though to go for the ice beam and it's
gonna<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> lot<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> damage<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.930> problem<00:01:04.440> is

damage I'm gonna be able to do with all
my<00:01:09.299> moves<00:01:09.570> basically<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.409> still<00:01:10.799> think

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
my moves basically but I still think

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.710 
my moves basically but I still think
that<00:01:11.310> ice<00:01:11.700> beam<00:01:11.940> will<00:01:12.120> be<00:01:12.240> able<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> knock<00:01:12.570> at

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that ice beam will be able to knock at

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.990 
that ice beam will be able to knock at
the<00:01:12.810> main<00:01:12.960> e<00:01:12.990> buds<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.380> indeed<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.310> does<00:01:14.490> so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the main e buds and indeed it does so

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.700 
the main e buds and indeed it does so
now<00:01:15.180> what's<00:01:15.810> gonna<00:01:15.869> happen<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.470> he's<00:01:16.619> gonna

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
now what's gonna happen is he's gonna

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240

like<00:01:38.130> double<00:01:38.580> switch<00:01:38.820> goes<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.330> krookodile

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
like double switch goes in a krookodile

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.420 
like double switch goes in a krookodile
and<00:01:40.020> then<00:01:40.260> goes<00:01:40.470> into<00:01:40.500> keldeo<00:01:41.040> because<00:01:41.340> he

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and then goes into keldeo because he

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.649 
and then goes into keldeo because he
feels<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.790> he<00:01:41.909> doesn't<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.240> anything<00:01:42.450> else

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
feels like he doesn't have anything else

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.749 
feels like he doesn't have anything else
to<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:42.900> into<00:01:43.080> against<00:01:43.439> his<00:01:43.590> knee<00:01:43.740> tokine<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
to go into against his knee tokine and I

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.340 
to go into against his knee tokine and I
guess<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.119> know<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.689> put<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> lead<00:01:46.110> sheet

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
guess you know just put the lead sheet

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.510 
guess you know just put the lead sheet
out<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.680> he's<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.860> waiting<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.310> me<00:01:47.400> to<00:01:47.490> die

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
out and he's just waiting for me to die

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.940 
out and he's just waiting for me to die
to<00:01:47.700> lead<00:01:47.939> sheet<00:01:48.150> which<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> perfectly<00:01:49.320> okay

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to lead sheet which is a perfectly okay

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.190 
to lead sheet which is a perfectly okay
method<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.580> now<00:01:51.270> I'm<00:01:51.390> gonna<00:01:51.540> go<00:01:51.659> back<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.080> my

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
method so now I'm gonna go back in my

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.649 
method so now I'm gonna go back in my
minim<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.430> basically<00:01:53.820> I'm<00:01:54.150> just<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
minim and basically I'm just going to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.560 
minim and basically I'm just going to
decide<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.200> try<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.130> go<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.090> thunderbolt

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
decide to try and go for a thunderbolt

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.569 
decide to try and go for a thunderbolt
doesn't<00:01:58.470> work<00:01:58.619> out<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.860> well<00:01:59.220> obviously

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
doesn't work out that well obviously

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.890 
doesn't work out that well obviously
because<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.390> into<00:02:00.509> krookodile

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
because it's going to go into krookodile

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.440 
because it's going to go into krookodile
maybe<00:02:01.229> should<00:02:01.470> have<00:02:01.500> predicted<00:02:01.920> that

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
maybe should have predicted that

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.280 
maybe should have predicted that
unfortunately<00:02:03.450> though<00:02:03.600> unlike<00:02:04.079> my

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
unfortunately though unlike my

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.840 
unfortunately though unlike my
counterpart<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.890> did<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.280> substitutes

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
counterpart I did not have substitutes

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.920 
counterpart I did not have substitutes
so<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.030> couldn't<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.390> know

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
so I couldn't really know

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.480 
so I couldn't really know
like<00:02:07.020> ways<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.530> turn<00:02:07.740> or<00:02:07.920> anything<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.340> that

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
like ways to turn or anything like that

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.490 
like ways to turn or anything like that
so<00:02:08.850> now<00:02:09.630> i'm<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.869> go<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.050> Mandy<00:02:10.380> buzz

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
so now i'm going to go to Mandy buzz

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.990 
so now i'm going to go to Mandy buzz
he's<00:02:10.740> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> go<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> stone<00:02:11.580> edge<00:02:11.730> it's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
he's going to go for a stone edge it's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.730 
he's going to go for a stone edge it's
going<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.390> do<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> lot<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.900> damage<00:02:13.380> and

unfortunately<00:02:14.070> there's<00:02:14.880> nothing<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.330> can

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
unfortunately there's nothing I can

unfortunately there's nothing I can
really<00:02:15.510> do<00:02:15.840> about<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.110> except<00:02:16.680> go<00:02:16.860> for<00:02:17.070> a

toxic so basically Manny buzz is going
to<00:02:19.140> die<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.560> can't<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.520> anything<00:02:20.700> else<00:02:20.940> about

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
anything that can knock this guy out

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.290 
anything that can knock this guy out
except<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.010> my<00:02:26.280> warmer<00:02:26.700> damn<00:02:26.880> but<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
except for my warmer damn but the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.300 
except for my warmer damn but the
problem<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.080> feel<00:02:28.320> like<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.560> warmer<00:02:28.950> name<00:02:29.100> is

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
problem is I feel like a warmer name is

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.500 
problem is I feel like a warmer name is
it<00:02:29.430> going<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.640> outspeed<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.120> I'm<00:02:30.209> going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.360> go

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it going to outspeed so I'm going to go

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.960 
it going to outspeed so I'm going to go
to<00:02:30.570> hitmontop<00:02:30.990> mock<00:02:31.950> punch<00:02:32.280> technician

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
to hitmontop mock punch technician

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.060 
to hitmontop mock punch technician
life-form<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.600> does<00:02:33.810> not<00:02:34.050> kill<00:02:34.410> because<00:02:34.650> of

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
life-form it does not kill because of

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.949 
life-form it does not kill because of
the<00:02:35.160> fact<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.580> he<00:02:35.940> got<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.390> bulk<00:02:36.750> up

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
the fact that he got that bulk up

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.690 
the fact that he got that bulk up
defense<00:02:37.320> boost<00:02:37.560> if<00:02:37.800> he<00:02:37.890> did<00:02:38.070> not<00:02:38.310> get<00:02:38.550> that

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
defense boost if he did not get that

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.850 
defense boost if he did not get that
boost<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.780> would<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:39.959> easily<00:02:40.320> killed

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
boost and that would have easily killed

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.910 
boost and that would have easily killed
but<00:02:41.250> unfortunately<00:02:42.170> hip<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.470> was<00:02:43.620> not<00:02:43.739> able

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
but unfortunately hip and I was not able

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.740 
but unfortunately hip and I was not able
to<00:02:44.040> get<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> job<00:02:44.459> done<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.150> first<00:02:45.420> turn

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
to get the job done on that first turn

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.650 
to get the job done on that first turn
and<00:02:45.989> now<00:02:46.620> bringing<00:02:46.950> such<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.910> try<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.390> go<00:02:48.480> for

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
and now bringing such I try and go for

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.300 
and now bringing such I try and go for
the<00:02:48.690> toxic<00:02:49.200> unfortunately<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.010> doesn't

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
the toxic unfortunately that doesn't

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.550 
the toxic unfortunately that doesn't
work<00:02:50.550> out<00:02:50.790> he<00:02:51.270> goes<00:02:51.450> from<00:02:51.600> earthquake<00:02:52.110> he<00:02:52.290> gets

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
work out he goes from earthquake he gets

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.410 
work out he goes from earthquake he gets
a<00:02:52.680> crit<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.280> don't<00:02:53.670> think<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.940> mattered

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
a crit I don't think that mattered

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.240 
a crit I don't think that mattered
anyways<00:02:54.810> now<00:02:55.380> I'm<00:02:55.410> gonna<00:02:55.680> go<00:02:55.800> in<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.950> warm<00:02:56.160> and

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
anyways now I'm gonna go in a warm and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.460 
anyways now I'm gonna go in a warm and
damn<00:02:56.400> he<00:02:56.610> actually<00:02:56.760> has<00:02:57.239> X's<00:02:57.870> or<00:02:57.900> which<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.320> was

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
damn he actually has X's or which I was

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.860 
damn he actually has X's or which I was
not<00:02:58.650> expecting<00:02:58.920> honestly<00:02:59.670> but<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.209> am<00:03:00.450> able<00:03:00.690> to

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
not expecting honestly but I am able to

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.750 
not expecting honestly but I am able to
retaliate<00:03:01.230> with<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.770> leaf<00:03:02.040> storm<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.489> it's<00:03:02.640> not

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
retaliate with a leaf storm so it's not

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.550

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
um and then I had nasty plot so and then

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.319 
um and then I had nasty plot so and then
of<00:04:05.340> course<00:04:05.370> Thunderbolt<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.090> didn't<00:04:06.299> really

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
of course Thunderbolt so I didn't really

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.610 
of course Thunderbolt so I didn't really
have<00:04:06.480> anything<00:04:06.720> else<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.049> hit<00:04:07.140> him<00:04:07.260> with<00:04:07.410> and

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
have anything else to hit him with and

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.160 
have anything else to hit him with and
especially<00:04:07.950> since<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.489> thought<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.600> Plusle

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
especially since I thought this Plusle

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.810 
especially since I thought this Plusle
would<00:04:10.350> be<00:04:10.470> getting<00:04:10.739> lightning<00:04:11.100> rod<00:04:11.310> because

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
would be getting lightning rod because

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.569 
would be getting lightning rod because
my<00:04:12.239> min<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.140> got<00:04:13.320> vote<00:04:13.620> absorbed<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.190> didn't

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
my min and got vote absorbed I didn't

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.240 
my min and got vote absorbed I didn't
think<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:15.030> in<00:04:15.209> this<00:04:15.359> random<00:04:15.660> battle<00:04:16.250> play

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
think that in this random battle play

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.500 
think that in this random battle play
style<00:04:17.579> they<00:04:17.790> would<00:04:17.970> have<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.389> plus<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:18.959> minus

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
style they would have the plus and minus

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.180 
style they would have the plus and minus
these<00:04:19.690> on<00:04:19.900> these<00:04:20.050> guys<00:04:20.260> in<00:04:20.470> bed<00:04:20.710> hit<00:04:20.980> you<00:04:21.070> know

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
these on these guys in bed hit you know

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.520 
these on these guys in bed hit you know
have<00:04:21.430> more<00:04:21.790> beneficiary<00:04:22.450> abilities<00:04:22.990> like<00:04:23.020> of

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
have more beneficiary abilities like of

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.740 
have more beneficiary abilities like of
course<00:04:24.160> lightning<00:04:24.580> rod<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:25.090> will<00:04:25.330> absorb

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
course lightning rod and will absorb

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.470 
course lightning rod and will absorb
able<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.560> do<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.770> decent<00:04:27.220> amount<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.030> plus<00:04:28.330> 0

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
able to do a decent amount to the plus 0

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.820 
able to do a decent amount to the plus 0
but<00:04:28.690> unfortunately<00:04:29.200> that's<00:04:29.410> not<00:04:29.500> going<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.800> be

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
but unfortunately that's not going to be

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.500 
but unfortunately that's not going to be
able<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:30.100> talk<00:04:30.220> about<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.730> don't<00:04:31.150> think<00:04:31.180> really

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
able to talk about I don't think really

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.970 
able to talk about I don't think really
mattered<00:04:31.810> anyways<00:04:32.170> because<00:04:32.350> Kelly<00:04:32.710> o<00:04:32.830> was

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
mattered anyways because Kelly o was

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.070 
mattered anyways because Kelly o was
still<00:04:33.190> going<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.370> be<00:04:33.460> there<00:04:33.700> they<00:04:34.390> were<00:04:34.450> really
