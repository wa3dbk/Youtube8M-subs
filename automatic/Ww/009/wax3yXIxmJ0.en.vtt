from the search oh it's already picked
it<00:00:58.250> up<00:00:58.339> that<00:00:58.850> I<00:00:58.879> haven't<00:00:59.030> even<00:00:59.149> had<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.420> scan

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
it up that I haven't even had to scan

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.790 
it up that I haven't even had to scan
the<00:00:59.839> scan<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.679> barcode<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:06.110> if<00:01:06.350> I<00:01:06.500> click<00:01:06.560> on

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
the scan the barcode and if I click on

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.050 
the scan the barcode and if I click on
that<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:07.820> can<00:01:08.090> go<00:01:08.299> off<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:09.579> again<00:01:10.579> it<00:01:10.700> goes<00:01:10.820> to

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
that I can go off and again it goes to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.240 
that I can go off and again it goes to
chow<00:01:11.420> what<00:01:12.079> else<00:01:12.229> we<00:01:12.409> got<00:01:12.439> got<00:01:12.770> quantum<00:01:13.159> of

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
chow what else we got got quantum of

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.620 
chow what else we got got quantum of
solace<00:01:13.549> that's<00:01:14.000> if<00:01:14.150> we<00:01:14.240> can<00:01:14.390> do<00:01:14.509> that<00:01:14.689> one<00:01:16.630> so

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
solace that's if we can do that one so

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.340 
solace that's if we can do that one so
if<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:17.810> can<00:01:17.900> do<00:01:18.049> it<00:01:18.110> just<00:01:18.320> from<00:01:20.140> nope<00:01:21.140> so

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
if you can do it just from nope so

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.990 
if you can do it just from nope so
that's<00:01:21.530> obviously<00:01:21.710> it's<00:01:22.250> got<00:01:22.430> confused<00:01:22.820> with

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
that's obviously it's got confused with

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.170 
that's obviously it's got confused with
the<00:01:23.090> one<00:01:23.240> behind<00:01:24.280> we<00:01:25.280> had<00:01:25.520> as<00:01:26.149> if<00:01:26.360> it<00:01:26.479> can<00:01:28.180> so

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
the one behind we had as if it can so

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.340 
the one behind we had as if it can so
it's<00:01:29.299> picked<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.570> up<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:29.810> it's<00:01:29.930> not<00:01:30.020> even

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
it's picked it up so it's not even

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.870 
it's picked it up so it's not even
looking<00:01:30.590> at<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.710> bar<00:01:30.920> code<00:01:31.130> on<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.280> one<00:01:31.579> and

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
looking at the bar code on that one and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.859 
looking at the bar code on that one and
let's<00:01:32.360> see<00:01:32.450> if<00:01:32.540> we<00:01:32.600> can<00:01:32.750> do<00:01:34.360> if<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:35.509> recognizes

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
let's see if we can do if it recognizes

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.910 
let's see if we can do if it recognizes
anything<00:01:36.740> here<00:01:38.170> nopes<00:01:39.170> all<00:01:39.350> we<00:01:39.439> can<00:01:39.560> do<00:01:39.710> is<00:01:39.740> we

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
anything here nopes all we can do is we

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.090 
anything here nopes all we can do is we
just<00:01:40.070> go<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.219> the<00:01:40.369> bar<00:01:40.549> code<00:01:41.829> and<00:01:42.829> it's<00:01:42.950> picked

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
just go to the bar code and it's picked

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.700 
just go to the bar code and it's picked
up<00:01:43.189> a<00:01:43.250> quantum<00:01:43.579> of<00:01:43.640> solace<00:01:43.820> or<00:01:44.329> click<00:01:45.320> on<00:01:45.500> that

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
up a quantum of solace or click on that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.920 
up a quantum of solace or click on that
and<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.890> again<00:01:49.310> launches<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.360> right<00:01:50.539> look

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
and that again launches the right look

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.709 
and that again launches the right look
now<00:01:51.320> what<00:01:51.560> is<00:01:51.740> interesting<00:01:51.920> as<00:01:52.490> well<00:01:53.090> as<00:01:53.570> we

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
now what is interesting as well as we

00:01:53.719 --> 00:02:01.740 
now what is interesting as well as we
can<00:01:53.869> then<00:01:55.000> do<00:01:56.000> we<00:01:56.450> go<00:01:56.600> back<00:01:57.850> we<00:01:58.850> can<00:01:59.000> do<00:01:59.149> some

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.050 

obviously<00:02:02.750> get<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.549> history<00:02:04.549> which<00:02:04.789> we<00:02:04.939> can

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
obviously get the history which we can

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.990 
obviously get the history which we can
look<00:02:05.149> at<00:02:05.329> whatever<00:02:05.570> we<00:02:05.840> want<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.670> shows<00:02:07.670> us<00:02:07.880> the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
look at whatever we want to shows us the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.270 
look at whatever we want to shows us the
things<00:02:08.240> we've<00:02:08.450> looked<00:02:08.600> at<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.110> past<00:02:09.380> and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
things we've looked at in the past and

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.250 
things we've looked at in the past and
we<00:02:10.490> can<00:02:10.610> do<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.700> thing<00:02:10.880> called<00:02:11.060> scan<00:02:11.450> text<00:02:12.110> which

we can do a thing called scan text which
it's<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.739> bit<00:02:13.860> difficult<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.459> use<00:02:14.900> holding<00:02:15.900> in

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
it's a bit difficult to use holding in

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.750 
it's a bit difficult to use holding in
front<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.290> camera<00:02:16.560> mitted<00:02:17.250> Lee<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:17.640> let's

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
front of a camera mitted Lee but let's

have another try let's go back let's see

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.949 
have another try let's go back let's see
if<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.519> get<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.879> right<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.329> gots<00:02:24.540> can

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
if we can get this right so gots can

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.149 
if we can get this right so gots can
text<00:02:25.650> hold<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:26.220> there<00:02:26.430> hold<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.629> still<00:02:28.159> it's
