00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.309 
like I have to put heat on it to blend
so<00:04:10.340> yes<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:11.120> would<00:04:11.240> purchase<00:04:11.540> this<00:04:11.840> hair<00:04:12.080> again

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
so yes I would purchase this hair again

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.870 
so yes I would purchase this hair again
just<00:04:12.620> because<00:04:12.770> of<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.040> simple<00:04:13.310> fact<00:04:13.580> that<00:04:13.640> I

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
just because of the simple fact that I

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.030 
just because of the simple fact that I
don't<00:04:14.060> have<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.360> put<00:04:14.510> heat<00:04:14.720> on<00:04:14.750> my<00:04:14.990> hair<00:04:15.040> to

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
don't have to put heat on my hair to

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.150 
don't have to put heat on my hair to
blend<00:04:16.910> in<00:04:17.209> with<00:04:17.450> my<00:04:17.510> natural<00:04:18.049> hair<00:04:18.230> so<00:04:18.650> that<00:04:19.010> is

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
blend in with my natural hair so that is

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.020 
blend in with my natural hair so that is
a<00:04:19.190> plus<00:04:19.459> for<00:04:19.519> me<00:04:20.200> if<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.890> had<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:22.370> rate<00:04:22.580> this<00:04:22.730> hair

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
a plus for me if I had to rate this hair

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.090 
a plus for me if I had to rate this hair
from<00:04:23.750> 1<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:25.070> 10<00:04:25.310> I<00:04:25.730> would<00:04:26.090> give<00:04:26.240> this<00:04:26.540> hair

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
from 1 to 10 I would give this hair

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.860 
from 1 to 10 I would give this hair
assessment<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.970> reason<00:04:29.270> for<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.690> is

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
assessment and the reason for that is

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.520 
assessment and the reason for that is
because<00:04:29.900> it's<00:04:30.710> like<00:04:31.180> it's<00:04:32.180> not<00:04:32.450> the<00:04:32.840> best<00:04:33.140> but

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
because it's like it's not the best but

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.730 
because it's like it's not the best but
it's<00:04:34.130> not<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.360> worst<00:04:35.660> it's<00:04:36.169> like<00:04:36.470> in

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
it's not so the worst it's like in

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.630 
it's not so the worst it's like in
between<00:04:37.280> so<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.580> would<00:04:37.850> give<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.180> 7<00:04:39.250> but<00:04:40.250> I

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
between so I would give it a 7 but I

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.220 
between so I would give it a 7 but I
would<00:04:40.940> still<00:04:41.240> purchase<00:04:41.540> it<00:04:41.780> here<00:04:41.900> again<00:04:42.020> just

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
would still purchase it here again just

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.080 
would still purchase it here again just
because<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.130> fact<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:43.490> don't<00:04:43.730> have<00:04:43.850> to<00:04:43.940> play

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
because of the fact I don't have to play
