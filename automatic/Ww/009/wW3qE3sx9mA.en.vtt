shaft it they aren't really the best

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.970 
shaft it they aren't really the best
screws<00:02:58.550> but<00:02:59.140> or<00:03:00.140> how<00:03:00.320> well<00:03:00.530> they're<00:03:00.680> holding

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
screws but or how well they're holding

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.580 
screws but or how well they're holding
up<00:03:01.160> they're<00:03:01.459> pretty<00:03:01.760> good<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:04.010> spring<00:03:04.430> is

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
up they're pretty good the spring is

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.590 
up they're pretty good the spring is
pretty<00:03:06.590> stretched<00:03:07.070> out<00:03:07.310> but<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.180> has<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.360> lot<00:03:08.570> of

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
pretty stretched out but it has a lot of

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.420 
pretty stretched out but it has a lot of
tension<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:10.989> hold<00:03:11.989> on<00:03:12.080> one<00:03:12.230> second<00:03:12.590> got<00:03:13.400> a

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
tension to it hold on one second got a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:24.509 
tension to it hold on one second got a
lot<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.670> tension<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:16.660> okay<00:03:17.769> so<00:03:18.769> yeah<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:23.060> um

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.320 
first impressions this cube is really
good<00:03:28.030> but<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.570> there<00:03:30.080> is<00:03:30.430> only<00:03:31.430> one<00:03:31.970> real

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
good but it there is only one real

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.800 
good but it there is only one real
design<00:03:33.320> fall<00:03:34.359> that<00:03:35.359> I<00:03:35.690> would<00:03:36.049> fix

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
design fall that I would fix

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.420 
design fall that I would fix
I<00:03:37.520> would<00:03:38.520> make<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.819> black<00:03:39.000> plastic<00:03:39.330> one<00:03:40.430> reason

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
I would make it black plastic one reason

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.170 
I would make it black plastic one reason
why<00:03:41.660> well<00:03:42.660> actually<00:03:42.840> -<00:03:43.140> um<00:03:43.730> my<00:03:44.730> experience

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
why well actually - um my experience

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.449 
why well actually - um my experience
black<00:03:45.450> plastic<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:46.349> can't<00:03:46.590> really<00:03:46.770> tell<00:03:47.099> if

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
black plastic you can't really tell if

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.880 
black plastic you can't really tell if
it's<00:03:47.880> dirty<00:03:48.090> or<00:03:48.300> not<00:03:48.330> so<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.260> really<00:03:49.440> doesn't

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
it's dirty or not so it really doesn't

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.650 
it's dirty or not so it really doesn't
make<00:03:50.099> a<00:03:50.160> difference<00:03:50.580> in<00:03:50.910> looks<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:52.290> AH

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
make a difference in looks and to AH

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.690 
make a difference in looks and to AH
foure<00:03:54.660> also<00:03:55.050> from<00:03:55.260> my<00:03:55.349> experiences<00:03:55.950> black

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
foure also from my experiences black

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:06.009 
foure also from my experiences black
plastic<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.450> better<00:03:58.200> for<00:03:58.800> building<00:03:58.980> cubes<00:04:03.230> but

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
plastic is better for building cubes but

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.509 
plastic is better for building cubes but
even<00:04:07.019> with<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.410> screws<00:04:07.890> on<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.160> tightest

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
even with the screws on the tightest

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.650 
even with the screws on the tightest
tension<00:04:10.310> they<00:04:11.310> are<00:04:11.670> still<00:04:12.319> it's<00:04:13.319> still<00:04:13.590> very

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
tension they are still it's still very

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.270 
tension they are still it's still very
smooth<00:04:15.660> puzzle<00:04:16.229> um<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:19.739> goes<00:04:19.919> together<00:04:20.070> really

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
smooth puzzle um it goes together really

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.070 
smooth puzzle um it goes together really
easily<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:22.490> pops<00:04:23.490> right<00:04:23.639> in<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.690> don't<00:04:24.960> even

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
easily just pops right in you don't even

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.629 
easily just pops right in you don't even
have<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.380> put<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:27.440> edge<00:04:28.440> pieces<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.430> laughs

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
have to put the edge pieces and laughs

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.969 
have to put the edge pieces and laughs

best most of the time you can put a

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.140 
best most of the time you can put a
corner<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.620> last<00:04:46.890> but<00:04:47.370> not<00:04:47.669> always

okay<00:05:10.070> um<00:05:11.210> from<00:05:13.850> this<00:05:14.850> terrine<00:05:15.539> is<00:05:15.690> smooth

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.760 

as<00:05:28.000> you<00:05:28.150> can<00:05:28.270> hear<00:05:28.539> it's<00:05:28.660> not<00:05:28.840> really<00:05:29.229> a<00:05:29.259> quiet

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
as you can hear it's not really a quiet

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:38.129 
as you can hear it's not really a quiet
cube<00:05:35.520> but<00:05:36.520> it<00:05:36.819> is<00:05:37.000> a<00:05:37.030> really<00:05:37.509> good<00:05:37.690> cube<00:05:37.990> it

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
cube but it is a really good cube it

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.649 
cube but it is a really good cube it
does<00:05:38.349> not<00:05:38.560> cut<00:05:38.919> corners<00:05:38.949> that<00:05:39.759> much<00:05:40.090> that's

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
does not cut corners that much that's

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.240 
does not cut corners that much that's
about<00:05:40.930> as<00:05:41.080> far<00:05:41.229> as<00:05:41.289> they'll<00:05:41.470> go

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.240 

um<00:05:45.250> unlike<00:05:46.090> my<00:05:47.129> better

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
um unlike my better

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.670 
um unlike my better
Edison<00:05:48.940> cube<00:05:51.569> well<00:05:52.569> not<00:05:53.110> really<00:05:53.259> much<00:05:53.470> better

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
Edison cube well not really much better

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.010 
Edison cube well not really much better
because<00:05:53.979> this<00:05:54.130> does<00:05:54.400> pop<00:05:54.699> very<00:05:55.080> much<00:05:56.880> see<00:05:58.020> um

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
because this does pop very much see um

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.550 
because this does pop very much see um
sorry<00:05:59.440> I<00:05:59.530> just<00:05:59.710> forced<00:06:00.039> that<00:06:00.159> to<00:06:00.280> happen<00:06:00.400> so<00:06:00.580> um

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
sorry I just forced that to happen so um

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
this is a good puzzle but yeah it I'll

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.490 
this is a good puzzle but yeah it I'll
make<00:06:06.099> a<00:06:06.159> view<00:06:06.430> on<00:06:06.520> that<00:06:06.639> on<00:06:06.759> my<00:06:06.849> other<00:06:06.940> channel

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
notice this one can cut corners there no

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.209 
notice this one can cut corners there no
problem<00:06:17.050> and<00:06:17.280> sometimes<00:06:18.280> even<00:06:18.639> line<00:06:18.940> up<00:06:19.150> a

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
problem and sometimes even line up a

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:24.860 
problem and sometimes even line up a
problem<00:06:21.219> this<00:06:22.090> one<00:06:22.330> can't<00:06:23.190> line<00:06:24.190> up

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
problem this one can't line up

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.980 
problem this one can't line up
nope<00:06:25.870> it's<00:06:26.319> not<00:06:26.440> happening<00:06:27.539> but<00:06:28.539> about

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
nope it's not happening but about

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.439 
nope it's not happening but about
halfway<00:06:29.229> through<00:06:29.440> the<00:06:29.949> middle<00:06:30.550> cube<00:06:33.360> maybe<00:06:34.360> a

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
halfway through the middle cube maybe a

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:41.059 
halfway through the middle cube maybe a
little<00:06:34.599> more<00:06:36.270> so<00:06:37.270> um<00:06:38.340> at<00:06:39.340> first<00:06:40.090> impressions

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:41.069 
little more so um at first impressions

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:46.980 
little more so um at first impressions
this<00:06:42.069> is<00:06:42.400> a<00:06:42.699> very<00:06:43.449> good<00:06:43.659> cube<00:06:44.130> I<00:06:45.719> just<00:06:46.719> realized

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
this is a very good cube I just realized

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.760 
this is a very good cube I just realized
it<00:06:47.139> another<00:06:47.319> flaw<00:06:48.419> it's<00:06:49.419> painted<00:06:49.960> the<00:06:50.500> paint

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
it another flaw it's painted the paint

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.980 
it another flaw it's painted the paint
