00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.059
let us discuss about band structure in metals
. as , we have already studied about conduction

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.660
band . in earlier section , i just write it
again.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:36.660
that conduction band is , the overlapped region
, of common orbitals, of atoms, in a lattice

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.250
structure , we know that all those electrons
which exist in conduction band can conduct

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.460
electricity as these are free to move in the
whole lattice structure .

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:57.360
so as we talk about metals or good conductors
. we can write about metals , these are substances

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:09.680
. in which . their valence electrons.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.820
we know that valence electrons are the outer
most electrons in any atom, so in which, their

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:31.890
valence electrons , exist .
in their conduction band. or we can say the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.770
substances in which their valence band overlap's
with their conduction band or valence band

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.920
exist in the overlapping zone of the common
orbitals so that the valence electrons are

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.280
free to move , so wherever valence electrons
are, in the zone of free electrons.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.060
or valence electrons are free to move then
these substances can conduct electricity , let's

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.620
have a look on , the band structure . of metals.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:13.409
this figure will give us, an idea about a
typical metal band structure, in this band

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:21.980
structure we can see that , if this is the
valence band of, typical lattice, and this

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.620
is the conduction band or this is the point
, x where .

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:34.269
the overlapping between the atom , band structure
starts , so all these, energy levels which

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:41.090
are above point x can be considered to be
in the conduction band , or, we can say all

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.760
these energy levels are making a common orbital
of conduction band in which the electrons

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.890
are free to move , and if in this particular
metal if electrons are filled up-to this level

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:00.079
, or this is our Fermi energy level .
then we can say here Fermi energy level , exist

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:06.700
within the zone of conduction band , so all
these electrons which are above point x, and

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.379
up-to, Fermi energy level , we can say that
these electrons are free electrons which will

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.499
always conduct electricity, whenever a potential
difference is applied across.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:24.519
this lattice , or these electrons are always
free to move in the whole lattice structure

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.049
in the conduction band , so we can say this
substance will behave like a good conductor

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.519
of electricity because it is having a plenty
of free electrons in the conduction band .

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.489
and we can say that those substances which
have more number of free electrons in the

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.379
conduction band ,or the overlapping of the
conduction band with the valence band is more

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.290
, we can say these are better conductor of
electricity because they will have more number

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:00.359
of free electrons in that , so in this way
we explain, the band structure , of metals.
