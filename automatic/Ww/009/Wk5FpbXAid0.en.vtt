this role is windrow first and then

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.400 
this role is windrow first and then
we'll<00:00:04.020> set<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.770> farm<00:00:05.009> all<00:00:05.160> on<00:00:05.310> his<00:00:05.430> way<00:00:06.410> got

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
we'll set the farm all on his way got

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.239 
we'll set the farm all on his way got
that<00:00:07.529> little<00:00:07.710> bit<00:00:08.010> there

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:10.249 
that little bit there

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:19.550 
that little bit there
there<00:00:11.249> we<00:00:11.400> go<00:00:16.160> there<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.189> go<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.750> field<00:00:19.110> is

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
there we go there we go so this field is

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.249 
there we go there we go so this field is
a<00:00:20.400> lot<00:00:21.090> bigger<00:00:21.239> than<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.509> was<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:22.079> this

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
a lot bigger than it was is this

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.819 
a lot bigger than it was is this
actually<00:00:22.529> three<00:00:23.070> fields<00:00:23.779> and<00:00:24.779> as<00:00:25.649> i<00:00:25.800> mentioned

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
actually three fields and as i mentioned

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.519 
actually three fields and as i mentioned
i<00:00:26.579> think<00:00:26.910> was<00:00:27.059> the<00:00:27.090> second<00:00:27.599> episode<00:00:27.660> movie<00:00:28.230> i

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
i think was the second episode movie i

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.459 
i think was the second episode movie i
actually<00:00:29.570> connected<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.689> fields<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.290> i

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:31.469 
actually connected all the fields and i

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.260 
actually connected all the fields and i
haven't<00:00:31.800> done<00:00:31.919> that<00:00:31.950> before<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.940> i<00:00:33.000> watched

fat<00:00:52.890> man<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:54.030> their<00:00:54.300> map<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.780> multiplayer

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
fat man do their map the multiplayer

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.250 
fat man do their map the multiplayer
classics<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:57.180> made<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> humongous<00:00:57.840> field

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
classics and they made a humongous field

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.290 
classics and they made a humongous field
through<00:00:58.980> plowin<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.520> think<00:00:59.760> they<00:00:59.850> use<00:00:59.970> tiny

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
through plowin I think they use tiny

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.579 
through plowin I think they use tiny
tiny<00:01:00.750> clouds<00:01:01.050> around<00:01:01.290> you<00:01:01.530> huh<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:03.409> guess<00:01:04.409> mine

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
tiny clouds around you huh I guess mine

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.170 
tiny clouds around you huh I guess mine
was<00:01:04.739> only<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> three<00:01:05.159> furrow<00:01:05.339> plows<00:01:05.670> aware<00:01:06.060> Lee

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
was only a three furrow plows aware Lee

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.970 
was only a three furrow plows aware Lee
wasn't<00:01:06.329> that<00:01:06.509> big<00:01:06.689> either<00:01:06.840> but

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.180 

there<00:01:10.160> we<00:01:10.310> go

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
there we go

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.880 
there we go
full<00:01:12.790> again

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.110 

I<00:01:16.040> suppose<00:01:16.490> I<00:01:16.580> could<00:01:16.610> make<00:01:16.850> one<00:01:16.970> of<00:01:17.060> these

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
I suppose I could make one of these

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.610 
I suppose I could make one of these
fields<00:01:17.570> potato<00:01:17.930> I'm<00:01:18.140> not<00:01:18.229> going<00:01:18.409> to<00:01:18.530> go

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
fields potato I'm not going to go

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.950 
fields potato I'm not going to go
there's<00:01:19.100> no<00:01:19.310> way<00:01:19.460> that's<00:01:19.850> way<00:01:20.060> too<00:01:20.120> big<00:01:20.360> for<00:01:20.420> a

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
there's no way that's way too big for a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.330 
there's no way that's way too big for a
single<00:01:21.440> real<00:01:21.590> harvester

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
single real harvester

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940 
single real harvester
that<00:01:23.939> would<00:01:24.119> be

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
that would be

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.120 
that would be
yeah<00:01:26.189> let's<00:01:26.549> too<00:01:26.670> much<00:01:27.200> let's<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.289> say<00:01:28.439> that

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.490 

basically<00:01:32.119> they<00:01:32.719> attached<00:01:32.990> they<00:01:33.259> made<00:01:33.409> of

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
basically they attached they made of

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.200 
basically they attached they made of
gone<00:01:33.680> big<00:01:33.890> field<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.280> I<00:01:34.310> know<00:01:34.399> the<00:01:35.030> great

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
gone big field and I know the great

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.539 
gone big field and I know the great
gamer<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.659> also<00:01:36.079> done<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.159> couple<00:01:37.310> times

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
gamer is also done that a couple times

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.800 
gamer is also done that a couple times
on<00:01:38.030> his<00:01:39.399> think<00:01:40.399> he<00:01:40.520> was<00:01:40.670> heated<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.060> on<00:01:41.210> hacking

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
on his think he was heated it on hacking

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.630 
on his think he was heated it on hacking
stat<00:01:42.140> in<00:01:42.350> my<00:01:42.560> way<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:42.829> thickness<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.490> map

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
stat in my way a thickness of the map

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.710 
stat in my way a thickness of the map
the<00:01:43.820> name<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.119> called<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:45.310> it's<00:01:46.310> pretty<00:01:46.460> cool

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
the name is called and it's pretty cool

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.060 
the name is called and it's pretty cool
uses<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:47.869> bigger<00:01:48.049> equipment<00:01:48.259> obviously<00:01:48.890> than

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
uses you bigger equipment obviously than

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.330 
uses you bigger equipment obviously than
i<00:01:49.189> am<00:01:49.700> using<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:50.710> that's<00:01:51.710> one<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.069> reasons

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
i am using so that's one of the reasons

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.590 
i am using so that's one of the reasons
why<00:01:52.490> did<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:52.789> off<00:01:52.939> camera<00:01:53.240> because<00:01:54.340> the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
why did it off camera because the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.370 
why did it off camera because the
so-called<00:01:56.600> only<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.140> 340<00:01:57.619> plow<00:01:57.920> so

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
so-called only a 340 plow so

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.950 
so-called only a 340 plow so
it<00:02:00.310> would<00:02:00.430> have<00:02:00.520> been<00:02:00.579> a<00:02:00.640> lot<00:02:00.790> of<00:02:00.969> back<00:02:01.930> and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
it would have been a lot of back and

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.410 
it would have been a lot of back and
forth<00:02:02.200> not<00:02:02.860> too<00:02:03.159> much<00:02:03.420> excitement

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
forth not too much excitement

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.160 
forth not too much excitement
unfortunate<00:02:05.140> for<00:02:05.289> you<00:02:05.380> guys<00:02:06.149> ah<00:02:07.149> maybe<00:02:07.899> in<00:02:08.080> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
unfortunate for you guys ah maybe in the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.790 
unfortunate for you guys ah maybe in the
future<00:02:08.349> I<00:02:08.590> will<00:02:08.860> attach<00:02:09.429> another<00:02:10.230> 22<00:02:11.230> fields

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
future I will attach another 22 fields

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.979 
future I will attach another 22 fields
together<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.400> then<00:02:12.670> I'll<00:02:12.970> show<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.239> that<00:02:13.420> are

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
together and then I'll show you that are

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.420 
together and then I'll show you that are
sure<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.319> part<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.800> probably<00:02:15.160> not<00:02:15.250> all

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
sure you part of that probably not all

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.790 
sure you part of that probably not all
of<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:18.220> we<00:02:18.459> go<00:02:19.050> let's<00:02:20.050> go<00:02:20.230> check<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
of it there we go let's go check the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.860 
of it there we go let's go check the
levels<00:02:21.130> are<00:02:21.250> like

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.590 

so<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:27.020> could<00:02:27.140> probably<00:02:27.320> put<00:02:27.760> another<00:02:28.760> load<00:02:29.300> of

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
so we could probably put another load of

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.990 
so we could probably put another load of
straw

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.130 

yeah<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.030> really<00:02:38.420> think<00:02:38.540> there<00:02:38.720> needs<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.989> be<00:02:39.019> a

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
yeah I really think there needs to be a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.190 
yeah I really think there needs to be a
neg<00:02:39.500> neg<00:02:39.950> another<00:02:40.300> entrance<00:02:41.300> on<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:41.750> for

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
neg neg another entrance on that for

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.830 
neg neg another entrance on that for
this<00:02:42.319> pastor<00:02:43.220> right<00:02:43.370> here<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.120> there's<00:02:44.360> more

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
this pastor right here and there's more

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.630 
this pastor right here and there's more
than<00:02:45.019> enough<00:02:45.080> grass<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:45.769> this<00:02:45.860> pasture<00:02:46.160> to

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
than enough grass in this pasture to

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.059 
than enough grass in this pasture to
fill<00:02:47.060> your<00:02:47.209> mixer<00:02:47.930> from<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.680> that's<00:02:48.800> one<00:02:49.010> of

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
fill your mixer from and that's one of

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.430 
fill your mixer from and that's one of
the<00:02:49.129> reasons<00:02:49.430> why<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.640> decided<00:02:49.940> who<00:02:50.510> remember

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
the reasons why I decided who remember

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.270 
the reasons why I decided who remember
the<00:02:51.470> gate<00:02:51.769> this<00:02:51.920> time<00:02:52.129> she's<00:02:53.590> um<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.099> that's

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
the gate this time she's um and that's

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.100 
the gate this time she's um and that's
the<00:02:55.430> reason<00:02:55.580> why<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:55.879> felt<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.299> was<00:02:56.390> okay<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.720> try

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
the reason why I felt it was okay to try

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.170 
the reason why I felt it was okay to try
to<00:02:57.170> rip<00:02:57.530> up<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.680> field<00:02:58.010> over<00:02:58.069> there<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.549> did

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
to rip up that field over there I did

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.229 
to rip up that field over there I did
leave<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.629> strip<00:03:00.170> at<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.590> end<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.760> fields

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
leave a strip at the end of the fields

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.270 
leave a strip at the end of the fields
and<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.599> can<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.080> can<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.680> course<00:03:03.769> use<00:03:03.980> this

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
and you can you can of course use this

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.720 
and you can you can of course use this
grass<00:03:04.849> right<00:03:05.090> here<00:03:05.360> for<00:03:06.310> silage<00:03:07.310> as<00:03:07.430> well<00:03:07.610> if

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
grass right here for silage as well if

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.110 
grass right here for silage as well if
you<00:03:07.849> want<00:03:07.880> to

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
you want to

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.729 
you want to
but<00:03:09.720> there's<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.959> strip<00:03:10.170> at<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.319> end<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
but there's a strip at the end of the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.110 
but there's a strip at the end of the
field<00:03:10.950> over<00:03:11.220> there<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:13.200> can<00:03:14.159> actually<00:03:14.580> use

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
field over there and I can actually use

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.360 
field over there and I can actually use
that<00:03:15.150> for<00:03:15.690> silage<00:03:16.019> as<00:03:16.140> well<00:03:16.319> if<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.129> really

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
that for silage as well if I really

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.680 
that for silage as well if I really
wanted

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
wanted

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.120 
wanted
do<00:03:19.320> that

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.280 

combine<00:03:24.760> stuck<00:03:25.030> nope<00:03:25.570> good

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.500 

I'm<00:03:29.860> trying<00:03:30.099> to<00:03:30.159> avoid<00:03:30.489> going<00:03:30.879> to<00:03:31.060> pursue<00:03:31.420> the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
I'm trying to avoid going to pursue the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.009 
I'm trying to avoid going to pursue the
crops<00:03:31.870> just<00:03:32.379> because<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:34.450> wouldn't<00:03:34.719> drag

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
crops just because you wouldn't drag

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.390 
crops just because you wouldn't drag
through<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.290> crops<00:03:35.500> in<00:03:35.680> real<00:03:35.829> life<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.219> I'm

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
through the crops in real life and I'm

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.250 
through the crops in real life and I'm
trying<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:37.799> somewhat<00:03:38.799> adhere<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:40.260> realistic

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
trying to somewhat adhere to realistic

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.319 
trying to somewhat adhere to realistic
principles<00:03:41.829> I'm<00:03:42.549> not<00:03:42.730> gonna<00:03:42.819> say<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> hundred

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
principles I'm not gonna say a hundred

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.479 
principles I'm not gonna say a hundred
percent<00:03:43.689> but<00:03:45.269> as<00:03:46.269> close<00:03:46.629> as<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:47.019> can<00:03:47.099> handle<00:03:48.099> I

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
percent but as close as I can handle I

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.319 
percent but as close as I can handle I
guess<00:03:48.700> is<00:03:48.879> where<00:03:49.030> we<00:03:49.180> boil<00:03:49.420> down<00:03:49.569> to<00:03:49.629> ah<00:03:51.329> but

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
guess is where we boil down to ah but

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.890 
guess is where we boil down to ah but
also

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.270 

I<00:03:57.030> was<00:03:58.030> going<00:03:58.269> that<00:03:58.420> oh<00:03:58.599> my<00:03:58.720> goodness<00:03:59.280> prada

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
I was going that oh my goodness prada

I was going that oh my goodness prada
sec<00:04:00.459> realistic<00:04:00.879> as<00:04:00.970> possible<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.620> if<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:03.670> ever

sec realistic as possible and if I ever
decide<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.269> get<00:04:04.689> a<00:04:06.480> better<00:04:07.480> decide<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:08.019> get<00:04:08.140> a

decide to get a better decide to get a

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.000 
decide to get a better decide to get a
tractor<00:04:09.099> with<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.700> wheels<00:04:09.879> on<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.829> like<00:04:11.829> there

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
tractor with the wheels on it like there

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.580 
tractor with the wheels on it like there
were<00:04:12.040> no<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.310> know<00:04:12.900> as<00:04:13.900> within<00:04:14.230> real<00:04:14.409> assignment

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
were no I know as within real assignment

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.770 
were no I know as within real assignment
so<00:04:14.950> try<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.459> avoid<00:04:15.640> driving<00:04:16.000> over<00:04:16.359> things<00:04:16.570> so

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
so try to avoid driving over things so

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.810 
so try to avoid driving over things so
if<00:04:16.870> i<00:04:16.959> do<00:04:17.019> get<00:04:17.289> there<00:04:17.470> were<00:04:17.530> no<00:04:17.709> i'll<00:04:18.459> probably

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
if i do get there were no i'll probably

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.430 
if i do get there were no i'll probably
just<00:04:18.970> use<00:04:19.449> that<00:04:19.479> for<00:04:20.699> plowing<00:04:21.699> cultivating

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.300 

actually<00:04:26.440> i<00:04:26.470> probably<00:04:26.620> couldn't<00:04:26.889> use<00:04:27.009> it<00:04:27.039> for

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
actually i probably couldn't use it for

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.670 
actually i probably couldn't use it for
plowing<00:04:27.699> because<00:04:27.850> it's<00:04:27.970> not<00:04:28.270> powerful<00:04:28.510> enough

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
plowing because it's not powerful enough

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.939 
plowing because it's not powerful enough
but<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.280> could<00:04:30.520> use<00:04:30.550> a<00:04:30.699> for<00:04:31.000> cultivating<00:04:31.570> and

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
but I could use a for cultivating and

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:38.040 
but I could use a for cultivating and
fertilizing<00:04:32.949> and<00:04:33.190> seeding<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:36.960> think<00:04:37.960> it

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
fertilizing and seeding I think it

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.999 
fertilizing and seeding I think it
should<00:04:38.530> be<00:04:38.590> powerful<00:04:39.220> enough<00:04:39.310> for<00:04:39.520> CD<00:04:40.050> sure<00:04:41.050> 84

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
should be powerful enough for CD sure 84

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.790 
should be powerful enough for CD sure 84
horsepower<00:04:42.490> should<00:04:43.210> be<00:04:43.330> enough<00:04:45.600> hmm<00:04:46.600> I<00:04:46.800> know

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
horsepower should be enough hmm I know

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.590 
horsepower should be enough hmm I know
that<00:04:48.070> Allis<00:04:48.370> Chalmers<00:04:48.520> didn't<00:04:48.970> say<00:04:49.150> how<00:04:49.419> much

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
that Allis Chalmers didn't say how much

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.480 
that Allis Chalmers didn't say how much
it<00:04:49.660> actually<00:04:49.930> need<00:04:50.410> for<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:51.070> terms<00:04:51.280> of

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
it actually need for in terms of

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.960 
it actually need for in terms of
horsepower<00:04:52.889> so<00:04:53.889> that's<00:04:54.310> something<00:04:54.580> I'll<00:04:54.820> need

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
horsepower so that's something I'll need

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.969 
horsepower so that's something I'll need
to<00:04:55.090> think<00:04:55.389> about<00:04:55.570> it<00:04:56.259> should<00:04:56.560> be<00:04:56.680> fine<00:04:56.860> I

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
to think about it should be fine I

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.230 
to think about it should be fine I
actually<00:04:59.979> think<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.520> allis-chalmers

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
actually think the allis-chalmers

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.159 
actually think the allis-chalmers
probably<00:05:01.840> a<00:05:01.870> bit<00:05:02.050> big<00:05:02.259> for<00:05:02.289> this<00:05:02.919> tractor<00:05:03.400> even

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169

alright<00:05:13.389> needed<00:05:13.840> with<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.139> combine<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:14.889> get

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
alright needed with the combine and get

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.570 
alright needed with the combine and get
the<00:05:15.340> other<00:05:15.520> little<00:05:15.759> section<00:05:20.280> way<00:05:21.280> way<00:05:21.550> over

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
the other little section way way over

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.249 
the other little section way way over
there<00:05:22.090> I<00:05:23.220> do<00:05:24.220> like<00:05:24.400> this<00:05:24.550> combine<00:05:24.970> I<00:05:25.720> like<00:05:26.139> the

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
there I do like this combine I like the

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.719 
there I do like this combine I like the
fact<00:05:26.379> that's<00:05:26.620> got<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:26.770> bit<00:05:26.949> big<00:05:27.099> bit<00:05:27.430> bigger

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
fact that's got a bit big bit bigger

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.510 
fact that's got a bit big bit bigger
header<00:05:28.030> on<00:05:28.240> it<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:28.960> it<00:05:29.500> moves<00:05:29.710> a<00:05:29.830> bit<00:05:29.860> faster

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
header on it and it moves a bit faster

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.939 
header on it and it moves a bit faster
than<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:31.090> far<00:05:31.509> it's<00:05:32.349> actually<00:05:32.590> cheaper<00:05:32.740> than

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
than the far it's actually cheaper than

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.290 
than the far it's actually cheaper than
the<00:05:33.009> fire<00:05:33.280> and<00:05:33.430> has<00:05:33.580> a<00:05:33.610> bigger<00:05:33.879> header<00:05:34.120> than

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
the fire and has a bigger header than

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.700 
the fire and has a bigger header than
the<00:05:34.389> fire<00:05:34.569> so<00:05:34.900> it's<00:05:35.889> good<00:05:36.069> in<00:05:36.159> my<00:05:36.280> books<00:05:37.710> it's

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
the fire so it's good in my books it's

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.740 
the fire so it's good in my books it's
got<00:05:38.830> some<00:05:38.949> nice<00:05:39.069> little<00:05:39.400> additions<00:05:40.180> to<00:05:40.270> it<00:05:40.539> so

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
got some nice little additions to it so

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.219 
got some nice little additions to it so
I<00:05:40.990> know<00:05:41.949> there's<00:05:42.759> I<00:05:43.120> think<00:05:43.150> it's<00:05:43.389> a<00:05:43.479> for<00:05:43.870> scrip

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
I know there's I think it's a for scrip

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.850 
I know there's I think it's a for scrip
I<00:05:44.469> think<00:05:44.740> it's<00:05:44.830> called<00:05:45.419> that's<00:05:46.419> on<00:05:46.810> mod<00:05:47.379> hasta

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
I think it's called that's on mod hasta

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.689 
I think it's called that's on mod hasta
and<00:05:47.949> I<00:05:47.979> was<00:05:48.129> considering<00:05:48.729> picking<00:05:49.180> it<00:05:49.449> up<00:05:49.539> I

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.629
