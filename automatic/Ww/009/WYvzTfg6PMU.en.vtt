00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.119
 you already know that the people of microsoft have 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.450
 an exclusivity with activision and that 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.360
 supposedly the year had already finished 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:52.310
 past but it seems that exclusivity 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.470
 it still goes on and there I do not know or have not said 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.210
 nothing has been signed a contract no no 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.330
 He knows nothing or suddenly he wants to have 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.530
 low low already in the contract or suddenly 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.420
 he will have told the press not to speak 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.509
 nothing but suddenly I think that the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.310
 activision people keep signing 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.720
 contracts with microsoft for 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.060
 exclusivity is not good there will be 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.320
