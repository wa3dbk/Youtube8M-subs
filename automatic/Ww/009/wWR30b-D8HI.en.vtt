it's not him

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.950 
it's not him
exactly<00:00:38.430> brand<00:00:38.730> new<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.629> kind<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.840> go

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
lid otherwise it's gonna be a little

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.340 
lid otherwise it's gonna be a little
sticky<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.510> more<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.960> use<00:00:45.989> this

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.830 
sticky and the more that you use this
the<00:00:47.100> more<00:00:47.340> lubricated<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.120> gonna<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the more lubricated it's gonna be so you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.420 
the more lubricated it's gonna be so you
don't<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> worry<00:00:49.379> about<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:50.250> getting

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
that in the top let's see exactly where

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.039 
that in the top let's see exactly where
it<00:01:40.200> goes<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:42.030> that's<00:01:42.240> gonna<00:01:42.450> make<00:01:42.780> your

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
neutral a little bit higher so you can

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.200 
neutral a little bit higher so you can
actually<00:01:45.479> pour<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.259> good<00:01:46.470> 11<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.520> know<00:01:47.549> 12<00:01:47.970> cups
