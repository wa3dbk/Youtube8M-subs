00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.240
 underpass 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.480
 I also wondered why this is an image that is beautiful and why cine no 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.750
 other things you only see why 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.620
 one-sided image now I just want to change that 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.840
 got the plate for a competition here he gets won 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.240
 volunteers to the office 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.660
 make a reality that starts on the church meeting with it 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.400
 Dutch soccerteam 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.800
 from the first half because the hand 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.080
 and it doesn't matter whether or not you played at the ball 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.280
 have the same idea of ​​making a magazine than thirty or so 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.960
 good it 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 a 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.130
 spot and real b and w write display prevent diversity 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.900
 to show and integrity I know in the and for example concert of famous 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.920
 Dutch 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.190
 and like that of jaspers 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.090
 both parties 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.740
 the group of chest that you have who voluntarily wanted to cooperate matic child 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.580
 has himself lived and the publisher with that club would appear a few times away 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.520
 helped to 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.670
 from the concept 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.140
 really thalys wagemakers really 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.409
 articles cannot be devised, so we have to interview the team 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.910
 from no side in a certain way 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.640
 our type is really out of the air, people are having a conversation there 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.470
 with it 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.500
 and there have beautiful fashion reports 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 and yes the pavement parties in which the men ask what they like and then 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.890
 it turns out that I am also very sorry and after long hair always in love 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.689
 to become 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.549
 also 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.479
 a merger at the age of 25 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.819
 yes how all that berkum that 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.749
 being set in motion 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:24.889
 I have all kinds of ideas and but I do not know it is doing well in the magazine 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.450
 said 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.390
 but you hear me helped 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.039
 it's about what is and what isn't 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:36.660
 d66 and then not with what came divided with the text and image 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.420
 with cards it is possible that it does not and also the design of the articles 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.379
 and it is expected that the general idea of ​​years will come later this time 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.379
 appeared after letting sing flat does not matter 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.819
 how do i get a lot of time to copy 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.819
 the fetuses on the day are all weirdly different 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:59.579
 Models come with differences 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.820
 the hague in the same clothing that it would go its own way 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.310
 simply sees that I have the idea of ​​putting it that way 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:12.559
 8 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.289
 8 Israel has 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:17.810
 not so much for the post of a certain age 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.940
 but election that the actual real beauty must come first and foremost 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.880
 who looks beyond you have ideal images that are sometimes sketched 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.110
 in today's society, I think it's great that the fortress is also Kathleen 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.379
 prevent us from entering this eneco 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.309
 another picture is sketched of how it is now the star is still fresh in it 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:39.279
 though talked about one 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:44.599
 9 but in a different way this disease has several attacks but several species 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.519
 dial 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.349
 what I'm not saying that the wrong verse they leave wrong that you should do that 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.819
 but it can also be done in a different way and I can see that and that 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.919
 I think it's really beautiful 8 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:00.370
 I've been sitting the action the recount that has unicef ​​it is now much better 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.369
 than half a year ago because I would not be in this place 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.679
 in-depth reform of 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:07.789
 mvl 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:12.479
 I say I no longer want to help no people to convert 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:17.650
 I have had this idea for so long and now it will soon run into a store and one 

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:21.029
 get light so that is simply not possible 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.089
 heerenveen more has been achieved
