now<00:00:06.550> you<00:00:06.609> know<00:00:06.880> the<00:00:07.029> how<00:00:07.240> and<00:00:07.600> how<00:00:08.410> to<00:00:08.469> load<00:00:08.770> and

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
now you know the how and how to load and

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.980 
now you know the how and how to load and
explode<00:00:09.460> and<00:00:09.820> use<00:00:09.969> your<00:00:10.090> step<00:00:10.389> out<00:00:10.629> and<00:00:10.900> the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
explode and use your step out and the

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.480 
explode and use your step out and the
power<00:00:11.230> grooves<00:00:11.559> helps<00:00:11.889> you<00:00:11.980> get<00:00:12.100> the<00:00:12.219> unit

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
power grooves helps you get the unit

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.760 
power grooves helps you get the unit
turn<00:00:12.699> and<00:00:12.969> you<00:00:13.600> also<00:00:13.809> know<00:00:13.959> the<00:00:14.260> directional

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
turn and you also know the directional

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.529 
turn and you also know the directional
so<00:00:15.010> you<00:00:15.070> know<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.580> how<00:00:15.789> and<00:00:16.059> you<00:00:16.209> know<00:00:16.240> the

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
so you know the how and you know the

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.349 
so you know the how and you know the
where<00:00:16.779> the<00:00:17.470> when<00:00:17.740> is<00:00:17.800> critical<00:00:18.430> to<00:00:18.609> and<00:00:18.850> it's

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:19.359 
where the when is critical to and it's

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.030 
where the when is critical to and it's
probably<00:00:19.810> the<00:00:19.990> icing<00:00:20.350> on<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.560> cake<00:00:20.740> or<00:00:20.980> to

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
probably the icing on the cake or to

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.190 
probably the icing on the cake or to
finishing<00:00:21.310> touch<00:00:21.610> because<00:00:21.970> it<00:00:22.480> allows<00:00:22.840> you<00:00:23.080> to

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
finishing touch because it allows you to

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.140 
finishing touch because it allows you to
know<00:00:23.380> when<00:00:23.620> you're<00:00:23.860> supposed<00:00:24.040> to<00:00:24.400> attack<00:00:24.790> and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
know when you're supposed to attack and

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.400 
know when you're supposed to attack and
when<00:00:25.270> you're<00:00:25.390> supposed<00:00:25.570> to<00:00:25.900> use<00:00:26.050> delayed

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
when you're supposed to use delayed

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.110 
when you're supposed to use delayed
pressure<00:00:26.710> or<00:00:26.950> use<00:00:27.250> quick<00:00:27.520> pressure<00:00:27.820> and

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.120 
pressure or use quick pressure and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.810

first ball our servant of the body the
approach<00:01:25.179> the<00:01:25.329> first<00:01:25.479> of<00:01:25.600> all<00:01:25.689> that's<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:26.159> quick

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
approach the first of all that's a quick

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.590 
approach the first of all that's a quick
pressure<00:01:27.490> technique<00:01:28.029> because<00:01:28.389> you're

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
pressure technique because you're

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.149 
pressure technique because you're
getting<00:01:28.719> to<00:01:28.959> the<00:01:29.049> net<00:01:29.229> for<00:01:29.499> to<00:01:29.590> put<00:01:29.740> away<00:01:29.859> on

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
getting to the net for to put away on

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.469 
getting to the net for to put away on
the<00:01:30.249> third<00:01:30.459> ball<00:01:30.670> just<00:01:30.939> like<00:01:31.060> when<00:01:31.209> you<00:01:31.240> serve

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
the third ball just like when you serve

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.330 
the third ball just like when you serve
and<00:01:31.600> volley<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.289> third<00:01:32.529> quick<00:01:32.799> pressure<00:01:33.039> play

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
and volley the third quick pressure play

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.099 
and volley the third quick pressure play
is<00:01:33.490> when<00:01:33.639> you<00:01:33.759> receive<00:01:34.119> serve<00:01:34.420> it's<00:01:34.899> going<00:01:35.049> to

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
is when you receive serve it's going to

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.660 
is when you receive serve it's going to
be<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.349> hit<00:01:35.529> in<00:01:35.619> charge<00:01:35.920> or<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.340> chip<00:01:36.520> in

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
be the hit in charge or the chip in

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.219 
be the hit in charge or the chip in
charge<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:37.389> you<00:01:37.479> need<00:01:37.659> to<00:01:37.749> work<00:01:37.929> on<00:01:38.109> these

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
charge so you need to work on these

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.160 
charge so you need to work on these
every<00:01:38.709> day<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:39.159> would<00:01:39.789> I<00:01:40.060> would<00:01:40.119> work<00:01:40.840> 30

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
every day I would I would work 30

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
but let's say you're playing michael

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.940 
but let's say you're playing michael
chang<00:02:57.760> or<00:02:58.090> somebody<00:02:58.690> has<00:02:58.810> fantastic<00:02:59.260> returns

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
chang or somebody has fantastic returns

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.259 
chang or somebody has fantastic returns
that<00:03:00.459> if<00:03:00.579> you<00:03:00.700> just<00:03:00.909> serve<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.239> volley

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
that if you just serve and volley

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.599 
that if you just serve and volley
against<00:03:01.900> them<00:03:02.049> they're<00:03:02.200> going<00:03:02.379> to<00:03:02.440> eat<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.459> up

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
against them they're going to eat you up

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.000 
against them they're going to eat you up
and<00:03:03.909> the<00:03:04.599> reason<00:03:04.810> why<00:03:05.139> is<00:03:05.170> because<00:03:05.379> their

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
and the reason why is because their

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.949 
and the reason why is because their
returns<00:03:06.459> are<00:03:06.819> better<00:03:07.030> than<00:03:07.209> your<00:03:07.359> serve<00:03:07.659> and

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
returns are better than your serve and

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.599 
returns are better than your serve and
they<00:03:08.019> put<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.290> at<00:03:08.379> a<00:03:08.409> disadvantage<00:03:08.549> what<00:03:09.549> do

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
they put you at a disadvantage what do
