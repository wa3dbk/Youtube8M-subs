00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
experiences busking with this amp and

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.789 
experiences busking with this amp and
try<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.570> do<00:04:18.690> my<00:04:18.840> best<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:19.140> compare<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.769> a

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
try and do my best to compare it to a

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.740 
try and do my best to compare it to a
roll<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.190> streak<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:20.609> I'll<00:04:21.000> try<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.600> keep

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
roll and streak you I'll try and keep

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.540 
roll and streak you I'll try and keep
this<00:04:21.930> short

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
this short

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.900 
this short
okay<00:04:23.550> I've<00:04:23.790> been<00:04:24.150> using<00:04:24.390> this<00:04:24.660> amp<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.530> busk

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
okay I've been using this amp to busk

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.520 
okay I've been using this amp to busk
for<00:04:26.910> about<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.630> year<00:04:28.230> now

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
for about a year now

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.950 
for about a year now
and<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:29.310> must<00:04:29.490> say<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:30.000> I've<00:04:30.240> been<00:04:30.420> perfectly

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
and I must say that I've been perfectly

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.560 
and I must say that I've been perfectly
happy<00:04:31.290> with<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.860> amp<00:04:32.130> in<00:04:32.340> use<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.730> think<00:04:33.480> it

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
happy with the amp in use I think it

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.230 
happy with the amp in use I think it
produces<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.230> pleasant<00:04:34.920> sound<00:04:35.250> when<00:04:35.970> I'm<00:04:36.090> out

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
produces a pleasant sound when I'm out

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.740 
produces a pleasant sound when I'm out
busking<00:04:37.070> one<00:04:38.070> of<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.310> questions<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:39.120> is<00:04:39.360> it

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
busking one of the questions is is it

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.030 
busking one of the questions is is it
loud<00:04:39.930> enough<00:04:40.700> now<00:04:42.110> where<00:04:43.110> as<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.350> performer

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
loud enough now where as a performer

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.400 
loud enough now where as a performer
when<00:04:44.340> you're<00:04:44.520> sitting<00:04:44.820> behind<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.419> AC<00:04:45.600> 33

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
when you're sitting behind the AC 33

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.890 
when you're sitting behind the AC 33
sometimes<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:47.820> doesn't<00:04:48.270> sound<00:04:48.510> as<00:04:48.720> though

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
sometimes it doesn't sound as though

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.530 
sometimes it doesn't sound as though
it's<00:04:49.050> loud<00:04:49.260> enough<00:04:49.290> but<00:04:50.250> honestly<00:04:50.640> out<00:04:51.240> in

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
it's loud enough but honestly out in

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.840 
it's loud enough but honestly out in
front<00:04:51.810> it's<00:04:52.350> putting<00:04:52.710> plenty<00:04:53.130> of<00:04:53.370> volume<00:04:53.580> out

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
front it's putting plenty of volume out

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.000 
front it's putting plenty of volume out
I've<00:04:54.510> been<00:04:54.870> caught<00:04:55.169> out<00:04:55.350> with<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.680> before

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
I've been caught out with it before

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.620 
I've been caught out with it before
where<00:04:56.340> I've<00:04:56.460> been<00:04:56.580> turning<00:04:57.000> up<00:04:57.120> thinking<00:04:57.540> I

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
where I've been turning up thinking I

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.110 
where I've been turning up thinking I
couldn't<00:04:57.840> hear<00:04:58.050> myself<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.650> I've<00:04:59.550> been<00:04:59.820> asked

from the microphone gain switch and you

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.380 
from the microphone gain switch and you
lose<00:05:14.760> but<00:05:15.510> you<00:05:15.750> lose<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:15.960> mid<00:05:16.260> control

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
lose but you lose a mid control

lose but you lose a mid control
everything<00:05:18.390> else<00:05:18.660> seems<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.110> be<00:05:19.200> global

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
everything else seems to be global

the point of view of an acoustic
musician<00:05:26.070> i<00:05:26.300> think<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:28.050> AC<00:05:28.370> 33<00:05:29.370> produces<00:05:30.270> a

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
musician i think the AC 33 produces a

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.840 
musician i think the AC 33 produces a
more<00:05:30.720> pleasant<00:05:30.990> sound<00:05:31.500> than<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.250> Roland

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
more pleasant sound than the Roland

of course is more flexible it's
certainly<00:05:37.650> got<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:37.860> lot<00:05:38.040> of<00:05:38.070> hind<00:05:38.400> gate<00:05:38.640> high
