00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.210
 What are you talking about ? 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.170
 and today I'm going to talk about it 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.170
 pirate games 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.060
 You have to start with the video I wanted. 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.100
 say that this video is opinionated he 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.930
 serves to stimulate and in the comments 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.000
 an exchange of ideas and is not a truth 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.489
 absolute only bringing here my 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.520
 opinion on the proposed theme 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.190
 I'll start with the controversial bahia who 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.000
 so I never installed a game for pc 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.910
 pirate in Brazil is very common that 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.870
 happen these products are freely 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.879
 marketed just by going through a 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.580
 a camel you meet there 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.530
 several dvd's of the most varied games that 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.839
 are in the market and this is a small 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.000
 of the subject and pirate games take over and 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.920
 of search engines on the internet you just 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.960
 do a quick google search and 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.420
 ready to take it and website that 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.760
 promises to have the game there complete with everything 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.290
 running right and the best without 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.930
 pay nothing for it 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.180
 but we know that you have the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.090
 Shit situation starts when you go 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.490
 try to download and fuck those sites he 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.380
 always has a lot of propaganda 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.390
 then it starts there because of the difficulty 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.030
 download the games most of the time 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.920
 these sites are full of advertising and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.320
 malware or even viruses 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.460
 and who are long and who can damage the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.590
 your equipment 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.649
 besides all this you still run the risk 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.049
 to download a file other than the game 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.329
 You want to download everything, go there, you think. 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.960
 who is downloading Hungarian field of life 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.579
 When are you going to see a porn movie? 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.219
 it is going to lose a lot of time will 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.320
 downloading when installing in the end 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.359
 game gives error due to some sim file 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.250
 corrupted or the game comes 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.560
 outdated and you can not do 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.450
 with which the game runs perfectly this 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.549
 happens a lot and when you play a 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.710
 pirate game most of the time you 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.649
 low and outdated ie the game 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.410
 still not optimized 100% it can 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.090
 come with some optimization errors and for 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.869
 that you have those boring faces of 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.760
 frames 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.490
 but then is it really worth it? 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.140
 install these pirate games 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.690
 one of the main arguments here 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.030
 used by the crowd would be the 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.040
 prices charged in these games 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.840
 this in terms I have to agree 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.540
 some games there really are very expensive 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.050
 type spoke had 250 real not know 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.030
 What the fuck? 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.370
 but we already have great promotions made there 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.300
 by the extinct who turns and moves three games 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.250
 very good 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.129
 there are less than twenty real feelings 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.290
 a promotion there including games of 2014 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.110
 that were recently released were well 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.220
 Cheap and accessible to everyone what 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.099
 Let's be honest. 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.360
 it's much better in the original game he gives you 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.099
 more desire to play 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.080
 nowadays i find much more advantage 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.450
 buy the original game for several 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.000
 reasons that you 're already what motivated me 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.130
 to invest money in original games 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.959
 they were certainly due to a bad 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.910
 experience in pirate games 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.980
 I've had a lot of headaches without 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.930
 Tell me that it's impossible for me 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.239
 tests with pirate games 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.340
 the game becomes very inconsistent and gets 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.560
 really too difficult another reason 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.540
 that for me there is essential is that the game 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.329
 pirate and does not give you play online 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.799
 and I'm a big fan of online mode 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.930
 another advantage also we 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.849
 can quote from the original games is that 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.370
 you give more value is the logical you 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.769
 spent money because the game gives you 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.720
 rewards and achievements but 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.700
 did people have this scheme of 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.459
 achievements and this of course brings 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.200
 feel good about you will really be the 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.540
 game with another stop that's pretty cool 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.370
 that is still a little bit in beta but 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.170
 which is already becoming a reality is 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.430
 the exchange of virtual games 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.280
 some companies are already using 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.420
 these tools for game exchanges 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.120
 that person did not like 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.040
 whats so out so is this leave it here 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.660
 below in the comments the opinion of 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.849
 What did you think I did? 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.849
 I said, did I happen to have forgotten some 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.319
 some pro argument against any place 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.730
 also the comments I received are 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.680
 important we are going to discuss about this 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.930
 This is exactly what I'm talking about. 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.730
 bringing this type of video to talk about it 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.889
 If you liked, do not forget to leave the 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.260
 you like this case you did not like it 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.239
 not just dislike video tell us 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.430
 comments what is missing to 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.150
 Can you improve the content here? 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.789
 you 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.620
 so ends another vlog 50k it's worth 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.620
 A hug, I fucked together and went
