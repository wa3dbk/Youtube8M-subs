00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.189
 most of this difficult situation the atmosphere here is right we 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:19.699
 have a distance these are about the Wolfsburg carmaker 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.739
 we have 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.439
 it is and on the 7th 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.740
 Carlo Wolf a few really good footballers are on the court today 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.739
 that's a kid would be played then go 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.790
 there are 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.670
 between 17 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.850
 for both teams left 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.850
 what is at stake? 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.420
 Today's game is once again a great opportunity for all players 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 to attract attention 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.200
 the mood in the stadium was the fans of both teams fire is seven 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.800
 have powerful voices 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.800
 Let's hope Dorfer good Vilbel 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.119
 the work councilors the last defender and in both ways that is 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.119
 was off good eye else ends 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.610
 wonderful 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.680
 the defender depends on it 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 the 2 0-liter rushes forward and grabs the ball 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.790
 Franz 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.219
 the most difficult to pass 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.919
 a powerful shot with left to often the goalkeeper brilliantly parried 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.539
 not now 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.409
 they lose the ball 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.939
 a fair duel Robert Eisele player said 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:50.089
 So right now, they are more in the category of possession than they are 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:51.579
 Category goals 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:52.939
 want to change that 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.939
 he is not right at the moment we are playing 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.659
 now a good cross then it rang 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.499
 good work on the defensive 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.499
 he could be expensive 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.029
 there say one more these defenders are technically limited by 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:35.029
 we prove the opposite 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.099
 here is not Chile 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.279
 the referee is already looking too old so long it is not more 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.439
 the referee whistles at half-time break if you look at the 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.439
 Statistics Farmer then you do not need to 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.219
 should you Bois 2 2 was the result 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.219
 How come I like to visit 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.419
 in the first half, especially the defenders of both teams in 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.329
 See action 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.650
 but unfortunately they prefer to go through the Alps for the film's development 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.650
 then mistakes are made 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.419
 nice exterior mirror 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.139
 something could work now 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.259
 Audrey 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.419
 the defense is beaten Berthold Eleventh beat others look everyone 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.879
 so far 11 there 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.879
 Clear the way on the return 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:43.249
 as a whole in one with 60 yards and the defensive players against the established ones 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.960
 Parties far too much space and be 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.960
 Consumers who do not complain about the goal 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.490
 and now they do not care that the gate is precautionary 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.490
 obviously was use 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.370
 and again and you only need 2 1 on 4 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.699
 I've had serious concerns about a goalless against them 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.699
 but now this game has been opened 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.650
 expect next to it 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.650
 this is with Dr 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.909
 confidently conquered the ball 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.099
 all equipment soon again 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:58.249
 Now they have the ball 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.969
 so the goalkeeper has no problems 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:26.780
 all pictures 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.780
 know perseverance almost limitless castle 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.410
 There is definitely no time left for midfield skirmishes 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.410
 we are now looking for a direct route to the gate 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:45.559
 with the good of the input, it may work with the compensation 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.360
 and that gives the free kick and that could be dangerous 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.570
 Intermittent change of coaches will see what they thought 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.039
 that's close enough to add value to you 

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:14.809
 should slowly it gets tight only five minutes plus added time 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.600
 where I still get the balance 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:26.589
 too imprecise 

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:29.589
 and Martha 

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:35.339
 good defense work 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:40.039
 but a visited 90 minutes over 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:45.029
 The result is one of the courage to have a loose idea today on the 

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:48.029
 Spectators are satisfied 

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:51.809
 That's what you call a Harbaugh AIDS victory
