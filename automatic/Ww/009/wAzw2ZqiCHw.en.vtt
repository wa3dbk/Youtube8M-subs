00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:24.820 

the<00:05:08.680> protein<00:05:09.340> closet<00:05:09.759> door<00:05:09.970> there<00:05:10.240> long<00:05:11.050> story

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.620 

and<00:05:24.950> now<00:05:25.850> for<00:05:26.480> our<00:05:26.540> 20<00:05:27.410> they're<00:05:28.100> like<00:05:28.340> a<00:05:28.630> 45

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
and now for our 20 they're like a 45

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:41.620 
and now for our 20 they're like a 45
degree<00:05:30.020> angle<00:05:30.550> upwards<00:05:39.670> all<00:05:40.670> right<00:05:40.790> so<00:05:41.330> a

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
degree angle upwards all right so a

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.010 
degree angle upwards all right so a
couple<00:05:41.930> bounce<00:05:42.440> off<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:42.950> ceiling<00:05:43.250> so<00:05:44.180> this

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
couple bounce off the ceiling so this

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.610 
couple bounce off the ceiling so this
definitely<00:05:45.590> get<00:05:46.160> to<00:05:46.310> more<00:05:46.460> than<00:05:46.520> 24<00:05:47.330> feet<00:05:47.620> this

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
definitely get to more than 24 feet this

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.060 
definitely get to more than 24 feet this
