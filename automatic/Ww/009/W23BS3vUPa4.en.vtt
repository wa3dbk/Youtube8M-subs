means<00:01:50.640> contracting<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.720> when<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.829> look<00:01:53.100> at

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the things coming down the road for

the things coming down the road for
Apple<00:01:55.320> things<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> dividend<00:01:56.159> increased<00:01:56.610> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
Apple things like a dividend increased a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.569 
Apple things like a dividend increased a
low-cost<00:01:57.270> iPhone<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.340> additional<00:01:59.340> new

low-cost iPhone and additional new

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.940 
low-cost iPhone and additional new
product<00:02:00.090> launches<00:02:00.570> well<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.380> stock<00:02:01.649> could

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
product launches well the stock could

product launches well the stock could
certainly<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.329> see<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> scenario<00:02:03.689> with<00:02:03.990> a

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
certainly you can see a scenario with a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.660 
certainly you can see a scenario with a
stock<00:02:04.290> should<00:02:04.439> end<00:02:04.619> up<00:02:04.680> significantly<00:02:05.340> higher

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
stock should end up significantly higher

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.429 
stock should end up significantly higher
than<00:02:05.939> lower<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.750> think<00:02:06.869> three<00:02:07.200> hundred

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
than lower so I think three hundred

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.979 
than lower so I think three hundred
dollars<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.920> less<00:02:08.610> likely<00:02:08.640> than<00:02:09.239> more<00:02:09.509> likely

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
dollars is less likely than more likely

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.660 
dollars is less likely than more likely
but<00:02:10.319> we'll<00:02:10.979> see<00:02:11.190> thanks<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.849> lot<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.239> fool<00:02:12.569> on
