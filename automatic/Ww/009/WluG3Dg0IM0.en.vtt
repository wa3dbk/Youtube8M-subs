00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 At first glance, it looks like 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.560
 a very ordinary tourist restaurant 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.900
 but it is rather for 60 years 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.910
 Existing cafe hare fields in Naumburg 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.080

 his sweet sins in xxl format 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.000
 For that, gallons of creamy debug flow

 sylvia richter among other things up to 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.070
 18 cm high chocolate dream processed 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.260
 for our chocolate cream need 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.260
 we then cream our whipped cream 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.390
 pre-cooked with cream precooked 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.700

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.090
 home-baked sliced 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:46.710
 Chocolate discrete bottoms will last now 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.860
 moment season pot so we start 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.449
 to fill our floors 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.910
 that means we have a nice cream 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.530
 purely 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:00.600
 next to our large palette 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:05.670
 Of course, watch out for hours like this 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.460
 is that just 4 x 3 x actually 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 not and then comes the whole cover 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.869
 on top 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.600
 the last lid closes it already 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.619
 Thank you, we start the pie from the outside 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:27.240
 to gamble around 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:29.869
 will participate also under some then 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.869
 still on top 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:41.240
 pretty much everything as if to clean 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.240
 plastered house 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.280
 so that's it then we take ours 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.799
 twelve one piece 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:59.789
 that means we divide those in twelve 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:02:02.789
 even sized pieces take us again 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:10.470
 a spoon at hand and then put on 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:12.510
 these pieces on top of that and then 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.380
 Let's just do it with our glass 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:25.340
