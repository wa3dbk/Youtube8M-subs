so<00:00:09.809> as<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> car<00:00:10.320> designer<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.950> I've<00:00:11.190> always

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
so as a car designer that I've always

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.459 
so as a car designer that I've always
been<00:00:11.910> fascinated<00:00:12.120> by<00:00:12.599> aircraft<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
been fascinated by aircraft and the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.810 
been fascinated by aircraft and the
principles<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.009> flight<00:00:14.099> since<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.549> was<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> young

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
principles of flight since I was a young

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.820 
principles of flight since I was a young
boy<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.780> lot<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.199> aerodynamic

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
boy and a lot of the aerodynamic

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.500 
boy and a lot of the aerodynamic
principles<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.609> physics<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.300> goes

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
principles and the physics that goes

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.019 
principles and the physics that goes
into<00:00:18.810> flight<00:00:19.350> applies<00:00:20.189> equally<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
into flight applies equally to the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.370 
into flight applies equally to the
industry<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.480> car<00:00:21.689> design

you<00:01:07.900> know<00:01:08.020> it<00:01:08.170> jugular<00:01:08.590> we<00:01:08.680> talked<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:08.980> lot

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
you know it jugular we talked a lot

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.100 
you know it jugular we talked a lot
about<00:01:09.130> shrink<00:01:09.760> wrapping<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.450> surface<00:01:10.990> of

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
about shrink wrapping the a surface of

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.320 
about shrink wrapping the a surface of
the<00:01:11.230> card<00:01:11.470> around<00:01:11.830> its<00:01:12.010> mechanicals<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:13.090> this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
the card around its mechanicals and this

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.180 
the card around its mechanicals and this
is<00:01:13.480> absolutely<00:01:13.930> shrimp<00:01:14.290> wrapped<00:01:14.530> around<00:01:14.710> me

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
is absolutely shrimp wrapped around me

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.480 
is absolutely shrimp wrapped around me
yeah<00:01:15.760> it's<00:01:16.000> taking<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.450> another<00:01:16.540> extreme

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.340 

the<00:01:22.939> fact<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:23.299> this<00:01:23.540> is<00:01:23.600> an<00:01:23.900> unpowered

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
the fact that this is an unpowered

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.639 
the fact that this is an unpowered
aircraft<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.549> efficiency<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:27.049> fuselage

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
aircraft the efficiency of the fuselage

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.469 
aircraft the efficiency of the fuselage
design<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.369> aerodynamics<00:01:29.060> create<00:01:29.329> and

design and the aerodynamics create and
the<00:01:29.540> lip<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:29.780> keep<00:01:29.899> it<00:01:30.020> in<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.200> air<00:01:30.670> amazing<00:01:31.670> to

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
the lip to keep it in the air amazing to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.789 
the lip to keep it in the air amazing to
me<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.180> really<00:01:32.360> is<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:32.990> in<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.170> car<00:01:33.380> where<00:01:33.710> you

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
me and really is so in a car where you

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.770 
me and really is so in a car where you
talk<00:01:34.040> about<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.490> power-to-weight<00:01:34.970> ratio<00:01:35.539> and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
talk about the power-to-weight ratio and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.630 
talk about the power-to-weight ratio and
you're<00:01:35.899> trying<00:01:36.080> to<00:01:36.259> reduce<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.770> weight<00:01:36.950> in

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
you're trying to reduce the weight in

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.219 
you're trying to reduce the weight in
advisor<00:01:38.000> we<00:01:38.240> have<00:01:38.390> our<00:01:38.509> lift<00:01:38.689> to<00:01:38.780> drag<00:01:38.810> ratio

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
advisor we have our lift to drag ratio

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.770 
advisor we have our lift to drag ratio
and<00:01:39.950> of<00:01:40.070> course<00:01:40.250> drag<00:01:40.939> obviously<00:01:41.479> is<00:01:41.659> the

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
and of course drag obviously is the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.109 
and of course drag obviously is the
common<00:01:42.140> enemy<00:01:42.439> for<00:01:42.950> both<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.340> us<00:01:43.429> on<00:01:43.729> XC

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
common enemy for both of us on XC

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.149 
common enemy for both of us on XC
incidentally<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.320> most<00:01:45.500> iodine<00:01:45.950> on<00:01:46.100> the

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
incidentally is the most iodine on the

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.969 
incidentally is the most iodine on the
jugular<00:01:46.580> we've<00:01:46.670> ever<00:01:46.820> produced<00:01:46.970> is<00:01:50.979> a

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
jugular we've ever produced is a

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.609 
jugular we've ever produced is a
peregrine<00:01:52.429> 400<00:01:53.000> mobile<00:01:53.330> every<00:01:54.049> pair<00:01:54.259> of<00:01:54.289> ribs

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
peregrine 400 mobile every pair of ribs

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.109 
peregrine 400 mobile every pair of ribs
what<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.250> see<00:01:55.399> he<00:01:55.459> came<00:01:55.700> right<00:01:55.850> alongside

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
what you see he came right alongside

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.630 
what you see he came right alongside
alone<00:01:56.720> with<00:01:56.869> us<00:01:57.020> that's<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.890> fastest<00:01:58.280> bird<00:01:58.429> in

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
alone with us that's the fastest bird in

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.010 
alone with us that's the fastest bird in
the<00:01:58.670> sky<00:01:58.819> would<00:01:59.390> you<00:01:59.479> like<00:01:59.569> to<00:01:59.690> see<00:01:59.840> what<00:01:59.990> a

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
the sky would you like to see what a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.600 
the sky would you like to see what a
hundred<00:02:00.289> miles<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.560> how<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.679> feels<00:02:00.890> like<00:02:00.979> yeah

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
hundred miles and how it feels like yeah
