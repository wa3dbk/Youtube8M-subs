00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
each of them so his is green well

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.430 
each of them so his is green well
actually<00:01:35.030> I<00:01:35.210> think<00:01:35.270> hers<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:35.810> green<00:01:36.080> his<00:01:36.290> is

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
actually I think hers is green his is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.080 
actually I think hers is green his is
blue<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:36.979> their<00:01:37.490> thumb<00:01:37.700> prints<00:01:37.880> are<00:01:37.970> right

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090

next<00:01:38.299> to<00:01:38.360> each<00:01:38.420> other<00:01:38.510> so<00:01:38.720> I<00:01:38.750> placed<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.290> Rings

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
next to each other so I placed the Rings

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.719 
next to each other so I placed the Rings
right<00:01:39.860> over<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.190> center<00:01:40.400> of<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.700> can

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
right over the center of it so you can

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.490 
right over the center of it so you can
kind<00:01:41.000> of<00:01:41.030> see<00:01:41.210> each<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.780> their<00:01:41.900> finger<00:01:42.229> prints

just<00:02:56.859> adjust<00:02:57.280> my<00:02:57.459> exposure<00:02:57.790> up<00:02:58.090> till<00:02:58.510> we<00:02:58.569> get<00:02:58.750> a

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
just adjust my exposure up till we get a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.629 
just adjust my exposure up till we get a
nice<00:02:59.079> little<00:02:59.349> white<00:02:59.560> point<00:02:59.859> on<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.129> sparkles

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
nice little white point on the sparkles

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.399 
nice little white point on the sparkles
of<00:03:00.790> our<00:03:01.299> diamonds<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.930> on<00:03:01.989> kind<00:03:02.139> of<00:03:02.260> the

of our diamonds and on kind of the
specular<00:03:03.040> highlights<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.609> really<00:03:03.909> we're

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
specular highlights and really we're

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.539 
specular highlights and really we're
done<00:03:04.540> with<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.989> image<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:06.010> last<00:03:06.250> thing<00:03:06.459> I'm

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
done with the image the last thing I'm

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.979 
done with the image the last thing I'm
gonna<00:03:06.670> do<00:03:06.849> with<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.299> just<00:03:07.540> go<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.810> select

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
gonna do with this is just go and select

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.140 
gonna do with this is just go and select
a<00:03:08.230> radial<00:03:08.650> filter<00:03:08.799> once<00:03:09.190> again<00:03:09.459> if<00:03:09.639> you're<00:03:10.090> in

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
a radial filter once again if you're in

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.030 
a radial filter once again if you're in
Lightroom<00:03:10.450> 4<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.989> can<00:03:11.109> do<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:11.500> same<00:03:11.739> thing

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
Lightroom 4 you can do the same thing

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.039 
Lightroom 4 you can do the same thing
this<00:03:12.370> image<00:03:12.700> we<00:03:12.819> have<00:03:13.000> our<00:03:13.150> subject<00:03:13.450> centered

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
this image we have our subject centered

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.629 
this image we have our subject centered
so<00:03:14.409> you<00:03:14.470> can<00:03:14.620> also<00:03:14.739> do<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.040> with<00:03:15.099> just<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.459> lens

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
so you can also do this with just a lens

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.009 
so you can also do this with just a lens
vignette<00:03:16.030> but<00:03:16.209> all<00:03:16.299> we're<00:03:16.450> gonna<00:03:16.540> do<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:16.900> just

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
vignette but all we're gonna do is just

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.740 
vignette but all we're gonna do is just
pull<00:03:17.349> in<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:18.010> little<00:03:18.579> burn<00:03:18.939> just<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.510> kind<00:03:19.689> of

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
pull in a little burn just to kind of

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.229 
pull in a little burn just to kind of
give<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.290> little<00:03:20.620> bit<00:03:21.099> of<00:03:21.220> oomph<00:03:21.400> or<00:03:21.760> just<00:03:22.120> a

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
give it a little bit of oomph or just a

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.420 
give it a little bit of oomph or just a
little<00:03:22.510> bit<00:03:22.599> extra<00:03:22.810> focus<00:03:23.349> all<00:03:24.040> right<00:03:24.250> so

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
little bit extra focus all right so

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.619 
little bit extra focus all right so
we're<00:03:24.579> just<00:03:24.609> pulling<00:03:24.939> this<00:03:25.030> down<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.420> about<00:03:25.450> a

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
we're just pulling this down to about a

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.839 
we're just pulling this down to about a
sixty<00:03:26.109> feather<00:03:26.379> then<00:03:27.010> we<00:03:27.159> have<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.400> subtle

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
sixty feather then we have a subtle

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.789 
sixty feather then we have a subtle
darkening<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.689> these<00:03:28.840> edges<00:03:29.170> not<00:03:29.349> too<00:03:29.590> much

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
darkening of these edges not too much

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.589 
darkening of these edges not too much
not<00:03:30.189> too<00:03:30.250> light<00:03:30.700> just<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.150> nice<00:03:31.389> little

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
not too light just a nice little

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.330 
not too light just a nice little
darkening<00:03:32.349> effect<00:03:32.440> where<00:03:32.889> we<00:03:32.980> can<00:03:33.099> kind<00:03:33.280> of

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
darkening effect where we can kind of

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.400 
darkening effect where we can kind of
see<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.730> little<00:03:34.120> bit<00:03:34.419> of<00:03:34.540> extra<00:03:34.810> color<00:03:35.109> towards

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
see a little bit of extra color towards

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.080 
see a little bit of extra color towards
the<00:03:35.560> edges<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:36.040> more<00:03:36.370> brightness<00:03:36.910> in<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
the edges and more brightness in the

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.539 
the edges and more brightness in the
center<00:03:37.180> so<00:03:38.049> we're<00:03:38.290> done<00:03:38.500> that's<00:03:38.919> really<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.400> we

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
center so we're done that's really it we

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.430 
center so we're done that's really it we
just<00:03:39.730> use<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.180> vivid<00:03:40.449> imports<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.049> then

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
just use the vivid imports and then

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.900 
just use the vivid imports and then
we'll<00:03:41.560> sync<00:03:41.859> an<00:03:41.980> entire<00:03:42.250> scene<00:03:42.549> with<00:03:42.699> all<00:03:42.730> the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
we'll sync an entire scene with all the

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.339 
we'll sync an entire scene with all the
effects<00:03:43.389> that<00:03:43.449> we're<00:03:43.629> doing<00:03:43.750> if<00:03:44.019> we<00:03:44.169> have

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
effects that we're doing if we have

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.869 
effects that we're doing if we have
multiple<00:03:44.859> images<00:03:45.010> in<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.370> scene<00:03:45.549> that<00:03:45.669> we<00:03:45.760> want

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
multiple images in a scene that we want

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.089 
multiple images in a scene that we want
to<00:03:45.940> apply<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.180> same<00:03:46.359> effect<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.750> we<00:03:47.440> just<00:03:47.709> sync

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
to apply the same effect to we just sync

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.949 
to apply the same effect to we just sync
it<00:03:48.190> across<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:49.269> let's<00:03:49.569> check<00:03:49.690> out<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.870> before

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
it across so let's check out the before

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.420 
it across so let's check out the before
and<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.319> after<00:03:50.440> with<00:03:50.769> one<00:03:50.980> click<00:03:51.190> over<00:03:51.400> here

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
and the after with one click over here

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.890 
and the after with one click over here
with<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:51.699> vivid<00:03:51.879> and<00:03:52.150> adjustment<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.780> our

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
with the vivid and adjustment to our

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.920 
with the vivid and adjustment to our
exposure<00:03:53.290> we<00:03:53.949> get<00:03:54.190> this<00:03:54.489> image<00:03:54.849> and<00:03:55.299> also<00:03:55.599> our

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
exposure we get this image and also our

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.869 
exposure we get this image and also our
radial<00:03:56.319> filter<00:03:56.500> or<00:03:56.829> vignette<00:03:57.310> depends<00:03:57.790> on

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
radial filter or vignette depends on

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.149 
radial filter or vignette depends on
whatever<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.239> prefer<00:03:58.569> to<00:03:58.750> use<00:03:58.989> all<00:03:59.859> right<00:04:00.010> so

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
whatever you prefer to use all right so

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.039 
whatever you prefer to use all right so
not<00:04:00.310> bad<00:04:00.489> on<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.699> before<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.060> after<00:04:01.449> again

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
not bad on the before and after again

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.089 
not bad on the before and after again
you<00:04:02.139> can<00:04:02.260> hit<00:04:02.409> them<00:04:02.500> before<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.799> after<00:04:03.010> by

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
you can hit them before and after by

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.219 
you can hit them before and after by
hitting<00:04:03.280> backslash<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:04.419> if<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.629> forget<00:04:04.989> just

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
hitting backslash so if you forget just

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.649 
hitting backslash so if you forget just
think<00:04:06.099> of<00:04:06.250> backslash<00:04:06.729> as<00:04:06.970> laying<00:04:07.269> on<00:04:07.479> its<00:04:07.599> back

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
think of backslash as laying on its back

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.059 
think of backslash as laying on its back
it's<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.139> one<00:04:08.260> that's<00:04:08.440> laying<00:04:08.620> backwards

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
it's the one that's laying backwards

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.770 
it's the one that's laying backwards
alright<00:04:09.699> let's<00:04:09.909> go<00:04:10.030> through<00:04:10.060> our<00:04:10.269> develop

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
alright let's go through our develop

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.270 
alright let's go through our develop
settings<00:04:10.959> now<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.560> just<00:04:11.709> talk<00:04:11.859> about<00:04:11.889> through

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
settings now and just talk about through

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.309 
settings now and just talk about through
what<00:04:12.519> we<00:04:12.639> did<00:04:12.819> here<00:04:13.030> so<00:04:13.540> with<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.930> vivid

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
what we did here so with the vivid

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.560 
what we did here so with the vivid
import<00:04:14.829> preset<00:04:15.430> basically<00:04:16.030> what<00:04:16.419> we're

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
import preset basically what we're

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.050 
import preset basically what we're
getting<00:04:16.810> is<00:04:16.989> this<00:04:17.229> kind<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.070> HDR<00:04:18.489> effect<00:04:18.579> we're

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
getting is this kind of HDR effect we're

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.430

25 but with a crush we're actually

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.790 
25 but with a crush we're actually
dropping<00:04:24.580> shadows<00:04:25.060> from<00:04:25.180> plus<00:04:25.539> 25<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.289> 0<00:04:26.560> and

blacks from plus 25 to zero we're also

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.529 
blacks from plus 25 to zero we're also
adding<00:04:29.680> 25<00:04:30.310> additional<00:04:30.699> contrast<00:04:31.210> which<00:04:31.419> is

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
adding 25 additional contrast which is

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.689 
adding 25 additional contrast which is
helping<00:04:31.840> us<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.020> boost<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:33.010> overall<00:04:33.159> contrast

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
helping us to boost the overall contrast

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:34.140 
helping us to boost the overall contrast
in<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:33.880> image

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
in the image

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.450 
in the image
we<00:04:34.840> have<00:04:35.020> a<00:04:35.169> mid-tone<00:04:35.560> clarity<00:04:35.949> boost<00:04:36.099> of<00:04:36.250> plus

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
we have a mid-tone clarity boost of plus

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.640 
we have a mid-tone clarity boost of plus
30<00:04:36.760> vibrance<00:04:37.389> plus<00:04:37.570> 30<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:37.990> saturation<00:04:38.349> plus

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
30 vibrance plus 30 and saturation plus

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.010 
30 vibrance plus 30 and saturation plus
10<00:04:38.950> this<00:04:39.400> gives<00:04:39.639> us<00:04:39.789> a<00:04:39.909> beautiful<00:04:40.450> amount<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.750> X

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
10 this gives us a beautiful amount of X

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.779 
10 this gives us a beautiful amount of X
color<00:04:41.319> to<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.590> image<00:04:41.860> we<00:04:42.310> also<00:04:42.460> have<00:04:42.669> our

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
color to the image we also have our

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.969

standard<00:04:43.389> s-curve<00:04:43.870> being<00:04:44.169> added<00:04:44.530> here<00:04:44.710> adding

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
standard s-curve being added here adding

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.070 
standard s-curve being added here adding
a<00:04:45.039> little<00:04:45.160> bit<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.340> contrast<00:04:45.879> and<00:04:46.060> really<00:04:46.900> it

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
a little bit of contrast and really it

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.689 
a little bit of contrast and really it
that's<00:04:47.440> kind<00:04:47.710> of<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.949> all<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> other<00:04:48.400> settings

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
that's kind of it all the other settings

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:49.980 
that's kind of it all the other settings
are<00:04:48.819> just<00:04:49.210> exactly<00:04:49.539> we've<00:04:49.780> gone<00:04:49.930> over

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
are just exactly we've gone over

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.439 
are just exactly we've gone over
previously<00:04:50.590> so<00:04:51.250> we<00:04:51.400> do<00:04:51.550> have<00:04:51.729> a<00:04:51.789> sharpening

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
previously so we do have a sharpening

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.270 
previously so we do have a sharpening
that's<00:04:52.720> being<00:04:52.870> applied<00:04:53.229> just<00:04:53.919> our<00:04:54.069> standard

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
that's being applied just our standard

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.029 
that's being applied just our standard
amount<00:04:54.580> of<00:04:54.639> 71.5<00:04:55.539> ten<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:55.960> thirty<00:04:56.199> we<00:04:56.770> have<00:04:56.860> no

amount of 71.5 ten and thirty we have no

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.529 
amount of 71.5 ten and thirty we have no
noise<00:04:57.220> reduction<00:04:57.550> that's<00:04:57.879> necessary<00:04:58.360> because

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
noise reduction that's necessary because

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.839 
noise reduction that's necessary because
these<00:04:59.440> are<00:04:59.560> details<00:04:59.949> and<00:05:00.159> we<00:05:00.340> want<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.610> reveal

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
these are details and we want to reveal

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.029 
these are details and we want to reveal
all<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.330> detail<00:05:01.629> possible<00:05:02.080> we<00:05:02.620> zoom<00:05:02.800> in<00:05:02.949> and

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
all the detail possible we zoom in and

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.320 
all the detail possible we zoom in and
we<00:05:03.099> see<00:05:03.220> that<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.460> sharpening<00:05:03.789> looks<00:05:03.970> great

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
we see that the sharpening looks great

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.360 
we see that the sharpening looks great
the<00:05:04.720> the<00:05:05.080> top<00:05:05.289> of<00:05:05.319> the<00:05:05.470> Ring<00:05:05.620> is<00:05:05.740> very<00:05:06.069> much<00:05:06.220> in

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
the the top of the Ring is very much in

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.339 
the the top of the Ring is very much in
focus<00:05:06.569> I'm<00:05:07.569> kind<00:05:07.780> of<00:05:07.840> one<00:05:07.930> of<00:05:07.960> those<00:05:08.139> that

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
focus I'm kind of one of those that

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.020 
focus I'm kind of one of those that
likes<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.919> shoot<00:05:09.069> my<00:05:09.220> ring<00:05:09.430> shots<00:05:09.669> at<00:05:09.819> lower

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
likes to shoot my ring shots at lower

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.969 
likes to shoot my ring shots at lower
apertures<00:05:10.539> usually<00:05:10.870> I'm<00:05:10.960> only<00:05:11.110> going<00:05:11.349> to<00:05:11.379> f/4

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
apertures usually I'm only going to f/4

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.040 
apertures usually I'm only going to f/4
I<00:05:12.009> don't<00:05:12.340> mind<00:05:12.580> if<00:05:12.879> there's<00:05:13.449> a<00:05:13.569> little<00:05:13.930> bit

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
I don't mind if there's a little bit

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.210 
I don't mind if there's a little bit
like<00:05:14.169> if<00:05:14.289> the<00:05:14.380> guy's<00:05:14.560> ring<00:05:14.800> is<00:05:14.919> a<00:05:14.949> little<00:05:14.979> bit

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
like if the guy's ring is a little bit

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.770 
like if the guy's ring is a little bit
blurry<00:05:15.400> this<00:05:16.120> is<00:05:16.270> kind<00:05:16.449> of<00:05:16.509> more<00:05:16.599> of<00:05:16.720> an

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.350 
have you know the profile adjustment
it's<00:05:38.020> not<00:05:38.199> necessary<00:05:38.919> under<00:05:39.610> manual<00:05:39.879> we<00:05:40.180> have

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
it's not necessary under manual we have

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.760 
it's not necessary under manual we have
a<00:05:40.389> zeroed<00:05:40.810> out<00:05:40.900> right<00:05:41.229> here<00:05:41.349> on<00:05:41.409> the<00:05:41.530> lensman

a zeroed out right here on the lensman
getting<00:05:42.190> we<00:05:42.759> don't<00:05:42.940> need<00:05:43.060> it<00:05:43.240> applied<00:05:43.719> so<00:05:44.169> we

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
getting we don't need it applied so we

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.980 
getting we don't need it applied so we
just<00:05:44.530> leave<00:05:44.680> it<00:05:44.800> at<00:05:44.889> zero<00:05:45.300> all<00:05:46.300> right<00:05:46.509> so

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
just leave it at zero all right so

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.689 
just leave it at zero all right so
