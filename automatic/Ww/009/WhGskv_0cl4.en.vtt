and<00:01:28.800> then<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.980> thought<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:30.060> should<00:01:30.210> test<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
and then I thought we should test if the

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.380 
and then I thought we should test if the
jellyfish<00:01:31.080> could<00:01:31.290> handle<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.770> hot<00:01:32.100> tub<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
jellyfish could handle a hot tub and it

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
kind of just snowballed from there but

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.730

I'd<00:01:36.120> say<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.510> a<00:01:36.570> pretty<00:01:36.810> successful<00:01:37.050> test

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
I'd say it's a pretty successful test
