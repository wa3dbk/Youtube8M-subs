00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.049
 or cause it 3 after these mines and 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:06.759
 long vacations we have missed 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.400
 I do not know much, I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.440
 make this very nice card to the one that 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.019
 the color magically appears so that 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.120
 do not take off, I'm using these 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.810
 american caps stamps collection 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.460
 of the first and this 6 by 6 of the same 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.620
 i dreamed collection the truth is that 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.930
 It has very beautiful and super designs 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.700
 feminine is one of the most 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.890
 new american craft so I'm going 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.770
 we work because we need two 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.630
 rectangles of these measures one of 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.670
 white paper and the other to accept it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.700
 in each one of them we are going to seal 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.530
 this girl with black ink the secret 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.660
 so that the two are well aligned 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.490
 it is first to position it where the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.980
 we want and then lift it with the 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.310
 inking block 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.290
 and make the impression first in 4 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.290
 the white and then in the acetate 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.600
 remember that all these materials are 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.430
 we have for sale in memorabilia you can 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.800
 go to the description box and there it is 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.869
 the link that will direct you to the 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.880
 Facebook page and if you get into the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.510
 Photo albums you can find all 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.510
 these beauties 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.030
 to 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.540
 you must be careful when sealing the acetate 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.940
 do not allow the printing to get dirty 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.840
 do not move it because then it will be 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.840
 pretty ugly 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 If you like this video, do not 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.229
 forget to tell us if with a little hand 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.679
 above and also tell us if you have 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.719
 Any doubt or good what you want and 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.340
 well also do not forget 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.890
 subscribe to this channel because every 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.250
 week we will have wonderful ideas in 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.250
 serious 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.170
 it's not that simple to seal on the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.330
 acetate but certainly if you can 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.520
 this is where you should color the lord 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.229
 it does not matter if it is with markers or colors 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.360
 or whatever you want but it's in this 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.640
 part I jumped it and went to what 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.520
 follow that is to put a little bit of 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.459
 glue when are these two well 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.980
 aligned and then I put a circle 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.630
 of an inch in half as well as what 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.850
 from the left side of the screen 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.600
 right away I'm going to use this one that's like a 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:26.650
 folder that measures this and is doubled to the 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.709
 half is to say this and I'm going to make it 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.569
 an opening in the top will 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.769
 cut about a quarter of 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.799
 inches deep on both sides and 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.739
 I'm going to cut in this way so that there 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.620
 my acetate can be introduced and you can see 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.019
 how it happens in magic is very 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.630
 simple I'm just going to put in the 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.360
 bottom part 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.640
 the colored part and above the acetate 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.550
 so it looks colorless and when it 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.890
 go up then look with the color and to 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.740
 stop it and I do not know if it does not go away 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.650
 I'm going to put a piece of paper 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.390
 half an inch x 3 inches and a half at 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.730
 long and I'm going to paste it on the part 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.490
 the stamp that is 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.390
 colored and to serve me as a stop 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.670
 A) Yes 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.250
 and this part of the outside I did it with a 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.500
 stock cards 8 inches by 5 long 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.040
 double them to half and that is to say 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.560
 So it measures 4 x 5 inches and I put that 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.569
 paper of the little cameras that I cut a 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.850
 quarter inch smaller I'm 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.920
 Drilling now using this 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.209
 one-inch circle to mark in 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.340
 where will you pull it up on the 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.290
 central part now I'm going to do the 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.470
 I'll do it in the middle of the window 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.380
 a half inch away from the 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.090
 part of up to down and to 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.640
 this is going to help me with my carpet 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.830
 cut I 'm going to put my rule there to 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.750
 one inch and now vertically 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:59.019
 I'm going to line it up to an inch and I'm going to 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.750
 mark good I'll cut until 5 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.090
 inches is to say that my window is going to 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.269
 have three and a half inches long by 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.220
 two and a half inches wide is average 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.290
 inch smaller than the panel that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.050
 let's put in because this was from 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:18.390
 3 x 4 memories and this will prevent 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.390
 that comes out or something strange happens 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.760
 in this last horizontal cut I no longer 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.550
 you need to measure because the guides are 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.050
 the verticals that I did previously 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.080
 so you must be very careful when 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.110
 do this window because if not the 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.200
 you do the right way the part that 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.360
 it slides because it's not going to look so good 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.340
 as you would expect or the doll is not going to 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.490
 stay in the right place so it's 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.010
 well here I measure it I see that really 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.620
 stay where it belongs and I give 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.810
 mind that it went very well now I'm going to 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.440
 paste this panel inside 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.440
 I will adhere to the main card 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.530
 only the folder I made weighs part 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.120
 Blanca remembers that the movable thing 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.910
 obviously not going to hit so 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.620
 can slide without any problem like that 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.530
 is that I already put the glue in the part 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.650
 below and I'm going to stick it to the card 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.980
 complete and then well, I'm going to 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.650
 close this as folder let's say and I'll 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.900
 put glue on the side and 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.590
 in the bottom part so that I stay 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.020
 like a little bag only the top 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.190
 open and to slide in this way 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.190
 it's super easy 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.210
 Anyway, if you do not think I 'm 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.930
 I explained very well you can leave a 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.290
 commentary 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.240
 and I will not take long to answer you, so 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.700
 well let's move on to this part that is 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.360
 optional is a banner that I put up 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.220
 down and cut the edges with this 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.380
 corner drill manu the 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.830
 corners is more like a little square 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.560
 and I cut him so he had that finish 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.450
 as a ribbon I immediately put a 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.120
 little bit of talcum powder so that 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.010
 bagging ink do not get watered by 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.670
 everywhere and print this stamp that 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:12.780
 says ions for me or you inspires me and 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:15.030
 well now I'm going to start it retreat 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.150
 the dust to show me that I 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.940
 I'm going to put it aside and throw away 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.060
 all this powder inside it 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.280
 bottle to save it that way is that 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.460
 really it is used very little and well what 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.740
 I put perfectly there and good with 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.930
 my impression now I will use the gun 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.030
 of heat so that these powders will 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.190
 melt and I feel sad that you can not see 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.520
 in the camera but the truth is that these 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.090
 powders end with 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.800
 As a plasticized effect, the 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.629
 powders and something truly remains 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.990
 beautiful this is one of my techniques 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:51.879
 favorite and it's a very nice extra in 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.539
 this card that is already beautiful 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:57.879
 So good this already here 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:01.090
 extra that is beautiful now I'm going to 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:03.780
 put it with font and sticker that is going to 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.710
 give a very beautiful touch not accommodate 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.379
 perfectly and quickly as 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.449
 I will simply place it so that it 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:12.280
 a much cuter view 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.650
 so it's good dear carter's this 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.659
 is the card today I hope you 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.030
 animes to do it does not matter that no 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:22.389
 you have exactly these materials if 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.889
 you can buy them better but yes no 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:25.569
