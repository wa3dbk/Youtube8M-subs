00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
I guess the culture side of everything

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.380 
I guess the culture side of everything
everything<00:02:14.450> off<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.810> field<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.970> Europe<00:02:17.239> as<00:02:17.360> a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
everything off the field to Europe as a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.479 
everything off the field to Europe as a
whole<00:02:17.630> yeah<00:02:18.230> minutes<00:02:18.709> it's<00:02:18.950> different<00:02:19.370> in

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
whole yeah minutes it's different in

whole yeah minutes it's different in
many<00:02:19.670> aspects<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.300> yeah<00:02:20.840> probably<00:02:21.019> greatest

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
many aspects but yeah probably greatest

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.740

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
thing was just the friendliness and the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.740 
thing was just the friendliness and the
open<00:02:24.650> nature<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.510> people<00:02:26.510> over<00:02:26.630> here
