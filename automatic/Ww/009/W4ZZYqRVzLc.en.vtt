00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
one thing all modern-day vehicles have

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.670 
one thing all modern-day vehicles have
in<00:01:04.670> common<00:01:04.940> is<00:01:05.360> shock<00:01:05.660> absorbers<00:01:06.229> they're

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
in common is shock absorbers they're

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.490 
in common is shock absorbers they're
used<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.460> dampen<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.270> spring<00:01:08.600> oscillation<00:01:09.380> of

a<00:01:09.620> vehicle<00:01:10.070> or<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.220> up-and-down<00:01:10.670> movement

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
a vehicle or the up-and-down movement

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.380 
a vehicle or the up-and-down movement
basically<00:01:11.960> their<00:01:12.470> function<00:01:12.920> is<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.070> take

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
basically their function is to take

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.550 
basically their function is to take
movement<00:01:14.390> energy<00:01:14.690> or<00:01:14.810> kinetic<00:01:14.930> energy

movement energy or kinetic energy

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.800 
movement energy or kinetic energy
convert<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.550> thermal<00:01:17.090> energy<00:01:17.330> which<00:01:17.630> is

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
convert it to thermal energy which is

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.600 
convert it to thermal energy which is
heat<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.260> dissipate<00:01:19.160> it<00:01:19.280> into<00:01:19.460> the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
heat and dissipate it into the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.410 
heat and dissipate it into the
