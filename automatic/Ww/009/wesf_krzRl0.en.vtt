00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.970 
think it's the best dress area was in
the<00:02:28.620> film<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:30.000> can't<00:02:30.329> get<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.980> really

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
the film you can't get it really

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.649 
the film you can't get it really
anywhere<00:02:32.459> from<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.849> Disney<00:02:33.180> Store<00:02:33.390> looking

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
anywhere from the Disney Store looking

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.809 
anywhere from the Disney Store looking
like<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.290> know<00:02:34.739> they<00:02:34.950> did<00:02:35.129> have<00:02:35.340> one<00:02:35.609> that

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
like this I know they did have one that

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.619 
like this I know they did have one that
was<00:02:35.970> released<00:02:36.299> in<00:02:37.370> America<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.030> parks<00:02:39.450> I

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
was released in America in the parks I

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.569 
was released in America in the parks I
think<00:02:39.840> years<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.230> years<00:02:40.379> ago<00:02:40.530> which<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.340> did

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
think years and years ago which I did

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.030 
think years and years ago which I did
have<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:42.150> obviously<00:02:42.840> years<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.680> years<00:02:43.829> ago

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
have but obviously years and years ago

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.430 
have but obviously years and years ago
that<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.459> now<00:02:44.700> gone<00:02:44.939> so<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:45.629> thought<00:02:46.139> this<00:02:46.260> one

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
that is now gone so I thought this one

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.839 
that is now gone so I thought this one
was<00:02:46.470> better<00:02:46.769> though<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> be<00:02:47.250> honest<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.670> think

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
was better though to be honest I think

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.089 
was better though to be honest I think
it<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.329> nicer<00:02:48.599> look<00:02:49.260> exactly<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.859> the

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099
