00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.350
 I did not want to come because he 's doing 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.350
 very cold 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.720
 we are at 14 degrees a lot of sensuality 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.099
 let's go to a hot chocolatito 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.099
 beautiful desert 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:31.490
 like a shampoo shampoo and a champurrado 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.180
 season to I grabbed the grip with a 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.180
 tamal cake 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.129
 but how that kind of feeling is made 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:54.399
 of atole but it is a little thicker 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:54.399
 because it has piloncillo that is not 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.280
 ok take your flour flour 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.970
 exactly what you put in a bucket of 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.970
 ice 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.250
 as before then on Fridays in water 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.760
 you put him like that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.760
 my grandmother 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.760
 preferably hot water water 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.760
 hot 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.540
 good warm water area to start 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.540
 do what 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.399
 ah 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.740
 and you put the flour 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.740
 well more cornstarch flour but 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.170
 cornstarch ok if you put your teeth 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.180
 then a few teaspoons of sugar if 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.180
 short half piloncillo 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:17.100
 of piloncillo and pour it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:30.090
 the pyro just pours good exchange rate 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.090
 alosno and that's how it is
