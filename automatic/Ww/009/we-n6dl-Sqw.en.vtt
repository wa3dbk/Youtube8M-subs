00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:16.670
 finally the recipes so requested in 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.310
 our group on facebook community of 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.590
 cupcakes and here the cupcakes of 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.039
 chocolate for this recipe are going to 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.100
 need hot water a cup of water 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.260
 very hot to the I put it in the 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.210
 microwave for two minutes can 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.680
 do in stove as you want 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.680
 half a cup of vegetable oil 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.960
 a cup of whole milk is milk 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.700
 Blanca has never used evaporated milk or 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.560
 another type of milk that does not mean 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.260
 that is not going to work simply that 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.550
 I have never used it but I imagine 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.550
 if they can use evaporated milk 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.780
 here we have two eggs at temperature 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.100
 room remember that all 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.629
 ingredients must be at 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.640
 room temperature or the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.220
 liquid ingredients less water 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.489
 because it has to be hot almost 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.489
 boiling 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.710
 here we have already mixed two cups of 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.619
 sugar one cup and three quarts of flour 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.860
 whole flour normal parity flour all 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.070
 use 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.020
 we also have a teaspoon plus a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.260
 quarter teaspoon of powder 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.960
 bake more or a teaspoon and a 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.150
 quarter teaspoon of baking 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.280
 sodium a pinch of salt that has been 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.240
 a quarter teaspoon of salt 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.780
 and this is three fourth of a cup 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.450
 cocoa three quarts are a quarter cup 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.220
 three times that's three quarters because I 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.720
 have asked then to specify 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.220
 and it's all here already mixed ok that's 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.200
 recipe is so simple to do because the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.840
 recipe that they call a bowl recipe 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.860
 where everything is mixed in the same goal and 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.860
 it's very easy 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.250
 although now 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.440
 that can be done in the machine 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.380
 mix blender or they can do to 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.840
 hand perfectly there is no 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.300
 problem also forget to tell them that 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.940
 It also has a little extract of 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.610
 vanilla where that can never be missing in 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.880
 no recipe 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.420
 ok let's put this mix to 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.280
 slow speed 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.489
 only until the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.430
 mix this does not have to be finished 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.960
 that has to end 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:49.370
 the flour and the whole mixture together 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:52.360
 ok now we start adding you 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.360
 the milk 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:03.100
 quickly the eggs 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.100
 fast in the oil 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.189
 we increase the speed 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.890
 this is being done in real time and 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:20.100
 increases the speed by about 5 seconds 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.400
 until everything is well incorporated and you 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.599
 throw the water 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.599
 very hot 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.980
 gradually to avoid 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.530
 it's that easy now let this 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.390
 mix about 30 seconds and 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.390
 then we will clean the spatula 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.980
 this mixture is very liquid as well 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.440
 they see it and it's perfectly fine that way 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.800
 how it should stay ok now we are going to 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.970
 We are going to divide it in the k corridors and 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.250
 we're going to bake it in the oven 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.220
 preheated to 350 degrees their cupcakes 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.970
 to bake for about 18 minutes that 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.690
 It always depends on your oven 18 minutes 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.850
 then the cupcakes are ok now 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.850
 we are going to put the frosting
