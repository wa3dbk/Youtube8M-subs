00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.649
 i 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.780
 to 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.230
 for me death is a step inside 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.119
 life for me death in death 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.090
 as such it is simply the continue 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.110
 of a cycle because I do not get 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.110
 that we live 70 80 90 years in the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:41.640
 earth and there everything ends I think that 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:42.899
 something must be missing with us if this 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.670
 laboratory as such has a 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.520
 very strong representation between 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.339
 city â€‹â€‹because we are the only laboratory 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.949
 that not being a medical school 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.059
 handles corpses and components 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.579
 anatomopathological for the study and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.989
 development when we enter the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.929
 lab in the now that what we're going 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.839
 to find us are those that are for 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:06.870
 locate lightly dissected corpses for 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.450
 the study of bone muscles veins 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.000
 arteries nerves ligaments 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.130
 we will find in all the edges 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.399
 from the laboratory what is part of the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.799
 museum of anatomy the museum are segments 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.560
 anatomical that are cut to be able 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.360
 do very specific study of certain 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.909
 areas then we find tips 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.620
 superior trunks tips 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.980
 lower 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.660
 in the background we find the cava de 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.430
 preservation when we extract the 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.940
 corpses of position to legal donated 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.380
 those corpses arrive in zeros then 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.840
 while the whole process of 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.350
 preservation is saved from table cava 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.350
 will replicate 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.650
 before the body arrives here not in 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.590
 any almost any kind of 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.360
 preservation that we do as 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.190
 the body in legal medicine is in a 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.220
 cooling bed we leave it 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.660
 defrosting approximately 6 hours 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.760
 after it 's freezes we open the 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.619
 thoracic cavity that is already open by 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.070
 the necropsy procedure and 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.150
 we removed all that component of bunks 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.800
 when the body is already conditional 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.590
 frozen we use something called 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.140
 mac injector is a motorcycle larger than 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.330
 uses the pressure to push a 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.100
 Preservative fluid that deforms 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.280
 which four analyzes after verifying 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.959
 that is injected at arterial level 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:35.230
 and repeat that procedure for 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.300
 three days every day once you leave 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.120
 15 days for the formalin to fix the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.100
 followed properly after it 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.450
 formed is already fixed the body can be 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.180
 leave here that is not going to 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.489
 decompose under any circumstances and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.140
 we started the dissection process on 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.870
 conscious insertion process first 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.920
 in removing the skin then remove all the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.900
 grease 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.510
 then the strawberry subcutaneous tissue 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.920
 aponeurosis membranes etcetera and already 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.650
 we started to expose what they would be 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.410
 muscles veins and arteries already so that the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.580
 body is totally ready to do 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.580
 the anatomical study in him 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.190
 the judicial investigation are all 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.100
 procedures that are performed for 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.019
 determine in a criminal proceeding the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.760
 validity of a test doing the 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.160
 collecting the analysis and 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.800
 interpretation of the results 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.410
 and the tanatopraxia are all 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.960
 technical procedures they use 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.150
 different chemicals to make 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.030
 the preservation of the corpse the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.130
 reconstruction when there is deformity and 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.050
 the presentation of that body before the 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.720
 mourners in a dignified way that the 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.970
 family can not talk without decreasing 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.080
 to the maximum the traumatic component that 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.080
 has death as such 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.860
 in Colombia until 12 years ago the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.860
 tanatopraxia was something empirical 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.530
 this is a corpse which has already been 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.180
 completely designed from cintia le 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.940
 we have retired as you may realize 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.150
 Here you can see traces of the skin 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.269
 but it's already removed the skin the fat 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.140
 and the subcutaneous cellular tissue 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.540
 basically that we found here by 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.640
 example we have the thigh region of 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.610
 the leg and we can see the 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.940
 sartorius muscle we can see the artery 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.760
 femoral we find the thoracic cavity 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.570
 already as such where the muscles are 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.849
 intercostals in the spine 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.969
 we found the upper member 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.709
 here in the hand we preserve the 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.990
 let's blame to recover the 

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:46.929
 footprints and at some point you order 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.209
 identified or claimed as such by 

00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:52.169
 the family equal the whole process will be 

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:52.169
 performs throughout the body 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.870
 from this laboratory they have suffered more 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.300
 of 89 research projects in 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.340
 science learning about variants 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.000
 Anatomical development of techniques 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.430
 Surgical measurement of components like 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.340
 well we take a component for example it 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.740
 cut this limb the heavy and 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.900
 according to that we establish a person 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.730
 of so much structure what should be 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.400
 our specialty to ponder a 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:24.010
 amputation the prosthesis and the most real thing 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:29.920
 possible and can be adjusted and does not feel 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:31.720
 so much the difference that individual in 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.280
 these laboratories going forward what will 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.680
 finish their in the other cases of 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.370
 plastination where they will be preserved 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.810
 the knowledge of perpetual form if these 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.630
 bodies are going to be able without being 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.000
 identified today or even among 500 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.670
 2000 years because these techniques what 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.290
 they do is change all the cells all 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.190
 body water by biopolymers 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:56.280
 always guaranteeing to be personal 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.280
 and
