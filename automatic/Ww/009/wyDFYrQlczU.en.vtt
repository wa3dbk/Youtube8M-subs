00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.800
 together we prepare the very expensive 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.809
 meatballs of easy to prepare with 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.830
 few and simple ingredients 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.830
 let's see how 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.260
 we chop in the bread box 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.450
 inside a container to this 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.220
 point let's add a little milk but 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.020
 be careful not to get too wet 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.150
 father let us soak it well 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.430
 helping us with our hands and we can 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.710
 add a can of tuna a 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.050
 about 80 grams to which we already have 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.750
 twisted the hate we add two teaspoons 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.920
 of frozen or fresh parsley e 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.809
 a generous handful of Parmesan with 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.379
 the fork helps us to mix 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.409
 well the mixture time to live a new 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.239
 and take the yolk to insert into the 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.010
 our compound leaving the part 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.500
 the album is that we will need it later for 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.869
 learn the perspectives we continue to 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.380
 knead our mixture until 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.880
 reach a certain density 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.530
 add about 3 teaspoons of 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.180
 breadcrumbs shuffle and I try now 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.159
 we work all the ingredients well or 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.500
 until the dough is just blended 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.570
 if it is too soft 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.400
 add a few more tables of 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.829
 bread crumbs 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.600
 now let's put a saucepan on the stove and 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.119
 we begin to heat the oil for then 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.039
 fry the meatballs 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.840
 now for a healthy fry would be 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.549
 the extra virgin olive oil of 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.619
 olive but the taste would be too much 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.990
 intense so we prefer to use 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.789
 peanut oil which 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.009
 will make the fry much more 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.659
 light and tasty we take the egg white and 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.630
 with a pinch of salt 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.140
 we mount it to snow we leave it aside 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.700
 and we start preparing the meatballs 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.679
 let's take a little bit of the mixture 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.630
 on the palm of our hand and helping us 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.649
 with the other we begin to form the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.810
 small balls 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.090
 let 's pass the meatball in the album that 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.289
 we just slammed and immediately after 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.999
 let's go in the breadcrumbs 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.009
 naturally we continue in this way 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.500
 until all the mixture is exhausted 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.950
 we have prepared at this point I would say 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.810
 that we are ready for frying 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.750
 let's start by cooking about 3 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.680
 meatballs we help each other with pliers for 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.610
 avoid getting burned with hot oil e 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.770
 let it cook for about 57 minutes 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.960
 turning them from time to time we pull them 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.160
 out and put them on a plate with 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.410
 of absorbent paper 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.260
 a paper towel is fine too 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.000
 we use locally at this point 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.520
 we also proceed with the second half 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.450
 of our meatballs and we repeat it 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.940
 same passage 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.300
 and here they are our meatballs al 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.300
 lathe
