00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.920 
put it on you have to line it up so
exact<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.970> example<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
exact for example you do have the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.719 
exact for example you do have the
speaker<00:01:43.439> back<00:01:43.619> there<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.579> make

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
speaker back there so you have to make

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.030 
speaker back there so you have to make
sure<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.060> aligned<00:01:45.149> perfectly<00:01:45.829> atop<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
sure it's aligned perfectly atop the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.889 
sure it's aligned perfectly atop the
speaker<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.240> make<00:01:48.420> sure<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
speaker and you have to make sure the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.990 
speaker and you have to make sure the
camera<00:01:49.290> isn't<00:01:49.619> covered<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.820> really

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
camera isn't covered and it's really

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.569 
camera isn't covered and it's really
hard<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.570> without<00:01:51.899> actually<00:01:52.770> setting

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
hard to do that without actually setting

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.490 
hard to do that without actually setting
it<00:01:53.670> down<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.180> real<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.570> ting<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
it down and real if ting it but the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.810 
it down and real if ting it but the
problem<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.920> once<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.729> many

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
problem is once you do that so many

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730 
problem is once you do that so many
times<00:01:57.119> you're<00:01:57.299> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.719> lot<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.140> dust

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
times you're going to get a lot of dust

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.340 
times you're going to get a lot of dust
and<00:01:59.070> fingerprints<00:01:59.549> behind<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.240> even<00:02:01.049> when<00:02:01.259> you

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and fingerprints behind it even when you

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.410 
and fingerprints behind it even when you
are<00:02:01.530> using<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.130> spray<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.030> i<00:02:03.060> finally

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
are using that spray so i finally

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.620 
are using that spray so i finally
applied<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.770> best<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.250> could<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.850> there<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
applied it the best I could and there is

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.839 
applied it the best I could and there is
a<00:02:06.659> bunch<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.229> creases<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.550> there<00:02:08.819> was

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
a bunch of creases in it there was

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.210 
a bunch of creases in it there was
bubbles<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.050> these<00:02:10.289> bubbles<00:02:10.709> will<00:02:10.860> not<00:02:11.009> come
