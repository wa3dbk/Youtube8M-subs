okay<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.639> version<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.300> laser<00:00:03.510> sabers

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
okay this is a version of laser sabers

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.450 
okay this is a version of laser sabers
sjr<00:00:04.890> looper<00:00:05.520> 4.0<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:07.170> this<00:00:07.410> one's<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.740> little

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
sjr looper 4.0 and this one's a little

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.040 
sjr looper 4.0 and this one's a little
different<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.660> doesn't<00:00:09.929> need<00:00:09.990> a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
different in that it doesn't need a

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.259 
different in that it doesn't need a
battery<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:11.010> work<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.759> also<00:00:11.910> emits

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
battery to work and it also emits

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.169 
battery to work and it also emits

of 48 WG there's made a finger to to
show<00:00:37.710> us<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> tiny<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.340> thing<00:00:38.579> but<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.820> seems

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
show us a tiny little thing but it seems

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.170 
show us a tiny little thing but it seems
to<00:00:39.090> work<00:00:39.270> best<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.870> configuration<00:00:41.180> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
to work best in this configuration the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.299 
to work best in this configuration the
diode<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.960> an<00:00:43.079> industrial<00:00:43.379> looking<00:00:43.890> job'

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
diode here is an industrial looking job'

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.700 
diode here is an industrial looking job'
that<00:00:45.030> came<00:00:45.180> from<00:00:45.270> an<00:00:45.420> old<00:00:45.480> TV<00:00:45.600> circuit<00:00:46.289> board

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that came from an old TV circuit board

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.650 
that came from an old TV circuit board
well<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.250> only<00:00:47.340> got<00:00:47.550> an<00:00:47.610> open<00:00:47.940> 5<00:00:48.120> volt<00:00:48.420> drop

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
well it's only got an open 5 volt drop

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.420 
well it's only got an open 5 volt drop
so<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.020> think<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> sharpie<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.950> works<00:00:50.190> well

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
so I think it's a sharpie it works well

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.779 
so I think it's a sharpie it works well
anyway<00:00:50.789> now<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> modification<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:53.460> not

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
anyway now the modification is to not

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.380 
anyway now the modification is to not
have<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.090> 3<00:00:54.329> LEDs<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:55.260> line<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.860> one

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
have the 3 LEDs in line but to have one

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.500 
have the 3 LEDs in line but to have one
diode<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.809> case<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.699> 1<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.879> 4<00:01:00.090> 1<00:01:00.239> 4<00:01:00.480> 8

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
diode in this case it's a 1 and 4 1 4 8

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.810 
diode in this case it's a 1 and 4 1 4 8
and<00:01:01.879> then<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.629> 2<00:01:03.899> helpful<00:01:04.650> wires<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.610> coil

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and then the 2 helpful wires to a coil

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.910 
and then the 2 helpful wires to a coil
or<00:01:06.090> three<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.659> fact<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> center<00:01:07.500> tap<00:01:07.740> if

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
or three in fact with a center tap if

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.030 
or three in fact with a center tap if
you<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.250> well<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.240> replaces<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.170> other<00:01:10.740> 2

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
you like well that replaces the other 2

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.609 
you like well that replaces the other 2
LEDs<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.299> goes<00:01:12.780> back<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> base<00:01:14.299> so<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
LEDs and goes back to the base so on the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.850 
LEDs and goes back to the base so on the
center<00:01:16.950> tap<00:01:17.159> I've<00:01:17.430> got<00:01:18.000> an<00:01:18.150> indicator<00:01:18.540> light

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
center tap I've got an indicator light

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.679 
center tap I've got an indicator light
and<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.640> virtual<00:01:21.150> ground<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and out to a virtual ground and the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.999 
and out to a virtual ground and the
reason<00:01:21.930> why<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> virtual<00:01:22.470> ground<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.830> there

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
reason why the virtual ground is there

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.710 
reason why the virtual ground is there
is<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.460> touch<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.540> light

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
is because if I touch it the light

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.530 
is because if I touch it the light
brightens<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.009> pretty<00:01:26.189> good<00:01:26.540> now

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
brightens up so that's pretty good now

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.200 
brightens up so that's pretty good now
it<00:01:27.600> also<00:01:27.780> serves<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.560> simply<00:01:29.159> show<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it also serves just simply show that the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.399 
it also serves just simply show that the
circuits<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.840> operation<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.909> here's<00:01:32.909> 3<00:01:33.659> LEDs

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
circuits in operation and here's 3 LEDs

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.230 
circuits in operation and here's 3 LEDs
which<00:01:34.740> would<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.130> similar<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.579> those<00:01:35.759> 3<00:01:36.030> that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
which would be similar to those 3 that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.090 
which would be similar to those 3 that
on<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> 2014<00:01:37.920> coil<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:39.240> there<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
on a 2014 coil and there we are and if I

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.539 
on a 2014 coil and there we are and if I
turn<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.850> touch<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> heatsink<00:01:42.600> again<00:01:43.549> they

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
turn if I touch the heatsink again they

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.609 
turn if I touch the heatsink again they
speed<00:01:44.880> up<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.750> they're<00:01:46.140> flash<00:01:46.350> trace

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
speed up and they're flash trace

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.920 
speed up and they're flash trace
basically<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.909> me<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.270> looks<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.630> solid

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
basically to me it looks like a solid

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.850 
basically to me it looks like a solid
line<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.579> that<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.759> brightens<00:01:51.180> up<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
line and that one brightens up and you

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.260 
line and that one brightens up and you
can<00:01:52.979> try<00:01:53.189> out<00:01:53.220> different<00:01:53.310> coils<00:01:53.790> then<00:01:54.060> this

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
can try out different coils then this

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.230 
can try out different coils then this
one<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.720> 24<00:01:55.500> turns<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
one here is 24 turns of what is it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.859 
one here is 24 turns of what is it
22<00:01:57.780> 24<00:01:58.320> gauge<00:01:59.180> here's<00:02:00.180> another<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.659> here

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
22 24 gauge here's another one here

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.840 
22 24 gauge here's another one here
which<00:02:01.110> was<00:02:01.590> tried<00:02:01.829> different<00:02:02.040> capacitors<00:02:02.640> I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
which was tried different capacitors I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.770 
which was tried different capacitors I
think<00:02:03.119> that's<00:02:03.270> worth<00:02:03.390> 102<00:02:04.290> that's<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.890> there

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
think that's worth 102 that's on there

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.060 
think that's worth 102 that's on there
try<00:02:06.780> another<00:02:06.930> one<00:02:07.320> here<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.160> are<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.890> that

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
try another one here we are and that

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.170 
try another one here we are and that
one's<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.370> bit<00:02:11.610> brighter

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
one's a bit brighter

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.000 
one's a bit brighter
try<00:02:13.020> again<00:02:13.080> see<00:02:13.380> if<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.620> brighten<00:02:13.860> them

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
try again see if you can brighten them

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.580 
try again see if you can brighten them
both<00:02:14.160> up<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> bit<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.170> fun<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.410> just

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
both up and it's a bit of fun it just

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.100 
both up and it's a bit of fun it just
means<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.010> really<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.540> idea<00:02:18.810> was<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.960> see

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
means that really the idea was to see

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.510 
means that really the idea was to see
whether<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.380> could<00:02:19.530> be<00:02:19.650> made<00:02:19.800> into<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:20.160> wireless

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
whether it could be made into a wireless

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.500 
whether it could be made into a wireless
system<00:02:20.700> which<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.270> can<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:23.250> also<00:02:23.430> run<00:02:24.330> it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
system which you can and to also run it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.010 
system which you can and to also run it
with<00:02:24.660> no<00:02:24.870> night<00:02:25.440> volt<00:02:25.680> battery<00:02:26.150> instead<00:02:27.150> going

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
with no night volt battery instead going

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.520 
with no night volt battery instead going
through<00:02:28.230> from<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.620> CFL<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.810> there<00:02:30.990> we<00:02:31.110> are

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
through from the CFL so there we are

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.660 
through from the CFL so there we are
no<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.760> need<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.270> why<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.750> southpaw

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
no but you need it and why the southpaw

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.810 
no but you need it and why the southpaw
okay
