00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.920
 here at Gaisberg we have two 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.589
 different trails the lisi osl trail 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.870
 and the gaisberg trail lisi osl trail 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.199
 was named the overall World Cup winner 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.940
 named lisi osl and became a kind of 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.899
 Gift made on this route 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.409
 She also trains a lot of deliziosa 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.909
 shows 55 curves so very strong 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.939
 changes of direction partly 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.979
 and a lot of investors 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.640
 So perfect for curves to drive 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.369
 work out 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.060
 We have 400 meters of altitude on the Gaisberg 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.940
 overcome 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.920
 So with the fan it is exactly 413 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.810
 altimeter and the trails are 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.270
 between two and three kilometers long 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.340
 the lisi osl trail knows specifically in 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.159
 lower part less difficulties 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.649
 that means you could get the upper part up 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.170
 driving on gravel or asphalt and only in the 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.899
 enter lower part of this is the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.940
 really suitable for families can be the 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.229
 three also combine speak in 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.509
 change middle 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.729
 the gaisberg part is a bit harder 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.500
 As far as things go you need everyone 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.939
 case a downhill bike or a good one 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.479
 Translated center europe 1 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.079
 In 2014 we have the Austrian ones 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.280
 held championships in downhill 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.320
 since then is a bit difficult 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.390
 become and quite demanding that 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.850
 Gaisberg Tales are open from the beginning of May until 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.929
