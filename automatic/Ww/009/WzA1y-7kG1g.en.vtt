 that benefits good arterial health 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.530
 the healthy monounsaturated fats

 of fat that far from damaging the organism 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.680
 it benefits him

 This type of fat does not have an impact 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.810
 harmful in the glucose levels in the 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.540
 blood actually helps reduce the 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.210
 sugar levels a person with

 of avocados to keep good 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.310
 glucose and energy levels one of 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.590
 these monounsaturated fats is the acid 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.920
 oleic which can reduce the level 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.660
 cholesterol in the body in addition to 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.420
 this compound have been attributed to him 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.880
 properties to reduce the risk of 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.080
 develop certain types of cancer by 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.670
 example breast cancer in women 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.300
 benefits of potassium lutein and

 antioxidants in the avocado 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.190
 lutein is a phytonutrient and a 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.010
 natural antioxidant consume lutein 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.910
 reduces the risk of presenting 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.790
 macular degeneration with 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.160
 aging that is protects health 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.620
 of the eyes since lutein is a 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.980
 composed of the macula which is the 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.620
 central area of ​​the retina 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.930
 the good amount of potassium present in 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.730
 avocados also reduces the risk 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.310
 to develop diseases 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.730
 cardiovascular and heart 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.720
 high blood pressure and heart attacks 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.510
 especially when the diet is 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.460
 reduces sodium intake one of the 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.220
 Popular fruits for their high content 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.200
 of potassium are bananas and it's 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.660
 surprising to know that an avocado 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.290
 contains three times more potassium than a 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.210
 banana similarly the avocado is 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.550
 one of the fruits that more vitamins 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.230
 contain this vitamin has the 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.170
 quality of neutralizing radicals 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.260
 free which harm the 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.660
 body cells oxidizing the 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.910
 vitamin is then an excellent 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.370
 antioxidant that has the quality of 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.660
 reduce the effects of aging and 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.010
 up to the risk of developing cancer 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.220
 Avocado or avocado contraindications 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.430
 there are very few negative effects due 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.530
 to the uses avocado uses among these 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.230
 you find an interaction with a 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.810
 anticoagulant medication called 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.080
 warfarin which reduces its effectiveness 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.690
 with avocado consumption the use of a 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.330
 certain avocado oil combined with 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.070
 Vitamin b12 cream can result in 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.280
 itching in the treatment of

 psoriasis should not be fed to 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.320
 animals with avocado since one of 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.570
 its compounds the toxin an acid 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.440
 harmless to humans can 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.330
 provoke intoxication in animals 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.300
 good friends, you liked the
