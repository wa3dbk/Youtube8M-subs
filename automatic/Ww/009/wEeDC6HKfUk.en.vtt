00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
pinned in the right position wouldn't

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.060 
pinned in the right position wouldn't
matter<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.110> went<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.619> left<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.040> just

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
matter if you went right or left I just

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.289 
matter if you went right or left I just
found<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.490> easier<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.060> right

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
found it a little easier to do right

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.990 
found it a little easier to do right
there<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> actually<00:01:31.560> took<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.159> bit<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
there and then I actually took a bit of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.819 
there and then I actually took a bit of
an<00:01:33.240> index<00:01:33.630> card<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> other<00:01:34.500> half

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
an index card so this is the other half

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.719 
an index card so this is the other half
of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.040> index<00:01:35.310> card<00:01:35.610> folded<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.770> twice<00:01:37.770> three

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
of the index card folded it twice three

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.760 
of the index card folded it twice three
times<00:01:38.759> into<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> little<00:01:39.840> bit<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
times into a little bit like this and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.270 
times into a little bit like this and
you<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.790> see<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.899> finished<00:01:43.350> product<00:01:43.740> here<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you can see the finished product here I

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.639 
you can see the finished product here I
took<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.369> pinned<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:48.409> right<00:01:49.409> trigger

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
took that and pinned the right trigger

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.670 
took that and pinned the right trigger
