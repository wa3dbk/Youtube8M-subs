again here we go the bones of course you

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.819 
again here we go the bones of course you
would<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.489> power<00:00:41.969> band<00:00:42.239> itself<00:00:42.829> this

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
would use at the power band itself this

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.459 
would use at the power band itself this
is<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> honest<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
is the honest it's like it's like a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.600 
is the honest it's like it's like a
chocolate<00:00:47.480> pretty<00:00:48.480> light<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:50.010> spreading<00:00:50.460> ice

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
chocolate pretty light and spreading ice

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.389 
chocolate pretty light and spreading ice
I<00:00:52.789> USB<00:00:53.789> month<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.629> my<00:00:54.780> cross<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.350> speeds<00:00:55.680> data

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
I USB month to my cross the speeds data

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.529 
I USB month to my cross the speeds data
cable<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.980> ok<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.239> used<00:01:00.390> for

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
cable is ok it is it can be used for

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.920 
cable is ok it is it can be used for
charging<00:01:01.430> it's<00:01:02.430> pretty<00:01:02.760> short<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.420> are

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
charging it's pretty short I think are

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.609 
charging it's pretty short I think are
you<00:01:04.110> owning<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:05.129> should<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.590> buy<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you owning you should you have to buy a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.320 
you owning you should you have to buy a
third<00:01:07.979> party<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.909> was<00:01:09.090> done<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:10.430> code<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.880> is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
third party it was done a code that is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
third party it was done a code that is
pretty<00:01:12.659> sure<00:01:13.430> you<00:01:14.430> also<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:17.659> chain<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.869> that's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
pretty sure you also the chain so that's

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.429 
pretty sure you also the chain so that's
all<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.850> most<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:26.750> 2006<00:01:27.750> my<00:01:28.049> phne

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
it's pretty good one too many consider

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.800 
it's pretty good one too many consider
to<00:01:35.150> buy<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> bomb<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.750> also<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:37.920> pretty

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
to buy a bomb and also the it's pretty

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.819 
to buy a bomb and also the it's pretty
easy<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.049> hold<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:40.799> hand<00:01:41.009> off<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:42.829> while

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you are going to a picnic or something

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.569 
you are going to a picnic or something
it's<00:01:46.680> pretty<00:01:47.009> useful<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:49.350> will<00:01:49.829> test<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:52.579> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
it's pretty useful I will test this the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.350 
it's pretty useful I will test this the
coming<00:01:53.909> days<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.759> used<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
coming days and and it's used like this

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.109 
coming days and and it's used like this
so<00:01:59.509> it's<00:02:00.509> pretty<00:02:00.930> nice<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.409> think<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:02.009> will<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
so it's pretty nice I think it will be a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.580 
so it's pretty nice I think it will be a
great<00:02:04.520> companion<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:05.969> those<00:02:06.180> who<00:02:06.329> travel

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.510 

until<00:02:10.760> it<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.270> you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
until it can be you

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.730 
until it can be you
each<00:02:13.510> other<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.080> think<00:02:14.140> it's<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.530> battery

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
each other so I think it's the battery

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.330 
each other so I think it's the battery
is<00:02:15.280> rechargeable<00:02:16.120> on<00:02:16.480> my<00:02:16.630> needs<00:02:17.130> 2006<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.250> I

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
is rechargeable on my needs 2006 and I

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.430 
is rechargeable on my needs 2006 and I
made<00:02:18.520> that<00:02:18.760> whether<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.420> kids<00:02:19.930> at<00:02:20.170> was<00:02:20.320> the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
made that whether the kids at was the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.880 
made that whether the kids at was the
killer<00:02:20.770> polling<00:02:21.190> because<00:02:21.960> so<00:02:22.960> you<00:02:23.110> most<00:02:23.770> of

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
killer polling because so you most of

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.680 
killer polling because so you most of
the<00:02:23.950> phone<00:02:24.130> ask<00:02:24.390> 2000mah<00:02:26.520> 2503<00:02:27.520> phones<00:02:27.820> so<00:02:28.570> if

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
the phone ask 2000mah 2503 phones so if

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.870 
the phone ask 2000mah 2503 phones so if
you<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:28.990> any<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.320> phone<00:02:29.590> thousand<00:02:30.580> sauter
