hello<00:00:01.740> guys<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.520> Nathan<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.240> in<00:00:03.360> this

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
hello guys this is Nathan and in this

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.050 
hello guys this is Nathan and in this
video<00:00:03.870> I'm<00:00:04.259> gonna<00:00:04.529> be<00:00:04.620> showing<00:00:04.980> you<00:00:05.400> how<00:00:05.730> to

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
video I'm gonna be showing you how to

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.040 
video I'm gonna be showing you how to
find<00:00:06.420> an<00:00:06.839> easier<00:00:07.350> way<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.589> do<00:00:07.980> LCM<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.090> if

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
find an easier way to do LCM and if

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.290 
find an easier way to do LCM and if
you're<00:00:10.260> wondering<00:00:10.679> what<00:00:10.830> LCM<00:00:11.429> means<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:12.030> at

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
you're wondering what LCM means it's at

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.919 
you're wondering what LCM means it's at
least<00:00:12.509> common<00:00:13.349> multiple<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.660> video

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
least common multiple and in this video

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.240 
least common multiple and in this video
i'm<00:00:16.379> gonna<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.770> using<00:00:16.830> using<00:00:17.580> 12<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.330> 18<00:00:19.250> first

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
i'm gonna be using using 12 and 18 first

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.210 
i'm gonna be using using 12 and 18 first
step<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.880> make<00:00:21.060> an<00:00:21.300> upside-down<00:00:22.220> division

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
step is to make an upside-down division

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.509 
step is to make an upside-down division
sign<00:00:23.900> put<00:00:24.900> 12<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.310> 18<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.920> then<00:00:28.920> think<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
sign put 12 and 18 in it then think of a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.049 
sign put 12 and 18 in it then think of a
number<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.570> go<00:00:30.779> into<00:00:31.050> both<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.439> them

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
number that can go into both of them

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.240 
number that can go into both of them
right<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:33.120> I'll<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:33.780> use<00:00:34.200> 6<00:00:35.809> 6<00:00:36.809> 12<00:00:37.649> divided

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
right now I'll just use 6 6 12 divided

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.650 
right now I'll just use 6 6 12 divided
by<00:00:38.280> 6<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.969> 2<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.750> 18<00:00:40.469> divided<00:00:40.800> by<00:00:40.950> 6<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.640> 3<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
by 6 is 2 and 18 divided by 6 is 3 and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.779 
by 6 is 2 and 18 divided by 6 is 3 and
these<00:00:43.500> 3<00:00:44.190> these<00:00:44.550> numbers<00:00:45.059> can't<00:00:45.450> go<00:00:46.789> these

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
these 3 these numbers can't go these

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.069 
these 3 these numbers can't go these
numbers<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.570> go<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.530> 6<00:00:50.430> or<00:00:50.789> any<00:00:51.120> number<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.870> go

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
numbers can go in 6 or any number can go

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.850 
numbers can go in 6 or any number can go
into<00:00:52.199> 2<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.800> 3<00:00:53.070> anymore<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.469> then

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
into 2 and 3 anymore so that's it then

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.510 
into 2 and 3 anymore so that's it then
you<00:00:55.980> multiply<00:00:56.160> 6<00:00:56.850> times<00:00:56.940> 2<00:00:57.449> which<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> 12<00:00:58.520> 12

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you multiply 6 times 2 which is 12 12

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.070 
you multiply 6 times 2 which is 12 12
times<00:00:59.879> 3<00:01:00.270> which<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.750> 36<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.149> 36<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.809> least

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
times 3 which is 36 and 36 is the least

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.070 
times 3 which is 36 and 36 is the least
common<00:01:04.680> multiple<00:01:05.280> that's<00:01:06.240> how<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.570> find<00:01:06.900> out

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
common multiple that's how you find out

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.830 
common multiple that's how you find out
a<00:01:07.439> shortcut<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> least<00:01:08.939> common<00:01:09.330> multiple

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
a shortcut for the least common multiple

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:22.789 
a shortcut for the least common multiple
I'll<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.830> another<00:01:11.070> number<00:01:14.659> 15<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:19.670> 20<00:01:21.799> ok

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
I'll do another number 15 and 20 ok

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.280 
I'll do another number 15 and 20 ok
again<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.119> another<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:25.020> into

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
again think of another I can go into

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.690 
again think of another I can go into
there<00:01:25.520> 5<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.970> 15<00:01:27.960> divided<00:01:28.380> by<00:01:28.409> 5<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.979> 3<00:01:29.009> 20

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
there 5 can 15 divided by 5 is 3 20

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.490 
there 5 can 15 divided by 5 is 3 20
divided<00:01:30.150> by<00:01:30.180> 5<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.780> 4<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:32.900> and<00:01:33.900> another<00:01:34.259> number

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
divided by 5 is 4 and and another number

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.120 
divided by 5 is 4 and and another number
can<00:01:34.950> go<00:01:35.130> into<00:01:35.369> 3<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> yeah<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.950> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
can go into 3 so yeah so you have to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.090 
can go into 3 so yeah so you have to
stop<00:01:38.490> there<00:01:38.850> 5<00:01:39.630> times<00:01:39.930> 3<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.290> 15<00:01:40.619> 15<00:01:41.549> times<00:01:42.240> 4<00:01:42.750> is

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
stop there 5 times 3 is 15 15 times 4 is

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.850 
stop there 5 times 3 is 15 15 times 4 is
60<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.759> I'll<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.659> check<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.380> case<00:01:46.649> for

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
60 and I'll just check just in case for

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:56.330 
60 and I'll just check just in case for
15<00:01:47.280> times<00:01:47.549> 4<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:50.119> 0<00:01:51.140> yes<00:01:52.140> 60<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.840> LCM<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.560> 15

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
15 times 4 is 0 yes 60 so the LCM for 15

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.190 
15 times 4 is 0 yes 60 so the LCM for 15
and<00:01:56.549> 20<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.509> 60<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:59.460> hope<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.180> video<00:02:00.420> helped

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and 20 is 60 I hope this video helped

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.160 
and 20 is 60 I hope this video helped
