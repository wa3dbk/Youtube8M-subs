let's<00:01:58.829> say<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.520> array<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.450> string

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
let's say I have this array of string

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.679 
let's say I have this array of string
items<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.409> wish<00:02:01.979> my<00:02:02.159> touchless<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.820> display<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
items I wish my touchless to display and

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.530 
items I wish my touchless to display and
the<00:02:04.560> only<00:02:04.710> thing<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.159> really<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.240> is

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the only thing I really have to do is

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.589 
the only thing I really have to do is
after<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:08.220> initialized<00:02:08.640> component<00:02:09.090> call<00:02:09.330> in

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
after the initialized component call in

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.430 
after the initialized component call in
my<00:02:09.959> form<00:02:10.289> I'm<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.489> assign

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
my form I'm going to assign

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.870 
my form I'm going to assign
the<00:02:12.920> touchless<00:02:13.370> datasource<00:02:14.240> property<00:02:14.900> these

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
the touchless datasource property these

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.750 
the touchless datasource property these
array<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:17.180> string<00:02:17.810> items<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:19.340> that's<00:02:19.550> pretty

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
array of string items so that's pretty

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.850 
array of string items so that's pretty
much<00:02:19.850> it<00:02:19.970> I'm<00:02:20.570> going<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.930> launch<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.710> into

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
much it I'm going to launch it into

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
emulator and let's start the debug

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.020 
emulator and let's start the debug
session<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.590> as<00:02:30.740> soon<00:02:30.890> as<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.190> forms<00:02:31.550> loaded

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030

into<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.270> emulator<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.530> touch<00:02:33.740> list<00:02:33.980> is

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
into the emulator the touch list is

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.020 
into the emulator the touch list is
displayed<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.880> here<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:35.900> have<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.500> menu

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
displayed and here we have the menu

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.080 
displayed and here we have the menu
consisting<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.810> string<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.820> string

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
consisting of the string of the string

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.560 
consisting of the string of the string
items<00:02:41.450> which<00:02:41.930> are<00:02:42.110> we<00:02:42.380> supplied<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.570> pretty

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
items which are we supplied to it pretty

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.750 
items which are we supplied to it pretty
cool<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.610> pretty<00:02:46.610> simple<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.780> far<00:02:48.760> notice

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
cool and pretty simple so far notice

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.480 
cool and pretty simple so far notice
that<00:02:49.970> each<00:02:50.330> item<00:02:50.960> is<00:02:51.230> high<00:02:51.830> enough<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.460> that

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
that each item is high enough so that

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.000 
that each item is high enough so that
the<00:02:52.730> user<00:02:52.760> can<00:02:53.000> select<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.720> comfortably<00:02:54.470> using

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
the user can select it comfortably using

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.090 
the user can select it comfortably using
his<00:02:55.100> finger<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.950> let's<00:02:57.950> now<00:02:58.160> explore<00:02:58.760> the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
his finger and let's now explore the

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.560 
his finger and let's now explore the
possibilities<00:03:01.100> of<00:03:01.130> color<00:03:01.550> customization<00:03:01.820> as

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
possibilities of color customization as

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.840 
possibilities of color customization as
right<00:03:03.320> now<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:04.040> does<00:03:04.340> not<00:03:04.520> look<00:03:04.790> that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
right now it does not look that

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.960 
right now it does not look that
appealing<00:03:05.500> there<00:03:06.500> are<00:03:06.650> many<00:03:07.070> colors<00:03:07.400> involved

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
appealing there are many colors involved

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.600 
appealing there are many colors involved
and<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:09.110> creates<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:10.460> funny<00:03:11.120> mixture<00:03:11.660> so

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
and it it creates a funny mixture so

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.120 
and it it creates a funny mixture so
let's<00:03:13.610> adjust<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.350> notice<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.530> touchless

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
let's adjust that notice that touchless

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.420 
let's adjust that notice that touchless
uses<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.760> separator<00:03:17.390> lines<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:18.470> separate<00:03:19.280> the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
uses the separator lines to separate the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.000 
uses the separator lines to separate the
individual<00:03:19.910> items<00:03:20.330> also<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.260> cursor<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.800> made

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
individual items also the cursor is made

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.830 
individual items also the cursor is made
of<00:03:22.130> gradient<00:03:22.580> fill<00:03:22.790> it's<00:03:23.030> actually<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.540> double

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
of gradient fill it's actually a double

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.140 
of gradient fill it's actually a double
gradient<00:03:24.230> fill<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.920> first<00:03:25.160> gradient<00:03:25.700> starts

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
gradient fill the first gradient starts

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.900 
gradient fill the first gradient starts
at<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.540> top<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.959> cursor<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.610> ends<00:03:28.610> in<00:03:28.700> the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
at the top of the cursor and ends in the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.650 
at the top of the cursor and ends in the
center<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.930> cursor<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.500> then<00:03:31.510> this<00:03:32.510> is

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
center of the cursor and then this is

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.180 
center of the cursor and then this is
followed<00:03:32.959> by<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.200> second<00:03:33.590> row<00:03:33.709> agent<00:03:34.010> Phil

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
followed by the second row agent Phil

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.430 
followed by the second row agent Phil
which<00:03:34.610> starts<00:03:34.940> in<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.120> center<00:03:35.270> and<00:03:35.540> ends<00:03:36.350> in

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
which starts in the center and ends in

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.550 
which starts in the center and ends in
at<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:37.070> bottom<00:03:37.520> of<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.760> cursor<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:39.350> I'm<00:03:39.440> going

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
at the bottom of the cursor so I'm going

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.710 
at the bottom of the cursor so I'm going
to<00:03:39.590> click<00:03:39.739> OK<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.370> stop<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.269> debug<00:03:41.540> session

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
to click OK to stop the debug session

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.470 
to click OK to stop the debug session
for<00:03:42.350> now<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.739> let's<00:03:42.880> explore<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.060> properties

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
for now and let's explore the properties

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.690 
for now and let's explore the properties
of<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.780> touch<00:03:44.959> list<00:03:45.200> again<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.459> first

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
of the touch list again so the first

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.930 
of the touch list again so the first
thing<00:03:46.820> I'm<00:03:47.209> going<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:47.930> do<00:03:48.110> is<00:03:48.730> we're<00:03:49.730> going<00:03:49.880> to

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
thing I'm going to do is we're going to

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.110 
thing I'm going to do is we're going to
use<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.120> background<00:03:50.660> image<00:03:50.840> for<00:03:51.769> for<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.880> touch

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
use a background image for for the touch

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.699 
use a background image for for the touch
list<00:03:53.390> we're<00:03:53.570> not<00:03:53.690> going<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.019> use<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.500> gradient

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
list we're not going to use the gradient

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.290 
list we're not going to use the gradient
fill<00:03:55.070> but<00:03:55.550> we're<00:03:55.700> going<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:55.880> use<00:03:56.150> the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
fill but we're going to use the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.390 
fill but we're going to use the
background<00:03:56.480> image<00:03:56.930> instead<00:03:57.170> I<00:03:57.530> have<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.070> couple

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
background image instead I have a couple

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.820 
background image instead I have a couple
of<00:03:58.489> images<00:03:58.610> prepared<00:03:59.420> here<00:03:59.780> so<00:04:00.230> let's<00:04:00.440> try

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
of images prepared here so let's try

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.810 
of images prepared here so let's try
this<00:04:00.890> one<00:04:01.250> background<00:04:01.760> image<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:04.459> image<00:04:04.489> has

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
this one background image the image has

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.780 
this one background image the image has
appeared<00:04:05.209> in<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:06.080> background<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:06.860> next

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
appeared in the background and the next

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.540 
appeared in the background and the next
thing<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.180> want<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.420> do<00:04:08.600> is<00:04:08.920> set<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:09.950> separator

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
thing I want to do is set the separator

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.570 
thing I want to do is set the separator
color<00:04:10.940> which<00:04:11.570> which<00:04:12.080> specifies<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:12.980> color<00:04:13.489> of

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
the separator lines i'm going to set

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.979 
the separator lines i'm going to set
that<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.070> dim<00:04:16.250> gray<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:17.269> gray<00:04:17.480> color<00:04:17.750> should

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
that to dim gray the gray color should

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.740 
that to dim gray the gray color should
match<00:04:18.890> much<00:04:19.370> better<00:04:19.669> with<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.209> the

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
match much better with the the

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.050 
match much better with the the
background<00:04:21.140> that<00:04:21.260> we<00:04:21.410> have<00:04:21.560> here<00:04:21.890> if<00:04:22.190> i<00:04:22.610> wish

not the separator colors to be displayed

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.200 
not the separator colors to be displayed
at<00:04:25.250> all<00:04:25.400> we<00:04:25.669> can<00:04:25.880> do

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
at all we can do

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.529 
at all we can do
sable<00:04:27.220> disable<00:04:28.220> them<00:04:28.370> using<00:04:28.880> this<00:04:29.030> property

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
sable disable them using this property

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.360 
sable disable them using this property
but<00:04:30.110> I'm<00:04:30.199> going<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.440> leave<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.800> enabled

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
but I'm going to leave that to enabled

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.330 
but I'm going to leave that to enabled
so<00:04:32.530> let's<00:04:33.530> try<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.800> now<00:04:35.740> so<00:04:36.740> when<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:36.979> project

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
so let's try it now so when the project

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.400 
so let's try it now so when the project
loads<00:04:37.550> into<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.030> emulator<00:04:38.539> we<00:04:39.229> can<00:04:39.410> see<00:04:39.620> that

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
loads into the emulator we can see that

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.499 
loads into the emulator we can see that
touches<00:04:42.410> like<00:04:42.620> now<00:04:42.919> looks<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.460> lot<00:04:44.300> better

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
touches like now looks a lot better

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.719 
touches like now looks a lot better
separator<00:04:45.349> lines<00:04:45.440> match<00:04:46.009> much<00:04:46.280> better<00:04:46.520> with

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
separator lines match much better with

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.909 
separator lines match much better with
the<00:04:46.880> background<00:04:47.419> color<00:04:47.660> with<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.680> background

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
the background color with a background

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.180 
the background color with a background
image<00:04:49.310> but<00:04:50.120> still<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.569> cursor<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.650> color<00:04:52.130> of

image but still the cursor the color of

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.710 
image but still the cursor the color of
the<00:04:52.400> cursor<00:04:52.759> does<00:04:52.910> not<00:04:53.060> really<00:04:53.270> match<00:04:53.479> with

the cursor does not really match with

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.870 
the cursor does not really match with
this<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.289> let's<00:04:54.800> change<00:04:55.069> the<00:04:55.340> colors<00:04:55.669> for<00:04:55.849> the

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
this so let's change the colors for the

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.390 
this so let's change the colors for the
cursor<00:04:56.389> to<00:04:56.599> i'm<00:04:56.930> going<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.199> click<00:04:57.590> OK<00:04:57.949> to<00:04:57.979> stop

the<00:04:58.520> debug<00:04:58.789> session<00:04:58.970> one<00:04:59.449> more<00:04:59.630> time<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.190> I'm

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
the debug session one more time and I'm

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.379 
the debug session one more time and I'm
going<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.400> explore<00:05:01.759> the<00:05:01.910> properties<00:05:02.360> for

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
going to explore the properties for

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.990 
going to explore the properties for
touch<00:05:02.690> list<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:04.220> carissa<00:05:04.520> gradient

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
touch list and the carissa gradient

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.930 
touch list and the carissa gradient
background<00:05:05.830> is<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:07.009> name<00:05:07.190> of<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:07.460> property

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
background is the name of the property

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.480 
background is the name of the property
which<00:05:08.630> specifies<00:05:09.199> the<00:05:09.229> colors<00:05:09.770> that<00:05:09.979> are<00:05:10.130> used

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
which specifies the colors that are used

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.200 
which specifies the colors that are used
for<00:05:11.120> touch<00:05:11.330> list<00:05:11.599> so<00:05:12.199> in<00:05:13.039> order<00:05:13.190> to<00:05:13.460> match<00:05:13.789> the

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
for touch list so in order to match the

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.360 
for touch list so in order to match the
color<00:05:14.449> scheme<00:05:14.690> that<00:05:15.080> we<00:05:15.440> are<00:05:15.590> creating<00:05:16.009> right

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
color scheme that we are creating right

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.420 
color scheme that we are creating right
now<00:05:16.580> I'm<00:05:16.820> going<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.449> choose<00:05:17.930> gray<00:05:18.919> kind<00:05:19.310> of

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
now I'm going to choose gray kind of

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.730 
now I'm going to choose gray kind of
colors<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:20.389> grain<00:05:20.630> kind<00:05:21.139> of<00:05:21.289> colors<00:05:21.560> will

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
colors the grain kind of colors will

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.490 
colors the grain kind of colors will
certainly<00:05:22.099> match<00:05:22.400> a<00:05:22.639> lot<00:05:23.000> better<00:05:23.240> with<00:05:24.229> the

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
certainly match a lot better with the

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.649 
certainly match a lot better with the
with<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.400> background<00:05:25.789> image<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.270> also<00:05:26.509> the

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
with the background image and also the

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.620 
with the background image and also the
separator<00:05:27.110> lines<00:05:27.229> that<00:05:27.949> we<00:05:28.069> chose<00:05:28.280> I'm<00:05:28.789> going

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
separator lines that we chose I'm going

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.960 
separator lines that we chose I'm going
to<00:05:29.750> use<00:05:30.229> this<00:05:30.669> custom<00:05:32.229> custom<00:05:33.229> color<00:05:33.620> codes<00:05:33.979> so

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
to use this custom custom color codes so

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.969 
to use this custom custom color codes so
these<00:05:35.240> are<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.449> colors<00:05:35.690> we're<00:05:36.530> going<00:05:36.740> to<00:05:36.800> use

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
these are the colors we're going to use

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.070 
these are the colors we're going to use
and<00:05:37.220> let's<00:05:38.060> try<00:05:38.270> it<00:05:38.330> out<00:05:38.479> and<00:05:40.630> as<00:05:41.630> soon<00:05:41.780> as<00:05:41.960> the

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
and let's try it out and as soon as the

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.800 
and let's try it out and as soon as the
forms<00:05:42.349> loaded<00:05:42.800> we<00:05:43.460> can<00:05:43.639> see<00:05:43.849> that<00:05:44.060> touchless

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
forms loaded we can see that touchless

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.260 
forms loaded we can see that touchless
displays<00:05:45.259> all<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.620> items<00:05:46.250> using<00:05:46.849> the<00:05:47.060> color

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
displays all the items using the color

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.270 
displays all the items using the color
codes<00:05:47.630> that<00:05:47.840> we<00:05:47.990> specified<00:05:48.229> for<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.860> cursor

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
codes that we specified for the cursor

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.219 
codes that we specified for the cursor
for<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.699> separator<00:05:50.150> lines<00:05:50.240> and<00:05:50.810> the

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
for the separator lines and the

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.550 
for the separator lines and the
background<00:05:51.409> image<00:05:51.889> is<00:05:52.190> also<00:05:52.580> in<00:05:52.729> place<00:05:53.560> so

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
background image is also in place so

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.170 
background image is also in place so
that's<00:05:54.770> pretty<00:05:55.009> much<00:05:55.099> it<00:05:55.340> for<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:55.699> first<00:05:55.909> part

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
that's pretty much it for the first part

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.320 
that's pretty much it for the first part
thank<00:05:56.630> you<00:05:56.719> very<00:05:56.750> much<00:05:56.930> for<00:05:57.110> watching
