00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.240
 At the end of this session the student will be 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.669
 able to explain the procedure 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.400
 correct to suspend the airplane with 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.650
 monkeys spare parts replacement 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.930
 the airplane can be lifted using 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.470
 individual suspension with the monkey in one 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.470
 landing gear 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.180
 which allows the replacement of wheels and 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.180
 brakes 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.949
 or total suspension through the 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.919
 suspension 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.710
 there are two main points of suspension 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.809
 on the underside of the wing and a 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.980
 suspension on the underside of the fuselage 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.350
 Rear the procedures for suspending 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.720
 damaged aircraft are described in the 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.329
 instruction manual for the extinction of 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.309
 fire and rescue in the ground the suspension 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.100
 complete of the airplane also called 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.050
 three- point suspension of the fuselage is 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.500
 required to perform 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.320
 maintenance such as replacement repair 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.089
 or operational inspection of the landing gear and 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.369
 its components 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.890
 can also be used for weighing the 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.439
 complete suspension of the airplane must 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.130
 carried out in accordance with Chapter 7 of 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.799
 the aircraft maintenance manual before 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.920
 complete suspension of the airplane to 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.329
 conditions that must be met must be 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.450
 all equipment is removed 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.060
 unnecessary below and around the plane 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.909
 the airplane must be suspended only in 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.659
 level floor and like nose pointing at the 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.659
 wind direction 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.810
 but preferably in a hangar with 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.899
 closed doors 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.210
 the two main landing gear and the 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.220
 nose landing gear must be in contact with 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.770
 the safety locks installed to 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.750
 to prevent inadvertent 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.110
 landing gear 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:59.659
 install the shims gss of 70 lbr 10 001 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.399
 on all wheels of the landing gear to 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.770
 prevent movement of the airplane to 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.970
 front or back before the monkeys 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.220
 the emergency brake is set 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.640
 parking bar must be released 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.500
 before the suspension is not allowed 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.340
 enter the airplane during the operation of 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.190
 suspension 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.250
 the airplane must be suspended until there is a 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.260
 minimum clearance between the ground and the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.090
 airplane to ensure sufficient height 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.849
 for pick-up of landing gear 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.730
 main note 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.349
 before suspending the airplane consult the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.470
 table mentioned in the 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.110
 maintenance nm to weight limits 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.140
 to make sure that the 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.980
 gravity is within the limits of 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.930
 the suspension 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.620
 the airplane is completely suspended by the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.470
 use of suspension points in the fuselage 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.049
 located behind panel 515 receive 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.160
 on the inside leading edge of the wing 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:00.680
 left and 615 cb panel on board 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.380
 right wing internal attack 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.310
 the point of suspension in the fuselage 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.170
 rear panel is located behind the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.510
 313 bl 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.940
 after installation of the suspension pins 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.680
 and monkeys the monkeys must be operated 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.290
 simultaneously to ensure that the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.359
 suspension is symmetrical and that the airplane 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.239
 stay flush all the time 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.790
 during suspension when the height 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.209
 desired is reached monkeys are 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.730
 be locked to prevent lowering 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.799
 inadvertent to lower the plane 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.790
 the area around to be released from 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.889
 obstacles 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.920
 the parking emergency brake 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:43.430
 should be released and monkeys should be 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.220
 unlocked all monkeys should then 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.620
 be downloaded slowly and symmetrically 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.460
 to ensure that the airplane maintains the 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.680
 level attitude 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.230
 as soon as the weight of the airplane is out 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.150
 the wheel chocks should 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.180
 be installed and the emergency brake 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.890
 in the parking lot must be activated 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.380
 landing gear suspension points 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.330
 nose and nose allow the 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.300
 individual replacement of wheels and 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.850
 brakes without limit of weight and suspension 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.130
 can be made even with empty tire in 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.890
 any leg of the landing gear 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.830
 the safety catch pins on the train 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.960
 The brake must be installed in the 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.510
 emergency parking should be 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.890
 released and the jack must be installed 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.410
 on the point of suspension 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.390
 corresponding leg of the 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.370
 landing gear 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.380
 then the monkey is raised until the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.980
 landing gear tires are spaced apart 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.700
 the soil after the 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.770
 maintenance 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.650
 the airplane must then be downloaded 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.350
 gently when the weight of the airplane 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.010
 outside the monkey jack should be 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.710
 removed, the wheels must be 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.430
 Emergency parking brake should 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.430
 be fired
