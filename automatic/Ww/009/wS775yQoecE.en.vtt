00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.049
 the special in the carbon is that it very much 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.710
 is easy and flexible to use and 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.029
 at the same time very hard and died 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.580
 carbon fiber is being used for good reason 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.890
 always for the construction of racing cars 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.420
 and spacecraft uses the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.849
 production process is pretty much 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.850
 complicated but convincing when 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.980
 carbon has the advantages of carbon fiber 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.980
 a unique relationship of strength 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.350
 in short, it's easier 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.820
 and more rigid than any standard material that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.039
 You would not expect it if you were 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.140
 the base material looks at the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.440
 Carbon fiber threads look like one 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.270
 tissue that they are kind to the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.460
 sensible use of composites 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.309
 reduces the total weight of the new one 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.479
 bmw i8 significantly , thus improving the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.950
 mileage and fuel efficiency 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.570
 Usually you think the plug-in cars 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.830
 be heavier than conventional 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.590
 powered vehicles 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.000
 because the drive is the battery and its 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.720
 Housing increase the weight 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.720
 the bmw i8 weighs only 1 1490 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.030
 so far has carbon in the normal 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.880
 automotive construction only a subordinate 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.010
 played because of the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.360
 production process is so complicated 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.100
 bmw has these challenges 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.229
 mastered and is now the first 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.850
 automobile manufacturer worldwide the 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.119
 carbon fiber in series production 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.030
 use and the recycling rate at the end 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.600
 The product life cycle is almost 100 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.600
 percent
