and over again my first inclination is

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.720 
and over again my first inclination is
to<00:02:32.700> say<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.000> guy<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:34.260> good<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:35.489> guy<00:02:35.670> is

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
to say that guy is good that guy is

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.940 
to say that guy is good that guy is
better<00:02:36.090> than<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.690> almost<00:02:37.230> never<00:02:37.530> go<00:02:37.889> to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
better than you I almost never go to

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.250 
better than you I almost never go to
that<00:02:38.430> guy<00:02:38.609> as<00:02:38.639> a<00:02:38.819> cheater<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.959> guy<00:02:40.109> was

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
that guy as a cheater this guy was

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.000 
that guy as a cheater this guy was
playing<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.620> sniper<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.930> was<00:02:43.799> getting

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
playing a sniper and I was getting

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.780 
playing a sniper and I was getting
killed<00:02:44.250> by<00:02:44.400> him<00:02:44.690> every<00:02:45.690> time<00:02:45.870> he<00:02:45.930> saw<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.590> and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
killed by him every time he saw it and

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.819 
killed by him every time he saw it and
I've<00:02:47.790> had<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.150> happen<00:02:48.209> before<00:02:48.510> but<00:02:49.290> never<00:02:49.530> to

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
I've had that happen before but never to

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.039 
I've had that happen before but never to
this<00:02:49.950> level<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.549> like<00:02:51.329> literally<00:02:51.660> he<00:02:51.930> would

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
this level I like literally he would

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.720 
this level I like literally he would
joke<00:02:52.260> around<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.709> corner<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.250> would<00:02:53.400> be<00:02:53.489> dead

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
joke around a corner and I would be dead

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.809 
joke around a corner and I would be dead
like<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.660> boom<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:56.310> would<00:02:56.519> pop<00:02:56.790> up

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
like that just boom and I would pop up

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.629 
like that just boom and I would pop up

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
there's these jump pads you can jump

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.000 
there's these jump pads you can jump
high<00:02:59.910> in<00:02:59.970> here<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.450> pop<00:03:00.690> up<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.440> jump<00:03:01.769> pad

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
high in here and pop up on a jump pad

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.660 
high in here and pop up on a jump pad
and<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.790> boom<00:03:02.910> I'd<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.269> dead<00:03:03.650> or<00:03:04.650> i'd<00:03:04.920> be<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:05.370> a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and just boom I'd be dead or i'd be in a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.610 
and just boom I'd be dead or i'd be in a
really<00:03:06.000> weird<00:03:06.030> place<00:03:06.269> halfway<00:03:06.840> across<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
really weird place halfway across the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.970 
really weird place halfway across the
arena<00:03:07.829> and<00:03:08.190> boo<00:03:08.609> might<00:03:08.910> be<00:03:09.030> dead<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.530> then<00:03:10.530> it

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
arena and boo might be dead and then it

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.620 
arena and boo might be dead and then it
just<00:03:11.180> occurred<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.209> me<00:03:12.389> that<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:13.049> guy<00:03:13.290> was

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
just occurred to me that this guy was

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.600 
just occurred to me that this guy was
preternaturally<00:03:15.630> good

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
preternaturally good

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.140 
preternaturally good
and<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:18.140> watched<00:03:18.830> his<00:03:19.070> score<00:03:19.520> you<00:03:19.790> get<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.030> see

and I watched his score you get to see

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.270 
and I watched his score you get to see
the<00:03:20.180> enemies<00:03:20.600> kill<00:03:21.350> count<00:03:21.590> every<00:03:21.950> time<00:03:22.130> they

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
the enemies kill count every time they

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.060 
the enemies kill count every time they
kill<00:03:22.520> you<00:03:22.670> he<00:03:23.540> killed<00:03:23.810> me<00:03:23.990> once<00:03:24.290> he<00:03:24.830> had<00:03:25.040> a

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
kill you he killed me once he had a

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.440 
kill you he killed me once he had a
score<00:03:25.520> of<00:03:25.640> 12<00:03:26.440> about<00:03:27.440> I<00:03:28.130> don't<00:03:28.640> know<00:03:28.730> 15<00:03:29.210> 20

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450

score of 12 about I don't know 15 20
seconds<00:03:29.990> later<00:03:30.200> I<00:03:30.500> had<00:03:30.890> spawned<00:03:31.280> I'd<00:03:31.610> come

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
seconds later I had spawned I'd come

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.460 
seconds later I had spawned I'd come
back<00:03:32.060> out<00:03:32.270> into<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.510> arena<00:03:32.720> boom<00:03:33.050> I<00:03:33.260> died

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
back out into the arena boom I died

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.800 
back out into the arena boom I died
again<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:33.950> he<00:03:34.310> was<00:03:34.430> up<00:03:34.580> to<00:03:34.610> 17<00:03:35.150> kills<00:03:35.450> have<00:03:35.720> you

period<00:03:38.390> of<00:03:38.420> time<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:40.340> it<00:03:41.030> just<00:03:41.270> was<00:03:41.540> clear

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
period of time and I it just was clear

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.660 
period of time and I it just was clear
that<00:03:41.990> he<00:03:42.230> was<00:03:42.380> using<00:03:42.680> some<00:03:42.950> sort<00:03:43.100> of<00:03:43.220> aim<00:03:43.400> hack

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
that he was using some sort of aim hack

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.560 
that he was using some sort of aim hack
and<00:03:43.940> I<00:03:44.870> just<00:03:45.320> quit<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.860> server<00:03:46.700> right<00:03:47.240> right

and I just quit the server right right

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.910 
and I just quit the server right right
like<00:03:47.780> that<00:03:48.020> and<00:03:49.090> it's<00:03:50.090> really<00:03:50.450> easy<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:51.410> get

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
like that and it's really easy to get
