camping is the hardest job I think is

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.510

really<00:01:07.470> heavy<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.220> hit<00:01:08.340> each

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
really heavy and you have to hit each

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.090 
really heavy and you have to hit each
bag<00:01:08.790> probably<00:01:09.830> 15<00:01:10.830> times<00:01:11.960> but<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.320> important

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.770 

well<00:01:17.100> come<00:01:17.220> out<00:01:17.280> tomorrow<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.850> probably<00:01:18.509> pick

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100
