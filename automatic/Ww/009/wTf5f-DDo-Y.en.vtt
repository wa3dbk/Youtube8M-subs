00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.190
 before starting check that the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.710
 surface to cover is in good 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.589
 been and with a homogeneous finish without 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.929
 fissures to make the 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.419
 installation of we will limit a rectangle 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.970
 with four lines marking the perimeter 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.859
 of the bottom of the pool and straight lines 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.919
 also in the upper limits of the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.809
 side walls as material of 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.090
 grip you have to prepare a mass of 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.630
 cement quality tail mixing the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.660
 until you get a creamy consistency 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.490
 to extend the glue cement 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.560
 we will use a notched trowel of 3 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.210
 millimeters 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.520
 it is important to move the trowel 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.640
 horizontally since this way we will favor 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.160
 the subject of the mosaic using a 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.680
 horizontal line as a guide we begin the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.550
 placement on top 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.430
 moving towards one of the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.240
 lateral 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.240
 two 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.469
 two 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.729
 once the walls are covered 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:14.130
 we started to place by one side 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.229
 long of the ground leaving for the end the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.229
 placement of the half-round or curve 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.330
 the material has great flexibility as well 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.159
 that we can place it without difficulty 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.950
 about the variations that the 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.619
 surface design 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.840
 for the auctions it is necessary to use 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.010
 a special pincer for cutting the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.110
 pieces 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.240
 if the pool and carry some drawing or 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.460
 decoration will be placed in the place 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.470
 adequate by placing the plates in the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.980
 exact order that indicates the sketch of 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.980
 mounting 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.810
 after the placement if we have used 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.720
 paper a solution is prepared with 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.870
 approximately 15 liters of water and 200 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.720
 grams of caustic soda with a brush 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.810
 unem we do all the paper in a way that 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.240
 get soaked next we proceed to 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.810
 remove it with the help of a hose and a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.810
 brush 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.920
 subsequently we prepare a mixture of 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.930
 cement tail something more liquid than 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 initial and we extend it on the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.290
 coating glass with a trowel 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.200
 rubber filling the joints 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.000
 without letting it dry we pass the trowel 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.790
 of rubber to remove the excess of 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.040
 cement 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.170
 finally it is cleaned with a 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.900
 dry scourer all cement powder 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.640
 accumulated on the surface discovering 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.060
 the authentic brightness and color of 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.950
 Vitreous lining is convenient 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.340
 wait a reasonable time before 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.260
 fill the pool when the time is 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.920
 important to prevent the water jet 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.840
 hit hard the coating these 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.970
 instructions are valid for 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.989
 placement of the glass covering in 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.989
 any surface
