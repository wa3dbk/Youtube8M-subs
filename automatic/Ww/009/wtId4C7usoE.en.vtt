00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hi everybody this is Mike here you know

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.500 
hi everybody this is Mike here you know
the<00:00:02.490> other<00:00:02.580> day<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:02.790> was<00:00:02.970> browsing<00:00:03.240> the

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
the other day I was browsing the

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.999 
the other day I was browsing the
instructables<00:00:03.990> website<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.799> came<00:00:04.980> across

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
instructables website and I came across

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.000 
instructables website and I came across
a<00:00:05.279> fun<00:00:05.580> little<00:00:05.730> project<00:00:06.029> titled<00:00:06.720> led<00:00:07.620> tilt

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
a fun little project titled led tilt

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.860 
a fun little project titled led tilt
lightbox<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:08.880> even<00:00:09.090> blogged<00:00:09.300> about<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.660> at

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
lightbox and I even blogged about it at

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.749 
lightbox and I even blogged about it at
the<00:00:09.960> time<00:00:10.139> but<00:00:10.920> in<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.160> project<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
the time but in that project the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.660 
the time but in that project the
gentlemen<00:00:12.120> use<00:00:12.330> some<00:00:12.840> LEDs<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.769> battery<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
gentlemen use some LEDs a battery and a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.369 
gentlemen use some LEDs a battery and a
little<00:00:14.880> tilt<00:00:15.120> switch<00:00:15.420> mounted<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.170> all

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
little tilt switch mounted that all

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.920 
little tilt switch mounted that all
inside<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.100> wooden<00:00:17.400> box<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:18.029> had<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> kind<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.840> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
inside a wooden box that had a kind of a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.470 
inside a wooden box that had a kind of a
plastic<00:00:19.470> diffusing<00:00:20.039> lid<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.029> effect<00:00:21.330> was

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
plastic diffusing lid and the effect was

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.060 
plastic diffusing lid and the effect was
that<00:00:21.630> if<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.810> picked<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.140> box<00:00:22.350> up<00:00:22.619> or<00:00:22.830> turned

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that if you picked the box up or turned

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.429 
that if you picked the box up or turned
it<00:00:23.189> over<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.400> its<00:00:23.519> side<00:00:23.779> you<00:00:24.779> would<00:00:24.869> activate

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
it over on its side you would activate

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.200 
it over on its side you would activate
that<00:00:25.619> tilt<00:00:25.920> switch<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.849> would<00:00:26.970> create

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
that tilt switch and it would create

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.839 
that tilt switch and it would create
some<00:00:28.140> LED<00:00:28.560> lighting<00:00:28.980> effects<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.550> kind<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.789> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
some LED lighting effects so kind of a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.999 
some LED lighting effects so kind of a
fun<00:00:30.000> little<00:00:30.119> project<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.019> itself<00:00:31.140> but

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
fun little project in and of itself but

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.680 
fun little project in and of itself but
then<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.189> got<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.489> thinking<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:33.329> know<00:00:33.420> what<00:00:33.600> if

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
then I got to thinking you know what if

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.150 
then I got to thinking you know what if
we<00:00:33.809> added<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.290> bit<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.500> logic<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
we added a little bit of logic to the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.560 
we added a little bit of logic to the
circuitry<00:00:35.610> maybe<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.000> could<00:00:36.149> create<00:00:36.390> some

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
circuitry maybe we could create some

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.740 
circuitry maybe we could create some
cool<00:00:36.780> effects<00:00:37.170> I've<00:00:38.129> got<00:00:38.370> some<00:00:38.640> old<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.270> tiny

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
cool effects I've got some old a tiny

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.869 
cool effects I've got some old a tiny
45s<00:00:40.649> left<00:00:40.860> over<00:00:41.040> from<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.280> previous<00:00:41.309> project

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
45s left over from a previous project

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.150 
45s left over from a previous project
and<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.170> small<00:00:43.440> programmable<00:00:44.040> logic

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and it's just a small programmable logic

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.799 
and it's just a small programmable logic
controller<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.910> has<00:00:45.059> six<00:00:45.390> general-purpose

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
controller it has six general-purpose

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.380 
controller it has six general-purpose
i/o<00:00:46.260> pins<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.980> supports<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.760> channel<00:00:48.149> pulse

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
i/o pins and supports to channel pulse

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360 
i/o pins and supports to channel pulse
width<00:00:48.600> modulation<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.500> think<00:00:50.190> it'll<00:00:50.309> be

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
width modulation I think it'll be

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.910 
width modulation I think it'll be
perfect<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> project<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.110> but

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
perfect for for a project like this but

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.290 
perfect for for a project like this but
in<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> meantime<00:00:53.340> I've<00:00:53.730> thrown<00:00:53.969> together<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
in the meantime I've thrown together a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.060 
in the meantime I've thrown together a
quick<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:54.750> prototype<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> circuit

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
quick little prototype of the circuit

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.510 
quick little prototype of the circuit
and<00:00:56.250> software<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.879> my<00:00:57.030> cue<00:00:57.300> block<00:00:57.539> CB<00:00:58.109> 280

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
and software on my cue block CB 280

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
and software on my cue block CB 280
using<00:00:59.520> their<00:00:59.640> study<00:00:59.910> board<00:01:00.180> let<00:01:01.050> me<00:01:01.199> go<00:01:01.260> ahead

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
using their study board let me go ahead

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.369 
using their study board let me go ahead
and<00:01:01.440> turn<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:02.000> I've<00:01:03.000> got<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.570> total<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.199> five

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and turn it on I've got a total of five

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.200 
and turn it on I've got a total of five
LEDs<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> middle<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.729> stays<00:01:05.970> lit

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
LEDs one in the middle just stays lit

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.359 
LEDs one in the middle just stays lit
all<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.630> time<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.590> other<00:01:07.710> four<00:01:08.070> are

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
all the time the other four are

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.740 
all the time the other four are
controlled<00:01:08.820> using<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.240> pulse<00:01:09.479> width

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
controlled using the pulse width

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.260 
controlled using the pulse width
modulation<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.909> soft

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
modulation so that you kind of that soft

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.499 
modulation so that you kind of that soft
on<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.229> then<00:01:13.350> off<00:01:13.380> transition<00:01:14.369> I've<00:01:15.299> also

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
on and then off transition I've also

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.910 
on and then off transition I've also
added<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.140> bit<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.320> analog<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> digital

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
added a little bit of analog to digital

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
added a little bit of analog to digital
conversion<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.030> play<00:01:18.180> around<00:01:18.299> with

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
conversion so we can play around with

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
conversion so we can play around with
the<00:01:18.750> variables<00:01:19.200> inside<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> program<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.490> can

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the variables inside the program we can

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.520 
the variables inside the program we can
make<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.850> pulse<00:01:21.689> width<00:01:21.869> modulation<00:01:22.350> rate

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
make that pulse width modulation rate

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
make that pulse width modulation rate
and<00:01:22.950> go<00:01:23.040> really<00:01:23.220> fast<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.570> make<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> go

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
and go really fast we can make it go

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.920 
and go really fast we can make it go
really<00:01:25.110> slow<00:01:26.150> we<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.299> add<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> little<00:01:27.659> bit<00:01:27.869> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
really slow we can add a little bit of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.090 
really slow we can add a little bit of
delay<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.890> our<00:01:29.220> loops<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.729> create<00:01:30.090> kind<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
delay to our loops so create kind of a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.179 
delay to our loops so create kind of a
digital<00:01:32.100> effect<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.479> kind<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.560> off<00:01:34.590> off

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
digital effect so kind of on on off off

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.550 
digital effect so kind of on on off off
sort<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.000> thing<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.420> don't<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.320> kind<00:01:37.500> of

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
sort of thing I don't know just kind of

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.010
