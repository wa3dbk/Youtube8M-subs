here's<00:01:47.180> my<00:01:47.330> feelings<00:01:47.690> on<00:01:47.840> them<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.080> know<00:01:48.170> people

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
here's my feelings on them I know people

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.990 
here's my feelings on them I know people
have<00:01:48.590> been<00:01:48.650> on<00:01:48.860> here<00:01:49.070> raving<00:01:49.490> how<00:01:49.610> wonderful

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
have been on here raving how wonderful

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.270 
have been on here raving how wonderful
it<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.120> and<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:51.080> does<00:01:51.290> have<00:01:51.500> its<00:01:51.650> uses<00:01:51.800> I<00:01:52.100> think

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
it is and it does have its uses I think

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.040 
it is and it does have its uses I think
they're<00:01:52.370> two<00:01:52.520> very<00:01:52.730> very<00:01:53.090> specific<00:01:53.690> time<00:01:53.870> so

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
they're two very very specific time so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.330 
they're two very very specific time so
anything<00:01:54.200> could<00:01:54.350> be<00:01:54.410> a<00:01:54.470> great<00:01:54.770> idea<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.130> get

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
anything could be a great idea to get

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.450 
anything could be a great idea to get
your<00:01:55.760> nail<00:01:55.910> select<00:01:56.740> but<00:01:57.740> my<00:01:57.890> conclusion<00:01:58.370> is

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
your nail select but my conclusion is

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.970 
your nail select but my conclusion is
it's<00:01:58.730> not<00:01:58.910> for<00:01:59.300> me<00:01:59.500> except<00:02:00.500> for<00:02:00.530> these<00:02:00.710> two

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
it's not for me except for these two

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.770 
it's not for me except for these two
specific<00:02:01.220> circumstances<00:02:02.210> first<00:02:02.480> of<00:02:02.660> all

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
specific circumstances first of all

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.840 
specific circumstances first of all
where<00:02:03.680> I<00:02:03.710> live<00:02:04.040> it<00:02:04.610> costs<00:02:05.030> $35<00:02:05.770> plus<00:02:06.770> tip<00:02:07.040> which

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
where I live it costs $35 plus tip which

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.609 
where I live it costs $35 plus tip which
i<00:02:08.000> think<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.540> a<00:02:08.600> little<00:02:08.810> pricey<00:02:09.020> because<00:02:09.380> it

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
i think is a little pricey because it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.290 
i think is a little pricey because it
only<00:02:09.740> lasts<00:02:09.979> about<00:02:10.130> two<00:02:10.460> two<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:10.970> three<00:02:11.120> weeks

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
only lasts about two two to three weeks

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.790 
only lasts about two two to three weeks
so<00:02:11.990> this<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.320> something<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.590> you're

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
so this is something that you're

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.350 
so this is something that you're
considering<00:02:13.130> doing<00:02:13.250> regularly<00:02:13.910> you're

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
considering doing regularly you're

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.490 
considering doing regularly you're
looking<00:02:14.750> at<00:02:15.010> $70<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> month<00:02:16.160> plus<00:02:16.610> tip<00:02:17.500> for

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
looking at $70 a month plus tip for

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.860 
looking at $70 a month plus tip for
nails<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.980> think<00:02:19.900> it's<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.960> little<00:02:21.020> high<00:02:21.320> um

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
nails I think it's a little high um

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.750 
nails I think it's a little high um
here's<00:02:23.870> where<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.290> think<00:02:24.620> it's<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.830> good<00:02:24.980> idea<00:02:25.100> if

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
here's where I think it's a good idea if

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.400 
here's where I think it's a good idea if
you've<00:02:25.940> just<00:02:26.210> had<00:02:26.360> your<00:02:26.420> acrylic<00:02:26.840> nails<00:02:27.080> taken

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
you've just had your acrylic nails taken

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.530 
you've just had your acrylic nails taken
off<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.580> want<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.910> give<00:02:29.030> your<00:02:29.150> nails<00:02:29.360> a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
off and you want to give your nails a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.050 
off and you want to give your nails a
tiny<00:02:30.020> little<00:02:30.380> extra<00:02:31.010> edge<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.460> strength<00:02:31.760> like

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
tiny little extra edge of strength like

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.820 
tiny little extra edge of strength like
a<00:02:32.090> minuscule<00:02:32.870> amount<00:02:33.110> as<00:02:33.350> they're<00:02:33.530> growing

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
a minuscule amount as they're growing

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.100 
a minuscule amount as they're growing
out<00:02:33.970> maybe<00:02:34.970> getting<00:02:35.390> your<00:02:35.510> nails<00:02:35.630> shellac<00:02:35.930> of

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
out maybe getting your nails shellac of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.080 
out maybe getting your nails shellac of
one<00:02:36.260> or<00:02:36.380> two<00:02:36.500> times<00:02:36.740> might<00:02:37.610> not<00:02:37.760> be<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:37.910> bad

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
one or two times might not be a bad

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.320 
one or two times might not be a bad
thing<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:39.530> doesn't<00:02:39.830> really<00:02:40.160> lend<00:02:40.520> a<00:02:40.820> lot<00:02:41.180> of

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
thing it doesn't really lend a lot of

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.640 
thing it doesn't really lend a lot of
extra<00:02:41.630> strength<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.140> your<00:02:42.230> nails<00:02:42.410> though

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
extra strength to your nails though

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.800 
extra strength to your nails though
which<00:02:43.250> was<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.460> downfall<00:02:43.970> for<00:02:44.000> me<00:02:44.240> because<00:02:44.540> in

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
which was a downfall for me because in

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.840 
which was a downfall for me because in
my<00:02:45.050> head<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.320> felt<00:02:45.770> like<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.490> had<00:02:46.640> gone<00:02:46.790> through

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
my head I felt like I had gone through

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.540 
my head I felt like I had gone through
this<00:02:47.120> huge<00:02:47.330> process<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:49.070> it<00:02:49.190> was<00:02:49.400> almost

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
this huge process and so it was almost

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.860 
this huge process and so it was almost
like<00:02:49.730> getting<00:02:49.880> acrylic<00:02:50.330> nails<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.630> I<00:02:50.660> found

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
like getting acrylic nails so I found

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.830 
like getting acrylic nails so I found
myself<00:02:51.020> using<00:02:51.470> my<00:02:51.650> nails<00:02:51.950> more<00:02:52.250> as<00:02:52.459> tools<00:02:52.880> that

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
myself using my nails more as tools that

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.570 
myself using my nails more as tools that
ended<00:02:54.110> up<00:02:54.170> breaking<00:02:54.350> my<00:02:54.680> nails<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:55.160> gives<00:02:55.520> you

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
ended up breaking my nails so gives you

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.560 
ended up breaking my nails so gives you
almost<00:02:55.730> like<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:56.000> false<00:02:56.209> sense<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.510> security

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
almost like a false sense of security

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.810 
almost like a false sense of security
when<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.230> have<00:02:57.350> shellac<00:02:57.650> on<00:02:57.830> so<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.700> was

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
when you have shellac on so that was

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.760 
when you have shellac on so that was
that<00:02:59.120> was<00:02:59.239> a<00:02:59.270> negative<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.780> was<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.930> con<00:03:00.140> the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
that was a negative that was a con the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.130 
that was a negative that was a con the
other<00:03:01.150> instance<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.330> think<00:03:02.360> where<00:03:02.720> it's<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.959> good

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
other instance I think where it's a good

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.040 
other instance I think where it's a good
idea<00:03:03.320> to<00:03:03.560> get<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.250> shellac<00:03:05.180> nails<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:05.810> if<00:03:05.930> you

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
idea to get a shellac nails is if you

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.920 
idea to get a shellac nails is if you
have<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.260> special<00:03:06.530> event<00:03:06.860> coming<00:03:06.920> up<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.930> you

worry<00:03:22.519> about<00:03:22.640> it<00:03:22.880> so<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.209> was<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.360> great

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.479 

circumstance<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.230> get<00:03:27.350> Micah's<00:03:27.650> edits<00:03:28.010> well<00:03:28.250> I

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
filmed the whole video and then realized

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.990 
filmed the whole video and then realized
that<00:03:30.920> in<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.250> background<00:03:31.670> while<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:31.880> was

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
that in the background while I was

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.150 
that in the background while I was
talking<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.600> Ruth<00:03:33.500> Gabe<00:03:33.709> was<00:03:33.830> pooping

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
right in the middle of my family room so

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.180 
right in the middle of my family room so
I<00:03:38.290> just<00:03:39.290> thought<00:03:39.530> I'd<00:03:39.650> share<00:03:39.830> that<00:03:40.010> with<00:03:40.100> you

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.930 
I just thought I'd share that with you
because<00:03:40.310> that's<00:03:41.209> pretty<00:03:41.420> funny<00:03:41.660> um<00:03:42.940> anyway

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
because that's pretty funny um anyway

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.120 
because that's pretty funny um anyway
hopefully<00:03:44.480> I've<00:03:44.690> edited<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:45.290> part<00:03:45.530> out<00:03:45.739> for

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130

you so I was talking about the two main
circumstances<00:03:49.640> when<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.820> think<00:03:50.090> that

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
circumstances when I think that

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.670 
circumstances when I think that
shellacking<00:03:50.540> is<00:03:50.810> a<00:03:50.840> good<00:03:51.019> idea<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.380> first

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
shellacking is a good idea the first

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.920 
shellacking is a good idea the first
being<00:03:52.100> if<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.090> have<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.209> special<00:03:53.540> event<00:03:53.630> coming

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
being if you have a special event coming

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.990 
being if you have a special event coming
up<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.440> don't<00:03:54.620> want<00:03:54.800> to<00:03:55.280> worry<00:03:55.940> about

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
up and you don't want to worry about

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.490 
up and you don't want to worry about
your<00:03:56.210> nails<00:03:56.420> chipping<00:03:56.780> over<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.110> course<00:03:57.319> of<00:03:57.410> a

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
your nails chipping over the course of a

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.650 
your nails chipping over the course of a
few<00:03:57.680> days

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
few days

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.120 
few days
that<00:03:58.900> goes<00:03:59.140> hand-in-hand<00:03:59.500> with<00:03:59.680> if<00:04:00.010> you're

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
that goes hand-in-hand with if you're

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.060 
that goes hand-in-hand with if you're
going<00:04:00.160> on<00:04:00.460> vacation<00:04:00.490> and<00:04:01.420> you<00:04:01.690> don't<00:04:01.840> want<00:04:01.960> to

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
going on vacation and you don't want to

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.500 
going on vacation and you don't want to
bring<00:04:03.070> along<00:04:03.400> nail<00:04:03.670> polish<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.180> nail<00:04:04.210> polish

remover<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:04.810> all<00:04:04.930> that<00:04:05.080> stuff<00:04:05.320> getting<00:04:06.310> your

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
remover and all that stuff getting your

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.100 
remover and all that stuff getting your
nails<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:06.730> lack<00:04:06.880> before<00:04:07.240> a<00:04:07.270> trip<00:04:07.540> it's<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.930> great

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
nails to lack before a trip it's a great

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.870 
nails to lack before a trip it's a great
idea<00:04:08.230> because<00:04:08.770> as<00:04:09.130> long<00:04:09.220> as<00:04:09.280> it's<00:04:09.550> a<00:04:09.580> neutral

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
idea because as long as it's a neutral

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.130 
idea because as long as it's a neutral
color<00:04:10.060> that<00:04:10.150> goes<00:04:10.420> with<00:04:10.480> everything<00:04:10.750> that

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
color that goes with everything that

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.900 
color that goes with everything that
you're<00:04:11.260> wearing<00:04:11.520> you<00:04:12.520> don't<00:04:12.670> have<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.850> think

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
you're wearing you don't have to think

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.840 
you're wearing you don't have to think
about<00:04:13.060> your<00:04:13.210> nails<00:04:14.190> however<00:04:15.190> even<00:04:15.760> though

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
about your nails however even though

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.789 
about your nails however even though
those<00:04:15.970> are<00:04:16.090> all<00:04:16.209> benefits<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.930> decided<00:04:17.709> that

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
those are all benefits I decided that

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.890 
those are all benefits I decided that
shellacking<00:04:18.160> really<00:04:18.880> isn't<00:04:19.060> for<00:04:19.390> me<00:04:19.510> unless

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
shellacking really isn't for me unless

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.170 
shellacking really isn't for me unless
I'm<00:04:20.230> going<00:04:20.530> on<00:04:20.620> vacation<00:04:21.100> or<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.700> have<00:04:22.150> a

them<00:05:00.700> up<00:05:00.820> I've<00:05:01.120> been<00:05:01.270> gardening<00:05:01.540> with<00:05:01.750> them<00:05:02.640> so

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
them up I've been gardening with them so

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.270 
them up I've been gardening with them so
in<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.120> end<00:05:04.270> I'm<00:05:05.110> not<00:05:05.170> a<00:05:05.530> fan<00:05:05.800> of<00:05:05.830> shellacking

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
in the end I'm not a fan of shellacking

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.120 
in the end I'm not a fan of shellacking
I<00:05:06.580> think<00:05:06.760> it's<00:05:06.910> expensive<00:05:07.330> for<00:05:07.900> what<00:05:08.470> it<00:05:08.590> is<00:05:08.620> I

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
I think it's expensive for what it is I

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.070 
I think it's expensive for what it is I
don't<00:05:09.670> like<00:05:09.850> putting<00:05:10.090> my<00:05:10.270> hands<00:05:10.630> and<00:05:10.780> UV<00:05:11.050> light

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
don't like putting my hands and UV light

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.070 
don't like putting my hands and UV light
over<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:11.920> over<00:05:12.040> and<00:05:12.130> over<00:05:12.990> even<00:05:13.990> though

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
over and over and over even though

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.180 
over and over and over even though
there's<00:05:14.230> absolutely<00:05:14.620> no<00:05:14.770> evidence<00:05:14.919> that

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
there's absolutely no evidence that

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.760 
there's absolutely no evidence that
shows<00:05:15.460> that<00:05:15.640> it's<00:05:15.820> horrible<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:17.140> it<00:05:17.440> just<00:05:17.470> it

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
shows that it's horrible I it just it

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.450 
shows that it's horrible I it just it
can't<00:05:17.950> be<00:05:18.070> good

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
can't be good

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.820 
can't be good
soaking<00:05:19.180> in<00:05:19.300> acetone<00:05:19.810> frequently<00:05:20.350> also<00:05:20.620> to

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
soaking in acetone frequently also to

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.530 
soaking in acetone frequently also to
get<00:05:21.010> it<00:05:21.100> off<00:05:21.220> I<00:05:21.550> don't<00:05:21.730> think<00:05:21.880> is<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.360> best

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
get it off I don't think is the best

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.260 
get it off I don't think is the best
thing<00:05:22.750> for<00:05:22.780> your<00:05:23.050> skin<00:05:23.590> or<00:05:23.800> nails<00:05:23.950> so<00:05:24.880> while<00:05:25.120> it

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
thing for your skin or nails so while it

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.180 
thing for your skin or nails so while it
does<00:05:25.419> have<00:05:25.450> its<00:05:25.780> uses<00:05:25.930> as<00:05:26.380> far<00:05:26.590> as<00:05:26.710> regular

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
does have its uses as far as regular

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.810 
does have its uses as far as regular
nail<00:05:28.110> routine<00:05:29.110> I<00:05:29.500> wouldn't<00:05:30.250> choose<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.430> do<00:05:30.640> it

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
nail routine I wouldn't choose to do it

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.280 
nail routine I wouldn't choose to do it
I<00:05:31.060> think<00:05:31.480> if<00:05:31.540> you're<00:05:31.660> gonna<00:05:31.750> go<00:05:31.900> to<00:05:31.930> that<00:05:32.020> much

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
I think if you're gonna go to that much

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.750 
I think if you're gonna go to that much
effort<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.950> might<00:05:33.250> as<00:05:33.370> well<00:05:33.430> just<00:05:33.610> put

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
effort you might as well just put

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.000 
effort you might as well just put
acrylic<00:05:34.150> nails<00:05:34.330> on<00:05:34.540> it's<00:05:34.840> less<00:05:35.050> expensive<00:05:35.290> it

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
acrylic nails on it's less expensive it

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.240 
acrylic nails on it's less expensive it
lasts<00:05:36.490> longer<00:05:37.410> yes<00:05:38.410> your<00:05:38.590> nails<00:05:38.740> get<00:05:38.950> ruined

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
lasts longer yes your nails get ruined

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.810 
lasts longer yes your nails get ruined
but<00:05:40.770> it<00:05:41.770> depends<00:05:42.190> on<00:05:42.250> what<00:05:42.310> you're<00:05:42.520> doing<00:05:42.550> it

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
but it depends on what you're doing it

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.130 
but it depends on what you're doing it
for<00:05:42.970> I<00:05:43.000> guess<00:05:43.150> if<00:05:43.360> you<00:05:43.419> want<00:05:43.570> to<00:05:43.750> have<00:05:43.870> the<00:05:43.990> look

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.740 
for I guess if you want to have the look
of<00:05:44.260> nice<00:05:44.440> nails<00:05:45.180> acrylics<00:05:46.180> will<00:05:46.330> do<00:05:46.419> that<00:05:46.570> for
