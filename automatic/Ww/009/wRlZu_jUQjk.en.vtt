00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.390 
intertwined but the structure of the
game<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.870> unique<00:02:14.140> because<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.950> choose<00:02:15.160> one<00:02:15.370> of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
game is unique because you choose one of

game is unique because you choose one of
these<00:02:15.519> guys<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:15.970> play<00:02:16.120> through<00:02:16.269> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
these guys and you play through the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.900 
these guys and you play through the
whole<00:02:16.390> Kate<00:02:16.720> whole<00:02:17.140> campaign<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:17.950> them<00:02:18.220> finish

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
whole Kate whole campaign as them finish

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.070 
whole Kate whole campaign as them finish
it<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.120> then<00:02:19.239> play<00:02:19.360> through<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.660> other<00:02:20.019> side

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
it and then play through the other side

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.780 
it and then play through the other side
so<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.860> kind<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.040> get<00:02:21.130> two<00:02:21.310> sides<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
so you kind of get two sides of the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.910 
so you kind of get two sides of the
story<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.390> they're<00:02:23.019> very<00:02:23.050> unique<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
story and they're very unique and the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.070 
story and they're very unique and the
gameplay<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.610> different<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.750> female

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
gameplay is different to the female

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.870 
gameplay is different to the female
character<00:02:26.290> she's<00:02:26.470> much<00:02:26.650> faster<00:02:27.280> speedy<00:02:27.730> or

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
character she's much faster speedy or

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.340 
character she's much faster speedy or
good<00:02:28.060> with<00:02:28.180> short<00:02:28.330> swords<00:02:28.750> whereas<00:02:28.959> ki<00:02:29.110> skates

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
good with short swords whereas ki skates

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.289 
good with short swords whereas ki skates
strong<00:02:29.680> better<00:02:30.310> with<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.549> slow<00:02:30.730> sword<00:02:31.000> so

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
strong better with the slow sword so

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.940 
strong better with the slow sword so
it's<00:02:31.600> kind<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.780> two<00:02:31.930> experiences<00:02:32.410> in<00:02:32.560> one<00:02:32.709> and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
it's kind of two experiences in one and
