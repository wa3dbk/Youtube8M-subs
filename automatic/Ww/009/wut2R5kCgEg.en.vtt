improvement we start with cuttings from
a<00:02:51.910> plant<00:02:52.209> very<00:02:52.600> much<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.140> way<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.290> would<00:02:53.590> do

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
a plant very much the way you would do

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.830 
a plant very much the way you would do

cuttings in your own home to make

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.350 
cuttings in your own home to make
several<00:02:56.170> plants<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:56.920> we<00:02:57.340> can<00:02:57.489> produce<00:02:57.670> plants

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
several plants and we can produce plants

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.479 
several plants and we can produce plants
from<00:02:58.540> those<00:02:58.720> cuttings<00:02:59.200> then<00:02:59.769> we<00:02:59.950> take<00:02:59.980> leaf

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
from those cuttings then we take leaf

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.000 
from those cuttings then we take leaf
lobes<00:03:00.910> which<00:03:01.330> are<00:03:01.600> unexpanded<00:03:02.170> tiny<00:03:02.680> leaves

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
lobes which are unexpanded tiny leaves

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.520 
lobes which are unexpanded tiny leaves
and<00:03:03.280> from<00:03:03.790> these<00:03:03.940> we<00:03:04.360> produce<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.959> certain<00:03:05.319> kind

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
and from these we produce a certain kind

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.100 
and from these we produce a certain kind
of<00:03:05.680> cell<00:03:05.980> which<00:03:06.550> is<00:03:06.730> capable<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.480> producing<00:03:07.840> a

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
of cell which is capable of producing a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.070 
of cell which is capable of producing a
whole<00:03:08.319> new<00:03:08.590> plant<00:03:08.920> these<00:03:09.880> cells<00:03:10.360> then<00:03:10.780> we

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
whole new plant these cells then we

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.800 
whole new plant these cells then we
through<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:11.890> complex<00:03:12.459> process<00:03:12.910> we<00:03:13.480> can<00:03:13.630> get

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
through a complex process we can get

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.620 
through a complex process we can get
genes<00:03:14.140> into<00:03:14.620> these<00:03:14.799> cells<00:03:15.190> genes<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.450> we're

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
genes into these cells genes that we're

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.539 
genes into these cells genes that we're
interested<00:03:17.049> in<00:03:17.380> doing<00:03:17.590> research<00:03:17.769> on<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.400> our

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
interested in doing research on in our

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.539 
interested in doing research on in our
laboratory<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.299> from<00:03:19.750> these<00:03:20.079> new<00:03:20.769> cells<00:03:21.190> we

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
laboratory and from these new cells we

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.819 
laboratory and from these new cells we
can<00:03:21.730> produce<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:22.239> whole<00:03:22.480> new<00:03:22.750> plant<00:03:23.110> this<00:03:23.769> plant

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
can produce a whole new plant this plant

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.880 
can produce a whole new plant this plant
is<00:03:24.280> now<00:03:24.459> an<00:03:24.610> improved<00:03:25.030> plant<00:03:25.360> with<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:26.170> traits

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
is now an improved plant with the traits

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.190 
is now an improved plant with the traits
that<00:03:27.070> we<00:03:27.310> have<00:03:27.459> put<00:03:27.670> in<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.090> now<00:03:28.570> we<00:03:28.630> end<00:03:28.930> up

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
that we have put in and now we end up

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.380 
that we have put in and now we end up
with<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.620> plant<00:03:29.860> very<00:03:30.190> much<00:03:30.459> like<00:03:30.700> we<00:03:30.880> started

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
with the plant very much like we started

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.539 
with the plant very much like we started
with<00:03:31.570> however<00:03:32.320> now<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.860> one<00:03:33.160> has<00:03:33.340> an

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
with however now this one has an

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.190 
with however now this one has an
improved<00:03:33.940> trait<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.870> what<00:03:35.049> we're

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
improved trait and this is what we're

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.099 
improved trait and this is what we're
doing<00:03:35.500> in<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.709> lab<00:03:35.940> we<00:03:36.940> teach<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.600> plant<00:03:37.870> we

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
doing in the lab we teach the plant we

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.380 
doing in the lab we teach the plant we
inoculate<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:39.010> plan<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.790> then<00:03:39.970> when<00:03:40.239> the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
inoculate the plan so then when the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.170 
inoculate the plan so then when the
virus<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.870> coming<00:03:41.290> this<00:03:41.560> sequence<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.670> DNA<00:03:42.820> is

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
virus is coming this sequence of DNA is

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.970 
virus is coming this sequence of DNA is
already<00:03:43.540> known<00:03:43.840> by<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.230> plant<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.920> the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
already known by the plant and the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.479 
already known by the plant and the
princess<00:03:45.430> as<00:03:45.720> more<00:03:46.720> time<00:03:46.750> is<00:03:47.739> prepared<00:03:48.340> to

princess as more time is prepared to

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.090 
princess as more time is prepared to
control<00:03:49.420> these<00:03:49.600> viruses<00:03:50.109> better<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.650> if<00:03:50.980> you

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
control these viruses better and if you

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.080 
control these viruses better and if you
do<00:03:51.280> this<00:03:51.430> job<00:03:52.120> very<00:03:52.930> well<00:03:53.170> then<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:54.489> winner

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
do this job very well then the winner

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.050 
do this job very well then the winner
will<00:03:55.390> be<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.690> plant<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:57.370> next<00:03:57.670> step<00:03:57.850> is<00:03:58.030> to

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
will be the plant the next step is to

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.090 
will be the plant the next step is to
grow<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.540> plants<00:03:58.870> they<00:03:59.049> hope<00:03:59.230> or<00:03:59.440> improved<00:03:59.890> in

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
grow the plants they hope or improved in

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.310 
grow the plants they hope or improved in
the<00:04:00.190> greenhouses<00:04:00.670> where<00:04:01.090> they<00:04:01.630> are<00:04:01.780> injected

plants<00:04:09.910> against<00:04:10.239> viruses<00:04:10.660> is<00:04:11.019> a<00:04:11.049> much<00:04:11.290> more

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320
