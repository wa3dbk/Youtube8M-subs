00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.230 
is gruesome I measured the size of the
bin<00:01:20.800> on<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.400> front<00:01:21.640> how<00:01:21.729> it<00:01:21.790> looked

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
bin on the front how it looked

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.240 
bin on the front how it looked
and<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.420> like<00:01:22.689> how<00:01:22.930> inside<00:01:23.710> of<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.920> drawer

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
and I like how inside of the drawer

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.070 
and I like how inside of the drawer
there<00:01:24.610> is<00:01:24.729> like<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:24.939> little<00:01:25.299> bit<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.689> space

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
there is like a little bit of space

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.539 
there is like a little bit of space
where<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:26.439> can<00:01:26.530> actually<00:01:26.979> put<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.250> paper

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
where you can actually put a paper

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.789 
where you can actually put a paper
securely<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.420> just<00:01:28.840> put<00:01:28.990> some<00:01:29.020> tape<00:01:29.380> down<00:01:29.560> don't

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
securely I just put some tape down don't

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.140 
securely I just put some tape down don't
have<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.009> worry<00:01:30.220> about<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:30.610> sliding<00:01:30.820> around

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
have to worry about it sliding around

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.749 
have to worry about it sliding around
because<00:01:32.020> on<00:01:32.290> that<00:01:32.650> little<00:01:32.950> space<00:01:33.280> gives<00:01:33.640> you

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
because on that little space gives you

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.310 
because on that little space gives you
like<00:01:33.909> a<00:01:33.939> little<00:01:34.210> gap<00:01:34.509> so<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.049> doesn't

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
like a little gap so it doesn't

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.660 
like a little gap so it doesn't
interfere<00:01:35.530> with<00:01:35.710> whatever's<00:01:36.220> in<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.460> drawer

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
interfere with whatever's in the drawer

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.980 
interfere with whatever's in the drawer
so<00:01:36.850> it's<00:01:36.970> not<00:01:37.090> going<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.360> like<00:01:37.450> squish<00:01:37.810> or

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
so it's not going to like squish or

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.359 
so it's not going to like squish or
anything<00:01:38.140> like<00:01:38.409> that<00:01:38.470> because<00:01:38.890> I<00:01:38.979> did<00:01:39.159> think

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
anything like that because I did think

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.660 
anything like that because I did think
about<00:01:39.579> that<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.030> then<00:01:40.630> also<00:01:40.960> um<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:42.369> all<00:01:42.579> you

about that and then also um you all you

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.280 
about that and then also um you all you
have<00:01:42.790> to<00:01:42.880> do<00:01:42.970> is<00:01:43.150> just<00:01:43.329> measure<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.720> cut<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.110> out

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290
