00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.199 
gadget now yes he doesn't he he dorma
sons<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.040> gadget<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.459> obviously<00:02:50.819> don't<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.060> in

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
sons to gadget I obviously don't have in

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.220 
sons to gadget I obviously don't have in
fact<00:02:51.330> there's<00:02:51.660> anything<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.140> kind

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
fact there's anything of that kind

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.050 
fact there's anything of that kind
wasn't<00:02:52.860> really<00:02:52.950> believe<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.430> mystic<00:02:53.790> I

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
wasn't really believe in the mystic I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.610 
wasn't really believe in the mystic I
think<00:02:54.450> they<00:02:54.540> started<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:54.900> compact<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.440> can't

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
think they started so compact you can't

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.130 
think they started so compact you can't
fit<00:02:55.890> anything<00:02:56.069> else<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.700> deck<00:02:56.849> so<00:02:57.690> he<00:02:57.720> just

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
fit anything else in the deck so he just

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.780 
fit anything else in the deck so he just
normal<00:02:58.560> some<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.829> gadget<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.220> his<00:02:59.549> turn

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
normal some of the gadget and his turn

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.720 
normal some of the gadget and his turn
and<00:03:00.060> as<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.110> turns<00:03:01.410> out<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.709> facedown<00:03:02.280> card

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
and as it turns out that facedown card

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.910 
and as it turns out that facedown card
is<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> limiter<00:03:03.510> removal<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:04.440> when<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.590> go<00:03:04.890> to

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
is a limiter removal and so when I go to

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.289 
is a limiter removal and so when I go to
discard<00:03:05.310> these<00:03:05.430> two<00:03:05.579> parts<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.000> special

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
discard these two parts to special

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.380 
discard these two parts to special
someone<00:03:06.480> megalo<00:03:06.780> abyss<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:08.060> he<00:03:09.060> could<00:03:09.269> have

someone megalo abyss and he could have

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.660 
someone megalo abyss and he could have
been<00:03:09.540> smart<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.560> changed<00:03:11.310> they've<00:03:11.549> been

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
been smart and changed they've been
