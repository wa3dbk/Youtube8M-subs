about<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.309> I've<00:00:08.550> heard<00:00:08.700> about<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.269> a

about that I've heard about it for a
long<00:00:09.389> time<00:00:09.450> we<00:00:09.960> looked<00:00:10.170> at<00:00:10.290> it's<00:00:10.500> based<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.280> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
long time we looked at it's based on the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.749 
long time we looked at it's based on the
Multistrada<00:00:12.269> motor<00:00:12.570> it's<00:00:12.929> got<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.759> leaven

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
Multistrada motor it's got a leaven

Multistrada motor it's got a leaven
hundred<00:00:14.969> cc<00:00:15.240> engine<00:00:15.509> looks<00:00:16.500> like<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> lot<00:00:16.949> of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
hundred cc engine looks like a lot of

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.650 
hundred cc engine looks like a lot of
fun<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.250> lot<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.490> torque<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.150> think<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.570> going

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
fun a lot of torque I think it's going

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.240 
fun a lot of torque I think it's going
to<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.840> wheelie<00:00:19.080> monster<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.130> I'm<00:00:20.189> gonna

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
to be a wheelie monster and so I'm gonna

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.340 
to be a wheelie monster and so I'm gonna
take<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.699> ride<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.119> tell<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.140> how<00:00:22.289> we

you're<00:01:12.000> almost<00:01:12.300> flying<00:01:12.690> there's<00:01:12.990> nothing

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
you're almost flying there's nothing

really<00:01:13.440> in<00:01:13.590> front<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.070> what<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> really

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
really in front of you what I really

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.240 
really in front of you what I really
enjoyed<00:01:15.270> about<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.600> bike<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.140> low<00:01:17.070> end

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
enjoyed about the bike is the low end

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.279 
enjoyed about the bike is the low end
power<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.820> low<00:01:18.000> end<00:01:18.210> torque<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.050> puts

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
power and low end torque that it puts

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.859 
power and low end torque that it puts
off<00:01:19.440> it's<00:01:19.740> unlike<00:01:20.280> my<00:01:20.460> CBR<00:01:20.820> which<00:01:21.179> makes<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.539> lot

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
off it's unlike my CBR which makes a lot

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.499 
off it's unlike my CBR which makes a lot
of<00:01:21.899> high-end<00:01:22.289> horsepower<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.360> really<00:01:24.360> almost

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
of high-end horsepower and really almost

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.570 
of high-end horsepower and really almost
scares<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.080> death<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.619> Ducati<00:01:26.220> makes<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
scares you to death the Ducati makes a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460 
scares you to death the Ducati makes a
lot<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.789> very<00:01:27.119> usable<00:01:27.630> low-end<00:01:27.990> torque<00:01:28.200> so

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
lot of very usable low-end torque so

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.460 
lot of very usable low-end torque so
it's<00:01:28.619> great<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:28.860> doing<00:01:29.340> wheelies<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.759> just

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
it's great for doing wheelies and just

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.600 
it's great for doing wheelies and just
accelerating<00:01:31.470> around<00:01:31.770> corners<00:01:32.130> around<00:01:32.250> town

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
accelerating around corners around town

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.840 
accelerating around corners around town
and<00:01:32.940> it's<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.929> little<00:01:34.110> bit<00:01:34.200> different<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.560> make

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
and it's a little bit different it make

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.669 
and it's a little bit different it make
doesn't<00:01:35.850> make<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.119> big<00:01:37.080> high<00:01:37.380> horsepower

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
doesn't make the big high horsepower

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.249 
doesn't make the big high horsepower
numbers<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.399> Supersport<00:01:38.970> bikes<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:40.140> all

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
numbers of the Supersport bikes it's all

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.380 
numbers of the Supersport bikes it's all
I<00:01:40.289> believe<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.740> only<00:01:40.799> about<00:01:40.950> 90<00:01:41.390> horsepower

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
I believe it's only about 90 horsepower

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.929 
I believe it's only about 90 horsepower
but<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.719> a<00:01:42.899> very<00:01:42.930> comfortable<00:01:43.500> very<00:01:43.939> usable

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
but it's a very comfortable very usable

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.690 
but it's a very comfortable very usable
power<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.509> still<00:01:46.350> plenty<00:01:46.740> four<00:01:46.950> wheeling<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
power and still plenty four wheeling and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.170 
power and still plenty four wheeling and
going<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:48.479> fast<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:50.369> brakes<00:01:50.640> are<00:01:50.820> really

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
going really fast the brakes are really

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.850 
going really fast the brakes are really
