00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.980
 hello world it's me again technique 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.600
 sliding gate there is a moment which 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.789
 call I do not know why you need him 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.670
 need like a moro how to apply it 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.250
 somewhere effective but he has it 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.010
 disclose discuss because quantity 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.329
 questions regarding and about each time 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.460
 schools and in Qatar incredible easier one 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.680
 once understand what 300 times to answer 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.489
 the same thing is a classic notion 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.829
 technique and stick stick which 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.170
 found still in skating in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.430
 technology and ask people how it 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.430
 why do you need him 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.890
 what is its meaning and whether it is necessary to stick the shelf 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.199
 or just give a stick means let's 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.289
 let's figure out what its meaning will close this 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.879
 the topic is like once and for all 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:07.290
 means the meaning of the stick stick in that 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.570
 it makes no sense there is only one 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.000
 the moment he can apply it in 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.420
 moment of riding very small turns 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.009
 at very low speed in order 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.229
 to make certain movements 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.790
 Now I will tell you how very much 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.580
 aggressive and fast and so let's 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.130
 order we are driving turns told from 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.400
 cut turn no matter what we do what 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.530
 body and body counter rotation then 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.869
 there we are for watt we twist the body in 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.729
 turning inwards turning into 1 pair another 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.070
 turn at this moment we do here 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.630
 such hand motions as if yes to 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.549
 to the top of the case on 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.280
 twisted to load 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.649
 us and skis to unload 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.500
 backdrops or just add some 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.090
 torsion in skiing sensations 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.640
 For loading 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.250
 either for side slips or 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.580
 for a greater bend a harmful turn 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.640
 no matter on the change of turns we need 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.430
 quickly change the direction of this 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.819
 twisting and then there is just 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.090
 works 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.359
 one moment look try just 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.340
 not fast going on how he slept on 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.870
 gentle slope literally to the lift 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.629
 or disappear immediately but the main thing is that 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.269
 the speed was small take on the go 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.819
 stick a stick stick a stick in an elephant 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.639
 what happens wand knows on the spot you 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.739
 move happens next time here 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.209
 such a taifas to pull back with 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.519
 Naturally what happens to the body 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.609
 the case unfolds yes so for 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.969
 this is this stick stick 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.560
 not to something here 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:46.200
 move actually need it for 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.199
 order to reactively shift here 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.969
 turning the hull into a new twist well this 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:53.000
 same again, and you can call 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:55.489
 initiating a new gate i mean i 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.459
 initiate body rotation new turn 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.579
 to betray you must understand that 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.949
 high speed in high bends 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.989
 this can not be done because stick 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.519
 stick to the slope get a good punch at 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.230
 principle you can even fly into the pump 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.019
 stick you have a long enough stick and 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.269
 cripple yourself break the shelf this 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.340
 absolutely exactly why actually in 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.859
 carving even on radii there turning 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.409
 13 meters already according to them of course no one 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:25.530
 already stick snow nikolet city stick 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:27.840
 snow or some kind of classic style 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.489
 frequent change of turns such a grasshopper 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.549
 put the technique either 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.720
 short turn and aggressive 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.049
 with slippage 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.430
 very small radius or waffles raise in 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.739
 some very narrow 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.120
 narrow places narrow map of them well either 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.609
 when very scary and want 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.819
 controls the speed of the small turn everything 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.919
 for other purposes not in principle here and 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.750
 all that there is such a floor shelf like this 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.140
 done in such situations apply and 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.230
 its meaning is exactly so sorted out 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.660
 but not to miss the following points 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.250
 which we will analyze the technique 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.810
 riding on the cat itself is not signed 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.910
 channel video put like this so that we 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.770
 understand what you saw go to the site 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.050
 let 's site questions on the forum we 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.250
 all answer all all bye meet 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.250
 on the slope of the chow
