I<00:00:44.520> find<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.180> bigger<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.629> holes<00:00:45.870> are<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
I find that the bigger the holes are the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:57.930 
I find that the bigger the holes are the
more<00:00:46.559> polish<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.280> hold

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.549 

using<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:59.090> pair<00:00:59.329> of<00:00:59.480> tweezers<00:00:59.750> to<00:00:59.960> hold<00:01:00.410> the

colors<00:01:02.809> onto<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.379> nail<00:01:03.590> this<00:01:04.489> will<00:01:04.699> create

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
colors onto the nail this will create

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.600 
colors onto the nail this will create
the<00:01:05.089> gradient<00:01:05.720> effect<00:01:05.979> make<00:01:06.979> sure<00:01:07.190> you<00:01:07.340> get<00:01:07.490> to

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
the gradient effect make sure you get to

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.330 
the gradient effect make sure you get to
the<00:01:07.729> corners<00:01:08.180> as<00:01:08.360> well<00:01:08.720> this<00:01:09.470> will<00:01:09.830> leave<00:01:10.130> a

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
the corners as well this will leave a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.760
