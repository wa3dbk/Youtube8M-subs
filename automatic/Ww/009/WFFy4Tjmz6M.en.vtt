00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.980 
a little trouble with that myself and
what<00:02:07.830> that<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:09.090> works<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> camera

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
what that is is it works like a camera

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.710 
what that is is it works like a camera
shutter<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.220> turn<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:11.570> and<00:02:12.570> it

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
opens it up on the ocular and the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.490 
opens it up on the ocular and the
objective<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:17.730> protects<00:02:18.450> your<00:02:18.570> lens<00:02:18.840> also
