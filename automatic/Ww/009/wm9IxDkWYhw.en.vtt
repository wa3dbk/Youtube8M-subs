generation iPad 4 and 20% thinner as
you'll<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.489> quick

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
you'll see here as I do a quick

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:02.470 
you'll see here as I do a quick
comparison<00:00:51.410> between<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.680> two<00:00:52.829> devices

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.210 

and<00:01:03.129> this<00:01:04.129> is<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.720> iPad<00:01:05.720> 4<00:01:06.369> as<00:01:07.369> you<00:01:08.360> can<00:01:08.509> see<00:01:09.220> an

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
and this is the iPad 4 as you can see an

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.840 
and this is the iPad 4 as you can see an
entire<00:01:10.490> bezel<00:01:11.180> is<00:01:11.299> basically<00:01:12.259> gone<00:01:12.580> on<00:01:13.580> the

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
entire bezel is basically gone on the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:23.649 
entire bezel is basically gone on the
iPad<00:01:14.240> air<00:01:21.820> when<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.940> hold<00:01:23.119> it<00:01:23.210> in<00:01:23.270> your<00:01:23.390> hand

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
iPad air when you hold it in your hand

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.109 
iPad air when you hold it in your hand
you<00:01:23.750> really<00:01:24.020> notice<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:25.899> it's<00:01:26.899> much<00:01:27.170> lighter

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
you really notice that it's much lighter

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.660 
you really notice that it's much lighter
compared<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.330> 1.4<00:01:29.960> pound<00:01:30.229> on<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:31.220> iPad

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
compared to the 1.4 pound on the iPad

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.820 
compared to the 1.4 pound on the iPad
for<00:01:34.720> 20%<00:01:35.720> thinner<00:01:36.140> really<00:01:36.560> makes<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.800> big

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
for 20% thinner really makes a big

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.370 
for 20% thinner really makes a big
difference<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:38.390> as<00:01:38.539> you<00:01:38.630> can<00:01:38.690> see<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.170> volume

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
difference and as you can see the volume

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.690 
difference and as you can see the volume
rockers<00:01:39.860> change<00:01:40.190> a<00:01:40.340> little<00:01:40.490> bit<00:01:40.700> there<00:01:40.970> but

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
rockers change a little bit there but

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.520 
rockers change a little bit there but
it's<00:01:43.700> still<00:01:43.940> at<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.869> bottom<00:01:45.200> with<00:01:45.409> the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
it's still at the bottom with the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.120 
it's still at the bottom with the
speakers

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
speakers

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.859 
speakers
however<00:01:46.909> it's<00:01:47.060> changed<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.539> little<00:01:47.690> bit

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
however it's changed a little bit

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.139 
however it's changed a little bit
because<00:01:48.049> it's<00:01:48.319> now<00:01:48.530> all<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.520> way<00:01:49.610> at<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.729> end

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
because it's now all the way at the end

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.550 
because it's now all the way at the end
you've<00:01:51.080> got<00:01:51.319> the<00:01:51.560> mics<00:01:51.830> on<00:01:52.069> top<00:01:53.560> actually

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
you've got the mics on top actually

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.550 
you've got the mics on top actually
they're<00:01:54.679> dual<00:01:54.920> mics<00:01:55.450> home<00:01:56.450> button<00:01:56.810> on<00:01:57.020> the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
they're dual mics home button on the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.109 
they're dual mics home button on the
front<00:01:57.799> still<00:01:58.220> place<00:01:58.610> in<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.209> same<00:01:59.390> location

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.380 

and<00:02:06.070> just<00:02:07.070> giving<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.549> quick<00:02:07.700> look<00:02:07.789> again

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
and just giving you a quick look again

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.990 
and just giving you a quick look again
at<00:02:08.690> how<00:02:09.100> basically<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.340> entire<00:02:10.609> right<00:02:10.970> side

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
at how basically the entire right side

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.009 
at how basically the entire right side
bass<00:02:11.420> over<00:02:11.630> there<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:12.140> gone<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.420> comparing<00:02:14.930> it

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
bass over there is gone so comparing it

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.390 
bass over there is gone so comparing it
to<00:02:15.049> the<00:02:15.230> iPad<00:02:15.530> Mini<00:02:15.910> it's<00:02:16.910> as<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:18.709> can<00:02:18.829> see<00:02:19.040> is

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
to the iPad Mini it's as you can see is

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.750 
to the iPad Mini it's as you can see is
bigger<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:20.540> not<00:02:20.890> much<00:02:21.890> much<00:02:22.130> bigger<00:02:22.370> like<00:02:22.579> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
bigger but not much much bigger like the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:32.839 
bigger but not much much bigger like the
iPad<00:02:23.090> 4<00:02:23.410> thickness<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:24.560> roughly<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.070> same

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.920 

the<00:02:33.420> iPad<00:02:33.810> Mini<00:02:35.420> feels<00:02:36.420> really<00:02:36.659> good<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.900> your

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
the iPad Mini feels really good in your

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.020 
the iPad Mini feels really good in your
hand<00:02:37.170> as<00:02:37.260> well<00:02:37.439> but<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.609> can<00:02:38.700> see<00:02:38.760> either<00:02:38.909> a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
hand as well but as you can see either a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.470 
hand as well but as you can see either a
divine<00:02:39.420> rocker<00:02:39.719> is<00:02:40.999> identical<00:02:41.999> to<00:02:42.409> to<00:02:43.409> their

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
divine rocker is identical to to their

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.849 
divine rocker is identical to to their
same<00:02:45.480> placement<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.079> Thunderbolt<00:02:46.560> and

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
same placement of Thunderbolt and

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.640 
same placement of Thunderbolt and
speakers<00:02:50.750> okay<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:51.810> let's<00:02:52.139> take<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.409> look<00:02:52.590> at

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
speakers okay so let's take a look at

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.339 
speakers okay so let's take a look at
all<00:02:52.859> three<00:02:53.069> devices<00:02:53.310> together<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:55.230> will

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
all three devices together and it will

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.899 
all three devices together and it will
give<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> really<00:02:56.280> good<00:02:56.489> size<00:02:56.700> comparison

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
give you a really good size comparison

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.409 
give you a really good size comparison
as<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.659> see<00:02:57.810> there<00:02:58.219> okay<00:02:59.219> so<00:02:59.280> let's<00:03:00.209> go

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
as you can see there okay so let's go

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.899 
as you can see there okay so let's go
ahead<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.840> jump<00:03:01.409> in<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:04.049> iPad<00:03:04.799> air<00:03:05.040> smart

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
ahead and jump in to the iPad air smart

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.479 
ahead and jump in to the iPad air smart
case<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.419> really<00:03:07.230> like<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.739> case<00:03:08.010> because<00:03:08.370> it

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
case I really like this case because it

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.369 
case I really like this case because it
gives<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.879> virtually<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> hundred<00:03:10.319> percent
