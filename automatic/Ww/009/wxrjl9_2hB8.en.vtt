00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
I actually want to change about the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.720 
I actually want to change about the
original<00:00:24.359> video<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.050> made<00:00:25.080> for<00:00:25.430> PVE<00:00:26.430> holy

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
original video that I made for PVE holy

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.519 
original video that I made for PVE holy
paladins<00:00:27.150> after<00:00:27.630> giving<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.050> lot<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.260> thought

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
paladins after giving a lot of thought

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.810 
paladins after giving a lot of thought
and<00:00:28.560> obviously<00:00:28.949> check<00:00:29.160> into<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> lot<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.640> things

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and obviously check into a lot of things

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.959 
and obviously check into a lot of things
as<00:00:30.000> well<00:00:30.590> it<00:00:31.590> seems<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.949> lot<00:00:32.070> wiser<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.579> take

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
as well it seems a lot wiser to take

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.500 
as well it seems a lot wiser to take
divine<00:00:33.390> purpose<00:00:33.899> /<00:00:34.489> holy<00:00:35.489> avenger<00:00:35.730> especially

divine purpose / holy avenger especially

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.119 
divine purpose / holy avenger especially
since<00:00:36.719> Cena's<00:00:37.260> you're<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.739> 18

since Cena's you're going to have 18
seconds<00:00:38.520> every<00:00:38.790> two<00:00:38.940> minutes<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.320> lot

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
seconds every two minutes of like a lot

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.010 
seconds every two minutes of like a lot
of<00:00:40.649> healing<00:00:40.800> which<00:00:41.190> okay<00:00:41.610> i<00:00:41.640> guess<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.329> going

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
of healing which okay i guess is going

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.020 
of healing which okay i guess is going
to<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.170> very<00:00:43.200> situational<00:00:44.040> depending<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.610> what

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
to be very situational depending on what

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.400 
to be very situational depending on what
sort<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.300> encounter<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.780> what<00:00:45.899> happens<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.260> an

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
sort of encounter and what happens in an

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.869 
sort of encounter and what happens in an
encounter<00:00:47.700> off<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:48.390> away<00:00:49.520> I'll<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.760> look

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
encounter off go away I'll to look

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.700 
encounter off go away I'll to look
at<00:00:51.030> obviously<00:00:51.270> divine<00:00:51.660> purpose<00:00:52.079> did<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
at obviously divine purpose did the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.410 
at obviously divine purpose did the
bid's<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.129> cost<00:00:53.340> holy<00:00:53.520> power<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> trend

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
bid's is a cost holy power have a trend

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.880 
bid's is a cost holy power have a trend
often<00:00:54.719> chance<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.320> cause<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> divine

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
often chance to do cause the divine

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.350 
often chance to do cause the divine
purpose<00:00:56.190> effect<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.879> next<00:00:57.120> holy

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
purpose effect which is your next holy

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.000 
purpose effect which is your next holy
power<00:00:57.539> ability<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:58.140> consume<00:00:58.440> no<00:00:58.649> holy<00:00:58.890> power

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
power ability will consume no holy power

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.950 
power ability will consume no holy power
and<00:00:59.550> what<00:00:59.760> causes<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.239> three<00:01:00.480> hardly<00:01:00.780> power

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and what causes if three hardly power

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.189 
and what causes if three hardly power
were<00:01:01.140> consumed<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.160> last<00:01:02.370> 4<00:01:02.550> 80<00:01:02.670> seconds

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
were consumed and then last 4 80 seconds

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.479 
were consumed and then last 4 80 seconds
so<00:01:04.199> obviously<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.070> should<00:01:05.339> affect

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so obviously that that should affect

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.160 
so obviously that that should affect
last<00:01:05.850> 30<00:01:06.090> seconds<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.540> means<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.900> each

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
last 30 seconds so that means that each

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.340 
last 30 seconds so that means that each
time<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:08.390> ok<00:01:09.390> could<00:01:09.720> one<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> wouldn't<00:01:10.290> do

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
time that ok could one I wouldn't do

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.770 
time that ok could one I wouldn't do
that<00:01:10.380> after<00:01:10.710> three<00:01:10.950> open<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> chance<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that after three open I have a chance to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020 
that after three open I have a chance to
have<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.140> again<00:01:13.439> or<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.040> another

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
have to get again or I can do another

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.970 
have to get again or I can do another
one

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:27.040 

so<00:01:19.610> one<00:01:19.940> in<00:01:20.060> four<00:01:23.470> maybe<00:01:24.470> not<00:01:25.750> all<00:01:26.750> right<00:01:26.900> well

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
so one in four maybe not all right well

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.010 
so one in four maybe not all right well
basically<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:28.700> effect<00:01:29.090> I've<00:01:29.360> ever<00:01:29.600> over<00:01:29.840> the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
basically that effect I've ever over the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.500 
basically that effect I've ever over the
duration<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.410> an<00:01:30.530> entire<00:01:30.890> fight<00:01:31.190> seems<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.330> lot

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
duration of an entire fight seems a lot

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.510 
duration of an entire fight seems a lot
more<00:01:32.540> beneficial<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.290> me<00:01:33.470> than<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.220> have<00:01:34.310> any

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
more beneficial to me than to have any

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.790 
more beneficial to me than to have any
18<00:01:35.000> seconds<00:01:35.480> every<00:01:35.930> two<00:01:36.110> minutes<00:01:36.410> over<00:01:36.710> an

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
18 seconds every two minutes over an

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.860 
18 seconds every two minutes over an
entire<00:01:36.890> fight<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.430> have<00:01:37.610> about<00:01:37.790> 40<00:01:38.270> seconds

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
entire fight you have about 40 seconds

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.310 
entire fight you have about 40 seconds
of<00:01:39.790> that<00:01:40.790> intensive<00:01:41.330> healing<00:01:41.630> for<00:01:41.810> an<00:01:41.990> entire

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
of that intensive healing for an entire

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.500 
of that intensive healing for an entire
fight<00:01:42.620> which<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:43.010> not<00:01:43.970> really<00:01:44.000> beneficial

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
fight which is not really beneficial

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.170 
fight which is not really beneficial
where<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:45.050> there<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.040> go<00:01:46.190> can<00:01:46.460> continuously

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
where this there you go can continuously

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.590 
where this there you go can continuously
prop<00:01:47.690> for<00:01:47.960> out<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.200> entire<00:01:48.470> fight<00:01:49.570> so<00:01:50.570> I

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
prop for out the entire fight so I

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.230 
prop for out the entire fight so I
believe<00:01:51.410> now<00:01:51.680> that<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:52.190> currently<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.850> lot

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
believe now that is currently a lot

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.160 
believe now that is currently a lot
better<00:01:54.760> so<00:01:55.760> obviously<00:01:56.090> let<00:01:56.780> me<00:01:56.870> know<00:01:56.960> what<00:01:57.080> you
