00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
to do it I hope I can do it first try

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.459 
to do it I hope I can do it first try
because<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.939> don't<00:02:06.420> really<00:02:06.780> know<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.049> there's<00:02:07.409> a

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
because I don't really know if there's a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.590 
because I don't really know if there's a
particular<00:02:07.860> timing

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
particular timing

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.220 
particular timing
okay<00:02:11.600> this<00:02:11.810> should<00:02:11.990> be<00:02:12.140> fine<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:13.510> now<00:02:14.510> you

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
okay this should be fine and now you

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.160 
okay this should be fine and now you
will<00:02:15.530> go<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.830> option<00:02:16.490> Sigma<00:02:17.090> nutriment<00:02:17.570> change

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
will go to option Sigma nutriment change

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.390 
will go to option Sigma nutriment change
routes<00:02:18.590> empty<00:02:19.250> slots<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.830> just<00:02:22.070> restart

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
routes empty slots and you just restart

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.540 
routes empty slots and you just restart
the<00:02:22.490> game<00:02:25.630> now<00:02:26.630> starting<00:02:27.350> game<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.860> hopefully

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
the game now starting game and hopefully

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.510 
the game now starting game and hopefully
it<00:02:29.150> will<00:02:29.390> work

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.630 

l<00:02:35.520> cage<00:02:35.820> worked<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:37.140> it's<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.740> bit<00:02:37.890> glitchy<00:02:38.100> at

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
l cage worked so it's a bit glitchy at

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.780 
l cage worked so it's a bit glitchy at
first<00:02:39.500> because<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.890> game<00:02:41.100> doesn't<00:02:41.400> know<00:02:41.640> if

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
first because the game doesn't know if

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.030 
first because the game doesn't know if
you're<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.330> first<00:02:43.050> room<00:02:43.350> or<00:02:43.620> not<00:02:45.920> that's<00:02:46.920> a

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
you're in the first room or not that's a

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.490 
you're in the first room or not that's a
bit<00:02:47.160> weird<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.580> don't<00:02:47.790> know<00:02:47.910> why<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.660> works<00:02:49.020> but

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
bit weird I don't know why it works but

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.480 
bit weird I don't know why it works but
it<00:02:50.250> works<00:02:50.600> also<00:02:51.600> as<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.710> can<00:02:52.740> see<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.400> will

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
it works also as you can see I will

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.590 
it works also as you can see I will
press<00:02:54.000> our<00:02:54.810> TN<00:02:55.200> all<00:02:55.380> T<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.580> actually<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.210> can

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
press our TN all T and it actually I can

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.550 
press our TN all T and it actually I can
I<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:58.440> change<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:59.420> this<00:03:00.420> side<00:03:00.720> even<00:03:01.320> if<00:03:01.440> I

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
I can change the this side even if I

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.450 
I can change the this side even if I

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.510 
memory camps that's another - I don't
know<00:03:05.870> but<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.080> kind<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.410> fun<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.890> also<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.250> can

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
know but it's kind of fun and also I can

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520 
know but it's kind of fun and also I can
move<00:03:08.700> during<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.120> cutscene<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.870> could<00:03:10.050> say<00:03:10.260> I

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
move during the cutscene you could say I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.040 
move during the cutscene you could say I
jump<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.100> come<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.520> Champaign<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.810> makes

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
jump and come to Champaign and it makes

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.980 
jump and come to Champaign and it makes
the<00:03:13.260> rotation<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.220> glitchy<00:03:14.460> as<00:03:14.700> well<00:03:17.960> so<00:03:18.960> I

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
the rotation of the glitchy as well so I

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.320 
the rotation of the glitchy as well so I
really<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:20.160> don't<00:03:20.250> really<00:03:20.700> know<00:03:20.880> how<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.300> works

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
really I don't really know how it works

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.060 
really I don't really know how it works
or<00:03:21.960> anything<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.220> can<00:03:23.880> try<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.500> start<00:03:25.500> no<00:03:26.040> I

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
or anything but I can try to start no I

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.810 
or anything but I can try to start no I
can't<00:03:26.520> reach<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:27.200> there's<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.290> way<00:03:28.500> okay<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:29.490> can

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
can't reach it there's a way okay I can

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.590 
can't reach it there's a way okay I can
reach<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:32.330> okay<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:33.390> now<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:34.920> have<00:03:35.130> to

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
reach it okay so now you just have to

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
reach it okay so now you just have to
beat<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.780> game<00:03:36.930> as<00:03:37.170> usual<00:03:38.930> this<00:03:39.930> was<00:03:40.290> on<00:03:40.440> the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
beat the game as usual this was on the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:51.130 
beat the game as usual this was on the
right<00:03:40.770> side

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.220 

and<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:52.010> will<00:03:52.190> see<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.520> the<00:03:52.760> N<00:03:52.880> is<00:03:53.120> not<00:03:54.050> being

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
and you will see that the N is not being

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.560 
and you will see that the N is not being
shit'll<00:03:54.740> you<00:03:55.010> just<00:03:55.340> don't<00:03:55.820> you<00:03:56.150> just<00:03:56.360> don't

see that's really weird and I really
didn't<00:06:52.580> think<00:06:52.670> that<00:06:52.970> would<00:06:53.180> do<00:06:53.420> something

didn't think that would do something
like<00:06:54.020> this<00:06:55.390> so<00:06:56.390> I<00:06:56.420> think<00:06:56.810> that's<00:06:56.960> a<00:06:57.050> good

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.500 
like this so I think that's a good
