animation and this footage is being

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.969 
animation and this footage is being
played<00:01:57.119> at<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> slow<00:01:57.659> setting<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.710> let's<00:01:58.890> look

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
played at the slow setting so let's look

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:07.880 
played at the slow setting so let's look
at<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> fast<00:01:59.520> mode<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.360> how<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.630> performs

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:19.059 

ah

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.000 

it's<00:02:20.069> really<00:02:20.310> fast<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.330> smooth<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.800> only

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
it's really fast and smooth the only

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.589 
it's really fast and smooth the only
issue<00:02:23.280> with<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.640> graphics<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
issue with the graphics is that the

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.690 
issue with the graphics is that the
fighters<00:02:24.959> look<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.349> same<00:02:25.620> which<00:02:26.340> makes<00:02:26.580> it

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
fighters look the same which makes it

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.820 
fighters look the same which makes it
feel<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> bit<00:02:27.330> like<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.510> shell<00:02:27.840> game<00:02:28.080> as<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.650> try

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
feel a bit like a shell game as you try

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.020 
feel a bit like a shell game as you try
to<00:02:28.890> keep<00:02:29.040> track<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.340> which<00:02:29.550> guy<00:02:29.790> you're
