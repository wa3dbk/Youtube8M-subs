00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.000
 yes 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.620
 hello how about youtube friends like this 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.940
 greets you at 90's with 1 video 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.800
 friends this time we're going to talk a 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.920
 little about what the conference was 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.840
 of Jesus in which they launched the new 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.630
 this that even though he had thousands and 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.150
 thousands of names in this long wait at 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.529
 final was called xbox one as you 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.610
 they could see the conference they did not see it 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.860
 the download the description of the link for 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.110
 that they can check it out and they can see it 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.790
 not everything that was presented in 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.300
 that conference we see what is the new 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.340
 ex which underwent a complete redesign and 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.830
 apart in its hardware it was also 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.990
 completely designed was presented what 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.970
 which is the console on the kinect sensor or 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.800
 the new kinect sensor and the new 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.450
 control in fact let's go a little more 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.640
 near the console on the console between 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.770
 the great changes that incorporated the 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.950
 of those who spoke was now good 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.070
 a 500GB hard drive also now 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.809
 processing of eight cores 8 gb 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.970
 ram and good finally counting with 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.210
 a blu-ray player apart from 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.820
 usb ports 3.0 hdmi input and output 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.009
 and an optimization in what is the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.929
 wifi system and wireless connection 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.280
 of this xbox with respect to what the sensor 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.070
 good kinect was improved with 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.409
 1080p camera at 30 frames per second 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.180
 and apart from what the sensors are 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.920
 sensitivity and other things optimized 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.390
 quite and in control we can see that 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.729
 we now have an integrated battery 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.920
 part of a redesign that apparently 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.409
 It can be a bit more ergonomic though 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.060
 the buttons the trigger sticks and others 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.200
 remained in the same position I think 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.729
 it's very good to leave in which the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.590
 control so honestly I would not have 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.670
 liked such a radical change in the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.440
 conference was also shown a bit 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.270
 about the interface has not improved 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.520
 much the xbox interface which now 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.229
 is going to be a kind of multitasking I think that 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.000
 he was not as focused as as 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.050
 the videogame console but it's going to 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.820
 be a complete system of 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.250
 entertainment in which they are already going to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.659
 incorporate separate television a little more 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.759
 of interaction with what is video 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.190
 multitasking and fully integrated 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.259
 skype which we will be able and redo and 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.340
 receive video calls by this means and 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.110
 when the developers playing 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.350
 they could fall behind they turned up 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.110
 with a new graphic engine and they showed 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.660
 some games like for example fifa 14 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.330
 maiden a game of the ufc and also the 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.769
 of nba what good the graphic engine the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.870
 truth is incredible that part yes I 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.240
 he liked it very much although good only 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.100
 show a pure cinematic did not show 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.510
 of real game we have new work 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.740
 force that the truth looks very good but 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.170
 Well now we go with what I liked and 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.990
 I did not like the conference I liked it 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.000
 that showed the truth enough things 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.100
 they showed the console as such we have 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.900
 they gave the characteristics that the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.550
 that is the hardware a hoop that I do not 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.840
 liked it a lot was that they did not do some 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.820
 time and I would have liked to see the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.710
 console in action to see the potential 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.560
 that has not since what what showing 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.390
 only kinematics and if the textures 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.980
 they are very good the particles are 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.350
 incredible but remember that it is 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.120
 they're just kinematics, it's not nothing 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.800
 running on it with just did not show 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.290
 nothing running a console anymore that was 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.410
 what was the graphical interface of the xbox 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.880
 not some novels movies and so on 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.590
 which at the end of accounts for the user 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.880
 final is not interested so much but good 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.770
 remember that they have to leave a 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.930
 little for what is the e3 the conference 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.000
 of games that already comes and is at 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.580
 around the corner and that's where good ya 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.710
 playstation that also yesterday 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.300
 showed a little bit to make your console that 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.480
 the truth was very blurred maybe see 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.190
 absolutely nothing this I already think that they go 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.420
 to show and everything will take us all 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.150
 they had to keep something obviously 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.099
 the two big companies 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.390
 for this this conference that is going to 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.459
 be very important of video games 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.959
 obviously here the beneficiary is going to be 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.329
 he knows in the end now we between 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.610
 more competition between companies and more 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.470
 strive to be able to achieve a better 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.239
 product is better for the end user 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.430
 We do not talk anything about the cost 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.079
 I would have liked them to mention and 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.670
 they did not give us an exact date of 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.980
 launch but good friends let's hope 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.019
 soon to have those consoles already in the 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.939
 I'm not going to go personally 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.799
 for xbox since that's where I always play 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.329
 but the precision the truth for is 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.489
 also an excellent control and we are going to 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.709
 see how they are going to give you for you in 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.120
 this new three euros but what we do 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.230
 all this was evidence is like to leave 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.389
 a comment on the part below 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.739
 see how you thought of clicking the button 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.959
 I like it and they are declared options 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.040
 that go in the part down here 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.660
 will miss much point to touch on this 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.100
 video so I'm going to make a 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.870
 livestream later if you are 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.810
 watching this video today on Tuesday 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.130
 woe if I'll do it after 7 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.139
 8 at night so that you the 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.940
 pending and we can discuss a little 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.280
 About good specifications others 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.320
 get a little more full share 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.090
 information like I'm going to practice a 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.889
 little more with you is code are 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.330
 pending to the channel social networks 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.530
 to be able to kiss from stream 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.490
 and see you later I hope that I have 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.490
