00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
doubled in size now what I do is I kind

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.690 
doubled in size now what I do is I kind
of<00:02:00.860> fold<00:02:01.250> them<00:02:01.580> so<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:04.759> creates<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.540> smaller

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
of fold them so it creates a smaller

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:17.650 
of fold them so it creates a smaller
ball<00:02:08.110> before<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.310> put<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.459> on<00:02:10.610> here

piece<00:04:43.670> of<00:04:43.880> bread<00:04:44.230> but<00:04:45.230> I<00:04:45.730> really<00:04:46.730> like<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.240> make

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
piece of bread but I really like to make

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.550 
piece of bread but I really like to make
these<00:04:47.810> little<00:04:48.650> buns<00:04:49.010> because<00:04:49.670> it's<00:04:49.850> easier<00:04:50.560> to

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
these little buns because it's easier to

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.720 
these little buns because it's easier to
know<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:52.400> portion<00:04:53.530> usually<00:04:54.530> they<00:04:54.680> eat<00:04:54.710> one<00:04:55.400> or

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
know the portion usually they eat one or

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.530 
know the portion usually they eat one or
two<00:04:56.240> bones<00:04:56.600> with<00:04:57.460> dinner<00:04:58.460> or<00:04:58.610> lunch<00:04:58.970> or

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
two bones with dinner or lunch or

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.050 
two bones with dinner or lunch or
breakfast

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
breakfast

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.380

it's<00:05:02.060> amazing<00:05:02.990> hide<00:05:03.380> this<00:05:03.770> because<00:05:04.250> it's<00:05:05.180> not

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
it's amazing hide this because it's not

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.510 
it's amazing hide this because it's not
full<00:05:06.170> of<00:05:06.350> chemicals<00:05:07.180> fills<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.420> up<00:05:08.770> on<00:05:09.770> the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
full of chemicals fills you up on the

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.940 
full of chemicals fills you up on the
beginning<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.450> ate<00:05:11.720> more<00:05:12.050> of<00:05:12.230> them<00:05:12.410> because<00:05:12.620> I

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
beginning I ate more of them because I

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.070 
beginning I ate more of them because I
couldn't<00:05:13.400> get<00:05:13.670> enough<00:05:13.970> of<00:05:14.180> it<00:05:14.360> but<00:05:15.230> later<00:05:16.190> on<00:05:16.340> I

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
couldn't get enough of it but later on I

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.930 
couldn't get enough of it but later on I
noticed<00:05:18.080> that<00:05:18.260> a<00:05:18.290> lot<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:18.710> times<00:05:19.070> all<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.490> need

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
noticed that a lot of times all I need

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:32.350 
noticed that a lot of times all I need
is<00:05:20.210> one<00:05:22.419> and<00:05:23.419> I'm<00:05:23.690> really<00:05:23.960> happy<00:05:24.230> about<00:05:24.380> that

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.670 

I<00:05:37.180> just<00:05:38.180> have<00:05:38.389> to<00:05:38.509> come<00:05:38.780> on<00:05:38.900> and<00:05:39.110> press<00:05:39.379> it<00:05:39.590> a

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
I just have to come on and press it a

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.740 
I just have to come on and press it a
little<00:05:39.889> bit<00:05:40.039> because<00:05:40.189> otherwise<00:05:40.610> they<00:05:41.060> roll

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
little bit because otherwise they roll

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:54.469 
little bit because otherwise they roll
down

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.510 

okay<00:05:55.479> and<00:05:55.750> now<00:05:55.960> comes<00:05:56.259> the<00:05:56.410> last<00:05:56.830> thing<00:05:57.310> before

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.390 
it goes to the oven I have this little
scissor<00:06:00.669> which<00:06:01.360> is<00:06:01.569> dedicated<00:06:01.900> to<00:06:02.470> my<00:06:03.039> bread

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
scissor which is dedicated to my bread

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.960 
scissor which is dedicated to my bread
making<00:06:03.910> so<00:06:04.569> I<00:06:04.810> just<00:06:05.289> caught<00:06:05.770> a<00:06:06.099> Lulu

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
making so I just caught a Lulu

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.100 
making so I just caught a Lulu
actually<00:06:07.930> I<00:06:07.960> like<00:06:08.259> to<00:06:08.470> cut<00:06:08.680> two<00:06:09.009> or<00:06:09.039> three

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
actually I like to cut two or three

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:19.260 
actually I like to cut two or three
little<00:06:11.110> thing<00:06:11.860> on<00:06:12.099> the<00:06:12.130> top<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:17.940> I<00:06:18.940> try<00:06:19.240> that

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
little thing on the top and I try that

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.600 
little thing on the top and I try that
with<00:06:19.630> knife<00:06:19.900> but<00:06:20.319> it<00:06:20.440> took<00:06:20.620> me<00:06:20.830> so<00:06:21.069> long<00:06:21.099> that<00:06:21.580> I

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
with knife but it took me so long that I

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.730 
with knife but it took me so long that I
decide<00:06:22.180> that<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.509> little<00:06:22.780> scissor<00:06:23.050> really<00:06:23.560> is

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
decide that the little scissor really is

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.520 
decide that the little scissor really is
the<00:06:23.949> best<00:06:24.190> way<00:06:24.490> to<00:06:24.520> do<00:06:24.880> it<00:06:25.090> so<00:06:26.080> I<00:06:26.110> dedicated

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
the best way to do it so I dedicated

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.879 
the best way to do it so I dedicated
this<00:06:27.340> little<00:06:27.729> scissor<00:06:28.470> just<00:06:29.470> doing<00:06:30.009> this<00:06:30.780> and

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
this little scissor just doing this and

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.040 
this little scissor just doing this and
now<00:06:32.889> I<00:06:32.919> believe<00:06:33.190> it<00:06:33.490> or<00:06:33.669> not<00:06:33.940> they<00:06:34.539> are<00:06:34.570> ready

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
now I believe it or not they are ready

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
now I believe it or not they are ready
to<00:06:35.259> go<00:06:35.410> to<00:06:35.470> the<00:06:35.770> oven<00:06:36.150> doesn't<00:06:37.150> that<00:06:37.300> look<00:06:37.509> good

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070
