00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
so let's do memory card and then you can

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.300 
so let's do memory card and then you can
actually<00:01:50.090> move<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.049> DCIM<00:01:52.770> folder<00:01:52.799> in

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
actually move it to the DCIM folder in

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.929 
actually move it to the DCIM folder in
here<00:01:53.600> move<00:01:54.600> here<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:56.009> moved<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.430> 3<00:01:56.640> items
