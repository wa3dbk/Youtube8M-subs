00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello markus here from markus fotos.de 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.580
 Nikon has a new camera this night 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.919
 presented and not as of 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.929
 many expect a d400 or something 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.929
 something similar but one 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.780
 successor to the idea 800 very 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.010
 successful camera and now urges 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.750
 a bit of the suspicion is on 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.240
 that's just as a little update as 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 at the d 600 on the idea 610 or 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.820
 there is more behind it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.369
 and I would like that with you now 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.680
 looking together dollar is falling 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.570
 that there are no two versions of hd 810 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.640
 Gave you remembered the g 8 100 was there 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.649
 also in addition an e version the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.329
 then no low pass filter had this 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.309
 distinction does not exist with the 810 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.800
 More is not trading at every 810 pm 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.850
 a camera without the low pass filter there 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.739
 you obviously have quite good 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.899
 Experiences made with both the d 800 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.980
 as well as with various consumer cameras 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.930
 which also on this filter 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.190
 renounce 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.739
 only very briefly for those who do not 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.590
 know this low pass filter should the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.449
 effects that is patterned shirts 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.170
 For example, effects streak 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.640
 avoid 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.980
 obviously you have a lot 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.390
 less problems than expected and if 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.369
 it sometimes happens something like that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.320
 also by software rules like the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.939
 predecessor also has the idea 810 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.680
 36.3 megapixel I myself am not 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.780
 great representative or great supporter 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.729
 from all too much megapixel that you know 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.860
 but if you imagine for 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.360
 which area nikon the idea 800 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.909
 originally conceived times 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.619
 for the studio and professional 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.360
 photography in this area the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.520
 maybe otherwise to medium format 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.990
 then tends to make the many megapixels 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.540
 because then I have the possibility 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.790
 from a photo eg a catalog page like that 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.500
 to shape that once I model 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.880
 in the whole picture but at the same time 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.710
 from this all foto also the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.740
 Detailed shots of good and a bag 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.869
 etc I then a little smaller on the edge 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.850
 so place the many megapixels 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.619
 so a bit useful for all 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.899
 those who are not exactly those now 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.380
 Making a kind of photography is natural 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.210
 the many megapixels consumed with it 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.680
 megabytes on memory cards and computers 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.030
 and 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.860
 the processing speed in the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.680
 little change in the course of the area 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.050
 nikon has also reacted here and has one 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.090
 big format introduced being that there 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.860
 because for small this is the advantage 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.210
 that one benefits from the reformator 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.430
 walter can use for example 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.760
 lossless white balance et cetera he 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.870
 knows the prejudices you have there 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.120
 but at the same time you have a little bit too 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.650
 Savings on the megabyte you get 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.420
 just a lot more photos on one 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.209
 card for all those who want to 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.280
 example nikon d 814 photography 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.090
 this is certainly a good one to use 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.709
 message 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.080
 before also for me actually 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.480
 The most interesting ones will come for a very short time 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.650
 said it works then expeed 4 processor 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.390
 in the camera and also the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.190
 Production speed is easy 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.300
 improved to seven now 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.790
 pictures per second 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.850
 The autofocus system is available from the G4s 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.640
 This has 51 autofocus fields 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.830
 and 15 of them cared for type autofocus 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.540
 Fields I find particularly interesting 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.239
 what happened in the iso area is here 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.480
 would you expect to pay like iso 100 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.090
 to eg 128000 but just in the bottom 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.280
 area is doing the exceptionally something 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.570
 because in this chamber is the lower 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.010
 iso range now indicated with 64 to 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.090
 128000 and that is very interesting the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.680
 question is this is just one 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.239
 marketing gag or did you do that? 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.720
 to know about comparability 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.250
 increase 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.470
 this will be the first measurements 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.540
 show I am very curious what the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.549
 Market out makes the advanced iso 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.290
 price of course also indicated namely 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.970
 with 32 to 512 thousand iso so 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.709
 incredible values ​​on the spot too 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.120
 but already the edges of the part too 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.590
 already from the previous model 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.870
 I also find the new interesting 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.549
 display nikon has indeed with the predecessor 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.320
 the de 800 very much beat for it 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.769
 because of problems with 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.470
 color pencils gave here is new that now 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.820
 nikon the display as a rgbw display 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.640
 indicating that means there is a fourth 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.190
 color apparently white bright leds to it 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.709
 which should improve the contrast a bit 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.019
 In addition to that you probably the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.940
 affect the color balance of the display 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.110
 could that mean if you can do that 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.459
 feel you have a display with 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.410
 a color cast you can do that 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.109
 correct interesting will be there 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.120
 whether manufacturers such as data coal or 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.250
 similar 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.510
 just one year of calibration device 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.310
 Maybe bring this to market 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.470
 then we really allowed the display 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.540
 our camera on our display on the 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.680
 desk to adapt so you can 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.699
 at least if you do not vacate 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.380
 photographed a certain 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.840
 color fastness between the two devices 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.070
 Out there in the outdoors 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.389
 the sun will of course continue 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.040
 his problems will continue 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.930
 somehow a small group or otherwise 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.520
 need to use or display 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.810
 hud have to use orderly 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.610
 to be able to provide that will believe 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.440
 I do not synonymous with the new display 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.090
 significantly improve in too 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.060
 Video area has done what the new 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.240
 d 810 support how are you nfp and 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.090
 Although not around 25 or 30 pictures here 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.770
 mode but now in the 50 or 60 pictures 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.789
 Mode fall from you the video technology 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.650
 not quite so fit 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.010
 that means that he is now at full 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.449
 hd easy times can do after 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.340
 with a word certainly also 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.650
 interesting a headphone output or 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.690
 microphone input, of course, continue 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.760
 while the HDMI-port which you heard of 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.110
 emerged knew two small 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.660
 there are certainly points of criticism as well 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.979
 to name a few 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.260
 Network capability idea is in the D 810 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.419
 Although available for both the 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.650
 Wired ethernet support 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.240
 as well as for wifi 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.370
 however, that does not mean that 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.169
 both on board is for both cases 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.270
 you need an additional adapter 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.650
 to be able to do the whole thing afterwards, I 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.470
 find a camera in this 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.240
 price segment would have at least wlan 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.979
 as standard on board wlan 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.930
 chips really cost no more money and 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.940
 in the consumer cameras one sees yes 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.349
 also that it is obviously hassle-free 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.210
 possible is that I would have me 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.630
 wanted at least wlan here too 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.220
 to have 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.860
 I personally do not need it that much 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.010
 but it makes perfect sense nowadays 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.389
 to have something like that in the cameras 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.160
 Almost a perennial for Nikon 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.449
 my second point of criticism is the two 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.010
 slots Although one has 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.080
 decided again two cards closed 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.849
 to incorporate what is possible then you have 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.620
 with yes not repeatable 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.300
 events like weddings or 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.070
 somehow elaborate shootings the 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.960
 possibility to work with two cards 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.430
 and so always have a backup only 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.440
 unfortunately one has also gone here 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.660
 opt for a cf card slot and one 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.430
 sd card slot 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.230
 let that mean that we as 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.360
 Photographer in two different media 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.890
 have to carry what just 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.810
 So annoying is why can you 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.030
 Do not unify slot decide it 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.200
 Now sd cards or his cf cards is 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.180
 actually do not care 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.800
 It is often brought into the field that 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.720
 cf cards are more robust that is 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.070
 certainly a piece was far but also 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.630
 sd cards are not exactly like that 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.370
 insanely sensitive how to get that 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.890
 always imagine and there are just 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.930
 also special version we something 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.820
 more robust than the normal that we 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.900
 now here from the hardware store or from the 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.520
 electronics market 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.830
 I already have facebook this morning 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.840
 boasted shortly before the camera and no 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.420
 spectator is not the name anymore 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.860
 familiar topsy has boasted that he 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.510
 that with the two cards not so 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.660
 bad because he just says 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.940
 I'll just take the cf card tray for him 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.680
 my main for the main card the 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.140
 This is particularly robust 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.180
 reliable and the sd card is in 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.670
 Only a backup card in it 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.870
 for the worst case and so it is 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.850
 then not too bad 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.110
 to have two different ones too 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.950
 is a point the piece far 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.900
 can understand 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.970
 here below the video you can find 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.410
 now two more videos that you 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.880
 can look very interesting drives 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.320
 One with the mouse over it will be there 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.720
 also indicated what this is about me 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.940
 would like to know from you what you think 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.220
 you of the d 810 would you be her 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.960
 what are you missing what would be 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.850
 you like to see things differently as I said 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.590
 Your opinion in the comments I am pleased 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.300
 me to discuss this with you 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.650
 Thank you for watching and we 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.800
 See you in the next video until then 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.800
 bye
