00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.460
You may get a nice and neat nail care at 
a nail shop, but the price is quite high.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.460
Trying them yourself may be bothersome

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.000
and may not done neatly.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.580
Regarding these weaknesses,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.680
a product has become a hot potato 
that allows you to decorate your nails

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.680
by just pressing like a stamp.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.760
Reporter O Jihye has more.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.440
When you try to draw pictures on your nails,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.680
it may not turn out as as you think 
and it takes up too much time.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.000
But this product decorates your nails 
with splendid patterns

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.820
by stamping on them.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.200
Put some manicure on a board with 
a variety of images and push them out.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.900
Then stamp it on your nails to 
cover them with the same patterns.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.120
You can apply various kinds of patterns delicately,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.600
and it only takes three to five minutes to dry them.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.940
The manufacture company focused on 
minimizing toxins within the product,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
thinking that the nails are just as delicate as skin.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.380
Generally, nail polish products have

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.100
chemical substance that 
prevents them from spreading.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.940
And the substance is poisonous.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.440
But our product excluded any kind of toxins,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.100
yet non-spreadable.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.840
Before local nail art industry was formed,
this company was established in 2002.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.120
It started the business targeting the global markets.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.980
Although nail art industry was already 
very widely popular in many foreign countries,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.780
the company succeeded in catching 
their eyes with this whole new idea.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.880
When we participated in the exhibition in L.A, 
all our products were sold out just in two days.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.720
A girl came to our booth

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.260
and asked if we could give her the product
we were using for promotion.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.340
That was the last one to demonstrate with,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.180
but we considered her our future customer, and 
gave her the last one. We had to wrap up after that.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.420
Ten years have passed since the company was 
established, but it’s more popular in foreign countries.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.380
The product is being sold at around 
2,000 stores in 120 countries now.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.480
Especially, regardless of the analysis that export 
isn’t very favorable in the second half year,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.920
it’s likely that the company will achieve 
the ten-million-dollar goal of this year.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.620
