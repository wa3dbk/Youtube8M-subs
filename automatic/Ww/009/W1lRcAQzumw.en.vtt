blending it in through the corner here
with<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.839> part<00:00:40.080> is<00:00:40.199> I'm<00:00:40.470> gonna<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.769> the<00:00:40.860> same

on the back and both sides alright so
now<00:00:51.900> what<00:00:51.989> I'm<00:00:52.110> doing<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.680> combing

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
now what I'm doing here is I'm combing

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:54.920 
now what I'm doing here is I'm combing
everything<00:00:53.549> down<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.299> side<00:00:54.510> here

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
everything down to this one side here

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.930 
everything down to this one side here
and<00:00:55.049> I'm<00:00:55.710> working<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.250> scissor<00:00:56.640> over<00:00:56.760> comb

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
and I'm working in scissor over comb

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.329 
and I'm working in scissor over comb
here<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.659> to<00:00:57.750> blend<00:00:58.019> in<00:00:58.229> the<00:00:58.769> sides<00:00:59.040> in

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
here just to blend in the sides in

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.299 
here just to blend in the sides in
through<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> top<00:00:59.970> and<00:01:00.229> again<00:01:01.229> like<00:01:01.860> with<00:01:02.010> most

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
through the top and again like with most

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.500 
through the top and again like with most
guys<00:01:02.489> they<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.909> it<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> little<00:01:03.150> bit<00:01:03.269> longer

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
guys they have it a little bit longer

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.969 
guys they have it a little bit longer
right<00:01:03.659> through<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.799> we're<00:01:04.890> going

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
right through here so what we're going

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.469 
right through here so what we're going
to<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.549> bring<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.000> all<00:01:06.240> down

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to do is just really bring this all down

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.170 
to do is just really bring this all down
to<00:01:07.049> where<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.770> has<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> nice<00:01:08.369> blend<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:09.060> in

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
to where this has a nice blend going in

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.450 
to where this has a nice blend going in
from<00:01:09.360> shorter<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.900> longer<00:01:10.100> right<00:01:11.100> into<00:01:11.370> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
from shorter to longer right into the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.210 
from shorter to longer right into the
top<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.150> we're<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.990> ideally<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
top so we're going to ideally have the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.460 
top so we're going to ideally have the
top<00:01:14.570> back<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.750> through<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.050> I'd<00:01:16.170> say<00:01:16.350> about

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
top back in through here I'd say about

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.830 
top back in through here I'd say about
an<00:01:16.710> inch<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.880> length<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:18.300> an<00:01:18.420> inch<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> half

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
an inch in length to an inch and a half

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.620 
an inch in length to an inch and a half
the<00:01:19.200> most<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> let's<00:01:20.640> continue<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:21.270> work<00:01:21.450> this

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the most so let's continue to work this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.480 
the most so let's continue to work this
in<00:01:21.840> blend<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.230> in<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:22.650> then<00:01:23.040> once<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.370> get

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
in blend this in and then once we get

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.880 
in blend this in and then once we get
into<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.820> area<00:01:24.090> we'll<00:01:24.690> start<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> extend<00:01:25.740> our

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
into this area we'll start to extend our

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.740 
into this area we'll start to extend our
comb<00:01:26.100> upwards<00:01:26.550> like<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.910> so<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.630> can

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
comb upwards like this so that we can

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.570 
comb upwards like this so that we can
give<00:01:27.930> ourselves<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.410> head<00:01:28.560> start<00:01:28.830> as<00:01:29.010> far<00:01:29.430> as

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
give ourselves a head start as far as

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.060 
give ourselves a head start as far as
the<00:01:29.760> actual<00:01:30.030> length<00:01:30.900> going<00:01:31.620> in<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the actual length going in from the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.860 
the actual length going in from the
corners<00:01:32.520> into<00:01:32.730> the<00:01:32.850> top<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.480> right<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.750> now

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
corners into the top all right so now

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.020 
corners into the top all right so now
the<00:01:33.930> sides<00:01:34.260> are<00:01:34.500> done<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.890> what<00:01:35.790> we're<00:01:35.909> going

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the sides are done and what we're going

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.740 
the sides are done and what we're going
to<00:01:36.060> now<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.540> work<00:01:37.170> our<00:01:37.409> way<00:01:37.620> in<00:01:37.860> from<00:01:38.630> going<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
to now is work our way in from going to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.770 
to now is work our way in from going to
the<00:01:39.840> top<00:01:40.080> in<00:01:40.320> through<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:42.210> back<00:01:42.390> into<00:01:42.690> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the top in through the the back into the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.630 
the top in through the the back into the
top<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.070> we're<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> pick

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
top so here we are we're going to pick

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.980 
top so here we are we're going to pick
up<00:01:44.760> we<00:01:44.909> left<00:01:45.090> off<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.420> back<00:01:45.600> here<00:01:45.870> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
up we left off in the back here and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.660 
up we left off in the back here and
we're<00:01:46.650> going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.830> just<00:01:46.980> basically<00:01:47.100> cut

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
we're going to just basically cut

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.030 
we're going to just basically cut
everything<00:01:47.909> towards<00:01:48.360> about<00:01:48.600> an<00:01:48.750> inch<00:01:49.040> in

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
everything towards about an inch in

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.040 
everything towards about an inch in
through<00:01:50.280> here<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.700> again<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.600> blended<00:01:51.960> this

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
through here and again we blended this

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.290 
through here and again we blended this
in<00:01:52.229> going<00:01:52.409> scissor<00:01:52.680> over<00:01:52.740> comb<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.340> go<00:01:53.850> shorter

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
in going scissor over comb to go shorter

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.210 
in going scissor over comb to go shorter
to<00:01:54.420> longer<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.900> now<00:01:55.470> what<00:01:55.650> we're<00:01:55.770> doing<00:01:55.800> is

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
to longer and now what we're doing is

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.190 
to longer and now what we're doing is
we're<00:01:56.430> cutting<00:01:56.580> towards<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.479> face<00:01:57.690> this<00:01:57.990> way

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
we're cutting towards the face this way

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.320 
we're cutting towards the face this way
alright<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> once<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.150> have<00:02:00.300> that

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
alright and once we have that

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.390 
alright and once we have that
established<00:02:01.020> once<00:02:01.620> we<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.890> connection

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
established once we have that connection

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.670 
established once we have that connection
then<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.510> go<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.780> through<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.229> top<00:02:04.409> here

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
then we can go in through the top here

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.010 
then we can go in through the top here
like<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.400> we<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.270> then<00:02:06.540> hold

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
like this and we can then hold

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.830 
like this and we can then hold
everything<00:02:07.470> straight<00:02:08.220> up<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.879> let's<00:02:09.209> start

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
everything straight up so let's start

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.240 
everything straight up so let's start
here<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.110> corner<00:02:10.409> and<00:02:10.590> then<00:02:11.039> we're<00:02:11.129> going

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
here in the corner and then we're going

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.530 
here in the corner and then we're going
to<00:02:11.310> bring<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.610> straight<00:02:11.730> up<00:02:11.909> like<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.180> and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
to bring it straight up like this and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.240 
to bring it straight up like this and
we're<00:02:13.049> going<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.230> cut<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.770> where<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.069> about

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
we're going to cut to where it's about

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.120 
we're going to cut to where it's about
an<00:02:15.000> inch<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.569> length<00:02:16.290> throughout<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> top

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
an inch in length throughout the top

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.190 
an inch in length throughout the top
here<00:02:17.430> let's<00:02:18.060> continue<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.480> work<00:02:18.660> all<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.050> way

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
here let's continue to work all the way

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.830 
here let's continue to work all the way
towards<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.650> front<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.160> head<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.580> this

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
towards the front of the head like this

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.449 
towards the front of the head like this
following<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.050> same<00:02:22.260> pattern<00:02:22.680> using<00:02:23.310> our

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
following the same pattern using our

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.660 
following the same pattern using our
guide<00:02:23.700> from<00:02:24.060> what<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:24.989> previously<00:02:25.920> cut<00:02:26.400> and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
guide from what we previously cut and

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.630 
guide from what we previously cut and
we're<00:02:27.569> going<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.810> leave<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.319> hair<00:02:28.560> about<00:02:29.489> an

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
we're going to leave the hair about an

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.619 
we're going to leave the hair about an
inch<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.970> an<00:02:30.150> inch-and-a-half

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
inch to an inch-and-a-half

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.270 
inch to an inch-and-a-half
and<00:02:30.870> length<00:02:31.319> through<00:02:31.530> here<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:31.950> then<00:02:32.099> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and length through here and then to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.699 
and length through here and then to
about<00:02:32.519> I'd<00:02:32.819> say<00:02:33.090> 2<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.959> 2<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.140> half<00:02:34.319> inches<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
about I'd say 2 to 2 and half inches the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.309 
about I'd say 2 to 2 and half inches the
most<00:02:34.970> into<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> very<00:02:36.300> very<00:02:36.450> front<00:02:36.660> all<00:02:37.140> right

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
most into the very very front all right

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.630 
most into the very very front all right
so<00:02:37.470> let's<00:02:37.620> work<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.040> very<00:02:38.250> very<00:02:38.370> front

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
so let's work in the very very front

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.520 
so let's work in the very very front
here<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.090> what<00:02:39.780> we're<00:02:39.900> going<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.050> do<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.380> we're

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
here and what we're going to do is we're

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.550 
here and what we're going to do is we're
actually<00:02:40.590> going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.900> just<00:02:42.900> cut<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.230> front<00:02:43.440> a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
actually going to just cut the front a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.370 
actually going to just cut the front a
little<00:02:43.800> bit<00:02:44.069> shorter<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:45.720> right<00:02:45.930> into<00:02:46.080> here

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
little bit shorter just right into here

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.780 
little bit shorter just right into here
because<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.739> little<00:02:47.010> bit<00:02:47.099> too<00:02:47.250> long<00:02:47.459> so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
because it's a little bit too long so

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.289 
because it's a little bit too long so
we're<00:02:48.720> I'd<00:02:49.230> say<00:02:49.470> it's<00:02:49.590> about<00:02:49.849> two<00:02:50.849> inches<00:02:51.150> or

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
we're I'd say it's about two inches or

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.970 
we're I'd say it's about two inches or
so<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.780> length<00:02:52.730> just<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:53.880> that<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.860> then<00:02:55.860> we

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
so in length just like that and then we

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.059 
so in length just like that and then we
can<00:02:56.010> brush<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.519> up<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.890> there<00:02:58.890> we

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
can brush this up like this and there we

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.720 
can brush this up like this and there we
pretty<00:02:59.250> much<00:02:59.599> have<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:01.410> look<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.160> what<00:03:02.640> I'm

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
pretty much have the look so what I'm

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.030 
pretty much have the look so what I'm
going<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:02.970> do<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.329> I'm<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.480> going<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:04.040> dry

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
going to do is I'm just going to dry

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.860 
going to do is I'm just going to dry
this<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> little<00:03:05.610> bit<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.970> then<00:03:06.360> make<00:03:06.510> any<00:03:06.660> sort

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
this a little bit and then make any sort

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.839 
this a little bit and then make any sort
of<00:03:06.930> finishing<00:03:07.170> touches<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.739> need<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.069> to

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
of finishing touches that I need to to

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.650 
of finishing touches that I need to to
finish<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> style<00:03:09.510> here

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.420 

all<00:03:14.110> right<00:03:14.230> now<00:03:14.320> what<00:03:14.440> I'm<00:03:14.530> do<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.770> going<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.340> go

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
all right now what I'm do is going to go

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.920
