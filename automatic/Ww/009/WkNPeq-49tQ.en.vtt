assassin right here I dig into these
guys<00:00:31.060> there<00:00:32.060> are<00:00:32.090> two<00:00:32.450> of<00:00:32.480> them<00:00:32.660> by<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.290> way

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
guys there are two of them by the way

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.860 
guys there are two of them by the way
and<00:00:33.770> then<00:00:34.220> I<00:00:34.250> take<00:00:34.580> out<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.880> first<00:00:35.060> one<00:00:35.270> I<00:00:35.450> run

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
and then I take out the first one I run

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.920 
and then I take out the first one I run
in<00:00:36.020> there<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:36.200> like<00:00:36.470> and<00:00:37.250> he's<00:00:38.030> dead<00:00:38.240> so<00:00:38.900> I

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
in there and like and he's dead so I

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.640 
in there and like and he's dead so I
wait<00:00:39.200> my<00:00:39.440> vulnerabilities<00:00:40.400> on<00:00:40.960> so<00:00:41.960> I<00:00:42.260> let<00:00:42.560> my

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
wait my vulnerabilities on so I let my

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:50.370 
wait my vulnerabilities on so I let my
team<00:00:42.830> mate<00:00:43.010> drop<00:00:43.340> in<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:44.000> take<00:00:44.450> him<00:00:44.570> out<00:00:48.340> so<00:00:49.340> um

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
team mate drop in and take him out so um

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.920 
team mate drop in and take him out so um

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
just right-click it either way you get

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.069 
just right-click it either way you get
the<00:01:03.590> super<00:01:03.920> power<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:05.030> super<00:01:05.390> power<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:05.720> get

the super power the super power you get

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.459 
the super power the super power you get
is<00:01:06.320> super<00:01:07.100> strengths<00:01:07.579> for<00:01:07.909> 1.5<00:01:08.630> seconds<00:01:09.200> and

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
is super strengths for 1.5 seconds and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.380 
is super strengths for 1.5 seconds and
you<00:01:10.429> get<00:01:11.229> vulnerability<00:01:12.229> for<00:01:12.259> four<00:01:12.649> seconds

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
you get vulnerability for four seconds

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.599 
you get vulnerability for four seconds
the<00:01:14.390> strength<00:01:14.749> is<00:01:14.990> great<00:01:15.380> one<00:01:15.890> hit<00:01:16.100> kills<00:01:16.340> if

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
the strength is great one hit kills if

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.550 
the strength is great one hit kills if
you<00:01:16.640> have<00:01:16.880> a<00:01:16.909> stone<00:01:17.179> sword<00:01:17.420> or<00:01:17.659> up<00:01:17.780> it's

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
you have a stone sword or up it's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.539 
you have a stone sword or up it's
amazing<00:01:19.630> but<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.899> vulnerability<00:01:21.740> makes<00:01:22.369> you

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
amazing but the vulnerability makes you

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.969 
amazing but the vulnerability makes you
a<00:01:22.609> one<00:01:22.819> hit<00:01:22.999> kill<00:01:23.030> from<00:01:23.630> stone<00:01:24.259> swords<00:01:24.710> are<00:01:24.859> up

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
a one hit kill from stone swords are up

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.130 
a one hit kill from stone swords are up
so<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:26.240> got<00:01:26.359> to<00:01:26.479> be<00:01:26.539> careful<00:01:26.689> with<00:01:26.990> the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
so you got to be careful with the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.080 
so you got to be careful with the
vulnerability<00:01:27.859> part<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.429> it<00:01:28.609> also<00:01:28.789> works

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
vulnerability part and it also works

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.660 
vulnerability part and it also works
great<00:01:29.240> for<00:01:29.450> charging<00:01:29.990> people<00:01:30.340> if<00:01:31.340> people

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
great for charging people if people

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.219 
great for charging people if people
decide<00:01:31.789> to<00:01:32.090> charge<00:01:32.299> you<00:01:32.600> or<00:01:32.630> take<00:01:32.899> you<00:01:32.960> off

decide to charge you or take you off
guard<00:01:33.259> in<00:01:33.679> any<00:01:33.859> way<00:01:34.069> you<00:01:34.880> place<00:01:35.119> it<00:01:35.270> down<00:01:35.420> and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
guard in any way you place it down and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.090 
guard in any way you place it down and
you're<00:01:35.929> quick<00:01:36.139> enough<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.439> can<00:01:36.770> take<00:01:36.979> them

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
you're quick enough you can take them

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.730 
you're quick enough you can take them
out<00:01:37.280> every<00:01:37.429> time<00:01:37.780> another<00:01:38.780> situation<00:01:39.289> where

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
out every time another situation where

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.889 
out every time another situation where
is<00:01:40.159> where<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:40.909> enemy<00:01:41.240> catches<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.719> off<00:01:41.869> guard

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
is where the enemy catches you off guard

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.779 
is where the enemy catches you off guard
you're<00:01:42.499> trying<00:01:42.770> your<00:01:42.920> near<00:01:43.159> inventory<00:01:43.639> or

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
you're trying your near inventory or

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.249 
you're trying your near inventory or
something<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:44.299> you're<00:01:44.389> building<00:01:44.899> up<00:01:44.990> and

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
something and you're building up and

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.219 
something and you're building up and
they<00:01:45.619> start<00:01:45.859> hitting<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.689> you<00:01:47.689> just<00:01:47.899> place<00:01:48.200> it

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
they start hitting you you just place it

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.800 
they start hitting you you just place it
on<00:01:48.469> down<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:48.979> get<00:01:49.219> the<00:01:49.369> kill<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.759> that<00:01:49.819> is

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
on down and get the kill and that is

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.410 
on down and get the kill and that is
definitely<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.799> best<00:01:51.920> way<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.219> use<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.759> now

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
definitely the best way to use that now

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.609 
definitely the best way to use that now
