 Good folks if you have a smartphone 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.740
 that has one has otg support just for you 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:18.779
 that you can play the real racing game with 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.869
 control and even play 21 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.609
 control here at home and it is not 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:33.390
 usb as everyone knows but here is the 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:40.640
 ac adapter on a cable protect 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.640
 let's open the real racing here 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.560
 remembering that I do not install any 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:07.970
 app to eat recognized the control 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:11.540
 is the same active system recognized however 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:16.220
 are directional here as acceleration and 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:22.250
 braking and the auto sr only controls 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:25.360
 here in directional here it 's pretty cool 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.360
 get to play cool 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.090
 but the first here here in 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.649
 settings in control here 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:51.740
 Here the slope is normally 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:54.819
 and placed on that rolling aac that 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.819
 it worked cool 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.490
 my people 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.490
 and know the directional 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.680
 takes you to get the sensitivity of the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.129
 analogue here but after you pick 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.129
 it's over 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:56.459
 A lot of people already know but the tip is 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.920
 if you have a control used in play 2 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.410
 there an adapter 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:07.880
 I do not believe you buy a 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:12.110
 control in parallel there already. 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.110
 will recognize the note 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.750
 that's it folks 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.750
 thanks
