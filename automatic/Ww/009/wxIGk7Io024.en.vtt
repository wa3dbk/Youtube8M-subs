00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
a good price it's actually one of the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.359 
a good price it's actually one of the
cheapest<00:00:15.750> UV<00:00:16.440> filters<00:00:16.830> I'm<00:00:17.010> zooming<00:00:17.250> around

cheapest UV filters I'm zooming around

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.179 
cheapest UV filters I'm zooming around
which<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.760> why<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> bought<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:19.160> because<00:00:20.160> of

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
which is why I bought it and because of

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.640 
which is why I bought it and because of
that<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.900> doesn't<00:00:21.900> necessarily<00:00:22.470> have<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that it doesn't necessarily have the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.640 
that it doesn't necessarily have the
best<00:00:22.980> quality<00:00:23.660> like<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.900> doesn't<00:00:25.260> lose

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
best quality like it doesn't lose

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.380 
best quality like it doesn't lose
quality<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.400> doesn't<00:00:26.730> affect<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.119> image

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
quality it just doesn't affect the image

right now which has the UV filter half
covering<00:00:49.800> blends<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.760> wasn't<00:00:51.030> attached<00:00:51.300> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
was just holding in front then you can

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.160 
was just holding in front then you can
kind<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.910> see<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.239> difference<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.079> can

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
kind of see the difference as you can

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.830 
kind of see the difference as you can
see<00:00:55.410> there's<00:00:55.680> not<00:00:55.890> very<00:00:55.920> much<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> in

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
see there's not very much at all so in

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.959 
see there's not very much at all so in
the<00:00:57.989> second<00:00:58.440> shot<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.160> pointed<00:00:59.789> my

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the second shot I actually pointed my

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.479 
the second shot I actually pointed my
lens<00:01:00.239> directly<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> light<00:01:01.739> source<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.340> an

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
lens directly at a light source like an

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.299 
lens directly at a light source like an
idiot<00:01:02.789> which<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.080> right<00:01:04.439> now<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.860> screen

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
idiot which it is right now on screen

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
idiot which it is right now on screen
but<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:06.510> light<00:01:06.750> source<00:01:07.020> was<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> little

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
but this light source was a little

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410 
but this light source was a little
differently<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.159> rijal<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.850> wasn't<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
differently and rijal I wasn't going to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.390 
differently and rijal I wasn't going to
put<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> noticed<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:11.280> is

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
put this but then I noticed there is

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.060 
put this but then I noticed there is
some<00:01:11.580> lens<00:01:11.820> flare<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.080> decided<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.710> put<00:01:13.979> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
some lens flare so I decided to put it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.800 
some lens flare so I decided to put it
in<00:01:14.220> now<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> difference<00:01:15.630> with

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
in now you can see the difference with

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.870 
in now you can see the difference with
and<00:01:16.020> without<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.130> shot<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.549> didn't

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and without it for this shot I didn't

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.030 
and without it for this shot I didn't
really<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.119> used<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.930> hold<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.619> filtering

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
really see used to hold the filtering

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.830 
really see used to hold the filtering
from<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> ones<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.909> kind<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> half<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
from the ones and kind of do a half a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.530 
from the ones and kind of do a half a
shot<00:01:21.869> ok<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:23.189> filter<00:01:23.549> also<00:01:23.759> comes<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
shot ok so the filter also comes with a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.530 
shot ok so the filter also comes with a
60<00:01:25.200> 2<00:01:25.439> millimeter<00:01:25.979> adapting<00:01:26.549> which<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.119> what's

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
60 2 millimeter adapting which is what's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.270 
60 2 millimeter adapting which is what's
actually<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.080> box<00:01:28.409> right<00:01:28.619> now<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> make<00:01:29.130> it

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
actually in box right now to make it

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.590 
actually in box right now to make it
look<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
look like it's the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
look like it's the
answer<00:01:30.900> right<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> film's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
answer right now I have the film's

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
answer right now I have the film's
