 premiumweg protein again 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.170
 Extra portion of glutamine is added 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.800

 fresh banana and stracciatella my 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.750
 favorite is chocolate nougat or 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.010
 strawberry vanilla 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.649
 But of course that's a matter of taste 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.079
 the composition is per 100 grams 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:00.230
 82 grams of protein 55 grams of carbohydrates 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:03.260
 45 grams of fat and 67 grams of amin

 concentrate and 20 clouds protein isolate 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.390
 What is exemplary with this product 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.180
 this is the indication on the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.189
 label has the most 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.060
 Manufacturers only write one here 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.729
 mixture 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.320
 the exact information how many clouds 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.520
 protein isolate now in the product 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:32.729

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:37.829
 not taking the right 30 gram 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.590
 from the powder with 300 milliliters of water 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.799
 mix and this right after training

 Take it immediately after training 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.310

 quick carbohydrate like maltodextrin 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.740

 to absorb proteins over the food 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.159
 a multi-component protein 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.430
 how the weiter protein 80plus better 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:20.049
 suitable because it has longer reaction times
