00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
calories per serving sighs I believe it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.230 
calories per serving sighs I believe it
is<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.770> that's<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> syrup<00:01:29.939> alone

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
is and that's just from the syrup alone

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.940 
is and that's just from the syrup alone
and<00:01:30.540> that's<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.930> importance<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> syrup

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and that's the importance of the syrup

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.910 
and that's the importance of the syrup
strictly<00:01:32.460> minerals<00:01:33.390> vitamins<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.350> calories
