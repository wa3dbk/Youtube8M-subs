00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.529

rings and pretty much just dodging

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.100 
rings and pretty much just dodging
anything<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.219> gets<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.520> your<00:00:35.640> way

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
see I try not to hit objects it'll slow

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.660 
see I try not to hit objects it'll slow
you<00:01:27.780> down

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.520 

plus<00:01:31.270> if<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:31.570> don't<00:01:31.780> have<00:01:31.900> anything<00:01:32.140> they<00:01:32.410> can

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
plus if you don't have anything they can

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.010 
plus if you don't have anything they can
get<00:01:32.650> an<00:01:32.710> achievement<00:01:32.770> for<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
get an achievement for it and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.480 
get an achievement for it and
achievements<00:01:35.530> are<00:01:35.620> always<00:01:35.830> good<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:39.100> least<00:01:39.310> in

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
achievements are always good at least in

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:52.660 
achievements are always good at least in
my<00:01:39.640> opinion<00:01:39.700> there

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.730 

so<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.240> remembered<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.720> had<00:01:54.080> any<00:01:54.230> dummies<00:01:54.620> that

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
so I remembered a had any dummies that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.810 
so I remembered a had any dummies that
you<00:01:54.860> see<00:01:55.060> they'll<00:01:56.060> give<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.510> more<00:01:56.720> time<00:01:56.930> to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
you see they'll give you more time to

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:07.030 
you see they'll give you more time to
reach<00:01:58.820> your<00:01:59.000> next<00:01:59.150> start

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.190 

and<00:02:07.790> then<00:02:07.970> Ram<00:02:08.240> anybody<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:08.840> gets<00:02:08.930> in<00:02:09.080> your

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
and then Ram anybody that gets in your

00:02:09.200 --> 00:03:07.459 
and then Ram anybody that gets in your
way

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:07.469 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.300 

yeah<00:03:08.469> I<00:03:08.500> really<00:03:08.829> set<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.159> blender<00:03:09.549> loops<00:03:09.760> I

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
yeah I really set the blender loops I

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.410 
yeah I really set the blender loops I
can<00:03:12.310> never<00:03:12.459> seem<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.760> go<00:03:13.090> through<00:03:13.269> them

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
can never seem to go through them

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.920 
can never seem to go through them
properly<00:03:14.370> whatever<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:16.329> is<00:03:16.540> your<00:03:16.719> actual

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
properly whatever this is your actual

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.039 
properly whatever this is your actual
match<00:03:17.290> now<00:03:17.939> and<00:03:18.939> it's<00:03:19.150> basically<00:03:19.659> the<00:03:20.019> same

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
match now and it's basically the same

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.190 
match now and it's basically the same
thing<00:03:20.620> as<00:03:20.769> practice<00:03:21.420> just<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.599> different<00:03:23.019> path

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
thing as practice just a different path

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.610 
thing as practice just a different path
and<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:24.010> more<00:03:24.700> aggressive<00:03:24.939> opponent

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.940 

but<00:03:31.620> it's<00:03:31.799> it's<00:03:32.040> actually<00:03:32.189> pretty<00:03:32.670> easy<00:03:33.950> as

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
but it's it's actually pretty easy as

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:52.190 
but it's it's actually pretty easy as
well<00:03:35.280> as<00:03:35.430> pretty<00:03:35.760> fun

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.540 

Edge's<00:03:52.950> remember<00:03:53.340> try<00:03:53.730> not<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.000> hit<00:03:54.120> anything

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
Edge's remember try not to hit anything

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.809 
Edge's remember try not to hit anything
beside<00:03:56.550> your<00:03:56.730> opponent<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.650> yeah<00:03:58.819> otherwise

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
beside your opponent and yeah otherwise

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.910 
beside your opponent and yeah otherwise
it<00:03:59.970> will<00:04:00.030> slow<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:00.300> down

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.460 

and<00:04:06.010> you'll<00:04:06.640> get<00:04:06.819> a<00:04:06.880> little<00:04:07.630> save<00:04:07.959> points

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
and you'll get a little save points

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.330 
and you'll get a little save points
throughout<00:04:09.250> them<00:04:09.840> throughout<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:10.989> game<00:04:11.340> or

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
throughout them throughout the game or

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.790 
throughout them throughout the game or
throughout<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.760> Quidditch<00:04:13.060> match<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:14.140> in

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
throughout the Quidditch match the in

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.830 
throughout the Quidditch match the in
case<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.190> fail<00:04:15.400> then<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.359> can<00:04:16.450> just<00:04:16.630> start

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
case you fail then you can just start

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:36.570 
case you fail then you can just start
like<00:04:17.739> halfway<00:04:18.010> through<00:04:18.340> or<00:04:18.459> something

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.950 

you<00:04:37.060> don't<00:04:37.240> really<00:04:37.360> have<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.660> worry<00:04:37.870> about

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
you don't really have to worry about

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.370 
you don't really have to worry about
missing<00:04:38.350> one<00:04:38.620> missing<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.370> star<00:04:39.640> it<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.900> games

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
missing one missing a star it the games

00:04:41.380 --> 00:05:31.320 
missing one missing a star it the games
pretty<00:04:41.620> forgiving

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.650 

see<00:05:31.810> as<00:05:31.930> you<00:05:32.080> can<00:05:32.169> see<00:05:32.319> I<00:05:32.349> missed<00:05:32.560> one<00:05:33.150> but<00:05:34.150> I'm

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
see as you can see I missed one but I'm

00:05:34.660 --> 00:06:23.850 
see as you can see I missed one but I'm
still<00:05:35.080> doing<00:05:35.199> pretty<00:05:35.470> good

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.100 

so<00:06:24.860> yeah<00:06:25.100> once<00:06:25.310> you<00:06:25.370> catch<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.790> snitch<00:06:26.000> you<00:06:26.060> um

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.550
