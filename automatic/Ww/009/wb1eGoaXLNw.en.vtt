you<00:00:11.880> with<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.360> cube<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.320> sphere<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.790> at<00:00:15.000> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
you with a cube and sphere so at the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.320 
you with a cube and sphere so at the
sphere<00:00:15.570> whatever<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.560> want<00:00:16.880> let's<00:00:17.880> say<00:00:18.060> echo

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
wanted you could put an indent in the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.389 
wanted you could put an indent in the
cube<00:00:30.230> say<00:00:31.730> you<00:00:32.730> know<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:33.090> dip<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.250> sphere<00:00:35.250> in

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
cube say you know just dip the sphere in

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.619 
cube say you know just dip the sphere in
here<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.829> have<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> dent<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.730> cube<00:00:39.000> oh<00:00:39.210> well

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
here and have a dent in the cube oh well

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.569 
here and have a dent in the cube oh well
that's<00:00:40.260> exactly<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.890> we're<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.430> do

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
that's exactly what we're going to do

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.270 
that's exactly what we're going to do
fraps<00:00:42.260> hi<00:00:43.260> right<00:00:45.050> first<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.590> might<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
fraps hi right first you might want to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.869 
fraps hi right first you might want to
select<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.059> sphere<00:00:48.360> first<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.879> go

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
select the sphere first like this and go

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.130 
select the sphere first like this and go
into<00:00:51.030> editing<00:00:51.510> f9<00:00:52.910> ok<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.270> shift<00:00:54.809> right

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
into editing f9 ok and then shift right

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
into editing f9 ok and then shift right
click<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> cube<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.120> okay<00:00:58.160> so

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
click on the cube like this okay so

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.810 
click on the cube like this okay so
without<00:01:00.149> any<00:01:00.210> other<00:01:00.719> delays<00:01:01.170> first<00:01:02.039> w<00:01:02.520> while

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
without any other delays first w while

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.250 
without any other delays first w while
the<00:01:03.000> cursor<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.650> window<00:01:05.040> okay<00:01:05.990> w<00:01:06.990> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the cursor is in this window okay w and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.440 
the cursor is in this window okay w and
adds<00:01:07.500> difference<00:01:08.220> modifier<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:10.100> apply<00:01:11.100> now

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
adds difference modifier and apply now

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.130 
adds difference modifier and apply now
you<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.630> remove<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.229> cube<00:01:13.500> actually<00:01:14.689> now<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
you can remove the cube actually now you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.499 
you can remove the cube actually now you
might<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> keep<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.830> cube<00:01:17.360> remove<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
might want to keep the cube remove the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
might want to keep the cube remove the
sphere<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.130> like<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.490> later<00:01:21.650> it's<00:01:22.650> there

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
sphere and like just later it's there

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.039 
sphere and like just later it's there
okay<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.229> intent<00:01:26.930> kind<00:01:27.930> of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
okay so you have your intent kind of

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.520 
okay so you have your intent kind of
thing<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.409> don't<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.229> punched<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.350> hole

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
thing I don't know so we punched a hole

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.740 
thing I don't know so we punched a hole
right<00:01:31.770> through<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.400> almost<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.420> one

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
right through it almost so this is one

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.090 
right through it almost so this is one
of<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.990> operations<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.829> know<00:01:37.979> remember<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
of the operations you know remember I

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.810 
of the operations you know remember I
think<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.490> was<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.700> sixth<00:01:42.329> grade<00:01:42.750> algebra

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
think that was the sixth grade algebra

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.399 
think that was the sixth grade algebra
with<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.030> operations<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.020> boolean

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
with the operations the boolean

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.590 
with the operations the boolean
operations<00:01:47.070> Union<00:01:47.820> intersect<00:01:48.329> and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
operations Union intersect and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.319 
operations Union intersect and
difference<00:01:49.110> well<00:01:50.100> i'm<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.880> union

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
difference well i'm going to do union

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.819 
difference well i'm going to do union
now<00:01:52.159> okay<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.220> apply<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.630> delete<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
now okay so apply and you can delete the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.880 
now okay so apply and you can delete the
sphere<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.430> course<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.329> won't<00:01:57.509> do<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.890> because

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
sphere of course I won't do this because

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.970 
sphere of course I won't do this because
I<00:01:59.130> still<00:01:59.369> need<00:01:59.579> it<00:02:00.259> okay<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.320> now<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.590> have

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
I still need it okay so now you have

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.140 
I still need it okay so now you have
the<00:02:03.980> same<00:02:04.220> thing<00:02:04.250> in<00:02:04.580> here<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.060> it's<00:02:05.780> no

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
the same thing in here and it's no

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.340 
the same thing in here and it's no
molten<00:02:08.150> together<00:02:09.640> like<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.240> so<00:02:11.960> if<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.170> want

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
molten together like so so if you want

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.160 
molten together like so so if you want
to<00:02:12.380> subserve<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:13.220> won't<00:02:13.430> get<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:14.480> sphere<00:02:14.840> and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
to subserve you won't get the sphere and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.410 
to subserve you won't get the sphere and
the<00:02:15.230> cube<00:02:15.500> you'll<00:02:16.250> get<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.520> freak<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.240> nature

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
the cube you'll get a freak of nature

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:25.300 
the cube you'll get a freak of nature
like<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:21.490> nice<00:02:22.490> cones<00:02:23.200> nice<00:02:24.310> well

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
like this a nice cones nice well

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.730 
like this a nice cones nice well
actually<00:02:25.430> that's<00:02:26.030> not<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:27.140> nice<00:02:27.380> because

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
actually that's not that nice because

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.700 
actually that's not that nice because
the<00:02:28.430> mesh<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:29.350> subdivided<00:02:30.350> like<00:02:30.860> hell<00:02:31.460> yeah<00:02:32.710> so

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
the mesh is subdivided like hell yeah so

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.380 
the mesh is subdivided like hell yeah so
you<00:02:34.160> know<00:02:34.250> just<00:02:34.490> forget<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:35.060> again<00:02:35.840> and

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
you know just forget this again and

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.180 
you know just forget this again and
we'll<00:02:38.390> talk<00:02:38.540> about<00:02:38.690> intersect<00:02:39.500> ok<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:43.100> again

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
we'll talk about intersect ok so again

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.630 
we'll talk about intersect ok so again
we<00:02:43.400> have<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.550> sphere<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.600> cube<00:02:44.990> and

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
we have the sphere and the cube and

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.840 
we have the sphere and the cube and
we'll<00:02:46.640> go<00:02:46.790> with<00:02:46.940> intersect<00:02:47.540> ok<00:02:47.860> w<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.100> add<00:02:49.370> in

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
we'll go with intersect ok w and add in

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.840 
we'll go with intersect ok w and add in
two<00:02:49.970> sec<00:02:50.150> modifier<00:02:50.570> this<00:02:51.440> just<00:02:51.830> gives<00:02:52.610> you

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
two sec modifier this just gives you

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.230 
two sec modifier this just gives you
where<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.870> two<00:02:54.110> meshes<00:02:54.440> intersect<00:02:55.280> just<00:02:55.970> like

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
where the two meshes intersect just like

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.050 
where the two meshes intersect just like
in<00:02:56.470> in<00:02:57.470> algebra<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.340> think<00:02:59.380> so<00:03:00.380> apply<00:03:01.060> remove

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
in in algebra I think so apply remove

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.100 
in in algebra I think so apply remove
the<00:03:02.350> sphere<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.360> exact

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
the sphere and you have the exact

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.350 
the sphere and you have the exact
portion<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.430> meshes<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.930> yo<00:03:09.380> interlace

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
portion of the meshes that yo interlace

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.590 
portion of the meshes that yo interlace
so<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.420> speak<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:13.270> it's<00:03:14.270> nice<00:03:14.480> ok<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:15.500> can<00:03:15.680> use

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
so to speak so it's nice ok you can use

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.320 
so to speak so it's nice ok you can use
the<00:03:17.600> boolean<00:03:17.989> operations<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:18.980> 3d<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.730> find<00:03:20.180> it

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
the boolean operations in 3d I find it

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.470 
the boolean operations in 3d I find it
very<00:03:20.360> nice<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.220> that's<00:03:22.220> about<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.520> so<00:03:23.150> you

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
very nice and that's about it so you

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.390 
very nice and that's about it so you
know<00:03:23.620> just<00:03:24.620> don't<00:03:25.870> go<00:03:26.870> all<00:03:27.080> nuts<00:03:27.350> when<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:28.190> got

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
know just don't go all nuts when you got

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.920 
know just don't go all nuts when you got
you've<00:03:28.670> got<00:03:28.910> too<00:03:29.420> many<00:03:29.570> vertices<00:03:29.989> see<00:03:30.860> ya
