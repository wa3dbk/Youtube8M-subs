00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.410

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.929
 In Kazan now I will go to court and I wanted 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.350
 would you show what I'm going today 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.730
 respectively, the next outfit of the day 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.480
 so as you can see here 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.010
 so here 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:31.710
 up long enough dress below the knee 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.530
 I adore this length if it was still 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.690
 longer for example for caviar for example I would 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.170
 Generally squeal but it is yes enough 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:47.070
 concise and quite intelligent 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.770
 business cotton is real 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.210
 organic cotton with a little 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.079
 adding polyester but percent 2 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.039
 there is everything and for changing is not critical 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.850
 the uniqueness that I don't like about him 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.000
 This is the composition of this top top here. 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.689
 because it is with us frank 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.890
 polyester and I don't like it very much 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.770
 I love all the same natural fabric but myself 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:22.500
 the style of the dress and the model itself is crazy to me 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 like means but here 's how 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.729

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.439
 tight but long respectively 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.750

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.600

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.979
