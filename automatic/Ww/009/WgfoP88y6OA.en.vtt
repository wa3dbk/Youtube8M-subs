 official twitter accounts too 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.940

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.930
 subscribed here on youtube we have several 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.839
 channels in which you can 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.810
 subscribe look this Friday this 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:27.269
 Friday on March 20 we have a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.159
 eclipse an eclipse that in some parts 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.499
 of the world will be total in other parts 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:33.510
 it will be partial to be an incredible event 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:36.930
 but the strangest thing is that also that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.019
 same day we have a super moon one 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.640
 super moon that good to the left side 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.500
 you can see what the moon looks like 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.539
 normally the full moon and next 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.449
 right you can see how you're going to see that 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.089
 day is going to see let's say bigger but 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.480
 On the same day we also have a 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.579
 equinox in the spring equinox 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.949
 Look how curious that events like 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.230
 the eclipses were seen as evil 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.940
 augury but the events of the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.739
 spring equinoxes looked like 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.450
 something good luck then good 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.659
 we are tables we are neutral 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.630
 is the thing is true that the event 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.090
 this is not to say a single if it occurs 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.729
 every time in fact the next 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.560
 Once these 13 events are given at the same time 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.689
 most of us who are 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.390
 here those of us who are watching these videos 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.500
 we will be quite old will be until 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.619
 2050 and 3 and then it will be until 2000 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.049
 76 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.909
 let's say it takes a long time for 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.860
 this event is given so enjoy it 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.079
 especially those in Spain 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.349
 who are in europe in asia in africa 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:44.409
 they will be able to see this phenomenon 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:46.000
 partially those who live in america to 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.740
 look good we're not going to see anything of 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.750
 this we can only see the super 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.060
 moon we can enjoy the equinox 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.310
 of spring that by the way in america 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.929
 especially in what is north mexico 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.439
 united states and canada we are living 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.869
 on the east side side a lot of heat and 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.729
 west side we are living a cold weather 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.739
 in fact, look, we're in March and it's 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.220
 incredible that another one still brings a 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:10.989
 jacket is not normal 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.470
 we are also internal as a 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.730
 child phenomenon 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.190
 with those that I'm going to 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.190
 talk more in detail what is 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.290
 important to know is that eclipses or 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.120
 the eclipse that you are going to be 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.820
 witnesses about all the friends that we 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.590
 they are watching in Spain what they will be able to 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.890
 see at different times depending on 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.920
 What part of Spain are I already living 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.220
 I will be sharing as I want in 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.960
 more detail information of all this 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.330
 event that same day that same day 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.820
 we will even try to make a video in 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.770
 I live so we can connect by 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.580
 at least by stamp by the application of 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.260
 stamp to see good if there is a some 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.209
 kind of phenomenon many times the 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.800
 strange phenomena in the sky appear 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.110
 when there is an eclipse that's why I say 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.030
 which is interesting so be aware 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.490
 that day and see if we get something 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.460
 interesting is also important 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.790
 tell them that 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.150
 if they have images that they want to share 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.640
 right here on the green route because what 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.710
 do they do us well and whether the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.410
 share by facebook or twitter 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.660
 by one of our networks would be very 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.940
 interesting to do something more interactive 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.550
