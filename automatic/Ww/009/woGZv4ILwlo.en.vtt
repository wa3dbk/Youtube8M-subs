into the ground and owned its territory

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.210 
into the ground and owned its territory
so<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:07.020> glad<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.409> gonna<00:02:07.500> be<00:02:07.649> black<00:02:07.799> ops<00:02:08.039> 3

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
so I'm glad it's gonna be black ops 3

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.559 
so I'm glad it's gonna be black ops 3
because<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:08.759> such<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> credible<00:02:09.360> game

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
because it's just such a credible game

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.809

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
and I really don't think it's possible

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.839 
and I really don't think it's possible
to<00:02:12.090> mess<00:02:12.360> up

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849

a blue to be perfect when they played it
a<00:05:07.740> little<00:05:08.040> bit<00:05:08.220> early<00:05:08.750> however<00:05:09.750> next<00:05:10.530> thing

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
a little bit early however next thing

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
there's just so much sway that's on the

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.159 
there's just so much sway that's on the
game<00:05:13.800> but<00:05:14.460> I'm<00:05:14.970> sure<00:05:15.180> they<00:05:15.720> don't<00:05:15.780> we<00:05:16.050> won't

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
game but I'm sure they don't we won't

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.050 
game but I'm sure they don't we won't
have<00:05:16.290> to<00:05:16.410> deal<00:05:16.560> with<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.830> again<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:17.850> look<00:05:17.940> up

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.380 
good assumption as to what black ops 3
might<00:05:22.560> be<00:05:22.740> if<00:05:23.490> there's<00:05:23.729> no<00:05:23.820> vertical<00:05:24.210> jump

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
might be if there's no vertical jump
