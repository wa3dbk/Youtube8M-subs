out like this but you know and then it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.539 
out like this but you know and then it
goes<00:01:49.700> right<00:01:49.849> back<00:01:49.999> into<00:01:50.450> what<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.840> want

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
goes right back into what I want

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.219 
goes right back into what I want
so<00:01:53.169> since<00:01:54.169> I'm<00:01:54.709> going<00:01:55.099> out<00:01:55.279> for<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:55.999> night<00:01:56.229> I'm

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
so since I'm going out for the night I'm

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.469 
so since I'm going out for the night I'm
actually<00:01:57.649> going<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.069> use<00:01:58.130> some<00:01:58.969> hairspray<00:01:59.209> to

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
actually going to use some hairspray to

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.199 
actually going to use some hairspray to
to<00:01:59.869> hold<00:02:00.049> this<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:00.380> place<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.639> guess<00:02:01.999> I'm

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
to hold this in place so I guess I'm

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.659
