00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.100 
specific reason to play that way it was
just<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> harmonica<00:02:25.940> made<00:02:26.210> sense<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.960> me

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
just that the harmonica made sense to me

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.340 
just that the harmonica made sense to me
laid<00:02:27.980> out<00:02:28.220> with<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.360> low<00:02:29.510> notes<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.140> right

this way around

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.520 
this way around
William<00:02:43.610> Clark<00:02:43.790> played<00:02:44.330> exactly<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.320> same

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
William Clark played exactly the same

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.800 
William Clark played exactly the same
way<00:02:45.710> low<00:02:46.010> notes<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.460> right<00:02:46.640> as<00:02:46.910> did<00:02:47.570> Sonny

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
way low notes to the right as did Sonny

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.950 
way low notes to the right as did Sonny
Terry<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.440> as<00:02:48.560> did<00:02:49.070> Paul<00:02:49.970> Butterfield<00:02:50.210> so<00:02:50.750> all

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
Terry and as did Paul Butterfield so all

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.160 
Terry and as did Paul Butterfield so all
fantastic<00:02:51.470> players<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.630> suspect

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
fantastic players and that I suspect

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.170 
fantastic players and that I suspect
that<00:02:54.290> they<00:02:54.710> came<00:02:55.130> across<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.550> in<00:02:55.640> exactly<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
that they came across it in exactly the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.490 
that they came across it in exactly the
same<00:02:56.210> way<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.780> did<00:02:57.020> that<00:02:57.170> they<00:02:57.290> just

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
same way that I did that they just

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.170 
same way that I did that they just
played<00:02:57.710> that<00:02:57.920> way<00:02:58.130> around<00:02:58.430> from<00:02:58.700> from<00:02:59.090> the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
played that way around from from the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.060 
played that way around from from the
beginning<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.600> might<00:02:59.780> be<00:02:59.930> wrong<00:03:00.110> but<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:00.560> don't

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
beginning I might be wrong but I don't

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.680 
beginning I might be wrong but I don't
suppose<00:03:01.340> they<00:03:01.520> were<00:03:01.610> having<00:03:01.850> lessons<00:03:02.090> or<00:03:02.540> so

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
suppose they were having lessons or so

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.550 
suppose they were having lessons or so
on

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
on

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.280 
on
so<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:05.180> right<00:03:05.390> way<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.840> hold<00:03:06.020> Bahama

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
so the the right way to hold Bahama

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.490 
so the the right way to hold Bahama
liquor<00:03:06.590> as<00:03:06.800> I<00:03:07.190> said<00:03:07.400> oh<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:08.390> right<00:03:08.660> way<00:03:08.900> is<00:03:09.200> in

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
liquor as I said oh the right way is in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.120 
liquor as I said oh the right way is in
your<00:03:09.650> left<00:03:09.830> hand<00:03:10.540> with<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:12.140> low<00:03:12.320> notes<00:03:12.620> to

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
your left hand with the low notes to

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.390 
your left hand with the low notes to
your<00:03:13.280> left<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.900> I'm<00:03:15.710> doing<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.100> exact

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
your left and I'm doing the exact

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.610 
your left and I'm doing the exact
opposite<00:03:16.820> I<00:03:17.030> think<00:03:17.510> that<00:03:17.630> that's<00:03:17.959> fine<00:03:18.350> I

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
opposite I think that that's fine I

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.790 
opposite I think that that's fine I
absolutely<00:03:19.190> wouldn't<00:03:19.880> advocate<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:21.260> copying

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
absolutely wouldn't advocate you copying

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.370 
absolutely wouldn't advocate you copying
me<00:03:21.920> if<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:22.820> already<00:03:22.970> play<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.570> right<00:03:23.750> way<00:03:23.810> so

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
me if you already play the right way so

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.920 
me if you already play the right way so
I<00:03:25.070> don't<00:03:25.790> think<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.120> gives<00:03:26.240> me<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.450> tonin

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
I don't think it gives me a tonin

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.660 
I don't think it gives me a tonin
advantage<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.709> don't<00:03:27.860> think<00:03:28.070> it<00:03:28.190> gives<00:03:28.280> me<00:03:28.430> any

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
advantage I don't think it gives me any

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.480 
advantage I don't think it gives me any

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
any sort of advantages in terms of

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.130 
any sort of advantages in terms of
playing<00:03:31.730> this<00:03:31.850> way<00:03:32.030> around<00:03:32.270> I<00:03:32.450> don't<00:03:32.870> do

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
playing this way around I don't do

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.170 
playing this way around I don't do
anything<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.920> harmonicas<00:03:34.520> I<00:03:34.730> don't<00:03:34.940> tend

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
anything to the harmonicas I don't tend

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.940 
anything to the harmonicas I don't tend
to<00:03:35.270> sort<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.600> work<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:36.020> my<00:03:36.170> heart's<00:03:36.530> very<00:03:36.770> much

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
to sort of work on my heart's very much

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.370 
to sort of work on my heart's very much
at<00:03:37.100> all<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:38.240> played<00:03:38.600> them<00:03:38.780> straight<00:03:39.080> out<00:03:39.230> the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
at all so I played them straight out the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.270 
at all so I played them straight out the
box<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.800> don't<00:03:40.060> change<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.740> cover<00:03:42.740> plates<00:03:43.070> or

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
box I don't change the cover plates or

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.880 
box I don't change the cover plates or
anything<00:03:43.459> like<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.790> it's<00:03:44.630> just<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:45.200> get<00:03:45.770> out

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
anything like that it's just I get out

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.040 
anything like that it's just I get out
of<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.100> box<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.820> turn<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.720> other<00:03:47.750> way

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
of the box and I turn it the other way

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.430 
of the box and I turn it the other way
around

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
around

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.940 
around
and<00:03:49.660> but<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:51.020> one<00:03:51.230> way<00:03:51.440> that<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:51.770> probably

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
and but the one way that you probably

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.800 
and but the one way that you probably
don't<00:03:52.370> want<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.820> hold<00:03:52.940> bahama<00:03:53.300> liquor<00:03:53.630> if<00:03:53.720> you

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
don't want to hold bahama liquor if you

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.460 
don't want to hold bahama liquor if you
can<00:03:53.959> avoid<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.530> is<00:03:55.520> where<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:57.050> whether

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
can avoid it is where you have whether

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.260 
can avoid it is where you have whether
it's<00:03:57.680> in<00:03:57.830> your<00:03:57.980> left<00:03:58.190> hand<00:03:58.370> or<00:03:59.060> your<00:03:59.090> right

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
it's in your left hand or your right

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.790 
it's in your left hand or your right
hand<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:01.040> have<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.520> low<00:04:01.820> notes

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.510 
sticking out away from the cup of your
hand<00:04:07.940> so<00:04:08.930> what<00:04:09.320> you<00:04:09.470> really<00:04:09.620> want<00:04:09.800> is<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.280> low

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
hand so what you really want is the low

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
where they come together and also where

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.090 
where they come together and also where
you<00:04:17.330> hold<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.750> mic<00:04:17.959> and<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.530> reason<00:04:18.890> for<00:04:19.040> that

you hold the mic and the reason for that

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.219 
you hold the mic and the reason for that
is<00:04:19.370> if<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.940> want<00:04:20.090> to<00:04:20.120> do<00:04:20.270> one<00:04:20.510> more<00:04:20.540> sounds

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.110 

it's<00:04:27.229> much<00:04:27.590> harder<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:28.009> do<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:28.280> if<00:04:28.669> you<00:04:28.910> have

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
it's much harder to do that if you have

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.340 
it's much harder to do that if you have
the<00:04:29.690> low<00:04:29.870> notes<00:04:30.169> here<00:04:31.160> away<00:04:32.030> from<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.690> cup

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
the low notes here away from the cup

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.450 
the low notes here away from the cup
it's<00:04:33.680> just<00:04:33.919> not<00:04:34.130> going<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.400> work<00:04:34.520> as<00:04:34.759> well<00:04:34.789> and

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
it's just not going to work as well and

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.620 
it's just not going to work as well and
similarly<00:04:37.460> when<00:04:37.759> you're<00:04:37.880> holding<00:04:38.120> a<00:04:38.330> bullet

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
similarly when you're holding a bullet

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.930 
similarly when you're holding a bullet
mic<00:04:38.810> or<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.110> microphone<00:04:39.470> if<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:40.310> low<00:04:40.460> notes<00:04:40.729> are

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
mic or a microphone if the low notes are

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.960 
mic or a microphone if the low notes are
out<00:04:41.060> here<00:04:41.419> you're<00:04:42.259> not<00:04:42.500> getting<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:43.430> chamber

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
out here you're not getting the chamber

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.790 
out here you're not getting the chamber
and<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.330> sound<00:04:44.630> is<00:04:44.870> going<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.139> be<00:04:45.229> thinner<00:04:45.560> and

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
and the sound is going to be thinner and

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.770 
and the sound is going to be thinner and
the<00:04:46.370> same<00:04:46.580> applies<00:04:46.940> if<00:04:47.180> you're<00:04:47.330> holding<00:04:47.600> it<00:04:47.690> in

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
the same applies if you're holding it in

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.150 
the same applies if you're holding it in
your<00:04:48.020> left<00:04:48.680> hand

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
your left hand

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.810 
your left hand
and<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:50.300> put<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:51.530> low<00:04:51.680> notes<00:04:51.979> out<00:04:52.310> here

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
and you put the low notes out here

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.120 
and you put the low notes out here
that's<00:04:53.630> pretty<00:04:53.990> much<00:04:54.229> the<00:04:54.470> only<00:04:54.500> thing<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:55.100> I

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
that's pretty much the only thing that I

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.640 
that's pretty much the only thing that I
would<00:04:55.430> avoid<00:04:55.699> by<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.300> wouldn't<00:04:56.870> copy<00:04:57.169> what<00:04:57.500> I'm

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
would avoid by I wouldn't copy what I'm

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.129 
would avoid by I wouldn't copy what I'm
doing<00:04:58.100> because<00:04:58.520> I<00:04:58.940> only<00:04:59.330> play<00:04:59.690> this<00:04:59.900> way

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
doing because I only play this way

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.439 
doing because I only play this way
because<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:00.979> harmonica<00:05:01.490> makes<00:05:01.729> sense<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.330> me

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
because the harmonica makes sense to me

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.510 
because the harmonica makes sense to me
laid<00:05:03.139> out<00:05:03.410> with<00:05:03.949> the<00:05:03.979> low<00:05:04.220> notes<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:05.090> my<00:05:05.300> right

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
laid out with the low notes to my right

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.670 
laid out with the low notes to my right
and<00:05:07.520> in<00:05:07.639> fact<00:05:07.850> when<00:05:08.539> I<00:05:08.570> look<00:05:08.660> at<00:05:08.900> a<00:05:08.930> piano<00:05:09.199> or

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680

and in fact when I look at a piano or

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
when I hear a piano it doesn't make

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.010 
when I hear a piano it doesn't make
sense<00:05:12.020> to<00:05:12.470> me<00:05:12.710> with<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.820> low<00:05:14.000> notes<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.900> my

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
sense to me with the low notes to my

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.950 
sense to me with the low notes to my
left<00:05:15.289> the<00:05:15.710> piano<00:05:16.070> sort<00:05:16.400> of<00:05:16.460> feels<00:05:17.150> funny<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.690> me

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
left the piano sort of feels funny to me

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.029 
left the piano sort of feels funny to me
not<00:05:18.440> on<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.740> pianist<00:05:19.160> but<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.770> feels

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
not on the pianist but the the it feels

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.800 
not on the pianist but the the it feels
like<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:22.940> keyboard<00:05:23.120> should<00:05:23.539> be<00:05:23.660> the

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
like the the keyboard should be the

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.040 
like the the keyboard should be the
other<00:05:23.900> way<00:05:24.020> around<00:05:24.139> so<00:05:24.530> I<00:05:24.710> think<00:05:24.979> it's<00:05:25.160> just<00:05:25.340> my

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
other way around so I think it's just my

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.439 
other way around so I think it's just my
mental<00:05:27.050> model<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.650> my<00:05:27.770> wiring<00:05:28.490> for<00:05:28.789> sound<00:05:29.060> is

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
mental model and my wiring for sound is

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.200 
mental model and my wiring for sound is
inverted<00:05:30.289> so<00:05:30.889> unless<00:05:31.340> you've<00:05:31.550> always<00:05:31.820> played

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
inverted so unless you've always played

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.110 
inverted so unless you've always played
that<00:05:32.270> way<00:05:32.919> with<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:34.039> low<00:05:34.190> notes<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.639> the<00:05:34.729> left

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
that way with the low notes to the left

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.779 
that way with the low notes to the left
definitely<00:05:35.840> don't<00:05:36.020> swap<00:05:36.430> so<00:05:37.430> I<00:05:37.460> hope<00:05:37.669> you

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
definitely don't swap so I hope you

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.100 
definitely don't swap so I hope you
found<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.150> useful<00:05:38.330> and<00:05:38.570> it's<00:05:38.750> cleared<00:05:38.960> up

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
found that useful and it's cleared up

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.149 
found that useful and it's cleared up
some<00:05:39.409> of<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:40.460> myths<00:05:40.669> or<00:05:41.030> or<00:05:41.710> whether<00:05:42.710> this

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
some of the myths or or whether this
