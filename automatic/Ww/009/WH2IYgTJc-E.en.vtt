the Panther has four individual

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.820 
the Panther has four individual
radiators<00:00:08.660> the<00:00:09.660> right-hand<00:00:10.469> side<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
radiators the right-hand side of the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.009 
radiators the right-hand side of the
vehicle<00:00:11.280> has<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.599> radiator<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> back

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
vehicle has a radiator in the back

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.180 
vehicle has a radiator in the back
corner<00:00:14.420> radiator<00:00:15.420> up<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.660> front<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.170> an<00:00:16.800> oil

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
corner radiator up in front and an oil

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.099 
corner radiator up in front and an oil
cooler<00:00:17.490> beside<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:20.160> left<00:00:20.340> side<00:00:20.930> just<00:00:21.930> has

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
cooler beside it the left side just has

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.429 
cooler beside it the left side just has
radiators<00:00:22.710> at<00:00:23.580> each<00:00:23.900> entrance<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
radiators at each entrance to the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.009 
radiators at each entrance to the
radiator<00:00:25.830> there's<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> louver<00:00:26.699> system<00:00:27.060> is

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
radiator there's a louver system is

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.820 
radiator there's a louver system is
controlled<00:00:28.349> by<00:00:28.529> cables<00:00:30.380> that<00:00:31.380> connect<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
controlled by cables that connect to a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.639 
controlled by cables that connect to a
bell<00:00:32.040> crank<00:00:32.340> that's<00:00:33.110> adjusted<00:00:34.110> from<00:00:34.230> inside

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
bell crank that's adjusted from inside

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.950 
bell crank that's adjusted from inside
the<00:00:34.770> vehicle<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.790> there's<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.059> view<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the vehicle so there's a view of the the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
the vehicle so there's a view of the the
louver<00:00:40.710> system<00:00:41.870> this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.850> this<00:00:44.850> restricts

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
louver system this is this restricts

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.950 
louver system this is this restricts
airflow<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> radiators<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:46.530> cold<00:00:47.039> start

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
airflow to the radiators for cold start

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.069 
airflow to the radiators for cold start
so<00:00:48.960> each<00:00:49.140> position<00:00:49.469> has<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.039> system<00:00:51.079> each

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so each position has this system each

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.639 
so each position has this system each
radiator<00:00:52.410> location<00:00:52.980> has<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.460> set<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.329> louvers

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.740 

it's<00:00:58.649> controlled<00:00:59.129> from<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.460> crank<00:01:00.300> inside

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
it's controlled from this crank inside

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.380 
it's controlled from this crank inside
the<00:01:00.960> vehicle

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.200 

the<00:01:08.840> coolant<00:01:09.200> exits<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.950> block<00:01:10.640> at<00:01:10.910> the<00:01:11.000> front

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
the coolant exits the block at the front

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.560 
the coolant exits the block at the front
of<00:01:11.330> each<00:01:11.450> cylinder<00:01:11.690> head<00:01:12.520> flows<00:01:13.520> into<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.060> top

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
of each cylinder head flows into the top

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.820 
of each cylinder head flows into the top
of<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.900> rear<00:01:15.110> radiators<00:01:16.060> where<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.830> coolant

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
of the rear radiators where the coolant

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.160 
of the rear radiators where the coolant
flows<00:01:19.010> through<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.660> clothes<00:01:20.660> to<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.870> bottom

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
flows through the clothes to the bottom

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.080 
flows through the clothes to the bottom
of<00:01:21.230> the<00:01:21.320> radiator<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:21.860> then<00:01:22.190> there's<00:01:22.400> tubes

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
of the radiator and then there's tubes

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.430 
of the radiator and then there's tubes
that<00:01:23.390> connect<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.870> bottom<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.320> each

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
that connect the bottom of each

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.850 
that connect the bottom of each
radiators<00:01:25.040> together<00:01:26.230> it<00:01:27.230> comes<00:01:27.470> up<00:01:27.650> through

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
radiators together it comes up through

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.240 
radiators together it comes up through
the<00:01:27.920> front<00:01:28.190> radiator<00:01:28.760> up<00:01:29.150> to<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.360> top<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:30.350> so

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
the front radiator up to the top and so

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.460 
the front radiator up to the top and so
it's<00:01:31.370> the<00:01:31.460> same<00:01:31.490> on<00:01:31.850> both<00:01:32.000> sides<00:01:32.300> so<00:01:33.140> then<00:01:33.320> this

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
it's the same on both sides so then this

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.950 
it's the same on both sides so then this
tube<00:01:35.050> connects<00:01:36.050> everything<00:01:36.350> together<00:01:36.560> and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
tube connects everything together and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.380 
tube connects everything together and
returns<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.440> expansion<00:01:40.010> tank<00:01:40.360> which<00:01:41.360> is

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
returns to the expansion tank which is

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.900 
returns to the expansion tank which is
located<00:01:41.870> here<00:01:42.610> there's<00:01:43.610> also<00:01:45.310> some<00:01:46.310> external

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
located here there's also some external

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.190 
located here there's also some external
lines<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.900> bleed<00:01:49.870> coolant<00:01:50.870> out<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.050> the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
lines to bleed coolant out of the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.040 
lines to bleed coolant out of the
backside<00:01:51.620> of<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.860> cylinder<00:01:52.220> heads<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:53.050> those

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
backside of the cylinder heads and those

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.030 
backside of the cylinder heads and those
are<00:01:54.200> attached<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.090> elbows<00:01:56.450> here<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:57.860> help

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
are attached to the elbows here to help

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.920 
are attached to the elbows here to help
pull<00:01:58.730> air<00:01:59.480> and<00:02:00.580> bubbles<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:01.820> steam<00:02:02.660> out<00:02:02.900> of

pull air and bubbles and steam out of

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.190 
pull air and bubbles and steam out of
the<00:02:03.050> back<00:02:03.230> of<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.680> cylinder<00:02:04.010> heads
