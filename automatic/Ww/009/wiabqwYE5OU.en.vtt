00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
illustrated by mara Coleman I do really

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.780 
illustrated by mara Coleman I do really
really<00:04:01.110> like<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:01.560> book<00:04:01.739> I<00:04:01.980> don't<00:04:02.520> know<00:04:02.640> why<00:04:02.760> I

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
really like this book I don't know why I

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.850 
really like this book I don't know why I
didn't<00:04:03.180> finish<00:04:03.330> it<00:04:03.630> when<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.260> started<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.830> I

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
didn't finish it when I started it I

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.350 
didn't finish it when I started it I
think<00:04:05.040> it's<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:05.430> cuz<00:04:05.520> it's<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.970> lot<00:04:06.209> to

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
think it's just cuz it's like a lot to

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.060 
think it's just cuz it's like a lot to
take<00:04:06.510> in<00:04:06.570> at<00:04:06.840> once<00:04:07.050> because<00:04:07.350> it's<00:04:07.560> very<00:04:07.800> well

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
take in at once because it's very well

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.800 
take in at once because it's very well
written<00:04:08.100> but<00:04:08.760> it's<00:04:08.880> very<00:04:08.970> quickly<00:04:09.330> written

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
written but it's very quickly written

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.500 
written but it's very quickly written
and<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.320> think<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.980> I<00:04:11.370> was<00:04:11.970> in<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.150> middle<00:04:12.330> of

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
and I think that I was in the middle of

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.240 
and I think that I was in the middle of
this<00:04:12.630> book<00:04:12.900> when<00:04:13.080> I<00:04:13.140> started<00:04:13.590> cinder<00:04:14.220> and
