00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
that you have the evaporator which is

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.520 
that you have the evaporator which is
inside<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.300> passenger<00:01:23.600> compartment<00:01:23.869> which

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
inside the passenger compartment which

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.080 
inside the passenger compartment which
is<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.830> low-pressure<00:01:25.190> side<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.729> system

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
is the low-pressure side of the system

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.490 
is the low-pressure side of the system
it's<00:01:26.270> basically<00:01:26.330> where<00:01:26.869> you<00:01:26.960> get<00:01:27.110> your<00:01:27.140> cold

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
it's basically where you get your cold

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.950 
it's basically where you get your cold
from<00:01:27.909> this<00:01:28.909> little<00:01:29.179> guy<00:01:29.300> down<00:01:29.360> here<00:01:29.780> at<00:01:29.869> the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
from this little guy down here at the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.370 
from this little guy down here at the
bottom<00:01:30.110> is<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:31.250> metering<00:01:31.909> orifice<00:01:32.539> now<00:01:33.080> there

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
bottom is a metering orifice now there

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.230 
bottom is a metering orifice now there
are<00:01:33.649> several<00:01:33.920> different<00:01:34.340> ways<00:01:34.399> of<00:01:34.850> doing<00:01:34.970> this

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
are several different ways of doing this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.859 
are several different ways of doing this
in<00:01:35.450> several<00:01:35.750> different<00:01:35.899> types<00:01:36.289> of<00:01:36.500> these<00:01:37.869> but

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
in several different types of these but

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.960 
in several different types of these but
basically<00:01:39.380> what<00:01:39.649> this<00:01:39.680> does<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.640> works

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
basically what this does is this works

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.100 
basically what this does is this works
off<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.509> pressure<00:01:41.750> temperature

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
off of the pressure temperature

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.859 
off of the pressure temperature
relationship<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.790> refrigerant<00:01:44.299> I'm

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
relationship of the refrigerant I'm

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.149 
relationship of the refrigerant I'm
going<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.079> go<00:01:45.200> over<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.470> in<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.649> minute<00:01:45.829> and

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
going to go over that in a minute and

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.780 
going to go over that in a minute and
then<00:01:46.820> lastly<00:01:47.240> we<00:01:47.479> have<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:48.460> receiver<00:01:49.460> dryer

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
then lastly we have the receiver dryer

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.810 
then lastly we have the receiver dryer
and<00:01:50.290> what<00:01:51.290> this<00:01:51.500> does<00:01:51.799> is<00:01:52.130> this<00:01:52.310> removes

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
and what this does is this removes

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.450 
and what this does is this removes
moisture<00:01:53.119> from<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.630> AC<00:01:53.780> system<00:01:54.460> moisture

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
moisture from the AC system moisture

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.789 
moisture from the AC system moisture
inside<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.119> AC<00:01:56.270> system<00:01:56.930> will<00:01:57.079> compromise<00:01:57.469> its

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
inside the AC system will compromise its

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.859 
inside the AC system will compromise its
efficiency<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:58.670> really<00:01:59.149> won't<00:01:59.270> work<00:01:59.479> as<00:01:59.659> good

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
efficiency it really won't work as good

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.929 
efficiency it really won't work as good
if<00:02:00.049> there's<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.290> lot<00:02:00.439> of<00:02:00.469> moisture<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:00.950> there<00:02:01.219> so

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
if there's a lot of moisture in there so

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.850 
if there's a lot of moisture in there so
they<00:02:02.090> put<00:02:02.119> this<00:02:02.450> little<00:02:02.659> guy<00:02:02.810> in<00:02:03.020> here<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.350> take

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
they put this little guy in here to take

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.789 
they put this little guy in here to take
the<00:02:03.979> moisture<00:02:04.130> out<00:02:04.539> to<00:02:05.539> demonstrate<00:02:06.110> the

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
the moisture out to demonstrate the

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.810 
the moisture out to demonstrate the
pressure<00:02:07.159> temperature<00:02:07.520> relationship<00:02:09.820> I'm

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
pressure temperature relationship I'm

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.160 
pressure temperature relationship I'm

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
time what happens in the can starts to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.790 
time what happens in the can starts to
get<00:02:29.340> cold<00:02:29.670> now<00:02:31.370> why<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.800> liquid

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
get cold now why is that the liquid

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.980 
get cold now why is that the liquid
inside<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.490> this<00:02:35.580> can<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.150> at<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.390> high<00:02:36.720> pressure

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
inside of this can is at a high pressure

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.470 
inside of this can is at a high pressure
when<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.980> let<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.430> out<00:02:38.550> through<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.120> small

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
when you let it out through the small

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.500 
when you let it out through the small
hole<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:40.590> turns<00:02:40.950> into<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.340> lower<00:02:41.790> pressure<00:02:42.150> so

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
hole it turns into a lower pressure so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.910 
hole it turns into a lower pressure so
it<00:02:42.600> goes<00:02:42.750> from<00:02:42.960> an<00:02:43.050> area<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.290> high<00:02:43.500> pressure<00:02:43.800> to

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
it goes from an area of high pressure to

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.890 
it goes from an area of high pressure to
an<00:02:44.160> area<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.520> low<00:02:44.700> pressure<00:02:44.730> because<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
an area of low pressure because the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.960 
an area of low pressure because the
material<00:02:46.290> goes<00:02:46.500> from<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:47.070> high<00:02:47.340> pressure<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.940> a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
material goes from a high pressure to a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.480 
material goes from a high pressure to a
low<00:02:48.060> pressure<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.930> basically<00:02:49.740> takes<00:02:50.100> heat

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
low pressure it basically takes heat

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.370 
low pressure it basically takes heat
with<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.180> really<00:02:52.020> what<00:02:52.170> an<00:02:52.260> air

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
with it and really what an air

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.990 
with it and really what an air
conditioning<00:02:52.770> system<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> heat

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
conditioning system is is a heat

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.940 
conditioning system is is a heat
exchanger<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.840> takes<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.260> heat<00:02:55.470> from<00:02:55.710> inside

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
exchanger it takes the heat from inside

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.640 
exchanger it takes the heat from inside
your<00:02:56.490> car<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.000> moves<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.870> outside<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.440> car

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
your car and moves it outside the car

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.760 
your car and moves it outside the car
now<00:02:59.100> down<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.580> front<00:02:59.910> of<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.300> radiator<00:03:00.770> this

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
now down in front of the radiator this

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.430 
now down in front of the radiator this
is<00:03:01.920> not<00:03:02.100> your<00:03:02.310> radiator<00:03:02.750> this<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.900> actually

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
is not your radiator this is actually

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.780 
is not your radiator this is actually
the<00:03:04.920> condenser<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.180> this<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.810> where<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:08.520> heat

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
the condenser and this is where the heat

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.990 
the condenser and this is where the heat
from<00:03:09.030> inside<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.750> car<00:03:09.990> is<00:03:10.970> transferred<00:03:11.970> to

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
from inside the car is transferred to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.450 
from inside the car is transferred to
the<00:03:12.330> outside<00:03:12.780> really<00:03:13.410> thin<00:03:13.710> thing<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.280> is

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
the outside really thin thing this is

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.220 
the outside really thin thing this is
the<00:03:14.610> radiator<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.300> this<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.900> condenser

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
the radiator and this is the condenser

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.970 
the radiator and this is the condenser
itself

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
itself

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.340 
itself
now<00:03:17.460> that<00:03:17.610> condenser<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.270> connected<00:03:18.750> by<00:03:18.900> lines

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
now that condenser is connected by lines

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.680 
now that condenser is connected by lines
down<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:20.550> compressor<00:03:21.120> which<00:03:21.300> I've<00:03:21.570> got

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
down to the compressor which I've got

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.260 
down to the compressor which I've got
something<00:03:22.110> else<00:03:22.230> these<00:03:23.190> are<00:03:23.250> those<00:03:23.490> lines<00:03:23.850> and

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
something else these are those lines and

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.200 
something else these are those lines and
these<00:03:25.020> are<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.290> service<00:03:25.680> fittings<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.460> then

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
these are the service fittings and then

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.110 
these are the service fittings and then
they<00:03:27.360> run<00:03:27.570> down<00:03:28.050> inside<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.130> car<00:03:29.340> now<00:03:29.850> this

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
they run down inside the car now this

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.640 
they run down inside the car now this
guy<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:31.470> compressor<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.520> this<00:03:33.330> is<00:03:33.810> driven

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
guy is the compressor and this is driven

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.280 
guy is the compressor and this is driven
by<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> belt<00:03:35.430> on<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.480> front<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.810> your<00:03:36.900> engine

this<00:04:05.400> guy<00:04:05.580> here<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.840> evaporator<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.800> this

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
this guy here is the evaporator and this

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.400 
this guy here is the evaporator and this
is<00:04:08.790> what<00:04:08.940> lives<00:04:09.150> inside<00:04:09.540> your<00:04:09.720> dash<00:04:09.990> this<00:04:10.350> is

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
is what lives inside your dash this is

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.550 
is what lives inside your dash this is
basically<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.040> cold<00:04:11.340> side<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.440> what<00:04:13.440> you'll

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
basically the cold side and what you'll

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.350 
basically the cold side and what you'll
notice<00:04:13.620> here<00:04:14.160> is<00:04:14.190> something<00:04:14.760> called<00:04:15.060> an

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
notice here is something called an

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.400 
notice here is something called an
expansion<00:04:15.810> valve<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.950> expansion<00:04:17.609> valve<00:04:17.850> is

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
expansion valve this expansion valve is

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.920 
expansion valve this expansion valve is
basically<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.680> small<00:04:20.130> hole<00:04:20.459> on<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:21.660> spra

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
basically that small hole on the spra

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.290 
basically that small hole on the spra
air<00:04:22.169> remember<00:04:23.419> that<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.750> this<00:04:25.400> are<00:04:26.400> virtually

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
air remember that and this are virtually

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.370 
air remember that and this are virtually
the<00:04:27.330> same<00:04:27.480> thing<00:04:28.130> but<00:04:29.130> this<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:30.110> works<00:04:31.110> like<00:04:31.350> a

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
the same thing but this is works like a

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.500 
the same thing but this is works like a
throttle<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.220> opens<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:32.820> closes<00:04:33.090> the

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
throttle and it opens and closes the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.090 
throttle and it opens and closes the
size<00:04:33.750> of<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.140> hole<00:04:34.410> depending<00:04:34.979> upon

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
size of that hole depending upon

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.460 
size of that hole depending upon
refrigerant<00:04:35.880> demand<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.390> they<00:04:36.840> also<00:04:37.020> don't

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
refrigerant demand and they also don't

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.420 
refrigerant demand and they also don't
want<00:04:37.710> this<00:04:37.890> whole<00:04:38.070> thing

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
want this whole thing

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.700 
want this whole thing
turn<00:04:38.610> into<00:04:38.850> a<00:04:38.880> giant<00:04:39.150> block<00:04:39.540> of<00:04:39.570> ice<00:04:39.840> all<00:04:40.470> right

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
turn into a giant block of ice all right

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.470 
turn into a giant block of ice all right
now<00:04:41.010> we've<00:04:41.190> gone<00:04:41.340> over<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.730> major<00:04:41.910> components

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
now we've gone over the major components

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.380 
now we've gone over the major components
of<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.660> AC<00:04:42.810> system<00:04:43.580> briefly<00:04:44.580> covered<00:04:45.030> how<00:04:45.210> it

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
of the AC system briefly covered how it

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.010 
of the AC system briefly covered how it
works<00:04:46.580> basically<00:04:47.580> I've<00:04:48.000> done<00:04:48.210> this<00:04:48.390> just<00:04:48.900> to

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
works basically I've done this just to

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.440 
works basically I've done this just to
give<00:04:49.170> you<00:04:49.290> an<00:04:49.440> overview<00:04:49.860> of<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.880> parts<00:04:51.210> and

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
give you an overview of the parts and

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.220 
give you an overview of the parts and
what<00:04:52.260> their<00:04:52.530> what<00:04:52.830> their<00:04:53.010> function<00:04:53.430> is

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
what their what their function is

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.630 
what their what their function is
servicing<00:04:55.230> an<00:04:55.320> AC<00:04:55.470> system<00:04:56.010> yourself<00:04:56.190> is

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
servicing an AC system yourself is

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.180 
servicing an AC system yourself is
something<00:04:56.820> I<00:04:57.060> don't<00:04:57.240> recommend<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:58.020> I<00:04:58.830> don't

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
something I don't recommend and I don't

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.700 
something I don't recommend and I don't
recommend<00:04:59.460> this<00:04:59.700> for<00:04:59.880> a<00:04:59.940> number<00:05:00.120> of<00:05:00.270> reasons

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
recommend this for a number of reasons

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.590 
recommend this for a number of reasons
not<00:05:01.710> only<00:05:02.250> does<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:02.880> average<00:05:03.030> person<00:05:03.480> not

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
not only does the average person not

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.480 
not only does the average person not
possess<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.080> proper<00:05:04.410> equipment<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:05.010> do<00:05:05.190> so

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
possess the proper equipment to do so

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.000 
possess the proper equipment to do so
but<00:05:06.060> whenever<00:05:06.630> you<00:05:06.900> remove<00:05:07.170> major<00:05:07.500> components

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
but whenever you remove major components

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.390 
but whenever you remove major components
from<00:05:08.070> an<00:05:08.220> AC<00:05:08.400> system<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:10.110> need<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.500> replace<00:05:10.860> a

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
from an AC system you need to replace a

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.900 
from an AC system you need to replace a
given<00:05:12.030> amount<00:05:12.210> of<00:05:12.330> oil<00:05:12.540> in<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.230> that<00:05:13.380> system

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
given amount of oil in to that system

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.340 
given amount of oil in to that system
the<00:05:14.910> system<00:05:15.120> has<00:05:15.450> its<00:05:15.630> own<00:05:15.750> lubricant<00:05:16.260> that

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
the system has its own lubricant that

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.800 
the system has its own lubricant that
goes<00:05:16.530> throughout<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.070> entire<00:05:17.600> circuit<00:05:18.600> and

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
goes throughout the entire circuit and

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.080 
goes throughout the entire circuit and
if<00:05:19.290> there<00:05:19.620> isn't<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:19.920> proper<00:05:20.250> amount<00:05:20.490> there<00:05:20.790> it

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
if there isn't a proper amount there it

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.610 
if there isn't a proper amount there it
could<00:05:21.360> cause<00:05:21.570> a<00:05:21.600> problem<00:05:21.900> either<00:05:22.260> being<00:05:22.530> too

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
could cause a problem either being too

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.950 
could cause a problem either being too
much<00:05:22.920> or<00:05:23.130> too<00:05:23.250> little<00:05:23.540> so<00:05:24.540> that's<00:05:24.780> something

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
much or too little so that's something

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.110 
much or too little so that's something
to<00:05:25.080> be<00:05:25.200> mindful<00:05:25.530> of<00:05:25.740> also<00:05:26.250> moisture<00:05:26.850> in<00:05:27.000> the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
to be mindful of also moisture in the

you<00:05:29.100> open<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.400> AC<00:05:29.550> system<00:05:30.120> up<00:05:30.330> is<00:05:30.620> is<00:05:31.620> also

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
you open the AC system up is is also

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.250 
you open the AC system up is is also
detrimental<00:05:32.340> to<00:05:32.700> its<00:05:32.940> operation<00:05:33.510> and<00:05:33.720> could
