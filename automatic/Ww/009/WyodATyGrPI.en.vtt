my<00:01:19.110> favorite<00:01:19.470> thing<00:01:19.680> about<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.159> weapon<00:01:20.340> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
my favorite thing about this weapon is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.910 
my favorite thing about this weapon is
that<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> actually<00:01:21.299> maintains<00:01:21.479> good<00:01:22.229> damage

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that it actually maintains good damage

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.340 
that it actually maintains good damage
at<00:01:23.250> further<00:01:23.610> ranges<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.270> drops<00:01:24.509> off<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> 25

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
at further ranges it drops off to 25

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.600 
at further ranges it drops off to 25
which<00:01:25.590> means<00:01:25.830> you're<00:01:26.009> always<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.520> be

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
which means you're always going to be

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.370

four shouting somebody with this weapon

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.140

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
the fact that it's got a 30 round

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
the fact that it's got a 30 round
magazine<00:01:30.689> means<00:01:30.960> your<00:01:31.229> range<00:01:31.470> potential<00:01:31.979> with

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
magazine means your range potential with

think the one that goes on the aka looks

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.859

them to the weapon now obviously I'm

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
using the iron sights here because of

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.179 
using the iron sights here because of
the<00:02:00.299> lota<00:02:00.570> itself<00:02:01.170> traditionally<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> would<00:02:02.070> be

the lota itself traditionally I would be

sight<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.799> gun<00:02:05.070> but<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.000> say<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
sight on this gun but I have to say the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.940 
sight on this gun but I have to say the
iron<00:02:06.540> sights<00:02:06.719> are<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:07.020> too<00:02:07.320> bad<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:07.799> this

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
iron sights are not too bad with this

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.410 
iron sights are not too bad with this
weapon<00:02:08.160> they<00:02:08.429> do<00:02:08.489> make<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.000> little<00:02:09.209> bit

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
weapon they do make it a little bit

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.570 
weapon they do make it a little bit
tricky<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.810> hit<00:02:10.050> further<00:02:10.649> range<00:02:10.920> targets<00:02:11.430> or

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
aim for the head

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.199 
aim for the head
because<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.260> size<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.220> weapon<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.790> its

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
because the size of the weapon and its

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.940 
because the size of the weapon and its
proximity<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.170> actual<00:02:16.440> iron<00:02:16.709> sights

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
proximity to the actual iron sights

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.530 
proximity to the actual iron sights
makes<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> little<00:02:17.640> bit<00:02:17.910> hard<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> track

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
makes it a little bit hard to track

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.940

usually<00:02:21.120> kept<00:02:21.330> my<00:02:21.480> location<00:02:21.930> concealed<00:02:22.620> long

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
usually kept my location concealed long

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.770 
usually kept my location concealed long
enough<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.459> even<00:02:23.819> if<00:02:23.940> my<00:02:24.090> aim<00:02:24.269> wasn't<00:02:24.540> that

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
enough that even if my aim wasn't that

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.690 
enough that even if my aim wasn't that
great<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.379> iron<00:02:25.620> sights<00:02:25.890> most<00:02:26.400> people

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
great with the iron sights most people

would know are shooting them from and I
would<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.400> advantage<00:02:29.519> regardless<00:02:30.450> now

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
would have the advantage regardless now

for<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.900> letter<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.680> wasn't<00:02:38.069> always

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
for this letter so I wasn't always

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.220 
for this letter so I wasn't always
getting<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.760> benefits<00:02:39.299> for<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.720> weapon<00:02:40.080> but

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
getting the benefits for this weapon but

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.680 
getting the benefits for this weapon but
once<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.830> got<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.220> angled<00:02:41.640> grip<00:02:41.790> unlocked<00:02:42.390> it

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
once I got that angled grip unlocked it

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.420 
once I got that angled grip unlocked it
made<00:02:43.019> all<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.260> difference<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.920> world<00:02:44.220> the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
made all the difference in the world the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.759 
made all the difference in the world the
first<00:02:44.640> shot<00:02:44.849> recoil<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.599> AKM<00:02:46.049> is<00:02:46.260> three

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
first shot recoil on the AKM is three

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.520 
first shot recoil on the AKM is three
times<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.510> much<00:02:48.720> higher<00:02:48.959> than<00:02:49.230> any<00:02:49.440> of

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
times that is so much higher than any of

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.440 
times that is so much higher than any of
the<00:02:49.709> follow-up<00:02:50.099> shots<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.549> what<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.060> does<00:02:51.269> is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
the follow-up shots and what it does is

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.900 
the follow-up shots and what it does is
it<00:02:51.630> throws<00:02:52.019> off<00:02:52.230> your<00:02:52.290> second<00:02:52.950> shot<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> bit<00:02:53.700> and

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
it throws off your second shot a bit and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.880 
it throws off your second shot a bit and
all<00:02:54.030> your<00:02:54.239> follow-up<00:02:54.720> shots<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.200> becomes

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
all your follow-up shots so becomes

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.039 
all your follow-up shots so becomes
harder<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.489> be<00:02:56.640> precise<00:02:57.239> with<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.810> weapon

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
harder to be precise with this weapon

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.870 
harder to be precise with this weapon
without<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.709> angled<00:02:59.069> grip<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.459> think<00:02:59.700> that's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
without the angled grip I think that's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.030 
without the angled grip I think that's
pretty<00:03:00.090> much<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.299> must-have<00:03:01.019> attachment<00:03:01.860> for

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
pretty much a must-have attachment for

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.520 
pretty much a must-have attachment for
the<00:03:02.130> AKM<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.819> man<00:03:03.120> does<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.480> AKM<00:03:03.959> really<00:03:04.319> just

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
the AKM and man does the AKM really just

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.380 
the AKM and man does the AKM really just
look<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.099> awesome<00:03:05.579> with<00:03:05.700> different<00:03:06.060> kinds<00:03:06.329> of

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
look so awesome with different kinds of

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.180 
look so awesome with different kinds of
camo<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.200> think<00:03:07.349> this<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.680> one<00:03:07.920> gun<00:03:08.160> that

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
camo on it I think this is one gun that

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.580 
camo on it I think this is one gun that
really<00:03:08.700> just<00:03:08.880> stylized<00:03:09.810> as<00:03:09.989> well<00:03:10.230> because

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
really just stylized as well because

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.440 
really just stylized as well because
it's<00:03:10.739> got<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.099> wood<00:03:11.459> furniture<00:03:11.910> yet<00:03:12.299> when

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
it's got that wood furniture yet when

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.690 
it's got that wood furniture yet when
you<00:03:12.569> put<00:03:12.780> sort<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.140> modern<00:03:13.620> camo<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.310> it's

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
you put sort of a modern camo on it it's

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.240 
you put sort of a modern camo on it it's
just<00:03:14.849> got<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.239> awesome<00:03:15.620> aesthetic<00:03:16.620> look<00:03:17.069> to

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
just got this awesome aesthetic look to

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.160 
just got this awesome aesthetic look to
it<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.519> don't<00:03:17.760> know<00:03:17.819> maybe<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:18.329> just<00:03:18.420> me<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:18.959> I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
it I don't know maybe it's just me but I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.319 
it I don't know maybe it's just me but I
love<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.799> way<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:19.950> aks<00:03:20.519> look<00:03:20.819> now<00:03:21.120> let's

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
love the way that aks look now let's

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.400 
love the way that aks look now let's
talk<00:03:21.480> about<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.840> big<00:03:21.989> difference<00:03:22.350> between

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
talk about the big difference between

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.229 
talk about the big difference between
this<00:03:22.889> assault<00:03:23.220> rifle<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.760> some<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.090> other

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
this assault rifle and some of the other

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.090 
this assault rifle and some of the other
assault<00:03:24.660> rifles<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.440> game<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.889> one

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
assault rifles in the game this one

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.069 
assault rifles in the game this one
shoots<00:03:26.400> slow<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.060> hits<00:03:27.329> hard<00:03:27.630> it's<00:03:27.870> got<00:03:28.049> a

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
shoots slow but it hits hard it's got a

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.289 
shoots slow but it hits hard it's got a
max<00:03:28.410> damage<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.980> 36<00:03:29.700> which<00:03:29.940> means<00:03:30.180> you're

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
max damage of 36 which means you're

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.180 
max damage of 36 which means you're
going<00:03:30.389> to<00:03:30.480> be<00:03:30.600> able<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.989> easily<00:03:31.290> three<00:03:31.920> shot<00:03:32.160> a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
going to be able to easily three shot a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.550 
going to be able to easily three shot a
target<00:03:32.609> in<00:03:32.910> close<00:03:33.299> quarters<00:03:33.720> at<00:03:33.900> range<00:03:34.290> it

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
target in close quarters at range it

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.470 
target in close quarters at range it
chips<00:03:34.859> off<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.280> around<00:03:35.519> 25<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.299> we're

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
chips off to around 25 that we're

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.599 
chips off to around 25 that we're
talking<00:03:36.660> about<00:03:37.109> lowering<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.500> damage<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:38.010> 24

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
talking about lowering the damage to 24

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.460 
talking about lowering the damage to 24
in<00:03:38.850> an<00:03:39.239> upcoming<00:03:39.420> patch<00:03:39.870> hopefully<00:03:40.290> they

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
in an upcoming patch hopefully they

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.990 
in an upcoming patch hopefully they
don't<00:03:40.680> do<00:03:40.920> that<00:03:41.100> because<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.459> think<00:03:41.609> it's

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
don't do that because I think it's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.729 
don't do that because I think it's
already<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.569> little<00:03:42.959> bit<00:03:43.139> under<00:03:43.470> class

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
already a little bit under class

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.229 
already a little bit under class
compared<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.370> other<00:03:44.549> assault<00:03:44.850> rifles<00:03:44.880> out

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
compared to the other assault rifles out

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.960 
compared to the other assault rifles out
there<00:03:45.450> but<00:03:45.930> it's<00:03:46.079> a<00:03:46.170> very<00:03:46.530> hard-hitting<00:03:47.220> AR<00:03:47.819> it

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
there but it's a very hard-hitting AR it

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.509 
there but it's a very hard-hitting AR it
makes<00:03:48.180> good<00:03:48.510> use<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:49.109> ammo<00:03:49.440> capacity<00:03:49.799> and

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
makes good use of the ammo capacity and

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.280 
makes good use of the ammo capacity and
so<00:03:50.850> you<00:03:50.910> should<00:03:51.209> be<00:03:51.329> able<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.569> take<00:03:51.780> down<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.989> lot

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
so you should be able to take down a lot

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.690 
so you should be able to take down a lot
of<00:03:52.440> targets<00:03:52.799> provided<00:03:53.220> you've<00:03:53.340> got<00:03:53.549> the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
of targets provided you've got the

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.610 
of targets provided you've got the
accuracy<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.420> back<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.780> up<00:03:54.870> now<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.290> course<00:03:55.440> the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
accuracy to back it up now of course the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.170 
accuracy to back it up now of course the
offset<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.130> damage<00:03:56.430> model<00:03:56.579> has<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:56.940> much

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
offset the damage model has a much

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.300 
offset the damage model has a much
slower<00:03:57.569> rate<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:57.989> fire<00:03:58.109> 600<00:03:58.950> rounds<00:03:59.099> per

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
slower rate of fire 600 rounds per

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.890 
slower rate of fire 600 rounds per
minute<00:03:59.700> but<00:03:59.849> you<00:04:00.030> really<00:04:00.269> don't<00:04:00.450> notice<00:04:00.660> it

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
minute but you really don't notice it

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.839 
minute but you really don't notice it
too<00:04:01.200> much<00:04:01.380> even<00:04:01.739> in<00:04:01.829> close<00:04:02.099> quarters<00:04:02.489> because

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
too much even in close quarters because

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.629 
too much even in close quarters because
your<00:04:03.329> damage<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.260> high<00:04:04.560> with<00:04:04.620> this<00:04:04.950> gun<00:04:05.190> you

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
your damage is so high with this gun you

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.670 
your damage is so high with this gun you
could<00:04:05.849> put<00:04:06.060> an<00:04:06.180> extended<00:04:06.780> mag<00:04:06.989> on<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:07.500> I

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
could put an extended mag on this I

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.319 
could put an extended mag on this I
don't<00:04:07.739> know<00:04:07.920> if<00:04:08.040> this<00:04:08.220> gun<00:04:08.400> really<00:04:08.910> needs<00:04:09.180> it

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
don't know if this gun really needs it

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.720 
don't know if this gun really needs it
the<00:04:09.480> extended<00:04:10.049> magazine<00:04:10.470> does<00:04:10.709> reduce<00:04:10.950> your

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
the extended magazine does reduce your

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.130 
the extended magazine does reduce your
accuracy<00:04:12.299> while<00:04:12.750> you're<00:04:13.019> moving

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
accuracy while you're moving

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.900 
accuracy while you're moving
so<00:04:14.290> that's<00:04:14.590> something<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:15.010> have<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.460> consider

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
so that's something you have to consider

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.150 
so that's something you have to consider
if<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.209> want<00:04:16.450> those<00:04:16.660> five<00:04:16.900> rounds<00:04:17.290> versus<00:04:17.650> the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
if you want those five rounds versus the

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.250 
if you want those five rounds versus the
reduced<00:04:18.640> moving<00:04:19.090> accuracy<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.780> would<00:04:20.050> say<00:04:20.200> you

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
reduced moving accuracy I would say you

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.230 
reduced moving accuracy I would say you
don't<00:04:20.410> really<00:04:20.709> need<00:04:20.920> it<00:04:20.980> because<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.880> rate<00:04:22.120> of

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
don't really need it because the rate of

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.880 
don't really need it because the rate of
fire<00:04:22.420> on<00:04:22.540> this<00:04:22.660> weapon<00:04:22.990> is<00:04:23.080> so<00:04:23.260> slow<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:23.830> you

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
fire on this weapon is so slow and you

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.380 
fire on this weapon is so slow and you
have<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.040> thirty<00:04:24.400> four<00:04:24.640> round<00:04:24.820> magazine<00:04:25.300> to

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
have a thirty four round magazine to

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.820 
have a thirty four round magazine to
begin<00:04:25.660> with<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:25.990> you're<00:04:26.320> probably<00:04:26.560> not

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
begin with that you're probably not

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.320 
begin with that you're probably not
going<00:04:26.950> to<00:04:27.010> see<00:04:27.160> too<00:04:27.310> many<00:04:27.430> situations<00:04:28.180> in

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
going to see too many situations in

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.390 
going to see too many situations in
which<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.540> bleed<00:04:29.050> this<00:04:29.230> magazine<00:04:29.710> dry<00:04:30.190> and

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
which you bleed this magazine dry and

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.490 
which you bleed this magazine dry and
have<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.670> hit<00:04:30.790> that<00:04:30.940> long<00:04:31.240> reload<00:04:31.750> time<00:04:31.990> if<00:04:32.380> you

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
have to hit that long reload time if you

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.020 
have to hit that long reload time if you
do<00:04:32.650> hit<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:32.860> long<00:04:33.190> reload<00:04:33.580> though<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:33.940> is

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
do hit that long reload though it is

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.730 
do hit that long reload though it is
three<00:04:34.300> point<00:04:34.570> three<00:04:34.750> seven<00:04:34.960> seconds<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:35.590> it's

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
three point three seven seconds so it's

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.380 
three point three seven seconds so it's
definitely<00:04:36.130> on<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.460> longer<00:04:36.820> side<00:04:36.850> now

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
definitely on the longer side now

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.180 
definitely on the longer side now
generally<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.050> performance<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:38.710> this<00:04:38.830> weapon

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
generally the performance of this weapon

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.460 
generally the performance of this weapon
is<00:04:39.400> top-notch<00:04:39.760> if<00:04:40.300> you've<00:04:40.480> got<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.840> AKM<00:04:41.290> and

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
is top-notch if you've got the AKM and

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.140 
is top-notch if you've got the AKM and
you've<00:04:41.590> got<00:04:41.770> it<00:04:41.920> outfitted<00:04:42.070> correctly<00:04:43.000> that

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
you've got it outfitted correctly that

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.910 
you've got it outfitted correctly that
is<00:04:43.330> with<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.600> angled<00:04:43.960> grip<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.440> pretty<00:04:44.740> much

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
is with the angled grip and pretty much

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.800 
is with the angled grip and pretty much
whatever<00:04:45.130> else<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.580> want<00:04:45.610> on<00:04:45.970> this<00:04:46.090> gun<00:04:46.330> then

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
whatever else you want on this gun then

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.450 
whatever else you want on this gun then
you<00:04:46.960> are<00:04:47.080> going<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.470> be<00:04:47.560> rocking<00:04:48.190> it<00:04:48.310> this

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
you are going to be rocking it this

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.790 
you are going to be rocking it this
thing<00:04:48.700> does<00:04:48.910> so<00:04:49.180> much<00:04:49.450> damage<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:50.320> suppressor

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
thing does so much damage the suppressor

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.070 
thing does so much damage the suppressor
is<00:04:50.830> actually<00:04:51.280> a<00:04:51.310> lot<00:04:51.640> of<00:04:51.670> fun<00:04:51.820> it's<00:04:52.480> surprising

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
is actually a lot of fun it's surprising

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.810 
is actually a lot of fun it's surprising
just<00:04:53.110> how<00:04:53.620> insanely<00:04:54.100> effective<00:04:54.670> the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
just how insanely effective the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.460 
just how insanely effective the
suppressor<00:04:55.270> is<00:04:55.390> it<00:04:55.840> keeping<00:04:56.200> you<00:04:56.320> off<00:04:56.440> that

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
suppressor is it keeping you off that

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.800 
suppressor is it keeping you off that
mini-map<00:04:57.070> in<00:04:57.280> TDM<00:04:57.700> style<00:04:58.090> scenarios<00:04:58.630> it's

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
mini-map in TDM style scenarios it's

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.410 
mini-map in TDM style scenarios it's
incredibly<00:04:59.410> useful<00:04:59.560> probably<00:05:00.310> less<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:01.120> maybe

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
incredibly useful probably less so maybe

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.150 
incredibly useful probably less so maybe
in<00:05:01.600> heist<00:05:01.900> game<00:05:02.200> modes<00:05:02.440> or<00:05:02.680> modes<00:05:02.950> where

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
in heist game modes or modes where

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.470 
in heist game modes or modes where
you're<00:05:03.340> surrounded<00:05:03.760> by<00:05:03.790> your<00:05:03.970> teammates<00:05:04.330> a

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
you're surrounded by your teammates a

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.930 
you're surrounded by your teammates a
lot<00:05:04.510> so<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.410> suppressor<00:05:05.890> and<00:05:06.130> your<00:05:06.460> mini-map

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
lot so the suppressor and your mini-map

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.880 
lot so the suppressor and your mini-map
stealthiness<00:05:07.660> isn't<00:05:08.140> really<00:05:08.470> that<00:05:08.500> valuable

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
stealthiness isn't really that valuable

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.420 
stealthiness isn't really that valuable
it<00:05:09.820> does<00:05:10.120> have<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.500> 580<00:05:11.500> meter<00:05:11.860> per<00:05:12.100> second

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
it does have a 580 meter per second

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.520 
it does have a 580 meter per second
muzzle<00:05:12.850> velocity<00:05:13.360> which<00:05:13.750> makes<00:05:13.960> it<00:05:14.110> decent

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
muzzle velocity which makes it decent

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.930 
muzzle velocity which makes it decent
for<00:05:14.680> hitting<00:05:14.890> long-range<00:05:15.310> targets<00:05:15.730> and<00:05:15.850> when

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
for hitting long-range targets and when

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.130 
for hitting long-range targets and when
you<00:05:16.060> put<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.300> suppressor<00:05:16.720> on<00:05:16.840> there<00:05:16.990> it's

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
you put the suppressor on there it's

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.290 
you put the suppressor on there it's
going<00:05:17.260> to<00:05:17.320> reduce<00:05:17.580> your<00:05:18.580> ability<00:05:18.700> to<00:05:19.060> hit

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
going to reduce your ability to hit

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.210 
going to reduce your ability to hit
moving<00:05:19.480> targets<00:05:19.690> I<00:05:20.140> definitely<00:05:20.830> saw<00:05:21.040> that

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
moving targets I definitely saw that

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.620 
moving targets I definitely saw that
while<00:05:21.430> playing<00:05:21.640> with<00:05:21.850> this<00:05:21.970> gun<00:05:22.180> for<00:05:22.330> a<00:05:22.420> bit

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
while playing with this gun for a bit

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.990 
while playing with this gun for a bit
and<00:05:22.750> it<00:05:23.200> actually<00:05:23.500> made<00:05:23.890> me<00:05:24.070> stop<00:05:24.400> shooting<00:05:24.880> it

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
and it actually made me stop shooting it

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.150 
and it actually made me stop shooting it
longer<00:05:25.390> range<00:05:25.600> targets<00:05:26.140> frankly<00:05:26.830> that<00:05:27.010> was<00:05:27.130> a

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
longer range targets frankly that was a

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.670 
longer range targets frankly that was a
combination<00:05:27.940> of<00:05:28.060> just<00:05:28.750> having<00:05:28.930> iron<00:05:29.410> sights

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
combination of just having iron sights

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.470 
combination of just having iron sights
and<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.920> suppressor<00:05:30.400> I<00:05:30.430> felt<00:05:30.700> that<00:05:30.820> really

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
and the suppressor I felt that really

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.210 
and the suppressor I felt that really
reduced<00:05:31.990> my<00:05:32.170> effectiveness<00:05:32.680> at<00:05:32.980> hitting

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
reduced my effectiveness at hitting

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.100 
reduced my effectiveness at hitting
those<00:05:33.340> long-range<00:05:33.820> targets<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:34.720> just<00:05:34.930> kind

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
those long-range targets so I just kind

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.720 
those long-range targets so I just kind
of<00:05:35.170> stopped<00:05:35.440> and<00:05:35.620> tried<00:05:35.770> to<00:05:35.890> get<00:05:36.100> in<00:05:36.220> a<00:05:36.370> little

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
of stopped and tried to get in a little

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.310 
of stopped and tried to get in a little
bit<00:05:36.880> closer<00:05:37.150> quarters<00:05:37.570> however<00:05:38.020> if<00:05:38.170> you

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
bit closer quarters however if you

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.110 
bit closer quarters however if you
didn't<00:05:38.680> have<00:05:38.800> that<00:05:38.830> suppressor<00:05:39.460> when<00:05:39.880> you<00:05:39.940> had

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
didn't have that suppressor when you had

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.940 
didn't have that suppressor when you had
a<00:05:40.150> red<00:05:40.750> dot<00:05:40.930> sight<00:05:41.200> on<00:05:41.350> there<00:05:41.530> or<00:05:41.680> even<00:05:41.800> a

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
a red dot sight on there or even a

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.730 
a red dot sight on there or even a
magnified<00:05:42.550> sight<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:43.330> could<00:05:43.510> be<00:05:43.660> so<00:05:44.050> so<00:05:44.470> much

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
magnified sight you could be so so much

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.350 
magnified sight you could be so so much
more<00:05:44.950> effective<00:05:45.340> with<00:05:45.460> this<00:05:45.610> weapon<00:05:45.820> at<00:05:46.060> range

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
more effective with this weapon at range

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.720 
more effective with this weapon at range
now<00:05:46.780> perhaps<00:05:47.110> one<00:05:47.350> day<00:05:47.500> I'll<00:05:47.680> unlock<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.400> gold

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
now perhaps one day I'll unlock the gold

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.090 
now perhaps one day I'll unlock the gold
camo<00:05:49.060> for<00:05:49.360> this<00:05:49.480> weapon<00:05:49.810> it<00:05:49.930> is<00:05:50.140> a<00:05:50.320> thousand

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
camo for this weapon it is a thousand

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.280 
camo for this weapon it is a thousand
kills<00:05:51.370> which<00:05:51.640> is<00:05:51.760> kind<00:05:51.970> of<00:05:52.030> crazy<00:05:52.240> it's<00:05:53.050> funny

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
kills which is kind of crazy it's funny

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.320 
kills which is kind of crazy it's funny
to<00:05:53.500> think<00:05:53.710> about<00:05:53.950> now<00:05:54.250> that<00:05:54.280> you<00:05:54.850> only<00:05:55.030> need<00:05:55.300> a

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
to think about now that you only need a

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.730 
to think about now that you only need a
hundred<00:05:55.660> kills<00:05:56.050> pretty<00:05:56.320> much<00:05:56.530> with<00:05:56.710> any

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
hundred kills pretty much with any

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.280 
hundred kills pretty much with any
weapon<00:05:57.340> before<00:05:57.790> you<00:05:58.000> can<00:05:58.390> unlock<00:05:58.810> all<00:05:59.110> the

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
weapon before you can unlock all the

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.170 
weapon before you can unlock all the
attachments<00:05:59.860> that<00:05:59.980> you<00:06:00.130> want<00:06:00.400> for<00:06:00.700> it<00:06:00.880> but<00:06:01.030> you

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
attachments that you want for it but you

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.940 
attachments that you want for it but you
need<00:06:01.330> a<00:06:01.360> thousand<00:06:02.140> kills<00:06:02.350> to<00:06:02.500> get<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:02.740> gold

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950

for<00:06:06.760> both<00:06:07.030> sides<00:06:07.510> so<00:06:07.870> there's<00:06:08.290> definitely

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
for both sides so there's definitely

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.770 
for both sides so there's definitely
some<00:06:09.100> steep<00:06:09.430> unlock<00:06:09.880> requirements<00:06:10.570> for<00:06:10.720> the

some steep unlock requirements for the

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.390 
some steep unlock requirements for the

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
guns in this game however there are

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
fewer guns significantly fewer guns in

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.280 
fewer guns significantly fewer guns in
hardline<00:06:15.310> than<00:06:15.790> there<00:06:15.970> were<00:06:16.120> and<00:06:16.300> say<00:06:16.450> bf4<00:06:16.990> so

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
hardline than there were and say bf4 so

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.900 
hardline than there were and say bf4 so
perhaps<00:06:17.500> getting<00:06:17.920> to<00:06:18.040> those<00:06:18.190> higher<00:06:18.550> kill

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
perhaps getting to those higher kill

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.120 
perhaps getting to those higher kill
counts<00:06:19.270> will<00:06:19.660> be<00:06:19.870> more<00:06:20.080> applicable<00:06:20.380> as<00:06:20.830> for

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
counts will be more applicable as for

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.410 
counts will be more applicable as for
actually<00:06:21.460> getting<00:06:21.610> lots<00:06:21.940> of<00:06:22.150> kills<00:06:22.419> in<00:06:22.600> a<00:06:22.720> time

Manor Team Deathmatch seems to work the
best<00:06:25.490> so<00:06:25.730> far<00:06:25.760> there<00:06:26.180> are<00:06:26.210> a<00:06:26.360> few<00:06:26.630> maps<00:06:26.870> on

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
Blood Money that are just crazy blood

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.510 
Blood Money that are just crazy blood

baths of infantry carnage but team

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.490 
baths of infantry carnage but team
deathmatch<00:06:31.760> is<00:06:32.150> consistently<00:06:32.780> a<00:06:32.900> good<00:06:33.260> way<00:06:33.440> to

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
deathmatch is consistently a good way to

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.770 
deathmatch is consistently a good way to
get<00:06:33.740> lots<00:06:34.070> of<00:06:34.250> kills<00:06:34.550> in<00:06:34.760> this<00:06:35.030> game<00:06:35.270> and<00:06:35.720> I

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
get lots of kills in this game and I

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.720 
get lots of kills in this game and I
recommend<00:06:36.140> that<00:06:36.560> however<00:06:36.890> it's<00:06:37.130> definitely

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
recommend that however it's definitely

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.820 
recommend that however it's definitely
not<00:06:37.970> one<00:06:38.240> of<00:06:38.270> the<00:06:38.510> top<00:06:38.720> point<00:06:39.080> earners<00:06:39.500> in<00:06:39.680> this

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
not one of the top point earners in this

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.680 
not one of the top point earners in this
game<00:06:40.070> so<00:06:40.310> if<00:06:40.430> cache<00:06:40.760> is<00:06:41.030> your<00:06:41.210> ultimate

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690

objective<00:06:41.840> TDM<00:06:42.740> is<00:06:42.920> not<00:06:43.100> the<00:06:43.250> way<00:06:43.370> to<00:06:43.400> go<00:06:43.670> I

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
objective TDM is not the way to go I

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.820 
objective TDM is not the way to go I
would<00:06:43.970> say<00:06:44.300> hot<00:06:44.600> wire<00:06:44.810> or<00:06:45.080> Blood<00:06:45.500> Money

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
would say hot wire or Blood Money

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.530 
would say hot wire or Blood Money
