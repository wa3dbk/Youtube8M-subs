anything like that I came across this
after<00:00:29.429> looking<00:00:29.910> into<00:00:30.000> mod<00:00:30.240> trips<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> while

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
after looking into mod trips for a while

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.459 
after looking into mod trips for a while
and<00:00:31.369> I<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:33.030> all<00:00:33.239> set<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.480> get<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.170> I

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
and I was all set to get one and then I

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.440 
and I was all set to get one and then I
realized<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.920> had<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.250> take<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:35.880> way<00:00:36.120> apart

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
realized you had to take your way apart

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.630 
realized you had to take your way apart
to<00:00:36.630> figure<00:00:36.809> out<00:00:37.020> which<00:00:37.340> chipset<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.489> have

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
to figure out which chipset you have

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.610 
to figure out which chipset you have
inside<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.149> way<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.629> i<00:00:39.690> kind<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.320> gave<00:00:40.440> up

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
inside your way so i kind of gave up

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.810 
inside your way so i kind of gave up
because<00:00:40.770> i<00:00:40.890> didn't<00:00:41.100> know<00:00:41.190> which<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.579> get

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
because i didn't know which one to get

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
because i didn't know which one to get
but<00:00:42.600> anyway<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> other<00:00:43.440> day<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.649> gotta<00:00:43.860> do

through<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.030> text<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> full

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
through in text and you have the full

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.740 
through in text and you have the full
text<00:01:53.490> instructions<00:01:53.939> here<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.390> well<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.720> case

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
text instructions here as well in case

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.600 
text instructions here as well in case
you<00:01:55.170> can't<00:01:55.409> follow<00:01:55.619> along<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.520> video

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you can't follow along with the video

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.389 
you can't follow along with the video
for<00:01:57.030> whatever<00:01:57.270> reason<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.590> video<00:01:58.829> also<00:01:59.100> has

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
for whatever reason the video also has

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.480 
for whatever reason the video also has
in<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.759> minutes<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.119> audio<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.829> just<00:02:01.829> keeping

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
in with minutes of audio I just keeping

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.390 
in with minutes of audio I just keeping
it<00:02:02.729> down<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
it down for the

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.000 
it down for the
purpose<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.730> this<00:02:04.380> okay<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.440> your<00:02:05.710> first<00:02:05.860> step

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
purpose of this okay so your first step

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.730 
purpose of this okay so your first step
then<00:02:06.340> would<00:02:06.670> be<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:07.170> modify<00:02:08.170> your<00:02:08.290> console

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
then would be to modify your console

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.859 
then would be to modify your console
second<00:02:09.399> step<00:02:09.610> is<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.090> start<00:02:10.360> downloading

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
second step is to start downloading

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.780 
second step is to start downloading
games<00:02:11.160> obviously<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.620> as<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:15.010> can<00:02:15.160> see<00:02:15.190> good

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
games obviously and as you can see good

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.090 
games obviously and as you can see good
literally<00:02:16.300> geez<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.350> looks<00:02:17.380> like<00:02:17.650> every<00:02:17.920> game

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
literally geez it looks like every game

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.540 
literally geez it looks like every game
probably<00:02:18.430> ever<00:02:18.640> released<00:02:21.930> yeah<00:02:22.930> tons<00:02:23.680> though

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
probably ever released yeah tons though

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.170 
probably ever released yeah tons though
they<00:02:24.730> also<00:02:24.880> have<00:02:25.180> private<00:02:25.420> trackers<00:02:26.080> here

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
they also have private trackers here

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.110 
they also have private trackers here
excellent<00:02:28.180> faster<00:02:28.600> download<00:02:29.020> speeds<00:02:30.060> okay<00:02:31.060> so

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
excellent faster download speeds okay so

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.400 
excellent faster download speeds okay so
that's<00:02:31.360> step<00:02:31.570> two<00:02:31.840> you've<00:02:32.110> got<00:02:32.260> all<00:02:32.380> your

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
that's step two you've got all your

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.770 
that's step two you've got all your
software<00:02:33.070> here<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:34.180> move<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.570> step

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
software here and you move on to step

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.050 
software here and you move on to step
three<00:02:36.510> step<00:02:37.510> three<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.910> extracting<00:02:39.910> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
three step three is extracting and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.180 
three step three is extracting and
burning<00:02:40.600> your<00:02:40.630> game<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.410> they've<00:02:41.740> got<00:02:41.770> all<00:02:42.070> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
burning your game so they've got all the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.080 
burning your game so they've got all the
software<00:02:42.670> for<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.000> every<00:02:43.570> version<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:45.000> tell<00:02:46.000> you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
software for it every version I tell you

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.060 
software for it every version I tell you
how<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.270> extract<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.959> major<00:02:47.290> points<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.800> avoid

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
how to extract it major points to avoid

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.940 
how to extract it major points to avoid
in<00:02:48.250> case<00:02:48.400> you're<00:02:48.520> having<00:02:48.730> difficulties<00:02:49.950> what

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
in case you're having difficulties what

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.060 
in case you're having difficulties what
to<00:02:51.100> do<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:52.720> order<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.080> make<00:02:53.110> your<00:02:53.410> own<00:02:53.530> backups

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
to do in order to make your own backups

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.820 
to do in order to make your own backups
and<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:55.300> looks<00:02:55.480> like<00:02:55.540> pull<00:02:55.959> videos<00:02:56.410> on<00:02:56.650> all

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
and it looks like pull videos on all

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.780 
and it looks like pull videos on all
these<00:02:57.070> processes<00:03:01.020> okay<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.400> looks<00:03:03.459> like

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
these processes okay so it looks like

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.990 
these processes okay so it looks like
there's<00:03:04.470> modules<00:03:05.470> in<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.770> video<00:03:06.040> how<00:03:06.940> to

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
there's modules in the video how to

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.330 
there's modules in the video how to
download<00:03:07.270> what<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.050> download<00:03:08.200> what<00:03:09.160> to

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
download what to download what to

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.660 
download what to download what to
extract<00:03:09.760> with<00:03:10.060> how<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.840> extract<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:12.550> then

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
extract with how to extract and then

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.040 
extract with how to extract and then
this<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:12.970> could<00:03:13.120> walk<00:03:13.330> through<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:14.019> just

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
this is I could walk through you just

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.910 
this is I could walk through you just
follow<00:03:14.470> along<00:03:14.650> here<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.470> couple

follow along here so this is a couple
minutes<00:03:18.040> long<00:03:18.310> each<00:03:18.489> module<00:03:18.790> is<00:03:19.030> probably<00:03:19.239> a

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
minutes long each module is probably a

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.050 
minutes long each module is probably a
few<00:03:19.450> minutes<00:03:19.600> long<00:03:20.580> they'll<00:03:21.580> show<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.820> what

great<00:03:27.060> step<00:03:27.629> by<00:03:27.810> step<00:03:28.080> how<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.349> extract<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
great step by step how to extract the

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:36.640 
great step by step how to extract the
files<00:03:33.170> they<00:03:34.170> show<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.560> whole<00:03:34.709> thing<00:03:34.950> there
