 american ballet theater 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:10.909
 he earned a reputation as a virtuoso 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:12.969
 classical principle impeccable 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.899

 contemporary productions his style 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.269
 however significantly different from

 Bolshoi Theater Corporate Identity 

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.430
 according to the dancer that's why the proposal 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.719
 great collaboration 

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:29.599
 seemed so interesting to him 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.460

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.900

 Russian artists who is his own 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.720
 repertoire at the same time I think and on them 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.370
 will affect how I dance because 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.760
 my style is very different 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.160
 again 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.010
 although part of beauty 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.130
 insult so the variant is all glory 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.030

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.439
 accepted this invitation 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.969
 previously just because I signed 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.429
 the contract does not mean that I became 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.579
 an artist for a big theater I will be very 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.409
 careful I will respect the traditions

 Bolshoi Theater its history and dancers 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.880
 it is clear whether this series wants us 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.509
 to commit 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.490
 Today, many Russian dancers 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.330
 act in the west and in particular in the us 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.530
 in the opinion of leaving rga received by him 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.160

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.250
 theater is a sign of the times and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.970
 inevitable sign and globalization and 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.340

 magnificent dancers left Russia but 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.070
 It seems to me that today is Russia 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.500
 completely different country open world 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.710

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:13.840
 an event 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.840
 attracting artists like david 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.549
 Hawley in particular 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.019
 I put alongside the same fact as 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.819
 attraction for ballet management 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.979

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.149
 these are two facts barely a phenomenon of one 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:29.980
 Row this is oldies events 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.940
 this is an event that will leave a mark on 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.470
 history of Russian ballet history 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.400
 world ballet 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.419
 and so in that sense 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.609
 n we have to be open today to 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.689
 the fact that Russian artists choose themselves 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.339
 the place where they consider themselves 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.699
 interesting and foreigners are talking about 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.379
 that migration if you can talk like that 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.939
 today process 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.639
 into the uncontrollable because it is difficult for them 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.769
 keep track of 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.059
 but as the artist moves around the world 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.730
 understand the relationship Alexey Ratmansky

 However, this day is not going to the holding 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.020

 what he does not speak Russian 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.339
 dancers don't bother 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:34.120

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.599
 but after a year I spoke freely for 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.309

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.969

 partly and really powder damage and what 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:04.480
 do dock be 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.510
 such as casco traction rates 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.110

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.150
 kind of find yourself
