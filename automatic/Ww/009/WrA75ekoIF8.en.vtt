the<00:01:32.270> Moto<00:01:33.270> kits<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> long<00:01:34.590> leg<00:01:34.799> pants<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the Moto kits it for a long leg pants it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.609 
the Moto kits it for a long leg pants it
you<00:01:36.390> know<00:01:36.509> looks<00:01:36.900> cool<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.320> motor<00:01:37.500> because

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you know looks cool for a motor because

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.569 
you know looks cool for a motor because
you<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.890> boots<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.369> doesn't

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
you have the boots for that doesn't

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.950 
you have the boots for that doesn't
really<00:01:38.700> match<00:01:38.850> over<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> shoes<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> think

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
really match over the shoes so I think

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
really match over the shoes so I think
the<00:01:40.439> shorts<00:01:41.040> look<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:41.369> better<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the shorts look a little better on a
