 I first about lip oil here nivea 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.430
 in this format, I learned of course on 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.350
 you of course there is a video of the myth of Klava 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.620
 the radio that smoked as much as 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.090
 great product and first thing to me 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.570
 liked this product 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.180
 this is what it smells just great 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.950
 I was more interested here precisely 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.590
 the words butter because i was 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.510
 I wonder what kind of product is oil 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.520
 for lips 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.399
 how he behaves how he applied and 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.809
 is it different from a balm for 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.550
 lips 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 having tried this tool i can say 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.939
 yes butter is completely different it looks like 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.030
 lip balm 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.939
 but this is a slightly different format oil for 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.580
 lip it is oil that is covers 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.280
 she lips such a film oily 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.369
 This film you do not go anywhere not 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.890
 lubricated is not eaten and remains on 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.840
 lips long enough 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.150
 what surprised me the most was that 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.780
 of these three oils the longest 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.360
 plenochka keeps here from this paradise 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.070
 coconut here he was the most persistent 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.049
 the most unstable most quickly eat them 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.619
 this one became juicy raspberry 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.619
 none of these oils have color then 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.700
 there is even if juicy raspberry you see in 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.460
 the package you have slightly rose mink 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.980
 it will be absolutely colorless on the lips 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.950
 that is, all these oils are colorless in colors 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.630
 They can easily be applied on the mouth 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.910
 lipstick lip gloss 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.170
 nothing you do not ride does not float 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.060
 because because this is such a product 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.440
 facing nothing and not 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.440
 swims of course the most important chip yes 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.870
 The most important feature of these oils is that 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.980
 madly delicious smell them really 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.260
 want to eat 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.150
 I thought that the most delicious for me 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.850
 will this macadam smell 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.020
 nut and fanil because I love all sorts 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.520
 vanilla or smells 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.620
 but yes he does smell good and 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.280
 heavenly mowing it's very refreshing 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.890
 coconut smell also smells very good 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.750
 nose to my favorite turned juicy 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.760
 raspberries 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:49.050
 it's really raspberry and she 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.750
 really juicy it said so 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.290
 that this oil is exactly in terms of smell 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.540
 smell my favorite that gives it 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.010
 lip oil is basically the same as 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.510
 gives caregiver balm softening 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.560
 moisturizing if you have a problem 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.750
 flaky lip then oil unconditional 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.330
 will save because oil is more 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.840
 high flow than a lip balm from 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.360
 I do not have such bright 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.290
 problems with lips get google die out 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.940
 for example during the day when descending from 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.890
 for example, some 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.440
 aggressive lip gloss or lipstick 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.090
 which dry lips there is a problem 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.060
 tightness on the lips 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.620
 but for me there is no problem for example 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.620
 cracked lips or scaly 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.620
 flaky are stupid that's why I can't 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.040
 say how good is butter 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.580
 works with these personal problems 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.340
 my experience from what I heard from 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.600
 the fact that I looked at youtube from the fact that 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.000
 saw reviews 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.730
 They say that oil copes with such 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.550
 problems are much better than normal 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.980
 lip balm 8 I believe that if 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.260
 your store has such a motta for 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.800
 lip nivea must be his 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.840
 try to take it though 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.340
 most incredible smell and at least for 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.310
 order to try 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.459
 yes what is it because oil 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.290
 really different to your fingers if you 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.380
 already tried the lip oil nivea 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.270
 write your favorite flavor 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.170
 see you in the next video total 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.040
 good luck to you 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.040
 but as
