he's got this giant worm that eats
mountains<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.700> run<00:04:52.970> by<00:04:53.120> loads<00:04:53.450> uh<00:04:53.810> let<00:04:54.260> me

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
mountains and it run by loads uh let me

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.970 
mountains and it run by loads uh let me
guess

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980

Cole uh yeah and it gets hungry or when
people<00:04:59.270> use<00:04:59.480> more<00:04:59.840> electricity<00:05:00.040> so<00:05:01.040> when<00:05:01.250> I

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
people use more electricity so when I

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.470 
people use more electricity so when I
turned<00:05:01.850> it<00:05:02.090> up

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
turned it up

I helped Huff with his plan oh man
the<00:05:06.110> question<00:05:06.680> is<00:05:06.890> where's<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.640> worm<00:05:08.060> headed

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
the question is where's the worm headed

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.340 
the question is where's the worm headed
next<00:05:09.640> scoot<00:05:10.640> to<00:05:10.790> greenhouse<00:05:11.210> bring<00:05:11.930> us<00:05:12.110> home
