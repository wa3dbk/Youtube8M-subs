00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.630
 of how to do one thing and this does 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.590
 very much I would not give it to the channel and 200 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.650
 very much 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.389
 sorry but I had no idea that 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.880
 teach them and I want them to see this 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.130
 beautiful texture that I have here using in 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.590
 my hands and see nothing else what the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.140
 beautiful requested and as they are in 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.769
 objects should be emphasized that I am in a 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.449
 0.10 and tomorrow tomorrow I will bring you a 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.910
 tutorial to comment packages 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.670
 textures in minecraft that television be 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.620
 like 10.0 alpha or the version you have 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.140
 but it is important that you have help 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.280
 because I do not do videos 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.280
 so let's do with the tutorial 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.520
 but surely you will ask 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.170
 what am I doing here that I'm going to 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.870
 learn the book then we will learn 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.239
 to make a television a television and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.840
 a computer in less than five 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.160
 minutes 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.809
 ok then let's start with the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.400
 television television is something very 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.979
 easy to do remember that this is a 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.530
 modern flat screen television 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.630
 because I do it because we have a budget 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.119
 then what we will do is put 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.310
 a step of dislate this shit 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:21.630
 quartz this mother so it's left of the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.679
 next way and we put a block 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.140
 what is this shit that is that this 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.009
 I want to fuck you want me to take 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.009
 take the hair but not 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.600
 and there we have our television so 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.820
 perfect how beautiful how beautiful that 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.680
 cool and here we have our 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.840
 modern television as you can see this 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.400
 is our base and this would be the box 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.290
 behind 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.640
 unfortunately there is not one more object 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:57.120
 slim shut up game please from x 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:02:00.090
 thank you there is no thinner object for 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.740
 to take a more realistic touch or not 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.470
 I know but that's modern television 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.970
 now let's go to the supercomputer and 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.100
 stop destroying these crystals that 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.700
 they see very very products but that very well 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.260
 and we are going to cover this for the moment here 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.430
 then basically what we will do 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.620
 will be grabbing a wooden table and a 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.680
 wooden step of the same color 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.620
 obviously and what we will do will be what 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.350
 next is true we will put the block 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.200
 of wood we will stand on top and 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.590
 we will put the wooden step 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.790
 obviously and also or by following 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.090
 it can be in the chair that you 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.700
 want for example that they are garcÃ­a that 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.400
 I learned to do a long time ago 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.640
 Yesterday 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:52.220
 doing this wait for guatemala to 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.659
 guatemala exposing this here is here 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.239
 but let's say we already have another 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.620
 cyclist ok then well we want this 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.299
 is our computers where fucking 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.390
 is our pc constant brand 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:10.260
 enough what we will do will obviously be 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.840
 get the famous black gray carpet 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.840
 or white depending on the keyboard that 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.900
 you want to have and also of course a 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.280
 painting box then well many 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.599
 have been saying that this has a 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.040
 bushing this has a fault because in the 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.290
 tutorial that I did to build a 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.810
 Many people told me that I had 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.250
 ok books then well I'm sorry no 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.109
 I knew about that but I have not been 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.640
 gone well I know why but I what 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:39.049
 I do is put a box standing up to the 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.049
 mother of four children 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:46.450
 yes 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.340
 we leave there let's say that you expose in 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.819
 your painting box and below 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.730
 we will put our carpet and ready like this 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.140
 our beautiful laptop stays and this 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.110
 it was what was happening that was removed 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.989
 then I do not find any solution to 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.790
 this problem can not be stopped but 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.610
 here I know why follow god who for 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.330
 what but I hope you have a solution 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.330
 of the environment 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:20.900
 but the important thing is that we have 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.900
 the idea and then we do not know anything 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.230
 good but I hope that you and more than 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.430
 nothing but nothing has helped them not 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.110
 forget the capsule and its comment 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.830

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.100
