00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.110 

so<00:00:00.690> the<00:00:00.960> compressor<00:00:01.709> in<00:00:01.860> my<00:00:02.010> Land<00:00:02.250> Cruiser<00:00:02.610> had

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
so the compressor in my Land Cruiser had

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.930 
so the compressor in my Land Cruiser had
seized<00:00:03.480> up<00:00:04.069> well<00:00:05.069> it<00:00:05.310> was<00:00:05.400> seized<00:00:05.580> when<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:05.759> got

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
seized up well it was seized when I got

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.150 
seized up well it was seized when I got
it<00:00:06.089> but<00:00:06.299> so<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.020> other<00:00:07.140> dad<00:00:07.319> just<00:00:07.560> pulled<00:00:08.010> the

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
it but so the other dad just pulled the

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.190 
it but so the other dad just pulled the
compressor<00:00:08.550> out<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.790> see<00:00:08.970> why<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.660> figured<00:00:10.019> me

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
compressor out to see why I figured me

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.810 
compressor out to see why I figured me
just<00:00:10.469> died<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.710> old<00:00:11.040> age<00:00:11.219> or<00:00:11.519> something<00:00:11.759> like

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
just died of old age or something like

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.799 
just died of old age or something like
that<00:00:12.290> but<00:00:13.290> my<00:00:13.769> when<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.160> first<00:00:14.370> got<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.639> out<00:00:14.809> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
that but my when I first got it out the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.540 
that but my when I first got it out the
first<00:00:16.020> thing<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.289> noticed<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.160> was<00:00:17.310> at<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
first thing I noticed that it was at the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.120 
first thing I noticed that it was at the
poli<00:00:18.090> spawn<00:00:18.690> very<00:00:19.020> nicely<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.710> usually<00:00:20.070> you

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
poli spawn very nicely and usually you

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.099 
poli spawn very nicely and usually you
find<00:00:20.310> an<00:00:20.520> old<00:00:20.640> compressors<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.840> from<00:00:21.990> this

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
find an old compressors like from this

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.200 
find an old compressors like from this
89<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.039> police<00:00:23.310> squeak<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.150> make

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
89 is that the police squeak and make

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.540 
89 is that the police squeak and make
noise<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.840> don't<00:00:24.960> spin<00:00:25.260> nicely<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.310> one

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
noise you don't spin nicely but this one

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.189 
noise you don't spin nicely but this one
perfectly<00:00:27.029> which<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.689> first<00:00:27.900> sign<00:00:28.170> that

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
perfectly which is the first sign that

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.550 
perfectly which is the first sign that
something<00:00:29.539> catastrophic<00:00:30.539> had<00:00:31.109> happened<00:00:31.470> to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
something catastrophic had happened to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.080 
something catastrophic had happened to
this<00:00:31.679> compressor<00:00:32.099> suddenly<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.759> quite<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
this compressor suddenly and quite a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.840 
this compressor suddenly and quite a
long<00:00:33.390> time<00:00:33.600> ago<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.920> next<00:00:35.070> thing<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.370> notice<00:00:35.700> is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
long time ago the next thing I notice is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.389 
long time ago the next thing I notice is
when<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> took<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.480> little<00:00:36.960> right<00:00:37.800> angle<00:00:37.950> poor

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
when I took this little right angle poor

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.030 
when I took this little right angle poor
adapter<00:00:38.850> off<00:00:39.030> was<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.230> completely<00:00:40.680> dry

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
adapter off was that is completely dry

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040 
adapter off was that is completely dry
inside<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.910> there's<00:00:42.210> no<00:00:42.270> sign<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.629> metal

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
inside this is there's no sign of metal

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.470 
inside this is there's no sign of metal
debris<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.620> oil<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.910> expect<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
debris or oil that what you expect for a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.090 
debris or oil that what you expect for a
compressor<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.899> was<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.289> slowly<00:00:46.649> slowly

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
compressor that was just slowly slowly

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.990 
compressor that was just slowly slowly
dying<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:49.800> even<00:00:49.980> more<00:00:50.129> evident<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.730> got

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
dying it was even more evident I got

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.369 
dying it was even more evident I got
these<00:00:51.149> plates<00:00:51.390> off<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.899> cover<00:00:52.110> plates

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
these plates off the cover plates

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.160 
these plates off the cover plates
they're<00:00:53.100> also<00:00:53.340> completely<00:00:53.789> dry<00:00:54.480> free<00:00:55.050> of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
they're also completely dry free of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.619 
they're also completely dry free of
metal<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.520> same<00:00:56.730> story<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> valve

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
metal in the same story with the valve

metal in the same story with the valve
plates

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
plates

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.130 
plates
there<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.489> little<00:00:59.730> wear<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> valve<00:01:00.629> reed

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
there was little wear on the valve reed

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.959 
there was little wear on the valve reed
valves<00:01:01.469> themselves<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.219> dude<00:01:02.699> they're

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
valves themselves and just dude they're

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.299 
valves themselves and just dude they're
very<00:01:03.270> clean<00:01:03.830> then<00:01:04.830> when<00:01:04.949> he<00:01:05.010> looked<00:01:05.129> at<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
very clean then when he looked at the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.440 
very clean then when he looked at the
cylinders<00:01:06.260> they<00:01:07.260> had<00:01:07.380> extreme<00:01:07.950> wear<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
cylinders they had extreme wear that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.530 
cylinders they had extreme wear that
looks<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.900> goes<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.200> very<00:01:10.470> sudden<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.909> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
looks like goes like very sudden and you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.030 
looks like goes like very sudden and you
could<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.869> tell<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.080> wasn't<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.890> was

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
could just tell that wasn't it was

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.980 
could just tell that wasn't it was
wasn't<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.700> natural<00:01:15.180> death<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
wasn't just natural death and the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.560 
wasn't just natural death and the
bearing<00:01:16.439> sounded<00:01:16.890> extremely<00:01:17.130> dry<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.909> both<00:01:18.150> on

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
bearing sounded extremely dry on both on

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.410 
bearing sounded extremely dry on both on
both<00:01:18.720> halves<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.920> finally<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:21.000> look<00:01:21.240> at<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
both halves and finally just look at the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.710 
both halves and finally just look at the
little<00:01:22.580> rollers<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.850> Pistons<00:01:24.270> ride<00:01:24.509> on

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
little rollers that the Pistons ride on

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.850 
little rollers that the Pistons ride on
they're<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.470> completely<00:01:26.720> destroyed<00:01:27.799> from<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
they're just completely destroyed from a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.520 
they're just completely destroyed from a
ton<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> friction<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.210> what<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.229> sealed

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
ton of friction and what really sealed

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
ton of friction and what really sealed
the<00:01:31.650> deal<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:31.860> me<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.460> thing<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:33.060> ran

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the deal for me that this thing this ran

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.330 
the deal for me that this thing this ran
out<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> oil<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.009> even

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
out of oil or is or is not even

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.370 
out of oil or is or is not even
installed<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:35.939> any<00:01:36.090> oil<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.540> me<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.140> seems

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
installed with any oil to me it seems

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.590 
installed with any oil to me it seems
like<00:01:37.439> was<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.009> compressor<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.549> replaced<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
like was the compressor was replaced and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.499 
like was the compressor was replaced and
they<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:41.310> forgot<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.759> add<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.939> didn't<00:01:42.390> know

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
they just forgot to add I didn't know

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.539 
they just forgot to add I didn't know
they<00:01:42.630> had<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.930> oil<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> system<00:01:43.950> let's

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
they had that oil to the system let's

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.999 
they had that oil to the system let's
look<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:44.850> these<00:01:44.909> Pistons<00:01:45.420> they're<00:01:46.350> blue<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
look at these Pistons they're blue and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.880 
look at these Pistons they're blue and
black<00:01:47.189> from<00:01:47.670> getting<00:01:48.119> extremely<00:01:48.630> hot<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.320> if

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
black from getting extremely hot and if

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.830 
black from getting extremely hot and if
you<00:01:50.009> look<00:01:50.189> carefully<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.180> piston<00:01:51.600> rings

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you look carefully the piston rings

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.420 
you look carefully the piston rings
which<00:01:52.350> are<00:01:52.439> usually<00:01:52.560> made<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.979> Teflon<00:01:53.189> or

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
which are usually made out of Teflon or

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.359 
which are usually made out of Teflon or
a<00:01:53.610> similar<00:01:53.970> material<00:01:54.350> are<00:01:55.350> completely<00:01:55.950> melted

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
a similar material are completely melted

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.370 
a similar material are completely melted
and<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:57.810> anymore

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and just this is not there anymore

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.039 
and just this is not there anymore
so<00:01:59.040> well<00:02:00.000> I'm<00:02:00.090> guessing<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.540> happened<00:02:00.869> was

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
so well I'm guessing what happened was

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.190 
so well I'm guessing what happened was
the<00:02:01.140> original<00:02:01.409> compressor<00:02:01.890> packed<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.280> in

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
the original compressor packed it in

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.560 
the original compressor packed it in
then<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.350> decided<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.829> replace<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.570> but

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
then they decided to replace it but

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.839 
then they decided to replace it but
maybe<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.350> had<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> neither<00:02:08.340> they<00:02:08.550> did<00:02:08.759> it

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
maybe they had a neither they did it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.999 
maybe they had a neither they did it
themselves<00:02:08.940> or<00:02:09.629> they<00:02:10.170> had<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> shop<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.890> they

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
themselves or they had a shop do it they

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.890 
themselves or they had a shop do it they
didn't<00:02:11.280> know<00:02:11.340> what<00:02:11.430> they<00:02:11.520> were<00:02:11.580> doing<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.360> put

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
didn't know what they were doing and put

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.650 
didn't know what they were doing and put
oil<00:02:13.050> back<00:02:13.349> in<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
oil back in the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.590 
oil back in the
presser<00:02:14.020> fire<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.860> up<00:02:15.010> may-maybe<00:02:15.820> last<00:02:16.240> like<00:02:16.570> a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
presser fire it up may-maybe last like a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.590 
presser fire it up may-maybe last like a
season<00:02:17.200> then<00:02:18.040> next<00:02:18.730> summer<00:02:18.940> when<00:02:19.360> they<00:02:19.450> went

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
season then next summer when they went

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.110 
season then next summer when they went
to<00:02:19.630> go<00:02:19.750> use<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.930> compressor<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.620> was<00:02:20.740> just

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
to go use a compressor it was just

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.600 
to go use a compressor it was just
completely<00:02:22.120> trashed<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.810> destroyed<00:02:23.610> yeah

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
completely trashed and destroyed yeah

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.310 
completely trashed and destroyed yeah
that's<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.600> little<00:02:25.870> mini<00:02:26.680> autopsy
