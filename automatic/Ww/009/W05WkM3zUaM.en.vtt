in<00:00:18.600> many<00:00:19.470> different<00:00:19.650> shapes<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.430> sizes<00:00:21.109> what

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
in many different shapes and sizes what

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.820 
in many different shapes and sizes what
I've<00:00:22.260> done<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.430> design<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.470> I've<00:00:25.470> started

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
I've done in this design is I've started

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.040 
I've done in this design is I've started
creating<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:27.050> diamond<00:00:28.050> pattern<00:00:28.760> spall<00:00:29.760> yay

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
creating a diamond pattern spall yay

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.220 
creating a diamond pattern spall yay
it's<00:00:31.050> called<00:00:31.380> or<00:00:31.769> tacking<00:00:32.610> up<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:33.180> tree<00:00:33.809> or<00:00:33.960> vine

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
it's called or tacking up a tree or vine

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.319 
it's called or tacking up a tree or vine
on<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> wall<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.680> way<00:00:37.800> I've<00:00:38.030> started<00:00:39.030> doing

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
on a wall and the way I've started doing

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.900 
on a wall and the way I've started doing
that<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.600> some<00:00:39.780> people<00:00:40.050> will<00:00:40.230> take<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.910> actual

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
that is some people will take a actual

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150 
that is some people will take a actual
trellis<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:43.530> stick<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> ground

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
trellis and just stick in the ground

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.950 
trellis and just stick in the ground
some<00:00:44.520> people<00:00:44.789> want<00:00:45.030> something<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.629> little<00:00:45.930> more

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
some people want something a little more

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.760 
some people want something a little more
elaborate<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.340> case<00:00:47.660> I<00:00:48.660> created<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
elaborate in this case I created a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.790 
elaborate in this case I created a
diamond<00:00:49.980> pattern<00:00:50.539> two<00:00:51.539> summers<00:00:52.020> ago<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.710> this

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
diamond pattern two summers ago so this

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.400 
diamond pattern two summers ago so this
is<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.219> second<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.969> will<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> second

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
is the second this will be the second

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.340 
is the second this will be the second
summer<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:57.059> created<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.629> diamond<00:00:57.899> pattern

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
summer and I created a diamond pattern

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.080 
summer and I created a diamond pattern
and<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.850> went<00:01:00.690> ahead<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.320> measured<00:01:01.710> out<00:01:02.129> some

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and I went ahead and measured out some

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.260 
and I went ahead and measured out some
diamond<00:01:03.539> shapes<00:01:04.339> all<00:01:05.339> consistently<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> same

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
diamond shapes all consistently the same

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.600 
diamond shapes all consistently the same
size<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.680> drew<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> pattern<00:01:08.430> with

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
size and then just drew the pattern with

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.730 
size and then just drew the pattern with
a<00:01:08.640> ruler<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.439> pencil<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.939> brick<00:01:12.240> wall

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
a ruler and a pencil on this brick wall

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.670 
a ruler and a pencil on this brick wall
now<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.159> went<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.270> used<00:01:15.979> some<00:01:17.570> espalier

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
now I went in and used some espalier

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.600 
now I went in and used some espalier
wire<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:21.439> you<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.619> buy<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:23.130> any<00:01:23.159> garden

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.520 
centers hardware stores and there's
different<00:01:26.549> styles<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.630> sizes<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
different styles and sizes this is a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469 
different styles and sizes this is a
very<00:01:28.829> very<00:01:29.130> thin<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.880> may<00:01:30.000> not<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.270> able<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
very very thin you may not be able to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.480 
very very thin you may not be able to
see<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.810> from<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.009> very<00:01:32.189> thin

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
see it from here but it's a very thin

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999 
see it from here but it's a very thin
flexible<00:01:32.869> aluminum<00:01:33.869> wire<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.799> use

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
flexible aluminum wire that you can use

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.789 
flexible aluminum wire that you can use
to<00:01:35.220> guide<00:01:36.140> trees<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.350> shrubs<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.009> different

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
to guide trees and shrubs and different

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.520 
to guide trees and shrubs and different
in<00:01:40.799> different<00:01:41.189> shapes<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.380> way<00:01:43.500> I

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
in different shapes so the way I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.940 
in different shapes so the way I
attached<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.820> wire<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.840> brick<00:01:46.110> was<00:01:46.920> I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
attached this wire to the brick was I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.730 
attached this wire to the brick was I
went<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.729> used<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.299> masonary<00:01:49.290> drill<00:01:50.009> bit

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
went in and used a masonary drill bit

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.639 
went in and used a masonary drill bit
and<00:01:53.060> once<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> masonry<00:01:55.079> drill<00:01:55.350> bit

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
and once you have a masonry drill bit

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.160 
and once you have a masonry drill bit
you'll<00:01:55.890> want<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> pick<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> drill<00:01:56.820> bit<00:01:57.170> that's

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
you'll want to pick the drill bit that's

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.830 
you'll want to pick the drill bit that's
a<00:01:58.649> little<00:01:59.189> bit<00:01:59.399> smaller<00:02:00.000> than<00:02:02.240> these<00:02:03.240> plastic

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
a little bit smaller than these plastic

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.499 
a little bit smaller than these plastic
anchors<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.619> these<00:02:05.520> plastic<00:02:05.939> anchors<00:02:06.329> are

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
anchors and these plastic anchors are

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.130 
anchors and these plastic anchors are
sold<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> package<00:02:07.469> at<00:02:08.009> your<00:02:08.069> hardware<00:02:08.399> store

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
sold in a package at your hardware store

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.940 
sold in a package at your hardware store
and<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:11.760> little<00:02:12.300> screws<00:02:12.690> actually<00:02:13.500> go

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and the little screws actually go

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.910 
and the little screws actually go
into<00:02:14.670> these<00:02:14.849> plastic<00:02:15.180> anchors<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.709> first

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
into these plastic anchors so the first

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.790 
into these plastic anchors so the first
step<00:02:17.190> would<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:18.200> create<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.319> pattern<00:02:19.650> that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
step would be to create the pattern that

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.680 
step would be to create the pattern that
you<00:02:19.890> want<00:02:20.130> whether<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.670> square<00:02:21.000> or<00:02:21.270> circle

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
you want whether it's a square or circle

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.350 
you want whether it's a square or circle
curves<00:02:22.349> in<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.400> design<00:02:23.730> happens<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> be<00:02:24.330> a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
curves in this design happens to be a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.140 
curves in this design happens to be a
diamond<00:02:24.599> pattern<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:26.310> after<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.790> created

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
diamond pattern and after you created

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.920 
diamond pattern and after you created
your<00:02:27.239> diamond<00:02:27.630> pattern<00:02:27.860> go<00:02:28.860> back<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
your diamond pattern go back in on the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.860 
your diamond pattern go back in on the
corners<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.650> your<00:02:32.280> squares<00:02:32.700> or<00:02:33.090> in<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:33.660> case

corners of your squares or in this case

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.260 
corners of your squares or in this case
the<00:02:34.080> diamond<00:02:34.410> pattern<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.819> may<00:02:36.000> be<00:02:36.060> able

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
the diamond pattern and you may be able

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.100 
the diamond pattern and you may be able
to<00:02:36.480> see<00:02:36.890> right<00:02:37.890> there's<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.400> actual<00:02:39.110> screw

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
to see right there's the actual screw

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.370 
to see right there's the actual screw
and<00:02:40.290> it's<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.500> there<00:02:40.650> really<00:02:40.800> tight<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.480> took

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
and it's in there really tight so I took

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.720 
and it's in there really tight so I took
the<00:02:43.860> drill<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:46.110> masonry<00:02:47.010> drill<00:02:47.250> bit<00:02:47.550> and

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
the drill and the masonry drill bit and

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.240 
the drill and the masonry drill bit and
and<00:02:48.180> never<00:02:48.480> drill<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.440> actual<00:02:49.709> grout<00:02:50.010> line

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
and never drill in the actual grout line

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.850 
and never drill in the actual grout line
or<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.670> concrete<00:02:51.120> line<00:02:51.330> drill<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.590> brick

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
or the concrete line drill in the brick

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.300 
or the concrete line drill in the brick
then<00:02:53.730> go<00:02:54.000> back<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:54.720> these<00:02:54.959> plastic

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
then go back in with these plastic

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.610 
then go back in with these plastic
anchors<00:02:56.330> put<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.450> plastic<00:02:57.900> anchor<00:02:58.260> in<00:02:58.470> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
anchors put the plastic anchor in the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.880 
anchors put the plastic anchor in the
hole<00:02:58.799> in<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.819> corners<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.540> square<00:03:00.750> or<00:03:00.900> in

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
hole in the corners of the square or in

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.650 
hole in the corners of the square or in
this<00:03:02.010> case<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.370> diamond<00:03:02.670> pattern<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.000> then

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
this case the diamond pattern and then

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.570 
this case the diamond pattern and then
just<00:03:03.930> stretch<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:05.730> wire<00:03:06.319> in<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:08.280> shape<00:03:08.549> that

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
just stretch this wire in the shape that

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.720 
just stretch this wire in the shape that
you<00:03:08.910> want<00:03:09.380> now<00:03:10.380> after<00:03:10.799> you<00:03:10.920> have<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.190> pattern

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
you want now after you have the pattern

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.949 
you want now after you have the pattern
created<00:03:12.120> then<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.049> go<00:03:13.170> back<00:03:13.350> in<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.220> plant

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
created then you go back in and a plant

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.910 
created then you go back in and a plant
the<00:03:15.959> shrub<00:03:16.260> or<00:03:16.620> tree<00:03:17.570> or<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.630> vine<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.769> you're

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
the shrub or tree or a vine and you're

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.009 
the shrub or tree or a vine and you're
in<00:03:20.160> your<00:03:20.310> choice<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:23.730> first<00:03:24.690> year<00:03:24.900> you

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
in your choice and the first year you

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.780 
in your choice and the first year you
may<00:03:25.109> want<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.350> get<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.500> larger<00:03:25.980> size<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.640> that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
may want to get a larger size so that

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.220 
may want to get a larger size so that
you<00:03:26.850> can<00:03:27.000> really<00:03:27.209> start<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.870> really<00:03:28.109> get

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
you can really start and really get

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.610 
you can really start and really get
ahead<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.980> shape<00:03:29.850> that<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.209> want<00:03:30.410> then<00:03:31.410> as

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
ahead on the shape that you want then as

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.759 
ahead on the shape that you want then as
as<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:33.090> years<00:03:33.390> go<00:03:33.750> by<00:03:33.780> then<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.440> go<00:03:34.560> back

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
as the the years go by then you go back

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.979 
as the the years go by then you go back
in<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.250> don't<00:03:35.370> just<00:03:35.640> prune<00:03:36.000> them<00:03:36.209> with

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
in and you don't just prune them with

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.710 
in and you don't just prune them with
these<00:03:37.170> smaller<00:03:37.530> scissor<00:03:37.920> pruners<00:03:38.459> but<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.570> go

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
these smaller scissor pruners but you go

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.620 
these smaller scissor pruners but you go
back<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:40.769> prune<00:03:41.190> some<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:42.299> won't

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
back in and you prune some that won't

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.610 
back in and you prune some that won't
necessarily<00:03:44.180> run<00:03:45.180> even<00:03:45.540> with<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.079> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
necessarily run even with the the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.599 
necessarily run even with the the
diamond<00:03:46.980> patterns<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:48.030> other<00:03:52.160> limbs<00:03:53.160> and

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
diamond patterns and the other limbs and

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:00.590 
diamond patterns and the other limbs and
branches<00:03:56.390> you<00:03:57.390> actually<00:03:57.840> just<00:03:58.049> take<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:59.600> the

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
branches you actually just take the the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.140 
branches you actually just take the the
wire<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.230> run<00:04:01.500> along<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.430> edge<00:04:02.579> of<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:02.940> dimer

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
wire and run along the edge of the dimer

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.440 
wire and run along the edge of the dimer
diamond<00:04:03.930> pattern<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.850> sort<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.880> like<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> bread

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
diamond pattern and sort of like a bread

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.160 
diamond pattern and sort of like a bread
tie<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.959> just<00:04:07.170> tie<00:04:07.620> these<00:04:07.859> on<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.959> hide

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
tie you just tie these on and you hide

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.370 
tie you just tie these on and you hide
these<00:04:10.380> down<00:04:10.650> this<00:04:10.889> way<00:04:11.569> and<00:04:12.569> then<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:12.989> go<00:04:13.170> in

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
these down this way and then you go in

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.170 
these down this way and then you go in
and<00:04:13.620> just<00:04:13.709> sort<00:04:14.130> of<00:04:14.190> neat<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.430> everything<00:04:14.940> up

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
and just sort of neat and everything up

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.219 
and just sort of neat and everything up
with<00:04:15.810> your<00:04:16.049> scissors<00:04:16.729> now<00:04:17.729> on<00:04:18.000> some<00:04:18.329> small

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
with your scissors now on some small

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:25.430 
with your scissors now on some small
trees<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:20.519> also<00:04:22.789> some<00:04:23.789> upright<00:04:24.210> shrubs<00:04:24.599> you

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
trees and also some upright shrubs you

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.590 
trees and also some upright shrubs you
can<00:04:25.590> also<00:04:25.770> create<00:04:26.190> archways

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
can also create archways

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.590 
can also create archways
this<00:04:28.140> is<00:04:28.290> just<00:04:28.500> some<00:04:28.830> arbor<00:04:29.520> vitae<00:04:29.700> shrubs

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
this is just some arbor vitae shrubs

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.800 
this is just some arbor vitae shrubs
that<00:04:30.780> were<00:04:30.870> planted<00:04:31.320> two<00:04:31.530> years<00:04:31.740> ago<00:04:32.540> this<00:04:33.540> one

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
that were planted two years ago this one

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.990 
that were planted two years ago this one
has<00:04:34.230> not<00:04:34.350> grown<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.650> lot<00:04:34.860> as<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.130> slow<00:04:35.400> grower<00:04:35.730> so

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
has not grown a lot as a slow grower so

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.470 
has not grown a lot as a slow grower so
you<00:04:36.090> can<00:04:36.270> buy<00:04:36.450> some<00:04:36.800> larger<00:04:37.800> sizes<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:39.240> first

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
you can buy some larger sizes the first

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.030 
you can buy some larger sizes the first
year<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:39.840> actually<00:04:39.990> even<00:04:40.350> do<00:04:40.500> this<00:04:40.650> arched

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
year and actually even do this arched

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.060 
year and actually even do this arched
design<00:04:42.410> so<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.440> plant<00:04:44.130> two<00:04:44.490> of<00:04:44.790> the<00:04:45.630> upright

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
design so you plant two of the upright

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.210 
design so you plant two of the upright
small<00:04:47.070> trees<00:04:47.370> together<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:48.830> make<00:04:49.830> sure<00:04:49.980> to

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
small trees together and make sure to

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.680 
small trees together and make sure to
before<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:50.670> plant<00:04:50.970> them<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.420> measure

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
before you plant them that you measure

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.600 
before you plant them that you measure
them<00:04:51.900> out<00:04:52.050> so<00:04:52.380> that<00:04:52.530> they<00:04:52.650> touch<00:04:52.920> to<00:04:53.340> create

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
them out so that they touch to create

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.330 
them out so that they touch to create
this<00:04:53.730> arching<00:04:54.210> effect<00:04:54.770> what<00:04:55.770> I've<00:04:55.890> used<00:04:56.190> to

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
this arching effect what I've used to

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.580 
this arching effect what I've used to
tie<00:04:56.520> those<00:04:56.700> together<00:04:56.940> is<00:04:57.780> some<00:04:58.140> inconspicuous

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
tie those together is some inconspicuous

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.590 
tie those together is some inconspicuous
and<00:04:59.220> really<00:04:59.460> small<00:05:00.620> espalier<00:05:01.620> wire<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.970> you

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
and really small espalier wire and you

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.050 
and really small espalier wire and you
can<00:05:03.780> maybe<00:05:04.110> barely<00:05:04.530> see<00:05:04.800> some<00:05:05.670> of<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:05.850> wires

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
can maybe barely see some of the wires

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.050 
can maybe barely see some of the wires
here<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:07.320> I<00:05:07.770> just<00:05:07.980> did<00:05:08.130> this<00:05:08.310> just<00:05:08.700> a<00:05:08.850> little

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
here and I just did this just a little

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.470 
here and I just did this just a little
while<00:05:09.150> ago<00:05:09.530> and<00:05:10.530> it<00:05:10.740> turned<00:05:10.980> out<00:05:11.390> pretty<00:05:12.390> well

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
while ago and it turned out pretty well

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.450 
while ago and it turned out pretty well
the<00:05:12.750> first<00:05:12.960> time<00:05:13.200> this<00:05:13.620> by<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:13.950> end<00:05:14.130> of<00:05:14.220> summer

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
the first time this by the end of summer

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.950 
the first time this by the end of summer
will<00:05:14.640> grow<00:05:14.790> together<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.390> you<00:05:15.510> really<00:05:15.690> won't

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
will grow together and you really won't

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.800 
will grow together and you really won't
see<00:05:16.370> this<00:05:17.370> wire<00:05:17.640> you<00:05:18.060> may<00:05:18.180> not<00:05:18.360> be<00:05:18.480> able<00:05:18.540> to<00:05:18.690> see

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
see this wire you may not be able to see

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.240 
see this wire you may not be able to see
it<00:05:18.870> too<00:05:19.020> well<00:05:19.200> now<00:05:20.210> this<00:05:21.210> design<00:05:21.740> with<00:05:22.740> arching

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
it too well now this design with arching

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.320 
it too well now this design with arching
trees<00:05:23.610> can<00:05:24.570> be<00:05:24.600> used<00:05:25.230> on<00:05:25.770> larger<00:05:26.280> trees<00:05:26.580> very

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
trees can be used on larger trees very

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.120 
trees can be used on larger trees very
small<00:05:27.690> trees<00:05:28.020> smaller<00:05:28.290> than<00:05:28.530> this<00:05:28.680> or<00:05:28.890> even

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
small trees smaller than this or even

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.480 
small trees smaller than this or even
trees<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.520> size<00:05:30.320> you<00:05:31.320> can<00:05:31.440> also<00:05:31.590> do<00:05:31.860> a<00:05:31.890> tripod

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
trees the size you can also do a tripod

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.410 
trees the size you can also do a tripod
where<00:05:32.850> you<00:05:33.090> actually<00:05:33.240> have<00:05:34.070> another

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
where you actually have another

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.270 
where you actually have another
evergreen<00:05:36.420> tree<00:05:36.720> equal<00:05:37.620> distance<00:05:38.070> and<00:05:38.220> a

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
evergreen tree equal distance and a

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.040 
evergreen tree equal distance and a
triangle<00:05:38.610> form<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.480> then<00:05:39.660> you<00:05:39.780> would<00:05:39.900> take

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
triangle form and then you would take

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.780 
triangle form and then you would take
the<00:05:40.200> third<00:05:40.410> one<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:40.740> arch<00:05:40.920> over<00:05:41.130> here<00:05:41.490> so<00:05:41.700> you

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
the third one and arch over here so you

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.440 
the third one and arch over here so you
have<00:05:41.850> a<00:05:41.970> tripod<00:05:42.270> actually<00:05:43.370> now<00:05:44.370> you're<00:05:44.700> when

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
have a tripod actually now you're when

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.770 
have a tripod actually now you're when
you<00:05:45.690> may<00:05:45.840> experience<00:05:47.240> some<00:05:48.240> of<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.510> side

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
you may experience some of the side

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.320 
you may experience some of the side
branchings<00:05:49.440> not<00:05:49.890> following<00:05:50.460> suit<00:05:50.730> with<00:05:50.760> with

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
branchings not following suit with with

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.530 
branchings not following suit with with
the<00:05:51.510> rest<00:05:51.720> of<00:05:51.870> these<00:05:52.020> in<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:53.010> case<00:05:53.310> I<00:05:53.730> would

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
the rest of these in that case I would

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.310 
the rest of these in that case I would
recommend<00:05:56.240> cutting<00:05:57.240> it's<00:05:57.750> always<00:05:57.960> better<00:05:58.230> to

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
recommend cutting it's always better to

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.070 
recommend cutting it's always better to
cut<00:05:58.560> a<00:05:58.590> little<00:05:58.740> extra<00:05:59.190> wire<00:05:59.370> in<00:05:59.910> that<00:06:00.690> case<00:06:00.930> you

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
cut a little extra wire in that case you

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.720 
cut a little extra wire in that case you
cut<00:06:01.320> this<00:06:01.470> wire<00:06:01.710> that's<00:06:02.610> by<00:06:02.790> a<00:06:02.820> wire<00:06:04.010> and<00:06:05.010> then

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
cut this wire that's by a wire and then

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:11.930 
cut this wire that's by a wire and then
just<00:06:05.910> simply<00:06:06.150> wrap<00:06:06.450> it<00:06:06.600> around<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:11.610> rest<00:06:11.820> of

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
just simply wrap it around the rest of

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.900 
just simply wrap it around the rest of
the<00:06:12.000> tree<00:06:12.240> now<00:06:12.480> you<00:06:12.690> can<00:06:12.840> adjust<00:06:12.960> how<00:06:13.620> tight<00:06:14.010> or

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
the tree now you can adjust how tight or

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.180 
the tree now you can adjust how tight or
how<00:06:14.940> loose<00:06:15.230> for<00:06:16.230> the<00:06:16.260> way<00:06:16.440> the<00:06:16.710> look<00:06:16.890> that<00:06:16.920> you

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
how loose for the way the look that you

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.310 
how loose for the way the look that you
want<00:06:17.430> just<00:06:17.730> by<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.180> amount<00:06:18.570> of<00:06:18.630> wire<00:06:18.840> and<00:06:19.200> how

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
want just by the amount of wire and how

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.830 
want just by the amount of wire and how
tight<00:06:19.620> you<00:06:19.770> tie<00:06:19.980> this<00:06:23.210> this<00:06:24.210> wire<00:06:24.390> it's<00:06:24.630> very

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
tight you tie this this wire it's very

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.540 
tight you tie this this wire it's very
easy<00:06:25.050> to<00:06:25.230> work<00:06:25.380> with<00:06:25.650> just<00:06:25.890> always<00:06:26.160> get<00:06:26.520> a

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
easy to work with just always get a

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.830 
easy to work with just always get a
little<00:06:26.760> extra<00:06:27.000> more<00:06:27.240> than<00:06:27.420> you<00:06:27.510> think<00:06:27.660> you

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
little extra more than you think you

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.710 
little extra more than you think you
need<00:06:30.320> then<00:06:31.320> any<00:06:31.530> excess<00:06:32.190> I<00:06:32.580> always<00:06:33.390> use<00:06:33.570> my

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
need then any excess I always use my

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.960 
need then any excess I always use my
printing<00:06:34.050> scissors<00:06:34.470> or<00:06:34.740> or<00:06:35.310> even<00:06:35.550> these<00:06:35.640> hand

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
printing scissors or or even these hand

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.080 
printing scissors or or even these hand
hand<00:06:36.600> shears<00:06:36.870> are<00:06:37.080> really<00:06:37.290> good<00:06:37.500> too

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
hand shears are really good too

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.870 
hand shears are really good too
and<00:06:39.090> they<00:06:39.180> just<00:06:39.330> cut<00:06:39.570> those<00:06:39.720> off

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
and they just cut those off

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.070 
and they just cut those off
and<00:06:41.880> so<00:06:42.030> see<00:06:42.210> now<00:06:42.420> you<00:06:42.480> don't<00:06:42.720> have<00:06:42.840> any<00:06:42.990> other

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
and so see now you don't have any other

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.290 
and so see now you don't have any other
side<00:06:43.440> branches<00:06:43.950> coming<00:06:44.190> out<00:06:44.430> as<00:06:44.670> well<00:06:44.700> and

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
side branches coming out as well and

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.780 
side branches coming out as well and
then<00:06:46.290> also<00:06:46.500> you<00:06:46.740> can<00:06:46.890> see<00:06:47.070> sort<00:06:47.280> of<00:06:47.400> this<00:06:47.490> arch

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
then also you can see sort of this arch

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.040 
then also you can see sort of this arch
effect<00:06:48.420> that's<00:06:48.660> so<00:06:50.360> so<00:06:51.360> I<00:06:51.390> hope<00:06:51.570> this<00:06:51.750> video

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
effect that's so so I hope this video

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.070 
effect that's so so I hope this video
has<00:06:52.230> been<00:06:52.290> some<00:06:52.680> help<00:06:52.710> and<00:06:53.450> have<00:06:54.450> a<00:06:54.480> great<00:06:54.690> day
