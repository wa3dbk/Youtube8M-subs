on<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.710> 2k<00:00:11.490> 14<00:00:11.820> PlayStation<00:00:12.750> 4<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.170> Xbox<00:00:13.410> one

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
on a 2k 14 PlayStation 4 and Xbox one

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.609 
on a 2k 14 PlayStation 4 and Xbox one
edition<00:00:14.070> now<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.570> thought<00:00:15.929> was<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> server

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
edition now this I thought was a server

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.099 
edition now this I thought was a server
problem<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.270> seems<00:00:18.539> as<00:00:18.750> though<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
problem but it seems as though the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.010 
problem but it seems as though the
server<00:00:19.490> ended<00:00:20.490> up<00:00:20.609> making<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.240> bigger<00:00:21.510> problem

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
server ended up making a bigger problem

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.390 
server ended up making a bigger problem
which<00:00:22.260> turned<00:00:22.560> into<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.830> glitch<00:00:23.130> or<00:00:23.340> something

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
which turned into a glitch or something

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.160 
which turned into a glitch or something
like<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.600> wanted<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> make<00:00:25.050> this

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170

fine<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.189> getting<00:01:53.549> connected<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.210> MBA<00:01:55.280> 2k14

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
fine with getting connected to MBA 2k14

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.950 
fine with getting connected to MBA 2k14
servers<00:01:56.970> so<00:01:57.179> I<00:01:57.210> don't<00:01:57.509> believe<00:01:57.720> they<00:01:57.869> are

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
servers so I don't believe they are

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.320 
servers so I don't believe they are
completely<00:01:58.500> down<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.759> whatever<00:01:59.880> reason

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
completely down and for whatever reason

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.789 
completely down and for whatever reason
I<00:02:00.420> don't<00:02:00.450> know<00:02:00.689> what's<00:02:00.899> causing<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.619> issue

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
I don't know what's causing this issue

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.410 
I don't know what's causing this issue
but<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.189> wanted<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> show<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.700> guys<00:02:02.850> because<00:02:03.390> I

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
but I wanted to show you guys because I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.779 
but I wanted to show you guys because I
figured<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.350> saw<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.860> video<00:02:05.250> maybe<00:02:05.610> it

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
figured if you saw it on video maybe it

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.449 
figured if you saw it on video maybe it
would<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:05.909> easier<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.600> correct<00:02:06.929> and<00:02:07.200> fix<00:02:07.470> so

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
would be easier to correct and fix so

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.039 
would be easier to correct and fix so
let's<00:02:08.910> go<00:02:09.060> ahead<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.330> wait<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.780> load

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
let's go ahead and wait for this to load

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.660 
let's go ahead and wait for this to load
up<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.319> then<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.530> will<00:02:10.649> show<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.160> it's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
up and then I will show you that it's

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.030 
up and then I will show you that it's
going<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:11.910> connect<00:02:12.330> perfectly<00:02:12.540> fine<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
going to connect perfectly fine to the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.039 
going to connect perfectly fine to the
server<00:02:14.610> now<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.209> happened<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.540> me<00:02:15.630> on<00:02:15.660> two

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
server now this happened to me on two

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.110 
server now this happened to me on two
accounts<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.650> actually<00:02:17.010> was<00:02:17.489> able<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.850> connect

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
accounts I actually was able to connect

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.940 
accounts I actually was able to connect
to<00:02:18.209> two<00:02:18.569> K<00:02:18.720> servers<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.230> my<00:02:19.350> second<00:02:19.709> account

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.830 
to two K servers on my second account
which<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:20.670> have<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.819> different<00:02:21.209> mic<00:02:21.330> career<00:02:21.630> on

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
and I was playing parks and then I tried

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.990 
and I was playing parks and then I tried
to<00:02:24.269> upgrade<00:02:24.540> my<00:02:24.900> player<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:26.340> said<00:02:26.640> could

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
to upgrade my player and it said could

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.520

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
not connect to two K servers it kicked

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.960 
not connect to two K servers it kicked
me<00:02:28.680> off<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.160> then<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.340> got<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.819> issue

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
hopefully 2k can get it fixed soon maybe

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.509 
hopefully 2k can get it fixed soon maybe
it<00:02:43.079> is<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.230> server<00:02:43.620> issue<00:02:43.859> and<00:02:44.160> maybe<00:02:44.310> they'll

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
it is a server issue and maybe they'll

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.550 
it is a server issue and maybe they'll
be<00:02:44.640> able<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.850> fix<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.239> with<00:02:45.390> just<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.109> servers

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
be able to fix it with just the servers

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.050 
be able to fix it with just the servers
being<00:02:46.799> corrected<00:02:47.370> or<00:02:47.519> something<00:02:47.880> like<00:02:48.000> that

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
being corrected or something like that

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.569 
being corrected or something like that
and<00:02:48.299> we<00:02:48.390> won't<00:02:48.570> need<00:02:48.720> another<00:02:48.780> update<00:02:49.579> but

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
and we won't need another update but

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.830 
and we won't need another update but
unfortunately<00:02:51.269> right<00:02:51.299> now<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.720> looking

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
unfortunately right now it's looking

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.210 
unfortunately right now it's looking
like<00:02:52.019> it's<00:02:52.230> going<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.470> need<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.739> update<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.190> I

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
like it's going to need to update and I

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.550 
like it's going to need to update and I
really<00:02:53.519> hope<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.820> doesn't<00:02:53.850> because<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.630> already

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
really hope it doesn't because I already

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.920 
really hope it doesn't because I already
had<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.769> wait<00:02:55.920> two<00:02:56.160> updates<00:02:56.609> now<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> get<00:02:57.630> my<00:02:57.780> my
