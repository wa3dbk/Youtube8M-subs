00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.729
 paula personal 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:14.809
 here we are not doing for us we will mount a tripod for our boy 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.509
 very light 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.889
 so let's go, this is the student we're going to need here 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.550
 demolish conar 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.179
 glue 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.390
 it's a day 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 we are together with everyone here 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.390
 she reunites us only with interest 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.040
 first we're going to sell themselves to panic or anonymous destroy the 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.370
 Iraqi so the enemy recovers after they break out 2 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.220
 collect trash 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.550
 what interests us 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.120
 done that 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.970
 but a historical day let's not dismount dismount level let's 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.570
 disassemble or 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.430
 or thriller 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.550
 sarkozy has changed his mind and we will pay this part 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.240
 there we put or wine collectors 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.790
 effectively 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.400
 the coordinator 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.320
 to collapse 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.120
 the initiative 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.410
 so here 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.260
 let's get 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.620
 put your hand on the ball 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.240
 now yes, now, what are we going to do? 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 put this together a little, we'll do it 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 We're going to build the complete list. 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.510
 right 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.760
 as it is seen as if he were the mayor as normally 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.160
 we would go back 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.760
 if it could work 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.760
 there be used by a 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.880
 not 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 moon 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.250
 we will make 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.860
 when combined 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.330
 and here again 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.790
 in the hands 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.730
 Paul, one thing 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.680
 this part from below 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.910
 care should be taken but in isolation it is worth noting that in 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.190
 so be careful when when that part of that region here 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.749
 and cut ptb was isolated because 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.909
 here here 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.090
 it was joy - we are not playing in the sea 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.220
 I do not give a guess, it's going to have energy so let's go inside, this must be 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:49.409
 totally isolated so much taste that the duduzÃ£o a feather a ball here of 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.989
 to emphasize 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.259
 so let's go there done it 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:56.579
 the world colossus 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.459
 settlers 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.459
 saw broken there is a culture 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.739
 tone of support of the cellular profit ' 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.950
 and this support will make the money and the cellphone more secure 'and will not 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.359
 treats when he was put on top of the hour spent 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:18.179
 in this position 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:20.070
 phoned last week 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.860
 it will not be any more sustenance understood I started to buy what is 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.579
 You can cut it from here. 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.649
 so here we have 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:32.569
 I feel happy 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.189
 the criterion 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.189
 to me 95 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.299
 no way 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.269
 so he 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.269
 cristian 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.539
 so now we're going to put the headlines 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.129
 What practical effect? 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.469
 so this is gratifying for Members 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.469
 so as not to ruin 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.389
 there it gets firmer 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.389
 his scenes here 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.629
 in all functionality 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:31.169
 here in the squares and end creation like here 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.050
 we will not use 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.050
 so now we already have credentials ipiau 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.419
 in addition to the 25 inclusive of mining plasticine 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.610
 deprived
