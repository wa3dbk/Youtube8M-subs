kind<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.739> getting<00:03:31.919> caught<00:03:32.129> up<00:03:32.189> in<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.489> choice

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
kind of getting caught up in the choice

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.999 
kind of getting caught up in the choice
rhetoric<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:33.449> for<00:03:33.900> about<00:03:34.049> 10<00:03:34.500> years<00:03:34.530> or<00:03:34.859> so

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:35.009 
rhetoric and so for about 10 years or so

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.349 
rhetoric and so for about 10 years or so
i<00:03:35.040> was<00:03:35.370> advocating<00:03:35.909> for<00:03:36.000> charter<00:03:36.329> schools

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
i was advocating for charter schools

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.809 
i was advocating for charter schools
they<00:03:37.290> didn't<00:03:37.530> exist<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:38.099> i<00:03:38.129> didn't<00:03:38.489> know<00:03:38.609> how

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
they didn't exist so i didn't know how

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.569 
they didn't exist so i didn't know how
things<00:03:39.209> would<00:03:39.419> turn<00:03:39.449> out<00:03:40.129> over<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.250> years

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
things would turn out over the years

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.569 
things would turn out over the years
from<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:43.319> period<00:03:43.620> in<00:03:43.829> which<00:03:43.889> charters

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
from the period in which charters

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.420 
accountability movement started i began
looking<00:03:48.720> at<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.019> results<00:03:49.169> when<00:03:50.069> I<00:03:50.099> looked<00:03:50.340> at

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
looking at the results when I looked at

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.759 
looking at the results when I looked at

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
we're not really making any improvements

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:55.999 
we're not really making any improvements

looked<00:04:06.810> at<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.019> evidence<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:08.340> thought<00:04:08.609> all

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
looked at the evidence and I thought all

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.390 
looked at the evidence and I thought all
these<00:04:09.269> things<00:04:09.629> that<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.900> hoped<00:04:10.650> would<00:04:10.799> be<00:04:10.949> work

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
these things that I hoped would be work

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.080 
these things that I hoped would be work
didn't<00:04:11.969> work<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.419> now<00:04:13.199> I<00:04:13.349> find<00:04:13.680> myself

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
didn't work and now I find myself

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.099 
didn't work and now I find myself
castigated<00:04:15.090> first<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.419> all<00:04:15.479> I'm<00:04:15.569> castigated

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
castigated first of all I'm castigated

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.719 
castigated first of all I'm castigated
by<00:04:16.139> people<00:04:16.530> on<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.680> right<00:04:16.769> who<00:04:16.829> say<00:04:17.159> you<00:04:17.639> were

by people on the right who say you were
never<00:04:17.909> real<00:04:18.269> conservative<00:04:18.959> course<00:04:19.289> they're

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
never real conservative course they're

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.560 
never real conservative course they're
right<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.620> never<00:04:19.919> was<00:04:20.130> real<00:04:20.430> conservative<00:04:21.090> but

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
right I never was real conservative but

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.390 
right I never was real conservative but
people<00:04:21.870> on<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.079> left<00:04:22.260> are<00:04:22.409> saying<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:23.190> had

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
people on the left are saying you had

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.260 
people on the left are saying you had
your<00:04:23.580> hand<00:04:23.789> in<00:04:23.880> this

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
your hand in this

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.869 
your hand in this
how<00:04:24.509> dare<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:24.870> change<00:04:25.169> sides<00:04:25.440> well<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.520> guess

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:26.879 
how dare you change sides well I guess

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:28.610 
how dare you change sides well I guess
the<00:04:27.030> answer<00:04:27.180> is<00:04:27.360> I'm<00:04:27.720> look<00:04:28.169> at<00:04:28.289> the<00:04:28.379> evidence

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
the answer is I'm look at the evidence

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.439 
the answer is I'm look at the evidence
I'm<00:04:28.979> not<00:04:29.220> on<00:04:29.370> anybody's<00:04:29.729> side<00:04:29.910> I'm<00:04:30.240> just

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
I'm not on anybody's side I'm just

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.170 
I'm not on anybody's side I'm just
trying<00:04:30.660> to<00:04:30.810> say<00:04:31.069> the<00:04:32.069> evidence<00:04:32.250> says<00:04:32.669> no<00:04:32.940> child

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
trying to say the evidence says no child

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.909 
trying to say the evidence says no child
left<00:04:33.300> behind<00:04:33.389> was<00:04:33.659> a<00:04:33.720> failure<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.349> the

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
left behind was a failure and the

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.010 
left behind was a failure and the
evidence<00:04:35.310> says<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:35.940> charter<00:04:36.539> schools<00:04:36.810> are

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
evidence says that charter schools are

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.529 
evidence says that charter schools are
going<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.319> lead<00:04:37.470> us<00:04:37.500> into<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.860> swamp<00:04:38.190> of<00:04:38.539> well

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
going to lead us into a swamp of well

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:40.550 
going to lead us into a swamp of well
first<00:04:39.750> of<00:04:39.870> all<00:04:39.900> there's<00:04:40.080> not<00:04:40.169> going<00:04:40.259> to<00:04:40.319> be<00:04:40.379> any

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
first of all there's not going to be any

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.409 
first of all there's not going to be any
better<00:04:40.740> because<00:04:41.550> if<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:41.789> look<00:04:41.940> at<00:04:42.060> national

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
better because if you look at national

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.749 
better because if you look at national
test<00:04:42.629> scores<00:04:43.129> charter<00:04:44.129> schools<00:04:44.159> were<00:04:44.490> first

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
didn't do any better than regular

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.930

charters regular public schools they

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.080 
charters regular public schools they
were<00:04:51.060> tested<00:04:51.419> again<00:04:51.599> in<00:04:51.750> 2005<00:04:52.849> 2007-2009<00:04:53.849> they
