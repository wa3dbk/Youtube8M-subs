00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.800
 this week is about how hard it is 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.840
 is the perfect game to create 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.370
 Of course, it always makes fun with youtube 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.170
 or other websites about games next to 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.670
 Commissioner to blaspheme player 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.350
 write thing lies this open world 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.699
 Game is way too boring or you 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.250
 post the game leaves no 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.500
 possibilities way too linear or that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.720
 cover system shit or boring 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.099
 story, of course, it is 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.570
 difficult to create perfect 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.219
 some hold his agent of zelda 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.000
 ocarina of time for one of the best 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.000
 games of all times 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.280
 the funny thing is i always thought of as 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.719
 my subjective opinion would be that 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.399
 ocarina of time the best game of all 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.840
 time is and at the store for 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.230
 this cage or I read that ocarina of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.239
 time 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.039
 according to the website with a meter criticism 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.750
 average score of 99 percent 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.610
 the highest rated video game of all 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.500
 Times is the game has been worldwide 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.149
 76 million times sold the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.250
 financially successful cell 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.799
 for him at that time also time a milestone 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.939
 what graphics sound and gameplay was concerned 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.740
 roleplaying adventure is still 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.900
 awesome and I always feel like it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.549
 but on top of that is the best game of all 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.409
 That's what it's all about 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.450
 I mean the game is from 98 and 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.530
 since then thousands of new ones are good 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.530
 come-thought-out game 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.390
 to 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.460
 There have been many games in recent years 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.020
 pretty successful minecraft is a 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.850
 obvious example but also if 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.710
 The game is loved by many there 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.899
 there are also some fit the team 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.729
 because of the openworld of the blocks graphic 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.350
 and so on for a while I have the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.000
 let's play strong as he still does 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.979
 every day a full community lex 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.570
 gave place and I got that 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.679
 like 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.470
 how much time some people are there 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.210
 put in some stand on shooter 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.009
 The bioshock others prefer online 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.929
 games like jersey or world of warcraft 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.000
 It's a super difficult game 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.759
 to tailor that everyone likes 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.560
 Good example is take the walking dead 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.630
 this is an episode adventure and will 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.009
 at the moment in the sky praised chunks 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.500
 this is not a classic adventure 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.179
 but almost an interactive movie 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.340
 interactive zombie movie at the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.890
 characters whose development is emotions 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.060
 and actions at the center are clear 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.739
 Are you scared of one or the other ? 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.690
 others ask but you can weeks 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.700
 will not compare, for example, left 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.220
 for dead left for dead is much faster 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.170
 and mainly shooter hey the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.660
 walking dead friend click adventure 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.579
 some like the other hate point and 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.579
 click and the linear felt gameplay 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.180
 so many games for so many people 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:44.189
 my ideal game would be comic please 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.040
 style adventure mixed with horror 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.569
 Do not puzzle to story funny and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.790
 alternately fast and slow in the 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.790
 ok and aqua dirty jokes 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.750
 Many Thanks 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.189
 hello what do we have there then that is 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.730
 do you only rejoice or rejoice in me? 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.980
 see 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.290
 and what is and then benjamin flowers then 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.060
 you have to distinguish between playing 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.590
 like at shop online games video or 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.449
 maybe world of warcraft 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.010
 I would if I could choose 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.609
 always play with others 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.840
 on-line 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.120
 in the best case, every player is 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.069
 specialized you have always something to do 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.290
 laugh or how can someone else do that 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.090
 to be guilty of failure 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.980
 Developers design a game just for 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.239
 what kind of a game of 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.040
 what kind of games would you play 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.730
 be inspired and do not write 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.599
 on the gate 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.599
 until next week
