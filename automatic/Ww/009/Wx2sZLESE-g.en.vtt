kind of a nuisance to have to search

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.130 
kind of a nuisance to have to search
through<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.180> we're<00:00:24.720> going<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.900> try<00:00:25.080> to

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
through it and we're going to try to

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140 
through it and we're going to try to
eliminate<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.580> left<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.029> right

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
eliminate like the left and right

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.560 
eliminate like the left and right
speaker<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:28.050> center<00:00:28.380> speaker<00:00:28.680> just

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
speaker the center speaker just

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.510 
speaker the center speaker just
streamline<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.320> nice<00:00:31.769> sound

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
streamline it with like one nice sound

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.510 
streamline it with like one nice sound
system<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> Sony<00:00:37.500> system<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.190> has

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
system so the Sony system we have has

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.880 
system so the Sony system we have has
HDMI<00:00:39.120> import<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.230> use<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
HDMI import so you can use it as like a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.950 
HDMI import so you can use it as like a
receiver<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.579> switcher<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.660> we're<00:00:42.809> going

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
receiver and switcher what we're going

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.720 
receiver and switcher what we're going
to<00:00:42.989> try<00:00:43.140> today<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.219> use<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.610> as

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
to try today is just to use it as

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.000 
to try today is just to use it as
something<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.780> receives<00:00:46.260> audio<00:00:46.649> from<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
something that receives audio from the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.389 
something that receives audio from the
TV<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.940> an<00:00:48.059> optical<00:00:48.539> cable<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
TV be an optical cable so this is the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.010 
TV be an optical cable so this is the
optical<00:00:50.879> cable<00:00:51.059> we're<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.570> use<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.930> go

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
optical cable we're going to use to go

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.209 
optical cable we're going to use to go
from<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.620> TV<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.190> into<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> sound<00:00:53.879> bar<00:00:58.219> okay

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
from the TV and into the sound bar okay

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.790 
from the TV and into the sound bar okay
so<00:00:59.280> one<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> problems<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.109> read<00:01:01.350> about<00:01:01.469> is

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
so one of the problems I read about is

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
so one of the problems I read about is
that<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> optical<00:01:02.579> cable<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> split

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
that the optical cable can have a split

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.899 
that the optical cable can have a split
second<00:01:04.350> delay<00:01:04.680> we're<00:01:05.189> going<00:01:05.400> into<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> sound

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
second delay we're going into the sound

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.810 
second delay we're going into the sound
and<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:07.260> we're<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.580> thing

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and then we're going to go to this thing

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.960 
and then we're going to go to this thing
called<00:01:08.930> s/pdif<00:01:09.930> output<00:01:10.470> no<00:01:11.280> idea<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
called s/pdif output no idea what that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.090 
called s/pdif output no idea what that
means<00:01:12.290> but<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.619> need<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:13.979> have

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
means but it's what we need and we have

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.490 
means but it's what we need and we have
to<00:01:14.189> go<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> audio<00:01:14.909> delay<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.439> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
to go here to the audio delay and so you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.370 
to go here to the audio delay and so you
just<00:01:16.740> want<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> adjust<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.869> it<00:01:18.869> slows<00:01:19.229> that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
just want to adjust that it slows that

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
just want to adjust that it slows that

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.469 
would be yeah okay so after some
tinkering<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.280> finally<00:02:02.640> got<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> all<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.329> work

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
tinkering you finally got it all to work

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
tinkering you finally got it all to work
we<00:02:04.049> ended<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:04.350> not<00:02:04.409> going<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> optical

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
we ended up not going with the optical

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.429 
we ended up not going with the optical
cable<00:02:06.060> because<00:02:06.329> there<00:02:06.479> was<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> delay<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.290> we

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
cable because there was a delay and we

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.919 
cable because there was a delay and we
couldn't<00:02:07.680> fix<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.879> instead<00:02:09.330> decided<00:02:09.720> to

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
couldn't fix it so we instead decided to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.140 
couldn't fix it so we instead decided to
go<00:02:10.050> with<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> HDMI<00:02:10.979> through<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.670> sound<00:02:11.910> bar

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
go with the HDMI through the sound bar

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.700 
go with the HDMI through the sound bar
into<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
into the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.010 
into the
essentially<00:02:13.430> making<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.850> soundbar<00:02:14.330> the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
essentially making the soundbar the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.190 
essentially making the soundbar the
input<00:02:15.470> controller<00:02:16.030> after<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.480> got<00:02:17.690> done<00:02:17.930> the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
input controller after that got done the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.690 
input controller after that got done the
other<00:02:18.410> hard<00:02:18.710> thing<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.920> figure<00:02:19.130> out<00:02:19.340> was<00:02:19.520> how

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
other hard thing to figure out was how

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.220 
other hard thing to figure out was how
do<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.850> connect<00:02:20.180> your<00:02:20.300> remote<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.020> sound

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
do you connect your remote to the sound

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.630 
do you connect your remote to the sound
bar<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.710> don't<00:02:21.890> have<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.160> keep<00:02:22.280> using

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
bar so you don't have to keep using

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.180 
bar so you don't have to keep using
different<00:02:22.910> remotes<00:02:23.180> not<00:02:23.480> too<00:02:24.080> hard<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.650> our

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
different remotes not too hard in our

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.590 
different remotes not too hard in our
case<00:02:25.400> with<00:02:25.580> Comcast<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:26.240> have<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.420> go<00:02:26.540> to

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
case with Comcast you have to go to

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.380

it<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.210> it's<00:02:41.750> still<00:02:42.020> not<00:02:42.110> going<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.320> be<00:02:42.410> easy

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
it is it's still not going to be easy

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.320 
it is it's still not going to be easy
for<00:02:42.890> everybody<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.430> do<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.060> reason

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
for everybody to do this and the reason

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.550 
for everybody to do this and the reason
for<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.750> because<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:45.020> got<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.440> many

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
for that is because you got so many

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.050 
for that is because you got so many
different<00:02:45.680> components<00:02:46.400> talking<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:46.940> each

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
different components talking to each

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.910 
different components talking to each
other<00:02:47.240> and<00:02:47.810> be<00:02:47.990> prepared<00:02:48.380> for<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.710> take<00:02:48.890> a

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
other and be prepared for it to take a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.470 
other and be prepared for it to take a
few<00:02:49.160> hours<00:02:49.460> to<00:02:49.580> do<00:02:49.700> because<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.120> does<00:02:50.270> take

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
few hours to do because it does take

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.330 
few hours to do because it does take
some<00:02:50.510> figuring<00:02:50.750> out<00:02:51.080> anyways<00:02:51.920> I'm<00:02:52.070> Daniel

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
some figuring out anyways I'm Daniel
