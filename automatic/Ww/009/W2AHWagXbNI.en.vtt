 These cute little stones for girls 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.340
 they are in this opportunity they have flowers 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.439
 We are going to make another artificial 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.090
 design of flowers that we are going to 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.740
 teach him I know that you know 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.140
 do but for those new girls 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.260
 who come to the channel to learn it 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.260
 to do we are going to use this cord that 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.140
 we have already bought it so it is a color a 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.650
 grade cord where they come different 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.140
 alone 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.360
 good in variety of colors so that 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.550
 you ask 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.550
 if you do not get in this kind of 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.160
 braided laces thin you 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.650
 can use what is mouse tail 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.660
 that comes thin or thick can 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.970
 use any other kind of subject 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.820
 of the leather so that you can 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.880
 make a normal braid and so on 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.860
 elaborate these beautiful lands you have to 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.930
 make them a nudity because when you 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.780
 purchase then they start to drop out 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.430
 they do the knots and you just 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.430
 they cut what are the little tips 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.210
 that you look good, you have to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.580
 seal the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.070
 and so you do not know what is damaging what they are 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.040
 the tips of the lands here 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.920
 we have simply cut by meters 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.729
 to be able to now the earth cut it by 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.220
 meters fold it in half like the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.399
 we have here and we are going to use in this 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.550
 opportunity a shakira or a donut 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.710
 plastic we introduce this we will 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.110
 serve to hold what is the future of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.720
 the head of the girls there you 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.899
 take the measure of the little head is the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.800
 girl and they make a knot the one that will help 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.070
 to hold and that they are very accurate 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.610
 the little girl's head can use 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.979
 these beautiful plastic you can use 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.110
 these metal or can make a knot 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.060
 I slip so you can 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.399
 use what is the earth 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.430
 we are going to teach you how to elaborate here 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.590
 little flowers we are going to paste these flowers 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.140

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.360
 do in any large flower class 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.670
 or small this is an idea so that 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.030

 or so that your ideas shine in any 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.950
 opportunity we will use 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.819
 what we have here tape 2 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.489
 centimeters and you can use it from 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.310
 satin or you can use the gross tape 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.379

 we are going to show you again how 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:55.970
 do we are going to bend the tip 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.970
 when we get to half we start to roll it 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.070
 you can go using a needle and 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.100
 thread or you can just stick with 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.950
 hot silicone or hot silicone each 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.920
 once they go rolling up so that for 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.390
 they holding the flower when they have 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.320
 made the roll that is going to be the center 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.360
 let's start folding the ribbon 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.920
 this way and we are starting to 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.480
 roll in the center of the flower 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.250
 we keep sticking silicone and stick it 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.060
 again we bend and roll is 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.340
 just fold tape roll it up and 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.560
 paste it with silicone the size that 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.470
 you want there they are forming what 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.150
 what is the little flower so that you 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.950
 encourage girls who have not been able 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:50.670
 elaborate the can do continue to bend 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.480
 they are sticking in the center of the flower and 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.480
 we are hitting 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.280
 here the process is 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.790
 consecutive to be encouraged and the 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.830

 much prettier 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.630
 we continue bending and hitting 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.349
 the size you no longer decide 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.030

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.720
 make the flowers simply 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.669
 cut they have to look at how much of 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.699
 ribbons they will use to make 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.919
 cut across the tape and that all 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.440
 the flowers of the same size you there 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.330
 you already liked you two tape 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.610
 centimeters so that they remain large 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.520
 appointments and I'm going to show you the 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.310
 miniature flowers if you the 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.319
 they want to make more little ones for 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.639
 end simply you apply 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.979
 silicone in the end 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.110
 pitt the little part at the end they're going to 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.289
 stick on the back 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.199
 there it is already hidden and the 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:19.740
 little flowers to finish the little flowers 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:22.979
 that those who plan and so short what 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.620
 it's the back quote part and they seal with 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.080
 the heat in this way is not going to 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.389
 drop and the heat helps you to fix in 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.620
 the tapes and do not break down the 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.690
 little flower then here we already have 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.760

 to start hitting just like now 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.889
 we have half of it from then on 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.569
 let's start using silicone 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.860
 hot 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.860
 let's paste 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.759
 and from there we will be guided where 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.759
 let's keep hitting the flowers 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.810
 try that the little flower is left 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.240
 planet so they can work it 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.940
