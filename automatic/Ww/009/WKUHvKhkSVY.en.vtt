00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
move away go somewhere else I told her

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.560 
move away go somewhere else I told her
that<00:05:49.479> would<00:05:49.900> be<00:05:50.169> nonsense<00:05:50.919> as<00:05:51.340> long<00:05:52.150> as<00:05:52.389> we

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
that would be nonsense as long as we

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.890 
that would be nonsense as long as we

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
I thought it would be best if uh if we

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.170 
I thought it would be best if uh if we
report<00:05:58.960> it<00:05:59.169> to<00:05:59.320> the<00:05:59.440> local<00:05:59.770> authorities<00:06:00.310> the

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
forth and thought that if they didn't

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.689 
forth and thought that if they didn't
bother<00:06:37.570> it<00:06:37.960> it<00:06:38.259> would<00:06:38.560> not<00:06:38.770> bother<00:06:39.009> them<00:06:39.340> and
