 Here is the video Ten Tips for Long 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.990
 and clicked nails 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.630
 I hope you really like the number 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.889
 One thing does not think you can do it in one 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.139
 Month nice and neat nails 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.809
 because you need it 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.640
 at least half a year because you have to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.369
 they had to imagine themselves 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.830
 yes get strong and then they have to first 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.359
 grow and that takes just 2 there is 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.529
 something you can do with that nails 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.349
 abgewÃ¶hnen 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.940
 that is, see the nail polish you do it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.170
 on the fingernails on it and man 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.040
 It always tastes bitter when you drink it 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.250
 wants to reduce 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.440
 and that really helps number three 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.239
 more nails regularly than they 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.879
 first have to become strong before they 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.920
 be long 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:54.960
 Number four nibble or don't 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.610
 because of track trade rules and new 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.770
 then it takes forever to nails 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.180
 strong only 5 times when you think of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.339
 The nails are tight enough 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.320
 let it slowly but are long 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.630
 only very slowly because otherwise they break 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.560
 immediately back to normal 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.299
 6 nails also have to be free 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.759
 does not mark constantly because they need 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.380
 they also become airborne 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.170
 Thicker because they get more oxygen 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.390
 7 Whether he has strong nails 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.909
 sometimes keeping parents open is called 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.110
 if you have strong nails you have 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.070
 Also which eight pushes a nail 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.900
 Noisy that's the bottom of it 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.979
 because the hands mark and see 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.979
 just not good for this one uses 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.110
 a pencil case the more crooked and off 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.610
 rubber i know i'm so good at seeing 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.310
 so here and now comes a pen 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.979
 So what made firstly made this 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.040
 cuticle just way back 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:06.400
 then push 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.040
 until such a small one dies and there 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:15.280
 come something like that out of the 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:17.050
 p2 by the way bamboo peeling so you turn 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.860
 learning a bit comes here like this 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.880
 This is what you do on the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.330
 So, moving away is a and 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.400
 then the skin is easy to open and 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.400
 yes that it really pin this me 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:41.430
 love the really getting 9 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.900
 So a pen and so does 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.140
 that was a bit deep and had 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.730
 his little bristles turn has indeed such a 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.280
 small hole there is also something 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.220
 gillard is out you turn here because 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.430
 then it comes out and that is for this 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.340
 dinger here some have it so this 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.270
 skin leftovers here and there and no idea 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.269
 monday it happens because there is such a let 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.940
 it massages it dry again and then 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.290
 are these things gone that sounds like 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.260
 bit weird but are getting 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.230
 Perfect then they dissolve and that 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.590
 is cool because I believe that has these things 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.590
 everyone 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:29.120
 So number 10 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.920
 That this trick is used with the 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.189
 Nails grow faster so they are firmer 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.799
 Be heard as good as you need one 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.780
 bowl with warm water on it makes you 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.870
 a pot in need but not anymore 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.659
 the commercial nails money and that looks 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.200
 not good then dry needs yes 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:51.200
 all reefs salt the salt and 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.720
 has snapped off and then 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.510
 made the nails clean that she was me 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.430
 then the nails fall off glass or 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.540
 Plastic case not with metal or 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.090
 a scissors make away 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.540
 then the spd makes off there you do it 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.540

 finished so nails grow faster and faster 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.079
