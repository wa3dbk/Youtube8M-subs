Tony he'll drop so we lose that here so

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:32.770 
Tony he'll drop so we lose that here so
that's<00:00:31.939> going<00:00:32.090> to<00:00:32.149> give<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:32.419> little<00:00:32.629> bit

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
that's going to give you a little bit

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.540 
that's going to give you a little bit
extra<00:00:32.899> power<00:00:33.260> as<00:00:33.500> he's<00:00:33.829> coming<00:00:34.010> through<00:00:34.190> under

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
extra power as he's coming through under

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.580 
extra power as he's coming through under
the<00:00:34.670> hips<00:00:34.850> because<00:00:35.840> you're<00:00:36.020> standing<00:00:36.350> on<00:00:36.469> the

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
the hips because you're standing on the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.920 
the hips because you're standing on the
back<00:00:36.770> end<00:00:37.070> of<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:37.250> camber<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.030> what<00:00:38.690> kind<00:00:38.870> of

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
back end of the camber so what kind of

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.139 
back end of the camber so what kind of
creates<00:00:39.170> a<00:00:39.260> little<00:00:39.379> bit<00:00:39.500> in-<00:00:40.489> ramp<00:00:40.760> angle<00:00:40.910> on

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
creates a little bit in- ramp angle on

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.020 
creates a little bit in- ramp angle on
this<00:00:41.269> thing<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:41.570> just<00:00:42.079> allow<00:00:42.440> six

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
this thing so just allow six

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.450 
this thing so just allow six
over<00:00:44.449> the<00:00:44.539> case<00:00:44.690> of<00:00:44.899> you<00:00:45.020> know<00:00:45.140> 15<00:00:45.350> or<00:00:45.590> 30<00:00:45.920> k<00:00:46.190> he

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
over the case of you know 15 or 30 k he

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.209 
over the case of you know 15 or 30 k he
started<00:00:46.760> getting<00:00:47.120> some<00:00:47.210> extra<00:00:47.420> bonus<00:00:47.809> I<00:00:47.960> said

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
started getting some extra bonus I said

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.590 
started getting some extra bonus I said
we're<00:00:49.219> also<00:00:49.340> able<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:49.760> put<00:00:49.910> a<00:00:49.940> carbon<00:00:50.329> played

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
we're also able to put a carbon played

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600 
we're also able to put a carbon played
in<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.870> soil<00:00:51.110> helps<00:00:51.710> to<00:00:51.920> increase<00:00:52.100> the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
in the soil helps to increase the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.329 
in the soil helps to increase the
longitude<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:53.809> torsional<00:00:54.530> rigidity<00:00:54.680> of<00:00:55.190> this

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
longitude and torsional rigidity of this

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.670 
longitude and torsional rigidity of this
product<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.180> it's<00:00:56.420> a<00:00:56.480> lot<00:00:56.660> of<00:00:56.690> energy<00:00:56.930> bacala

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
product so it's a lot of energy bacala

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.399 
product so it's a lot of energy bacala
the<00:00:57.860> scheme<00:00:58.250> he's<00:00:58.519> a<00:00:58.550> very<00:00:58.670> responsive<00:00:59.539> this

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
the scheme he's a very responsive this

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.259 
the scheme he's a very responsive this
soul<00:01:00.710> is<00:01:00.920> 20<00:01:01.250> grams<00:01:01.489> lighter<00:01:01.760> than<00:01:02.120> the

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
soul is 20 grams lighter than the

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.700 
soul is 20 grams lighter than the
previous<00:01:02.379> so<00:01:03.379> we<00:01:03.559> have<00:01:03.680> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
previous so we have a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.190 
previous so we have a

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
much later when Alou

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.080 
much later when Alou
in<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.710> XE<00:01:06.950> om<00:01:07.039> scheme<00:01:07.340> we<00:01:07.520> also<00:01:07.640> have<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:07.909> new

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
in the XE om scheme we also have a new

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.700 
in the XE om scheme we also have a new
carbon<00:01:08.539> cuff<00:01:08.780> this<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.350> one<00:01:09.500> hundred

carbon cuff this is a one hundred

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.039 
carbon cuff this is a one hundred
percent<00:01:09.740> carbon<00:01:10.189> it's<00:01:10.520> extremely<00:01:11.060> thin<00:01:11.390> it's

percent carbon it's extremely thin it's

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.139 
percent carbon it's extremely thin it's
very<00:01:12.350> anatomically<00:01:12.860> shape<00:01:13.579> so<00:01:13.909> it<00:01:13.939> matches

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
very anatomically shape so it matches

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.450 
very anatomically shape so it matches
the<00:01:14.390> medial<00:01:14.899> lateral<00:01:15.229> sides<00:01:15.679> of<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:15.950> leg<00:01:16.159> very

your foot you put it on a little heater
and<00:01:26.990> it<00:01:27.079> holds<00:01:27.259> up<00:01:27.500> we've<00:01:28.100> done<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.340> few<00:01:28.610> tweaks

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
and it holds up we've done a few tweaks

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.319 
and it holds up we've done a few tweaks
to<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.270> lacing<00:01:29.780> system<00:01:30.640> we've<00:01:31.640> changed<00:01:31.969> the

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
to the lacing system we've changed the

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.020 
to the lacing system we've changed the
attachment<00:01:33.140> in<00:01:33.319> the<00:01:33.380> angles<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.310> this<00:01:34.490> webbing

attachment in the angles of this webbing
so<00:01:35.299> how<00:01:35.509> it's<00:01:35.719> coming<00:01:35.929> in<00:01:36.140> on<00:01:36.289> the<00:01:36.319> foot<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:36.860> it

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
so how it's coming in on the foot and it

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.160 
so how it's coming in on the foot and it
moves<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.520> whole<00:01:37.729> lacing<00:01:38.119> over<00:01:38.539> to<00:01:38.899> the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
moves the whole lacing over to the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.410 
moves the whole lacing over to the
lateral<00:01:40.039> side<00:01:40.159> of<00:01:40.459> the<00:01:40.520> foot<00:01:40.759> a<00:01:40.789> bit<00:01:40.880> which

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
lateral side of the foot a bit which

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.149 
lateral side of the foot a bit which
helps<00:01:41.720> alleviate<00:01:42.470> some<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:42.979> pressure

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
helps alleviate some of the pressure

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.889 
helps alleviate some of the pressure
points<00:01:43.549> that<00:01:43.580> can<00:01:43.700> happen<00:01:43.939> in<00:01:44.179> this<00:01:44.299> area<00:01:44.659> here

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899

and<00:03:34.700> less<00:03:34.850> like<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.240> do<00:03:35.300> so<00:03:36.140> they<00:03:36.380> fit<00:03:36.590> close<00:03:36.860> to

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
and less like I do so they fit close to

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.550 
and less like I do so they fit close to
the<00:03:37.160> foot<00:03:37.400> very<00:03:38.300> thin<00:03:38.630> padding<00:03:39.110> it's<00:03:39.440> all

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
the foot very thin padding it's all

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.320 
the foot very thin padding it's all
about<00:03:39.590> performance<00:03:40.870> he<00:03:41.870> bolted<00:03:42.200> liner<00:03:42.470> and

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
about performance he bolted liner and

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.720 
about performance he bolted liner and
it's<00:03:44.330> about<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:45.100> yep<00:03:46.100> so<00:03:46.310> we<00:03:46.430> have<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.550> new

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
it's about it yep so we have a new

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.910 
it's about it yep so we have a new
classics<00:03:47.240> key<00:03:47.420> for<00:03:47.660> this<00:03:47.750> year<00:03:48.020> we've<00:03:48.740> done<00:03:48.890> a

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
classics key for this year we've done a

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.560 
classics key for this year we've done a
couple<00:03:49.010> things<00:03:49.430> we've<00:03:49.640> added<00:03:49.820> some<00:03:50.000> abs

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
couple things we've added some abs

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.500 
couple things we've added some abs
material<00:03:50.780> under<00:03:51.560> kick<00:03:52.489> zone<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:53.239> is<00:03:53.360> going

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
material under kick zone this is going

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.180 
material under kick zone this is going
to<00:03:53.600> help<00:03:54.050> with<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.260> few<00:03:54.530> things<00:03:54.709> one<00:03:55.040> it

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
to help with a few things one it

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.860 
to help with a few things one it
increases<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:55.700> torsional<00:03:56.209> rigidity<00:03:56.360> of<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
increases the torsional rigidity of the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.750 
increases the torsional rigidity of the
skis<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:57.440> this<00:03:57.560> skis<00:03:57.770> like<00:03:57.800> a<00:03:57.950> twist<00:03:58.459> side<00:03:58.730> to

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
skis so this skis like a twist side to

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.390 
skis so this skis like a twist side to
side<00:03:59.120> as<00:03:59.330> much<00:03:59.570> as<00:03:59.810> they<00:03:59.930> do<00:04:00.080> in<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.350> past<00:04:00.590> it

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
side as much as they do in the past it

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.210 
side as much as they do in the past it
also<00:04:01.580> helps<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.090> regulate<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.950> camera<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.100> the

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
also helps to regulate the camera of the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.920 
also helps to regulate the camera of the
ski<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:04.700> it's<00:04:04.850> a<00:04:04.940> little<00:04:05.090> more<00:04:05.300> consistent

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
ski so it's a little more consistent

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.870 
ski so it's a little more consistent
through<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.170> manufacturing<00:04:06.860> process<00:04:06.890> it

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
through the manufacturing process it

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.060 
through the manufacturing process it
also<00:04:08.180> allows<00:04:08.450> for<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.780> nice<00:04:08.959> smooth<00:04:09.320> transition

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
also allows for a nice smooth transition

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.340 
also allows for a nice smooth transition
from<00:04:10.100> cameras<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:10.940> lights<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.989> we're<00:04:12.230> not

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
from cameras and lights so we're not

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.290 
from cameras and lights so we're not
going<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.590> plow<00:04:12.830> some<00:04:13.280> soft<00:04:13.489> snow<00:04:13.760> as<00:04:13.940> much<00:04:14.120> by

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
going to plow some soft snow as much by

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.259 
going to plow some soft snow as much by
having<00:04:14.540> some<00:04:14.690> hinge<00:04:14.870> points<00:04:15.230> up

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
having some hinge points up

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.240 
having some hinge points up
so<00:04:16.690> that's<00:04:16.870> this<00:04:17.019> white<00:04:17.319> red<00:04:17.680> material<00:04:18.009> you

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
so that's this white red material you

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.520 
so that's this white red material you
see<00:04:18.430> here<00:04:18.669> we<00:04:18.849> call<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.150> by<00:04:19.359> edge<00:04:19.569> it<00:04:20.259> just

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
see here we call it by edge it just

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.219 
see here we call it by edge it just
helps<00:04:20.739> with<00:04:21.099> the<00:04:21.449> overall<00:04:22.449> construction<00:04:22.810> of

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
helps with the overall construction of

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.680 
helps with the overall construction of
whiskey<00:04:23.680> it's<00:04:24.490> also<00:04:24.639> another<00:04:25.120> thing<00:04:25.300> that

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
whiskey it's also another thing that

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.899 
whiskey it's also another thing that
we're<00:04:25.870> doing<00:04:25.900> now<00:04:26.319> it's<00:04:26.560> our<00:04:26.949> trip<00:04:27.250> this<00:04:27.729> is

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
we're doing now it's our trip this is

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.930 
we're doing now it's our trip this is
the<00:04:28.060> wax<00:04:28.270> list<00:04:28.659> so<00:04:28.840> right<00:04:29.050> now<00:04:29.310> for<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.400> 11-12

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
the wax list so right now for the 11-12

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.640 
the wax list so right now for the 11-12
season<00:04:31.300> we<00:04:31.389> have<00:04:31.509> a<00:04:31.539> rubber<00:04:31.840> skin<00:04:32.199> that<00:04:32.440> has

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
season we have a rubber skin that has

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.740 
season we have a rubber skin that has
little<00:04:32.949> pieces<00:04:33.280> of<00:04:33.460> rubber<00:04:33.759> built<00:04:34.210> in<00:04:34.449> tonight

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
little pieces of rubber built in tonight

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.100 
little pieces of rubber built in tonight
that<00:04:35.259> creates<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.680> grip<00:04:36.039> on<00:04:36.759> snow<00:04:37.240> this

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
that creates the grip on snow this

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.619 
that creates the grip on snow this
technology<00:04:39.009> is<00:04:39.039> evolving<00:04:39.340> all<00:04:39.819> the<00:04:40.000> time<00:04:40.240> and

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
technology is evolving all the time and

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.570 
technology is evolving all the time and
this<00:04:41.020> is<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.349> newest<00:04:41.710> version<00:04:41.770> of<00:04:42.220> that<00:04:42.250> this

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
this is the newest version of that this

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.820 
this is the newest version of that this
is<00:04:42.729> basically<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.210> really<00:04:43.720> really<00:04:43.900> soft<00:04:44.319> base

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
is basically a really really soft base

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.830 
is basically a really really soft base
material<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.940> you<00:04:46.090> would<00:04:46.270> sand<00:04:46.599> it<00:04:46.810> and

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
material and you would sand it and

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.450 
material and you would sand it and
create<00:04:47.289> the<00:04:47.470> patterns<00:04:47.979> get<00:04:48.159> your<00:04:48.310> little

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
create the patterns get your little

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.219 
create the patterns get your little
hairs<00:04:48.759> on<00:04:48.970> those<00:04:49.120> that<00:04:49.389> provide<00:04:49.599> to<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:49.960> grill

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
hairs on those that provide to the grill

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.260 
hairs on those that provide to the grill
what's<00:04:50.949> interesting<00:04:51.130> about<00:04:51.550> this<00:04:51.819> because<00:04:52.000> it

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
what's interesting about this because it

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.909 
what's interesting about this because it
is<00:04:52.300> base<00:04:52.630> material<00:04:53.139> you<00:04:53.440> can<00:04:53.560> run<00:04:53.770> this

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
is base material you can run this

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.950 
is base material you can run this
through<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.220> stump<00:04:54.490> grinder<00:04:54.970> if<00:04:55.509> you<00:04:55.630> need<00:04:55.810> to

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
through a stump grinder if you need to

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.439 
through a stump grinder if you need to
restructure<00:04:56.680> your<00:04:56.830> skis<00:04:57.220> you<00:04:57.849> can<00:04:58.000> also<00:04:58.180> take

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
restructure your skis you can also take

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.930 
restructure your skis you can also take
a<00:04:58.479> metal<00:04:58.840> scraper<00:04:59.139> knock<00:04:59.770> this<00:05:00.039> down<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.699> put

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
a metal scraper knock this down and put

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.120 
a metal scraper knock this down and put
a<00:05:00.970> hard<00:05:01.210> wax<00:05:01.389> so<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.050> can<00:05:02.259> treat<00:05:02.470> this<00:05:02.650> as<00:05:02.800> wax

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
a hard wax so you can treat this as wax

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.309 
a hard wax so you can treat this as wax
it<00:05:03.340> will<00:05:03.460> see<00:05:03.580> as<00:05:03.789> well<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:04.690> if<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:04.960> needed<00:05:05.259> to

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
it will see as well so if you needed to

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.200 
it will see as well so if you needed to
have<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.500> one<00:05:05.800> ski<00:05:06.039> Weber<00:05:06.400> you<00:05:06.669> can<00:05:06.819> now<00:05:06.970> have

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
have a one ski Weber you can now have

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.360 
have a one ski Weber you can now have
this<00:05:07.479> is<00:05:07.599> a<00:05:07.630> SI<00:05:07.930> toos<00:05:08.199> this<00:05:08.590> is<00:05:08.710> our<00:05:08.860> Universal

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
this is a SI toos this is our Universal

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.459 
this is a SI toos this is our Universal
camber<00:05:09.759> so<00:05:10.240> you<00:05:10.300> can<00:05:10.479> have<00:05:10.659> it<00:05:10.780> as<00:05:10.900> in<00:05:11.139> a<00:05:11.199> wax

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469

much<00:06:07.060> higher<00:06:07.270> performance<00:06:07.930> and<00:06:08.169> then

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
much higher performance and then

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.940 
much higher performance and then

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
appropriate sizes

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.410

okay<00:06:11.520> so<00:06:12.560> awesome<00:06:13.560> and<00:06:13.770> is<00:06:13.920> it<00:06:14.100> so<00:06:15.000> i<00:06:15.030> guess<00:06:15.210> the

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
okay so awesome and is it so i guess the

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.260 
okay so awesome and is it so i guess the
difference<00:06:15.720> between<00:06:15.870> this<00:06:16.410> and<00:06:16.680> like<00:06:17.270> an

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
difference between this and like an

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.020 
difference between this and like an
adult<00:06:18.690> axiom<00:06:19.200> is<00:06:19.470> the<00:06:20.070> base<00:06:20.250> material<00:06:20.820> or<00:06:21.000> the

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
adult axiom is the base material or the

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.550 
adult axiom is the base material or the
construction<00:06:21.510> oh<00:06:21.570> the<00:06:21.780> base<00:06:21.990> materials<00:06:22.500> the

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
construction oh the base materials the

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.920 
construction oh the base materials the
same<00:06:22.770> other<00:06:23.570> constructions<00:06:24.570> are<00:06:24.750> very

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
same other constructions are very

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.640 
same other constructions are very
similar<00:06:25.290> it's<00:06:26.250> the<00:06:26.460> overall<00:06:27.380> inflexible<00:06:28.380> skis

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
similar it's the overall inflexible skis

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.710 
similar it's the overall inflexible skis
this<00:06:29.010> is<00:06:29.130> going<00:06:29.250> to<00:06:29.340> be<00:06:29.430> a<00:06:29.490> soft<00:06:29.850> or<00:06:30.120> skiing<00:06:30.420> in

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
this is going to be a soft or skiing in

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.480 
this is going to be a soft or skiing in
general<00:06:31.470> just<00:06:31.500> because<00:06:31.920> the<00:06:32.010> size<00:06:32.220> of<00:06:32.400> the

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
general just because the size of the

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.390 
general just because the size of the
athletes<00:06:32.790> going<00:06:33.030> to<00:06:33.090> be<00:06:33.770> so<00:06:34.770> this<00:06:34.950> will<00:06:35.130> flex

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
athletes going to be so this will flex
