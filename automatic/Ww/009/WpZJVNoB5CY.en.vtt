00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 and hello to everyone in this issue 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.830
 I tell what the plastic and how it 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.960
 burn as it is very, very often 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.710
 question I will tell everything very and very 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.710
 in detail 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.710
 For starters, I'll tell you what 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.349
 plastic plastic is a material that 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.270
 very much like a bed no more 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.930
 loose structure but so be it 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.540
 you do not exchange it after kneading 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.980
 plastic becomes very, very soft 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.980
 you can make anything out of it 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:52.530
 absolutely everything can be done with plastic 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.530
 starting with hairstyles and ending already 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.579
 but in this issue I will only tell you about 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.250
 how to give a solid state for 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.909
 we need this foil and 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.329
 respectively, the plastic itself 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.869
 even if you have foil you need to do it 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:14.119
 presence of adults so I will show you 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.520
 so burn the example of this 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.350
 foil molds I'll take a little bit 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.810
 plastics 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.810
 reasonable this don't like her foil 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.649
 we 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:41.030
 and so we can notice that plastic 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.400
 very soft and very easily deformed 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.400
 but we are this country 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.299
 so 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.040
 burn and must strictly presence 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.170
 adults 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.960
 do not even try yourself 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.020
 this also requires a little experience 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.020
 because the power is 1 1 so 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:16.550
 we take one match just in case 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.550
 can bring water 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.230
 set on fire 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.920
 take plastic and start typing 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.920
 tuck up 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.680
 when the plastic turns black to such 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.080
 states 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.870
 rest assured that she is ready for now 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.870
 she will not cool she will wait soft 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.370
 some time later when plastic 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.950
 cool you can check 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.680
 as far as we remember it was applied even 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.680
 from scissors what will happen now 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.900
 as well as any traces does not remain but if 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.630
 let's say she didn't bake 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.560
 how here we see that she is all 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.450
 equally crushed 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.450
 then you need to try again
