short<00:03:39.480> I'm<00:03:39.959> gonna<00:03:40.230> have<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.560> say<00:03:40.739> no<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:41.459> lack

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
short I'm gonna have to say no the lack

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.640 
short I'm gonna have to say no the lack
of<00:03:41.700> integrated<00:03:42.329> graphics<00:03:42.480> may<00:03:42.959> not<00:03:43.170> be<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.380> big

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
of integrated graphics may not be a big

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.190 
of integrated graphics may not be a big
deal<00:03:43.680> if<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.220> plan<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.459> use<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.700> GPU<00:03:45.150> anyway<00:03:45.630> but

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
deal if you plan to use a GPU anyway but

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.750 
deal if you plan to use a GPU anyway but
just<00:03:46.230> keep<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.709> mind<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:47.069> this<00:03:47.190> won't<00:03:47.489> allow

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
just keep in mind that this won't allow

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.599 
just keep in mind that this won't allow
you<00:03:47.819> to<00:03:48.090> use<00:03:48.209> any<00:03:48.389> other<00:03:48.630> PCI<00:03:49.319> accessories<00:03:49.980> the

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
USB freezing problem also bothers me as

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.860 
USB freezing problem also bothers me as
I'm<00:03:52.920> constantly<00:03:53.430> plugging<00:03:53.730> USB<00:03:54.239> devices<00:03:54.510> in

I'm constantly plugging USB devices in

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.690 
I'm constantly plugging USB devices in
and<00:03:55.019> out<00:03:55.109> of<00:03:55.230> my<00:03:55.319> machine<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.889> just<00:03:56.160> need<00:03:56.579> to

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
and out of my machine I just need to

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.490 
and out of my machine I just need to
know<00:03:56.819> what<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.060> system<00:03:57.420> won't<00:03:57.599> lock<00:03:57.900> up<00:03:58.109> on<00:03:58.260> me

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
know what the system won't lock up on me

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.800 
know what the system won't lock up on me
also<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.489> need<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.700> flash<00:04:00.030> or<00:04:00.239> BIOS<00:04:00.599> for

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
also the need of flash or BIOS for

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.210 
also the need of flash or BIOS for
native<00:04:01.109> power<00:04:01.380> management<00:04:01.680> isn't<00:04:02.130> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
native power management isn't the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.979 
native power management isn't the
optimal<00:04:02.700> solution<00:04:03.120> as<00:04:03.269> there's<00:04:03.540> always<00:04:03.690> some

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
optimal solution as there's always some

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.720 
optimal solution as there's always some
risk<00:04:04.139> involved<00:04:04.530> when<00:04:04.739> flashing<00:04:05.280> your<00:04:05.430> BIOS

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
risk involved when flashing your BIOS

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.059 
risk involved when flashing your BIOS
besides<00:04:06.540> those<00:04:06.720> three<00:04:06.989> things<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.560> have<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.920> say

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
besides those three things I have to say

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.740 
besides those three things I have to say
that<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.340> system<00:04:08.669> performed<00:04:09.180> pretty<00:04:09.450> well

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
that the system performed pretty well

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.930 
that the system performed pretty well
just<00:04:10.019> not<00:04:10.680> well<00:04:10.859> enough<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.130> recommend<00:04:11.549> for<00:04:11.910> a

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
just not well enough to recommend for a

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.909 
just not well enough to recommend for a
hackintosh<00:04:12.329> there's<00:04:12.989> simply<00:04:13.319> other<00:04:13.590> boards

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
hackintosh there's simply other boards

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.500 
hackintosh there's simply other boards
out<00:04:14.069> there<00:04:14.099> that<00:04:14.400> are<00:04:14.489> more<00:04:14.669> compatible<00:04:15.090> and

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
out there that are more compatible and

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.539 
out there that are more compatible and
cost<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.989> same<00:04:16.200> amount<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:16.769> now<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.190> guys

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
cost the same amount so now you guys

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.490 
cost the same amount so now you guys
know<00:04:17.820> what<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.030> think<00:04:18.329> about<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.630> asrock<00:04:19.139> be

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
know what I think about the asrock be

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.279 
know what I think about the asrock be
75m<00:04:20.370> ITX<00:04:20.970> motherboard<00:04:21.090> tell<00:04:21.959> me<00:04:22.049> what<00:04:22.200> you
