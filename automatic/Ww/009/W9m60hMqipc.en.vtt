00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that the search results will pretty much

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.600 
that the search results will pretty much
only<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.720> video<00:02:10.050> results<00:02:10.679> mainly<00:02:11.099> YouTube

which<00:02:18.540> would<00:02:18.780> be<00:02:18.870> pretty<00:02:19.080> cool<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.290> see

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
which would be pretty cool to see

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.260 
which would be pretty cool to see
implemented<00:02:19.950> here<00:02:20.370> especially<00:02:20.550> since<00:02:20.880> it

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
implemented here especially since it

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.690 
implemented here especially since it
does<00:02:21.510> link<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.020> your<00:02:22.170> Google<00:02:22.500> account<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.160> feel

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
like it would be possible and easy to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.050 
like it would be possible and easy to
implement<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:25.830> right<00:02:26.070> now<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.610> pretty

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
implement but right now it's pretty

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.360 
implement but right now it's pretty
basic<00:02:27.270> but<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.440> voice<00:02:28.620> search<00:02:28.890> functionality

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
basic but the voice search functionality

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.610 
basic but the voice search functionality
does<00:02:29.760> work<00:02:30.030> well<00:02:30.270> if<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:30.990> go<00:02:31.110> back<00:02:31.290> home

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
does work well if we go back home

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.590 
does work well if we go back home

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
combat 4 and asphalt 8 I do actually

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.500 
combat 4 and asphalt 8 I do actually
really<00:03:47.010> like<00:03:47.160> how<00:03:47.340> they<00:03:47.459> categorized<00:03:48.090> games

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
really like how they categorized games

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.810 
really like how they categorized games
for<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.050> gamepad<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.830> for<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.580> remote

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
for the gamepad and for the remote

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.280 
for the gamepad and for the remote
separately<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:51.720> can<00:03:51.810> actually<00:03:52.050> find

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
separately so that you can actually find

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.199 
separately so that you can actually find
the<00:03:52.380> games<00:03:52.590> for<00:03:52.920> each<00:03:53.100> input<00:03:53.370> device<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:54.090> your

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
the games for each input device of your

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.390 
the games for each input device of your
choice<00:03:54.350> but<00:03:55.350> I<00:03:55.380> was<00:03:55.650> using<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:55.980> remote<00:03:56.250> to

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
choice but I was using the remote to

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.280 
choice but I was using the remote to
play<00:03:56.550> games<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.330> system<00:03:57.750> handled<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
play games and the system handled the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.199 
play games and the system handled the
games<00:03:58.500> pretty<00:03:58.830> well<00:03:59.070> it's<00:03:59.670> certainly<00:03:59.850> no

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
games pretty well it's certainly no

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.000 
games pretty well it's certainly no
next-gen<00:04:00.750> console<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> graphics<00:04:01.769> really

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
next-gen console the graphics really

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.560 
next-gen console the graphics really
won't<00:04:02.160> allow<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.550> at<00:04:02.850> all<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.239> the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
won't allow you at all and the

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.840 
won't allow you at all and the
performance<00:04:04.080> isn't<00:04:04.290> great<00:04:04.500> it's<00:04:05.040> not<00:04:05.610> bad

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
performance isn't great it's not bad

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.430 
performance isn't great it's not bad
though<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.090> didn't<00:04:06.420> notice<00:04:06.660> any<00:04:06.840> serious<00:04:07.200> lag

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
though I didn't notice any serious lag

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.860 
though I didn't notice any serious lag
it's<00:04:07.980> just<00:04:08.220> not<00:04:08.400> my<00:04:08.580> preferred<00:04:09.060> console<00:04:09.690> for

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
it's just not my preferred console for

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.020 
it's just not my preferred console for
gaming<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.500> for<00:04:10.709> sure<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.160> just<00:04:11.670> overall

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
gaming that is for sure and just overall

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.000 
gaming that is for sure and just overall
the<00:04:12.299> Nexus<00:04:12.570> player<00:04:12.720> performs<00:04:13.380> well<00:04:13.590> for<00:04:13.890> being

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
the Nexus player performs well for being

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.920 
the Nexus player performs well for being
such<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.370> new<00:04:14.700> device<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.299> mean<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.540> shows<00:04:15.720> off

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
such a new device I mean it shows off

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.020 
such a new device I mean it shows off
the<00:04:16.109> new<00:04:16.260> Android<00:04:16.680> TV<00:04:17.070> platform<00:04:17.100> with<00:04:17.820> no

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
the new Android TV platform with no

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.740 
the new Android TV platform with no
problems

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
problems

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.050 
problems
I<00:04:18.840> think<00:04:19.410> Android<00:04:19.769> TV<00:04:20.130> really<00:04:20.310> has<00:04:20.549> potential

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
I think Android TV really has potential

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.909 
I think Android TV really has potential
as<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.330> platform<00:04:21.750> has<00:04:21.930> more<00:04:22.140> time<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.620> sort<00:04:22.830> of

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
as the platform has more time to sort of

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.430 
as the platform has more time to sort of
mature<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:24.030> developers<00:04:24.720> have<00:04:24.840> more<00:04:25.050> time<00:04:25.289> to

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
mature and developers have more time to

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.290 
mature and developers have more time to
develop<00:04:25.680> apps<00:04:26.039> there's<00:04:26.789> a<00:04:26.850> decent<00:04:27.180> selection

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
develop apps there's a decent selection

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.969 
develop apps there's a decent selection
of<00:04:27.630> apps<00:04:27.750> right<00:04:27.990> now<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.560> hasn't<00:04:28.740> really

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
of apps right now and it hasn't really

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.830 
of apps right now and it hasn't really
been<00:04:29.220> out<00:04:29.370> for<00:04:29.580> very<00:04:29.729> long<00:04:29.940> at<00:04:30.060> all<00:04:30.150> two

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
been out for very long at all two

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.060 
been out for very long at all two
additions<00:04:31.229> that<00:04:31.410> I<00:04:31.440> do<00:04:31.530> want<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.860> mention

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
additions that I do want to mention

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.650 
additions that I do want to mention
about<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.460> system<00:04:32.789> that<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:32.970> really<00:04:33.240> like<00:04:33.450> is

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
about the system that I really like is

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.200 
about the system that I really like is
that<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:34.320> also<00:04:34.440> acts<00:04:34.770> as<00:04:35.010> chromecast<00:04:35.669> so<00:04:36.120> you

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
that it also acts as chromecast so you

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.540 
that it also acts as chromecast so you
can<00:04:36.419> stream<00:04:36.750> content<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.560> this<00:04:37.680> device<00:04:38.010> from

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
can stream content to this device from

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.219 
can stream content to this device from
your<00:04:38.760> phone<00:04:39.030> your<00:04:39.360> laptop<00:04:39.510> or<00:04:40.080> your<00:04:40.169> tablet

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
your phone your laptop or your tablet

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.680 
your phone your laptop or your tablet
just<00:04:41.130> like<00:04:41.250> you<00:04:41.400> would<00:04:41.580> normally<00:04:41.880> do<00:04:42.090> with

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
just like you would normally do with

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.690 
just like you would normally do with
chromecast<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:43.979> I<00:04:44.010> found<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.460> really<00:04:44.580> useful

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
chromecast so I found that really useful

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.270 
chromecast so I found that really useful
also<00:04:45.539> you<00:04:45.810> can<00:04:46.020> use<00:04:46.140> your<00:04:46.229> phone<00:04:46.470> or<00:04:46.530> tablet<00:04:46.740> as

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
also you can use your phone or tablet as

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.250 
also you can use your phone or tablet as
a<00:04:47.310> remote<00:04:47.430> by<00:04:48.210> downloading<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.870> Nexus<00:04:49.229> player

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
a remote by downloading the Nexus player

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.580 
a remote by downloading the Nexus player
remote<00:04:50.039> app<00:04:50.280> so<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:50.970> like<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.479> lot<00:04:51.539> too<00:04:51.900> but

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
remote app so I like that a lot too but

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.500 
remote app so I like that a lot too but
for<00:04:52.770> $100<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.520> don't<00:04:53.669> think<00:04:53.820> this<00:04:53.940> is<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.240> best

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
for $100 I don't think this is the best

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.870 
for $100 I don't think this is the best

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020
