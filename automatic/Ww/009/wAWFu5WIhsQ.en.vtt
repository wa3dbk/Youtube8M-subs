I<00:01:02.839> just<00:01:03.839> measure<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> water<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.009> as<00:01:05.190> I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
I just measure the water going in as I

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.249 
I just measure the water going in as I
add<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> bucket<00:01:11.539> we<00:01:12.539> got<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:12.930> mini

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
add to the bucket we got a little mini

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.170 
add to the bucket we got a little mini
jet<00:01:13.560> down<00:01:13.740> there<00:01:14.039> starting<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.759> water<00:01:14.909> around

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
jet down there starting to water around

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.690 
jet down there starting to water around
so<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.450> doesn't<00:01:15.720> get<00:01:15.810> stale<00:01:17.420> got<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> hairline<00:01:18.840> -

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
so it doesn't get stale got a hairline -

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.600 
so it doesn't get stale got a hairline -

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
then of course from the aqua lifter goes

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.690 
then of course from the aqua lifter goes
up<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.890> cell<00:01:34.069> that<00:01:35.069> comes<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.490> right

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
up in this cell that comes out right

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.270 

there's<00:01:41.330> this<00:01:41.570> float<00:01:42.200> switch<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.979> activate

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
there's this float switch to activate

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.520 
there's this float switch to activate
the<00:01:44.150> system<00:01:44.990> here

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
the system here

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.710 
the system here
I'll<00:01:46.460> swish<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.880> water<00:01:47.000> around<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.420> little<00:01:47.510> bit

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
I'll swish the water around a little bit

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.890 
I'll swish the water around a little bit
see<00:01:47.900> if<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:48.050> can<00:01:48.200> make<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.440> come<00:01:48.950> on<00:01:51.280> there<00:01:52.900> shut

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
see if I can make it come on there shut

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:07.790 
see if I can make it come on there shut
off<00:01:54.020> with<00:01:54.170> other<00:01:54.350> seconds

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.410 

this<00:02:08.800> system<00:02:09.220> actually<00:02:09.369> has<00:02:09.610> two<00:02:10.060> float

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
this system actually has two float

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
just to top it off some people let them

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.280 
just to top it off some people let them
onto<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.680> high<00:02:19.520> switch<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.450> low<00:02:20.630> switch

vision want to have the tooth above them
with<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:30.780> because<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.709> aqua<00:02:32.099> lifter<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:33.060> at

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
the bottom of the sump so actually if

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.619 
the bottom of the sump so actually if
the<00:02:37.530> two<00:02:37.739> was<00:02:38.069> in<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.459> water<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.300> sump

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
the two was in the water and the sump

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.500 
the two was in the water and the sump
was<00:02:39.900> lower<00:02:40.140> than<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> tube<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:42.060> anything

was lower than the tube and if anything
would<00:02:42.599> happen<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.380> aqua<00:02:44.340> lifter<00:02:45.530> it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
would happen to that aqua lifter it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.220 
would happen to that aqua lifter it
actually<00:02:46.890> caused<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:48.170> siphon<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.319> out<00:02:49.500> fact<00:02:49.860> and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
actually caused a siphon it out fact and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.150 
actually caused a siphon it out fact and
possibly<00:02:52.230> drain<00:02:52.560> out<00:02:52.769> myself<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.950> my

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
possibly drain out myself and and my
