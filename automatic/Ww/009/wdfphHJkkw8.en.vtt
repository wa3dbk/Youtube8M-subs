and<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.480> shadows<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:33.350> then<00:00:33.500> adjust<00:00:33.860> the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
and the shadows and then adjust the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
maybe for this image I'd want to amplify

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.119 
maybe for this image I'd want to amplify
the<00:00:59.660> Blues<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:00.739> I'm<00:01:00.829> going<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.010> add

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
the Blues and so I'm going to add

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.520 
the Blues and so I'm going to add
another<00:01:01.550> layer<00:01:01.820> layer<00:01:02.660> of<00:01:02.870> Blues<00:01:03.140> into<00:01:03.440> the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
another layer layer of Blues into the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.859 
another layer layer of Blues into the
highlights<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.699> higher<00:01:04.940> I<00:01:04.970> go<00:01:05.300> on<00:01:05.509> this<00:01:05.660> color

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
highlights the higher I go on this color

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.139 
highlights the higher I go on this color
palette<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.860> more<00:01:07.070> saturated<00:01:07.520> gonna<00:01:07.670> be<00:01:07.880> and

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
palette the more saturated gonna be and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:09.790 
palette the more saturated gonna be and
the<00:01:08.240> lower<00:01:08.450> I<00:01:08.539> go<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.110> less<00:01:09.320> saturate<00:01:09.710> is

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
the lower I go the less saturate is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.080 
the lower I go the less saturate is
going<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:09.979> be<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:10.610> we<00:01:10.700> can<00:01:10.820> see<00:01:10.940> that

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
going to be so we can see that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.580 
going to be so we can see that
saturation<00:01:11.690> adjustment<00:01:11.780> at<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.259> bottom

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
saturation adjustment at the bottom

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.109 
saturation adjustment at the bottom
actually<00:01:13.039> being<00:01:13.220> adjusted<00:01:13.460> as<00:01:13.729> we<00:01:13.820> pull<00:01:14.000> it

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
actually being adjusted as we pull it

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.150 
actually being adjusted as we pull it
down<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:15.110> I'm<00:01:15.170> gonna<00:01:15.289> let<00:01:15.440> go<00:01:15.590> right<00:01:15.770> here<00:01:16.009> and

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
just go down to here this by the way is

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.779 
just go down to here this by the way is
not<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.899> way<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.140> would<00:01:33.410> produce<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:34.490> image

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
not the way I would produce this image

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.339 
not the way I would produce this image
but<00:01:34.970> once<00:01:35.149> again<00:01:35.270> we're<00:01:35.599> just<00:01:35.780> doing<00:01:35.869> it<00:01:36.080> for

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:36.349 
but once again we're just doing it for

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:38.410 
but once again we're just doing it for
the<00:01:36.560> sake<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:36.950> tutorial<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:38.119> actually<00:01:38.390> I

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
the sake of this tutorial so actually I

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.699 
the sake of this tutorial so actually I
don't<00:01:38.479> like<00:01:38.690> that<00:01:38.840> let's<00:01:39.080> go<00:01:39.200> over<00:01:39.319> the<00:01:39.440> greens

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
don't like that let's go over the greens

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.249 
don't like that let's go over the greens
I<00:01:39.860> think<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.069> greens<00:01:40.250> looks<00:01:40.459> cooler<00:01:41.110> okay<00:01:42.110> so

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
I think the greens looks cooler okay so

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.540 
I think the greens looks cooler okay so
we're<00:01:42.500> gonna<00:01:42.590> select<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:42.920> green<00:01:43.130> if<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.340> go<00:01:43.490> up

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
we're gonna select this green if I go up

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.100 
we're gonna select this green if I go up
too<00:01:43.729> high<00:01:43.910> it's<00:01:44.450> gonna<00:01:44.569> make<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.899> entire

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
too high it's gonna make the entire

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.449 
too high it's gonna make the entire
thing<00:01:45.200> green<00:01:45.500> we<00:01:45.649> add<00:01:45.770> too<00:01:45.920> much<00:01:46.009> saturation

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
thing green we add too much saturation

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.419 
thing green we add too much saturation
so<00:01:46.759> let's<00:01:46.880> go<00:01:46.970> down<00:01:47.119> a<00:01:47.149> little<00:01:47.360> lower<00:01:48.429> all

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
so let's go down a little lower all

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:50.830 
so let's go down a little lower all
right<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:49.729> let's<00:01:49.910> close<00:01:50.149> this<00:01:50.300> up<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:50.690> now

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
right so let's close this up and now

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.270 
right so let's close this up and now
with<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.140> balance<00:01:51.560> we're<00:01:51.740> adjusting<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
with the balance we're adjusting the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.880 
with the balance we're adjusting the
balance<00:01:52.399> between<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:53.179> shadows<00:01:53.780> versus<00:01:54.649> the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
balance between the shadows versus the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.380 
balance between the shadows versus the
highlights<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:55.489> going<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.849> the<00:01:56.000> right<00:01:56.179> is

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
highlights so going to the right is

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.850 
highlights so going to the right is
gonna<00:01:56.569> show<00:01:56.810> more<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.170> those<00:01:57.229> highlight<00:01:57.619> tones

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
gonna show more of those highlight tones

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.190 
gonna show more of those highlight tones
going<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.819> the<00:01:58.880> left<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.300> gonna<00:01:59.420> show<00:01:59.720> more<00:02:00.110> of

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
going to the left is gonna show more of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.740 
going to the left is gonna show more of
the<00:02:00.259> shadow<00:02:00.770> tones<00:02:01.099> so<00:02:02.030> we<00:02:02.149> can<00:02:02.239> create<00:02:02.390> cool

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
the shadow tones so we can create cool

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.930 
the shadow tones so we can create cool
kind<00:02:03.080> of<00:02:03.110> duo<00:02:03.410> tones<00:02:03.770> split<00:02:04.160> tone<00:02:04.369> looks<00:02:04.729> to

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
kind of duo tones split tone looks to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.240 
kind of duo tones split tone looks to
our<00:02:04.970> images<00:02:05.479> with<00:02:06.259> this<00:02:06.560> split<00:02:07.069> toning

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
our images with this split toning

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.190 
our images with this split toning
feature<00:02:07.550> now<00:02:08.390> another<00:02:08.660> cool<00:02:08.869> thing<00:02:09.080> with

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
feature now another cool thing with

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.650 
feature now another cool thing with
split<00:02:09.410> toning<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:10.039> it<00:02:10.160> actually<00:02:10.660> works

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
split toning is that it actually works

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.270 
split toning is that it actually works
over<00:02:12.020> black<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.380> white<00:02:12.470> images<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.069> we<00:02:13.099> can

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
over black and white images so we can

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.890 
over black and white images so we can
create<00:02:13.430> duo<00:02:13.760> tone<00:02:14.030> black<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.420> white<00:02:14.510> images

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
create duo tone black and white images

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.140 
create duo tone black and white images
by<00:02:15.500> first<00:02:15.860> shifting<00:02:16.400> an<00:02:16.489> image<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.790> black<00:02:16.970> and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
by first shifting an image to black and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.970 
by first shifting an image to black and
white<00:02:17.209> by<00:02:17.420> hitting<00:02:17.599> V<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.170> then<00:02:18.769> you<00:02:18.860> can

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
white by hitting V and then you can

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.530 
white by hitting V and then you can
still<00:02:19.219> see<00:02:19.430> our<00:02:19.549> color<00:02:19.849> tone<00:02:20.060> adjustments

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540

actually go over those highlights and
shadows<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.180> image

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
shadows in this image

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.170

for<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.450> shadows<00:02:41.110> maybe<00:02:41.380> go<00:02:41.590> into<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.950> little

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370

bit<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.550> yellows<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.410> then<00:02:44.410> we<00:02:44.530> adjust<00:02:44.950> our

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
bit the yellows and then we adjust our

we<00:03:03.880> get<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.300> advanced<00:03:04.690> processing

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
we get to the advanced processing

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.230 
we get to the advanced processing
tutorials<00:03:05.710> so<00:03:06.310> for<00:03:06.460> now<00:03:06.580> let's<00:03:06.610> reset<00:03:07.120> the
