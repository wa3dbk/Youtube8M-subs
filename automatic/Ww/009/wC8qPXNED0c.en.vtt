00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.800
 Yes 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.540
 it's the mayor guy but it's hard 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.860
 comment ad you speak to me I have very 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.110
 well today we find ourselves on that 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.490
 the wicked black place for a tutorial 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.520
 which will help you improve your 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.980
 shoot with the submachine gun and the snipers 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.750
 have during this video there will be two 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.730
 parties the first part it will be 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.860
 how better his football with the machine gun 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.080
 and the second part it will be how 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.879
 but luckily sniper football target 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.010
 directly access the second part 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.460
 you can by clicking on it all 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.840
 simply 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.840
 so it's gone 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.140
 so first you go to 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.689
 the pattern portion 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.670
 or of course will you have personalized yourself 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.170
 go change the map you put the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.880
 card of your choice I advise you 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.490
 punch or small loss for example 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.960
 jack and money time next week end 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.149
 really small like that you found 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.009
 enemies quite easily then 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.479
 for activists you put inimities 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.860
 the limit of this body is you who 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.030
 see I advise you to put 50 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.509
 points or 30 points 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.490
 in any case between the two is that she 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.140
 comes from moliÃ¨re life it's you who 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.909
 see 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.580
 after you leave you will leave you all 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.080
 shot in the head only open to st 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.140
 a little later in the video 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.770
 and after that you just have to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.659
 start the game so just before 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.270
 sure you have to put enemy bases 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.429
 there were eleven of us and you put 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.299
 in second commando operation and that that 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.979
 depends on your level 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.360
 so once you've done all that 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.000
 you just have to throw at party and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.159
 so that's gone ok go see it's 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.840
 a really normal part is for 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.060
 you evaluate somehow to be able to 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.790
 a bit your level so 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.099
 if you see that you have well in 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.260
 go out during this first part 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.450
 you see that it happens that you 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.030
 get to do a minimum I can 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.209
 leave no for example one at least 1 52 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.010
 low ratio you can afterwards move on to the 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.870
 second part does not put the soul if you 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.180
 made less than 1 50 charging space 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.680
 you of your coaching the limit if you 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.930
 do less of the limit as we are 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.989
 imposed I advise you to start again 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.989
 until it brings its colors 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.640
 so down the first part of the 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.840
 first part in a way is 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.640
 already finished and now we'll go 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.880
 at a higher stage of the first 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.550
 part so we will activate 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.290
 shooting a head only and we did not 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.660
 more than just throw at party but just 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.430
 before we will lower the level of the bat 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.730
 to be slightly taken palce 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.340
 is a student to guarantee that it's going to be 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.050
 much harder because at first in 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.540
 May was taking off he really galley 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.610
 but took afterwards you will see 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.400
 what you're going to do a lot less trouble 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.260
 or do big series and of course 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.600
 after when you will be in the multi 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.030
 you will have a lot easier to 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.030
 target a body part of your 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.860
 enemy and so you'll have a lot I 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.990
 included spoke a lot more ease 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.820
 to kill him since as you 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.470
 rehabitute to shoot in the head 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.210
 and much later to target a part of the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.300
 port it will be even more simple 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.000
 so why did you manage to 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.970
 to make a score like that is you 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.580
 go to the next step so the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.130
 second step the second part of my 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.130
 video that arrives right away 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.550
 and so here we are again there you do not 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.500
 change nothing leave you like you 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.550
 just do the general scrum or 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.500
 lower the pigs a bit because 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.360
 sniper it's true it's a little slower 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.840
 so you put for example 30 points 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.070
 always unlimited like shooting 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.720
 artillery only we'll see a little 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.959
 later you do not have to 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.750
 make 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.190
 so this will be for the second part of 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.340
 the second part finally you have me 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.530
 including 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.750
 then you restrict all 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.760
 submachine guns and all the stuff like that 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.020
 the grenades et cetera or not you have 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.720
 did it all we I cut you 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.370
 the video you put 11 enemy bats and 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.520
 I advise you to put in second 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.520
 class 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.600
 and so here we are sorry there was a bug 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.190
 with my computer it could not come 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.800
 to record she's not eating our 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.040
 reports so here it's a step all to 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.840
 normal is the sniper is here 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.740
 you can not evaluate of course the goal 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.000
 This is not to scop of art 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.759
 it's really about making balls 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.889
 scop is to already try to make some 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.300
 Pussy beings if possible but good if 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.569
 you can not get Spanish but that's 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.569
 will be for 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.290
 fight for me in not long 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.170
 you'll see right after this little 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.660
 carnage so down right now so 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.570
 there what are you going to do you have 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.880
 just leave all that and you go 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.160
 go change rules you go m 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.530
 serdar only affects you go 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.470
 put yes nokla you 'll see the 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.510
 people that you really have galley and I 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.670
 can guarantee you that me and took me 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.580
 tons of party to succeed at 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.860
 put at least four or five and cat 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.180
 but once you have succeeded you 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.500
 go see that in the multi you go 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.710
 really do very very big carnage 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.790
 and after with your present steps that 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.350
 you are going to make private parties is 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.160
 always there to burst you for a 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.350
 warm-up party 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.990
 you will see that really you have 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.580
 burst them all and I can you 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.440
 guarantee that even I myself 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.720
 drastically improved because there is a 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.180
 guy in my team so dedication to him a 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.500
 maximum of why he is really very 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.210
 very strong and 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.040
 before I remember it on google is 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.990
 king and where I had ever alabaster and 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.210
 I had not even read m 4.5 yy and 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.610
 frankly now I'm coming I'm 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.590
 do a lot better against him good 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.690
 of course he still beats me must I 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.710
 practice well one day I will beat him 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.750
 so 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.040
 we are at and break it and it's 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.270
