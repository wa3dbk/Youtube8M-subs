00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.820 

I<00:00:14.179> extended<00:00:15.179> my<00:00:15.360> bumper<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:15.990> my<00:00:16.170> trailer<00:00:16.500> and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
I extended my bumper on my trailer and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.660 
I extended my bumper on my trailer and
added<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.910> aluminum<00:00:18.449> storage<00:00:18.990> box<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.490> back

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
added a aluminum storage box on the back

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.000 
added a aluminum storage box on the back
of<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.939> trailer<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> had<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.680> relocate

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
of the trailer and so I had to relocate

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.509 
of the trailer and so I had to relocate
my<00:00:23.580> spare<00:00:24.539> tire<00:00:24.779> which<00:00:25.109> hang<00:00:25.380> used<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.099> hang<00:00:26.310> on

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
my spare tire which hang used to hang on

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.509 
my spare tire which hang used to hang on
that<00:00:26.760> bumper<00:00:27.240> here's<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.289> original<00:00:28.740> location

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
that bumper here's the original location

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.759 
that bumper here's the original location
and<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.630> how<00:00:30.779> they<00:00:30.810> usually<00:00:31.109> come<00:00:31.439> from<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and it's how they usually come from the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.950 
and it's how they usually come from the
factory<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.340> most<00:00:32.579> traders<00:00:32.850> they're<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.930> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
factory on most traders they're on a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.650 
factory on most traders they're on a
bracket<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.910> bumper<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> trailer

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
bracket on the bumper of the trailer

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.630 
bracket on the bumper of the trailer
I<00:00:36.690> wanted<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.620> mount<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.070> spare<00:00:38.370> tire

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
I wanted to mount the spare tire

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.430 
I wanted to mount the spare tire
underneath<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.480> trailer<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.079> out<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
underneath the trailer and out of the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.220 
underneath the trailer and out of the
way<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:41.399> seldom<00:00:41.760> used<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:42.960> tucked

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
way it's seldom used so it can be tucked

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.139 
way it's seldom used so it can be tucked
up<00:00:43.379> underneath<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.010> frame<00:00:44.219> quite<00:00:44.579> easily<00:00:44.760> so

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
up underneath the frame quite easily so

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
up underneath the frame quite easily so
I<00:00:45.600> moved<00:00:45.870> mine<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.770> front<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
I moved mine to just in front of the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.080 
I moved mine to just in front of the
front<00:00:48.000> entry<00:00:48.360> door<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.840> close<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.129> the

front entry door and close to the the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.880 
front entry door and close to the the
front<00:00:51.390> tongue<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> trailer<00:00:51.930> here's<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
front tongue of the trailer here's a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.380 
front tongue of the trailer here's a
shot<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:53.219> under<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> trailer<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.210> my

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
shot from under the trailer that's my

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.689 
shot from under the trailer that's my
son<00:00:54.600> laying<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.350> ground<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.920> we

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
son laying there on the ground and we

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.029 
son laying there on the ground and we
actually<00:00:56.879> did<00:00:57.329> both<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.600> our<00:00:57.960> travel<00:00:58.680> trailers

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
actually did both of our travel trailers

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.840 
actually did both of our travel trailers
at<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> same<00:00:59.550> time<00:00:59.879> use<00:01:00.600> slightly<00:01:01.170> different

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
at the same time use slightly different

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.070 
at the same time use slightly different
methods<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.000> mounting<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
methods of mounting them because the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.260 
methods of mounting them because the
differences<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> trailers<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
differences in the trailers but the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.620 
differences in the trailers but the
windup<00:01:07.110> tire<00:01:07.740> storage<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.670> identical<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.570> both

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
windup tire storage is identical on both

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.080 
windup tire storage is identical on both

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the the way you crank the handle now I

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.580 
the the way you crank the handle now I
mounted<00:02:05.070> mine<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:06.829> steel<00:02:07.829> angle<00:02:08.310> iron<00:02:08.520> and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
mounted mine on a steel angle iron and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.280 
mounted mine on a steel angle iron and
what<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.280> actually<00:02:10.520> was<00:02:10.789> was<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.450> salvaged<00:02:11.959> bed

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
what it actually was was a salvaged bed

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.690 
what it actually was was a salvaged bed
frame<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:13.430> can<00:02:13.610> see<00:02:13.849> at<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.420> far<00:02:14.660> end<00:02:14.900> there

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
frame you can see at the far end there

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.520 
frame you can see at the far end there
that<00:02:16.700> that's<00:02:17.270> how<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.599> bed<00:02:17.870> would<00:02:18.050> mount<00:02:18.260> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
that that's how the bed would mount to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.100 
that that's how the bed would mount to
the<00:02:18.650> frame<00:02:18.920> but<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.819> worked<00:02:20.120> as<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.780> great

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
the frame but this worked as a great

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.910 
the frame but this worked as a great
crossmember<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.069> didn't<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:24.110> any<00:02:24.349> place<00:02:24.680> else

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
crossmember I didn't have any place else

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.699 
crossmember I didn't have any place else
to<00:02:25.099> mount<00:02:25.819> it<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.239> made<00:02:26.540> my<00:02:26.720> own<00:02:26.750> extra<00:02:27.440> frame

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
to mount it so I made my own extra frame

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.550 
to mount it so I made my own extra frame
and<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.430> works<00:02:28.640> great<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.239> because<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.380> has<00:02:30.530> a

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
and it works great and because it has a

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.449 
and it works great and because it has a
flange<00:02:31.130> at<00:02:31.370> both<00:02:31.550> ends<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.060> can<00:02:32.300> bolt<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.930> the

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
flange at both ends I can bolt it to the

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:41.340 
flange at both ends I can bolt it to the
outside<00:02:34.750> frame<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.709> trailer<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.310> then

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.750 

adjust<00:02:42.350> it<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:42.799> can<00:02:43.010> bolt<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.370> two<00:02:43.400> pieces

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
adjust it so I can bolt the two pieces

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.130 
adjust it so I can bolt the two pieces
angled<00:02:44.239> together<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.750> made<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:44.930> great

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
angled together so it made a great

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.340 
angled together so it made a great
carrier<00:02:45.730> now<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.790> way<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.030> raise<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.810> lower<00:02:47.840> my

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
carrier now the way I raise and lower my

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.600 
carrier now the way I raise and lower my
tire<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.799> just<00:02:49.310> used<00:02:49.580> my<00:02:50.319> cordless<00:02:51.319> drill<00:02:51.610> put

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
tire I just used my cordless drill put

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.180 
tire I just used my cordless drill put
us<00:02:52.870> nut<00:02:53.870> driver<00:02:54.170> on<00:02:54.380> there<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:54.860> can<00:02:54.980> see

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
us nut driver on there and you can see

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.979 
us nut driver on there and you can see
the<00:02:55.340> tire<00:02:55.549> coming<00:02:55.970> down<00:02:56.150> gets<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.900> little

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
the tire coming down gets a little

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.690 
the tire coming down gets a little
difficult<00:02:57.170> holding<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.830> camera<00:02:58.130> trying<00:02:58.549> to

difficult holding the camera trying to

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.089 
difficult holding the camera trying to
operate<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.420> drove<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.140> same<00:03:00.319> time<00:03:00.650> here<00:03:00.920> but

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
operate to drove the same time here but

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.320 
operate to drove the same time here but
you<00:03:01.280> can<00:03:01.459> see<00:03:01.700> how<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.510> works<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:04.060> here<00:03:05.060> are<00:03:05.180> my

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
you can see how it works and here are my

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.150 
you can see how it works and here are my
tools<00:03:05.599> that<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:05.959> use<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.440> raise<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.830> lower<00:03:06.860> the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
tools that I use to raise and lower the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.759 
tools that I use to raise and lower the
tire

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.780 

so<00:03:12.769> here's<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.360> parts<00:03:14.360> that<00:03:14.540> I<00:03:14.629> needed<00:03:14.840> to

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
bracing we had to put in now on this

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.210 
bracing we had to put in now on this
particular<00:04:53.270> trader<00:04:53.720> there<00:04:53.990> was<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.220> existing

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
particular trader there was a existing

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.920 
particular trader there was a existing
cross<00:04:55.430> frame<00:04:55.759> that's<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.180> yellow<00:04:56.389> arrow<00:04:56.690> at

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
cross frame that's the yellow arrow at

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.020 
cross frame that's the yellow arrow at
the<00:04:56.960> bottom<00:04:57.349> right<00:04:57.560> there<00:04:57.789> there<00:04:58.789> was<00:04:58.910> an

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
the bottom right there there was an

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.310 
the bottom right there there was an
existing<00:04:59.650> angle<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:00.800> we<00:05:00.919> could<00:05:01.099> mount<00:05:01.250> our<00:05:02.320> our

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
existing angle so we could mount our our

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.640 
existing angle so we could mount our our
cranking<00:05:04.210> mechanism<00:05:05.210> right<00:05:05.840> onto<00:05:06.199> a<00:05:06.229> piece<00:05:06.470> of

cranking mechanism right onto a piece of
angle<00:05:06.979> iron<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:07.520> I<00:05:07.580> bolted<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.539> that

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
angle iron that I bolted to that

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.409 
angle iron that I bolted to that
existing<00:05:09.410> cross<00:05:09.650> frame<00:05:10.009> now<00:05:10.789> once<00:05:11.000> we<00:05:11.150> crank

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
existing cross frame now once we crank

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.820 
existing cross frame now once we crank
the<00:05:11.590> wheel<00:05:12.590> up<00:05:12.909> it<00:05:13.909> had<00:05:14.270> nothing<00:05:15.169> to<00:05:15.289> rest<00:05:15.560> on

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
the wheel up it had nothing to rest on

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.529 
the wheel up it had nothing to rest on
the<00:05:16.099> edges<00:05:16.430> like<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.759> rubber<00:05:16.970> part<00:05:17.300> of<00:05:17.419> the

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
the edges like the rubber part of the

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.120 
the edges like the rubber part of the
tire<00:05:17.750> had<00:05:17.960> nothing<00:05:18.259> to<00:05:18.349> rest<00:05:18.560> on<00:05:18.770> so<00:05:19.009> it

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
tire had nothing to rest on so it

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.790 
tire had nothing to rest on so it
wobbled<00:05:19.550> back<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:19.970> forth<00:05:20.240> so<00:05:21.110> I<00:05:21.139> put<00:05:21.470> in<00:05:21.590> these

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
wobbled back and forth so I put in these

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.309 
wobbled back and forth so I put in these

against the floor underneath the trailer

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.370 
against the floor underneath the trailer
and<00:06:12.580> this<00:06:13.580> tire<00:06:13.880> is<00:06:14.060> now<00:06:14.240> nice<00:06:14.509> and<00:06:14.539> secure<00:06:15.169> and

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
and this tire is now nice and secure and

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.310 
and this tire is now nice and secure and
tight<00:06:16.039> up<00:06:16.219> against<00:06:16.669> the<00:06:16.729> the<00:06:17.300> bracing

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:56.580 

yeah

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.070 

tire<00:06:57.590> tanks<00:06:58.130> up<00:06:58.280> relatively<00:06:59.000> easy<00:06:59.510> there's<00:06:59.870> no

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
tire tanks up relatively easy there's no

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.620 
tire tanks up relatively easy there's no
strain<00:07:00.410> whatsoever<00:07:00.950> with<00:07:01.160> using<00:07:01.610> your<00:07:01.730> power

driver<00:07:02.990> and<00:07:03.260> I<00:07:03.320> would<00:07:03.470> suggest<00:07:03.620> that<00:07:04.070> just

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
driver and I would suggest that just

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.340 
driver and I would suggest that just
about<00:07:04.520> any<00:07:04.880> driver<00:07:05.180> of<00:07:05.450> any<00:07:05.630> size<00:07:05.930> even<00:07:06.200> a

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.350 
about any driver of any size even a

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.200 
about any driver of any size even a
small<00:07:06.650> nine<00:07:06.890> volt<00:07:07.190> one<00:07:07.430> would<00:07:07.580> work<00:07:07.790> just<00:07:08.060> as

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
small nine volt one would work just as

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.060 
small nine volt one would work just as
fine

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
fine

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.420 
fine
now<00:07:10.070> it's<00:07:10.220> up<00:07:10.340> against<00:07:10.730> the<00:07:10.820> bracing<00:07:12.430> just

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
now it's up against the bracing just

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.400 
now it's up against the bracing just
check<00:07:13.670> to<00:07:13.700> make<00:07:13.850> sure<00:07:14.000> how<00:07:14.360> tight<00:07:14.660> it<00:07:14.810> is<00:07:14.840> make

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410 
check to make sure how tight it is make

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.260 
check to make sure how tight it is make
sure<00:07:15.560> it's<00:07:15.680> nice<00:07:15.770> and<00:07:15.830> tape<00:07:16.190> and<00:07:16.910> there's<00:07:17.090> all

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
sure it's nice and tape and there's all

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.490 
sure it's nice and tape and there's all
