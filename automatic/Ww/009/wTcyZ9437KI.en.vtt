with a front diff on the rear nose cone

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.729 
with a front diff on the rear nose cone
I'll<00:00:31.890> usually<00:00:32.099> put<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.719> right<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.320> mean

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
I'll usually put one right there I mean

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.970 
I'll usually put one right there I mean
this<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> rear<00:00:35.640> nose<00:00:35.880> cone<00:00:36.649> and<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.860> see

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this is a rear nose cone and you can see

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.869 
this is a rear nose cone and you can see
the<00:00:38.040> difference<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.370> can't<00:00:38.550> put<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the difference you can't put on the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.220 
the difference you can't put on the
front<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.450> say<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> actuators

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
front if I was say because the actuators

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.400 
front if I was say because the actuators
there<00:00:41.329> but<00:00:42.329> uh<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> good<00:00:42.989> place<00:00:43.230> but

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
there but uh that's a good place but

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.110 
there but uh that's a good place but
it's<00:00:44.040> not<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> best<00:00:44.340> place<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.670> could<00:00:44.820> find<00:00:44.850> on

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the front diff um I there's a prowler

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760 
the front diff um I there's a prowler
reduce<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> front<00:00:49.379> diff<00:00:49.500> there's

reduce this is the front diff there's

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.959 
reduce this is the front diff there's
the<00:00:49.829> front<00:00:50.039> diff<00:00:50.129> out<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.399> Prowler<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.760> just

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the front diff out of my Prowler I just

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.080 
the front diff out of my Prowler I just
greased<00:00:51.739> they<00:00:52.739> sit<00:00:52.949> upside<00:00:53.250> down<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.940> mean

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
greased they sit upside down so I mean

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.360 
greased they sit upside down so I mean
see<00:00:54.270> here's<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> drain<00:00:54.870> plug<00:00:56.510> and<00:01:01.370> they'll

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
see here's the drain plug and they'll

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.260 
see here's the drain plug and they'll
sit<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.500> but<00:01:04.500> since<00:01:04.979> most<00:01:05.460> people<00:01:05.580> more

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
sit like that but since most people more

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.390 
sit like that but since most people more
familiar<00:01:06.659> with<00:01:06.750> how<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.930> sit<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> bike<00:01:07.500> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
familiar with how to sit in a bike I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.219 
familiar with how to sit in a bike I
flip<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.119> back<00:01:09.270> over<00:01:09.299> serve<00:01:09.689> ice<00:01:09.840> from<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:15.229> um

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.210 
flip it back over serve ice from here um
I<00:01:17.869> mean<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:18.990> pretty<00:01:19.080> simple<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.009> mean

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220

I mean it's pretty simple really I mean
just<00:01:20.430> when<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.670> grease<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.080> want

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
just when you grease it you really want

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
just when you grease it you really want
to<00:01:22.259> grease<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.439> through<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> nose<00:01:22.950> cone<00:01:23.630> take

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to grease it through the nose cone take

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.719 
to grease it through the nose cone take
it<00:01:24.750> off<00:01:24.900> when<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.920> take<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.220> off<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.580> it's

sits on the back of the shaft ear in
there<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.810> I'll<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.590> pop<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.979> off<00:01:41.159> in

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
there like that I'll just pop it off in

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.660 
there like that I'll just pop it off in
the<00:01:41.790> input<00:01:42.180> shaft<00:01:42.390> will<00:01:42.600> come<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:43.670> alright

together<00:01:59.299> drill<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.360> hole<00:02:00.680> put<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.770> back<00:02:01.860> on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
together drill the hole put it back on

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.130 
together drill the hole put it back on
and<00:02:02.579> I'm<00:02:02.700> pump<00:02:02.909> out<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.270> two-bit<00:02:03.689> 1/2<00:02:03.899> through

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and I'm pump out a two-bit 1/2 through

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.609 
and I'm pump out a two-bit 1/2 through
here<00:02:04.290> maybe<00:02:04.520> 200<00:02:05.540> also<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> front<00:02:07.350> diff

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619

since<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.129> spider<00:02:08.399> gears<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.910> is

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
since I have the spider gears this is

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.850 
since I have the spider gears this is
the<00:02:09.149> old<00:02:09.360> beat-up<00:02:09.750> chunk<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.560> had<00:02:10.709> laying

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the old beat-up chunk I had laying

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.640 
the old beat-up chunk I had laying
around<00:02:10.979> but<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.060> see<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.450> spider<00:02:13.319> gears

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
around but you can see the spider gears

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.080 
around but you can see the spider gears
in<00:02:13.800> there

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
in there

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.540 
in there

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
see if you can see you see the spider

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.100 
see if you can see you see the spider
gears<00:02:16.819> in<00:02:16.970> there<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.569> really<00:02:17.840> got<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:17.990> make

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
gears in there you really got to make

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.809 
gears in there you really got to make
sure<00:02:18.260> grease<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.740> in<00:02:18.770> there<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.490> don't<00:02:19.670> want

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
sure grease is in there you don't want

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.430 
sure grease is in there you don't want
to<00:02:19.880> then<00:02:20.209> run<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.510> dry

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
to then run and dry

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.900 
to then run and dry
I<00:02:21.500> actually<00:02:22.069> didn't<00:02:22.430> take<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.610> out<00:02:22.700> on<00:02:22.730> this

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
I actually didn't take it out on this

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.670 
I actually didn't take it out on this
one<00:02:23.120> just<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.360> see<00:02:23.630> if<00:02:23.750> when<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.319> bumped<00:02:24.620> it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
one just to see if when I bumped it

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.140 
one just to see if when I bumped it
through<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.860> nose<00:02:25.040> cone<00:02:25.250> if<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.580> would<00:02:25.730> fill

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
through the nose cone if it would fill

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.590 
through the nose cone if it would fill
that<00:02:26.240> up<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.020> did<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:28.330> pumped<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.420> right

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
right now I've got the X waiter on and

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.720 
right now I've got the X waiter on and
it's<00:03:09.530> in<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> two<00:03:10.640> wheel<00:03:10.790> drive<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:12.260> uh<00:03:12.290> I<00:03:12.800> mean

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
it's in a two wheel drive but uh I mean

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.120 
it's in a two wheel drive but uh I mean
let's<00:03:14.450> take<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.720> x-ray<00:03:15.019> there<00:03:15.170> off<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:18.130> put

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
let's take the x-ray there off and put

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.150 
let's take the x-ray there off and put
it<00:03:19.220> in<00:03:19.310> four<00:03:20.440> also<00:03:21.440> since<00:03:21.769> it's<00:03:21.890> full<00:03:22.070> of

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
it in four also since it's full of

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.640 
it in four also since it's full of
grease<00:03:22.370> it's<00:03:22.640> kind<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:22.910> slow<00:03:23.260> going<00:03:24.260> into<00:03:24.470> full

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
grease it's kind of slow going into full

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.890 
grease it's kind of slow going into full
drive<00:03:25.000> like<00:03:26.000> if<00:03:26.120> you're<00:03:26.209> just<00:03:26.360> sitting<00:03:26.540> still

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
drive like if you're just sitting still

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.900 
drive like if you're just sitting still
and<00:03:26.959> you're<00:03:27.260> not<00:03:27.380> moving<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.680> front<00:03:27.890> tires<00:03:28.130> it

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
and you're not moving the front tires it

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.479 
and you're not moving the front tires it
really<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:29.750> not<00:03:29.989> wanting<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.620> go<00:03:31.160> into<00:03:31.280> for

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
really is not wanting to go into for

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.630 
really is not wanting to go into for
drive<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:33.170> mean<00:03:33.590> if<00:03:33.769> you're<00:03:33.860> moving<00:03:34.310> and

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
drive but I mean if you're moving and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.740 
drive but I mean if you're moving and
you<00:03:35.769> front<00:03:36.769> end<00:03:36.890> moves<00:03:37.100> at<00:03:37.220> all<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.640> mean<00:03:38.299> it'll

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
you front end moves at all I mean it'll

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
see it's moving now but just circulate

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.569 
see it's moving now but just circulate
it<00:03:53.660> around<00:03:53.720> as<00:03:54.560> you're<00:03:54.829> pumping<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.400> mean

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
it around as you're pumping it I mean

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:56.530 
it around as you're pumping it I mean
pump<00:03:55.850> a<00:03:55.910> little<00:03:56.090> while

spin it pump a little while spin it you

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.699 
spin it pump a little while spin it you
just<00:03:58.910> want<00:03:59.090> that<00:03:59.209> grease<00:03:59.450> to<00:03:59.660> get<00:03:59.750> circulated

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
just want that grease to get circulated

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.720 
just want that grease to get circulated
around<00:04:00.769> as<00:04:00.980> much<00:04:01.130> as<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.340> can

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.620 

that's<00:04:04.730> nothing<00:04:05.030> when<00:04:05.090> you're<00:04:05.209> pumping<00:04:05.570> the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
that's nothing when you're pumping the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.050 
that's nothing when you're pumping the
side<00:04:05.840> cavity<00:04:06.260> over<00:04:06.380> here<00:04:06.670> or<00:04:07.670> pull<00:04:07.880> with<00:04:08.000> the

side cavity over here or pull with the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.340 
side cavity over here or pull with the
fill<00:04:08.239> plug<00:04:08.390> you<00:04:08.660> wanna<00:04:08.780> make<00:04:08.900> sure<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.109> side

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
fill plug you wanna make sure the side

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.020 
fill plug you wanna make sure the side
cavity<00:04:09.739> gets<00:04:09.950> full<00:04:10.220> over<00:04:10.459> here<00:04:10.609> so<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:10.910> want

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
cavity gets full over here so you want

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.610 
cavity gets full over here so you want
to<00:04:11.180> kind<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:11.329> press<00:04:11.600> keep<00:04:11.840> grease<00:04:12.140> up<00:04:12.320> in<00:04:12.440> there

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
to kind of press keep grease up in there

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.920 
to kind of press keep grease up in there
just<00:04:13.549> make<00:04:13.730> sure<00:04:13.880> it's<00:04:14.060> full<00:04:14.329> I<00:04:14.540> mean<00:04:14.600> you<00:04:14.750> want

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
just make sure it's full I mean you want

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.170 
just make sure it's full I mean you want
it<00:04:14.989> packed<00:04:15.350> full<00:04:15.709> as<00:04:16.340> full<00:04:16.609> as<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:16.789> can<00:04:16.910> get<00:04:17.030> it

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
it packed full as full as you can get it

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.789 
it packed full as full as you can get it
on<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.750> front<00:04:17.930> diff<00:04:18.140> here<00:04:18.289> it's<00:04:18.380> probably<00:04:18.709> not

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
on the front diff here it's probably not

on the front diff here it's probably not
going<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.010> come<00:04:19.100> out<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.310> vent<00:04:19.489> tube

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
going to come out the vent tube

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.069 
going to come out the vent tube
let's<00:04:20.000> probably<00:04:20.299> come<00:04:20.390> out<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.570> side<00:04:20.750> first

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
let's probably come out the side first

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.020 
let's probably come out the side first
but<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:21.919> mean<00:04:22.130> if<00:04:22.460> it's<00:04:22.669> coming<00:04:22.820> through<00:04:22.909> the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
but I mean if it's coming through the

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.200 
but I mean if it's coming through the
carrier<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:24.020> cavity<00:04:24.409> is<00:04:24.470> pretty<00:04:24.710> full<00:04:24.970> but<00:04:25.970> I

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
carrier the cavity is pretty full but I

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.730 
carrier the cavity is pretty full but I
mean<00:04:26.960> just

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
mean just

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.200 
mean just
two<00:04:27.889> and<00:04:28.009> a<00:04:28.039> half<00:04:28.100> tubes<00:04:28.460> is<00:04:28.729> really<00:04:28.940> what<00:04:29.090> it

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
two and a half tubes is really what it

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.320 
two and a half tubes is really what it
holds<00:04:30.100> that's<00:04:31.100> about<00:04:31.250> average<00:04:31.789> what<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.150> get

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
holds that's about average what I get

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.320 
holds that's about average what I get
into<00:04:32.600> them<00:04:35.680> it's<00:04:36.680> just<00:04:36.889> a<00:04:36.979> strolling<00:04:37.970> downside

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
into them it's just a strolling downside

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.969 
into them it's just a strolling downside
of<00:04:38.479> it<00:04:38.539> is<00:04:38.660> it's<00:04:38.870> just<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.199> for<00:04:39.380> drive<00:04:39.620> systems

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
of it is it's just the for drive systems

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.900 
of it is it's just the for drive systems
kind<00:04:40.729> of<00:04:40.789> slow<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.599> I<00:04:42.410> mean<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.520> diff<00:04:43.699> lock

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
kind of slow and I mean the diff lock

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.420 
kind of slow and I mean the diff lock
it's<00:04:44.569> the<00:04:45.530> diff<00:04:45.740> lock<00:04:45.919> it<00:04:46.009> doesn't<00:04:46.220> seem<00:04:46.340> as

it's the diff lock it doesn't seem as

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.339 
it's the diff lock it doesn't seem as

the actuator does when you put it into

the actuator does when you put it into
two-wheel<00:04:55.639> drive<00:04:55.880> it<00:04:56.599> pushes<00:04:57.050> this<00:04:57.199> pin<00:04:57.470> in

two-wheel drive it pushes this pin in
you<00:04:58.580> see<00:04:58.789> them<00:04:58.880> pushing<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.240> now<00:04:59.270> and<00:04:59.720> you'll

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
you see them pushing it now and you'll

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.740 
you see them pushing it now and you'll
be<00:05:00.410> in<00:05:00.560> two-wheel<00:05:00.889> drive<00:05:01.099> as<00:05:01.610> you<00:05:01.759> can<00:05:01.880> see<00:05:02.030> the

be in two-wheel drive as you can see the

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.719 
be in two-wheel drive as you can see the
cups<00:05:03.020> not<00:05:03.199> moving<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:04.009> I'm<00:05:04.220> turning<00:05:04.430> that

when it goes in the full drive that pin

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.800 
when it goes in the full drive that pin
just<00:05:07.430> actually<00:05:07.610> just<00:05:07.789> slides<00:05:08.270> back<00:05:08.599> out

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
just actually just slides back out

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.140 
just actually just slides back out
that's<00:05:09.710> all<00:05:09.830> full<00:05:10.039> drive<00:05:10.280> is<00:05:10.490> there's<00:05:11.030> a

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
that's all full drive is there's a

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.900 
that's all full drive is there's a

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
x-ray just lets go you know when it lets

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.070 
x-ray just lets go you know when it lets
go<00:05:17.410> that<00:05:18.410> pin<00:05:18.680> will<00:05:18.800> come<00:05:18.949> back<00:05:19.070> out<00:05:19.690> and<00:05:20.690> I<00:05:20.870> see

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
go that pin will come back out and I see

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
that's one thing I can't say with a

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.529 
that's one thing I can't say with a
greased<00:05:28.190> front<00:05:28.520> diff<00:05:28.699> you<00:05:28.909> can't<00:05:29.180> sit<00:05:29.509> still

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539
