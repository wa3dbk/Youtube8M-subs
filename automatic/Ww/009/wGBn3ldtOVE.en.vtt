00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.029

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.670
 had shares against the cards form 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.329
 +30 lake of the coup the price is in the process of 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:33.530

 rest there is no air either 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.450
 to have very very heavy maybe 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.229
 torres that will leave game left 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.030
 in front of torres the door of resources 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.009
 networks if he has stats that we are at 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.810

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.380
 on the other hand his paw to him I can the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.880
 sell rather expensive up and torso jerseys 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.140
 naked obviously that's the jerseys of 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.330
 teams like that usually it's part 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.250
 rather well so I do not take the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.370
 head and I put on sale so a first 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.650
 pack rather means are we going to open the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.080
 second immediately second to 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.849
 35000 I still hope shocked a 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.090
 little boost to a long time so we have 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.930
 richard's wiltshire dante is 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.910
 what else are there 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.700
 there's not a little heavy double that I have 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.850
 have no humor 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:37.470
 g.lacombe low arenas a good stage the 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.450
 logo of Switzerland is still enough 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.269
 mean is still pretty average there 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.650
 two packs and little luck then to 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.500
 note also I lie profit from the woods I 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.000
 to the pub there is a best-of standing 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.319
 not count nor who will come out good in 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.640
 hoping to have a big trick there when 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.430
 even for for then added in the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.350
 best-of who got out gets tomorrow either 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.990

 within two days max you have you have 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.660
 the opening pack and after it's really 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.890
 mean what I read in the time we go 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.870
 to release we will not take the head 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.670
 because that and so not cocooning 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.560
 since fipa sweet anyway that for 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.030
 tell you how much it time 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.790
 even though I'm doing videos on 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.860
 youtube and it's also time 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.840
 I also have a lot of luck 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.830
 so the crate what is it 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.060

 do not tell me that I still have players 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.240

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.860
 giovinco who is domingo kichi time 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.060
 behind this is going to be a I think it 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.490
 going to be someday I think this is 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.200
 a video of the future genre is made for him 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.370
 championship slovenia but no but 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.900
 it's anything good though I 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.480
 does all my form stock more 30 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.230
 but good must stop fuck it 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:48.480

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:51.770
 this daube for the fucking ehpad we do not 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.730
 knows nothing but nothing 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.140
 since not even how much are these 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.410
 days there must not be worth anything because 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.450
 when you get sick, you know what 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.450
 I am caught in a traffic jam 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.450
 I go in the packs we will open the 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.100
 North pack before opening the last 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.370
 weight only 35 thousand good after I'm going 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.740
 go agen chicharito hernandez in a 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.370
 pack of adriano redhead shit that was 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.370
 sweet not very long 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:26.020
 sampdoria all that i keep the rest on 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.380
 clear yeah good it's still 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.790
 not famous 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.220
 it's not famous what I have in the 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.830
 packs so the last pack to 35000 after 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.870
 I will finish by opening packs 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.080
 150 games for another three so we go 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.570
 finish on that and a benatia giroud 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.040
 benatia to loïc remy loïc remy it's not 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.520
 bad it's still worth the credits 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.620
 currently 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.230
 yeah really very very average 35000 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.230
 luckily I missed something 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:58.800
 all here oh so catastrophic this 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.800
 that I had in packs la roque 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:07.550
 yeah on the other hand I hope they 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:09.759
 are expensive and pretty much always its 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.759
 price 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.389
 I would like to review butch all so 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.389
 I was going to watch never know 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.740
 do we imagine where my little one 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.290
 marco risk for example my player the 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.710
 more expensive is a 4000 credit like that 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.710
 not bad 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.660
 hop it clears and so we will finish 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.770
 with the last three packs so 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.970
 150 packs 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.860
 and not only at 35 it was catastrophic 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.990
 so I think we'll stop find at 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.000
 stop net a little pedro falling 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.289
 placed on keita transfer list 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.930
 who is not bad also as a player 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.800
 a map shape more sharp I still 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.270
 the collecting of Charente 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.919
 collect cards form +30 so 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.819
 on one side I redid my stock it's 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.530
 rather not bad and to the east the front 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.490
 last pack right now I 'm going 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.900
 stop skiing because they combine 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.220
 script I have not much thing maybe 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.199
 that without what pays I want to have 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.490
 Something 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:10.690
 super gibbs I'm talking about something 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:13.650
 what fillet gules but 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.789
 australia an elderly mg motor card 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.250
 morata morata that will perhaps be 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:21.250
 boosted that he did a good match when 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:24.940
 of victory yesterday the juventus 7 0 but 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.770
 after that it's true that if why I 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.949
 not wait why did not I 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.930
 expected so is the last pack 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:34.120
 surely a crappy pack again a 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.889
 times to continue and he is a 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.759
 player is good here it was 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.380
 really not famous this pack opening I 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:44.800
 am disgusted I am disgusted 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.300
 like what luck is no longer there the 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.479
 luck is gone luck is everything 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.680

 in his parks at 35000 avoid mythos 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:57.699
