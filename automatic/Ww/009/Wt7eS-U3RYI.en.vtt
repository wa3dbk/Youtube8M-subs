literally dying to have take this from
me<00:03:15.710> so<00:03:16.710> I<00:03:16.740> may<00:03:17.130> be<00:03:17.190> selling<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:19.260> uh<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:20.420> was

me so I may be selling it but uh I was

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.870 
me so I may be selling it but uh I was
excited<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.290> at<00:03:22.380> least<00:03:22.500> get<00:03:22.740> to<00:03:22.800> mess<00:03:23.640> with<00:03:23.820> a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
excited to at least get to mess with a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.220 
excited to at least get to mess with a
little<00:03:24.060> bit<00:03:24.150> i<00:03:24.180> tell<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> very

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
little bit i tell you this is a very

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.199 
little bit i tell you this is a very
stout<00:03:25.770> knife<00:03:26.130> very<00:03:27.170> thick<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:29.610> blade<00:03:29.850> stocks

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
stout knife very thick the blade stocks

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.220 
stout knife very thick the blade stocks
really<00:03:30.600> thick<00:03:30.840> on<00:03:30.990> this<00:03:31.200> i<00:03:32.300> can<00:03:33.300> imagine<00:03:33.600> and

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
really thick on this i can imagine and

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.560 
really thick on this i can imagine and
it's<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:34.620> sharp<00:03:34.890> as<00:03:35.040> hell<00:03:35.190> great<00:03:36.180> lay<00:03:36.420> on

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
it's it's sharp as hell great lay on

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.740 
it's it's sharp as hell great lay on
this<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.440> i'm<00:03:37.560> guessing<00:03:37.800> if<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:39.300> really<00:03:39.600> needs

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
this so i'm guessing if you really needs

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.340 
this so i'm guessing if you really needs
a<00:03:39.900> hard<00:03:40.260> use<00:03:40.440> type<00:03:40.680> folder<00:03:41.130> this<00:03:41.430> would<00:03:41.610> be<00:03:41.640> a

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
a hard use type folder this would be a

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.820 
a hard use type folder this would be a
perfect<00:03:43.350> knife<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:45.000> know<00:03:45.120> whether<00:03:45.480> it's

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
perfect knife you know whether it's

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.100 
perfect knife you know whether it's
cutting<00:03:46.830> whether<00:03:47.250> it's<00:03:47.430> prying<00:03:47.880> it's<00:03:48.600> kind<00:03:48.989> of

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
cutting whether it's prying it's kind of

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.580 
cutting whether it's prying it's kind of
a<00:03:49.260> thick<00:03:50.840> utilitarian<00:03:51.840> type<00:03:52.050> knife<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.380> not

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.930 
on me what I do that yeah all right I'll
lose<00:04:27.120> something<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.449> put<00:04:27.599> it<00:04:27.690> too<00:04:28.020> tight

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
lose something to put it too tight

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.300 
lose something to put it too tight
anyway<00:04:29.940> uh<00:04:30.349> it's<00:04:31.349> the<00:04:31.380> cool<00:04:31.590> thing<00:04:31.800> about<00:04:31.830> a

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
anyway uh it's the cool thing about a

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.650 
anyway uh it's the cool thing about a
pivot<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.419> where<00:04:33.539> you<00:04:33.720> actually<00:04:33.930> have<00:04:34.259> some<00:04:35.660> so

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
pivot to where you actually have some so

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.629 
pivot to where you actually have some so
I<00:04:36.690> just<00:04:36.930> tighten<00:04:37.259> the<00:04:37.319> pivot<00:04:37.620> up<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.550> now

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
I just tighten the pivot up and now

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.170 
I just tighten the pivot up and now
we're<00:04:38.789> dead<00:04:38.970> center<00:04:39.650> so<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.889> does<00:04:41.099> it<00:04:41.940> does

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
we're dead center so and it does it does

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.809 
we're dead center so and it does it does
tighten<00:04:42.539> up<00:04:42.599> the<00:04:42.750> blade<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:42.990> little<00:04:43.289> bit<00:04:43.819> which

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
tighten up the blade a little bit which

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.219 
tighten up the blade a little bit which
i<00:04:44.940> think<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.210> probably<00:04:45.360> why<00:04:45.599> it<00:04:45.660> was<00:04:45.870> loosened

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
i think is probably why it was loosened

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.980 
i think is probably why it was loosened
up<00:04:46.319> but<00:04:46.530> I'd<00:04:47.009> rather<00:04:47.190> have<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.490> dead<00:04:47.729> center<00:04:48.120> and

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
up but I'd rather have a dead center and

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.270 
up but I'd rather have a dead center and
a<00:04:49.050> little<00:04:49.289> tighter<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:49.680> let<00:04:49.800> me<00:04:49.889> work<00:04:49.919> through

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
a little tighter and let me work through

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.610 
a little tighter and let me work through
it<00:04:50.460> than<00:04:50.669> anything<00:04:51.030> else<00:04:51.210> but<00:04:51.620> it's

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
it than anything else but it's

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.860 
it than anything else but it's
definitely<00:04:52.860> tighter<00:04:53.220> I<00:04:53.539> may<00:04:54.539> just<00:04:54.720> have<00:04:54.810> to

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
definitely tighter I may just have to

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.350 
definitely tighter I may just have to
put<00:04:54.990> some<00:04:55.110> oil<00:04:55.229> on<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.500> anyway<00:04:56.340> um<00:04:56.610> just<00:04:57.210> want
