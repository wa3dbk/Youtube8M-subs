00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.369
 and good morning to all those seven to ten 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.140
 finds himself today for a 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.779
 new video which is the introduction to 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.750
 a new series named guide of 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.699
 classes that downgrades ckoi and ben on 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.789
 take the fifteen classes of dofus 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.850
 there will be one episode per class and we will 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.130
 see together a little bit of the gameplay 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.480
 we go a little bit more 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.550
 length the stuff 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.559
 so we will use a tool that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 called facebook that I am on 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.460
 more than one of you knows and for 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.489
 each class we will make stocks 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.379
 so important we will make snuff 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.010
 not just at the level of blood we 're going 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.449
 start at level 140-150 if there are any 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.800
 players who would like me to start 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.390
 a little lower say the self in the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 comments but I think the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.180
 majority of you have at least one 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.100
 level 140-150 so I will do some stuff 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.049
 one or two top level 140 150 in 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.439
 function of your optimization of your 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.869
 means 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.180
 and then we will not redo a level 181 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.110
 about and then we will level 149 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.869
 200 with - optimization so no 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.060
 dofus paddock retse to the character 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.700
 very highly optimized who can afford 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.799
 to have everything he wants on the game and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 we may also talk about 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.920
 possible elements for each class 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.750
 etc. 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.780
 we will also talk a little about the class 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.329
 so I said very gameplay 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.570
 briefly spells but hey we're not going 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.979
 lay on it and especially what 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.350
 I want to set up for this 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.820
 series it's for each video 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.970
 so every class I would invite with me 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.680
 a person who is either a youtube 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.869
 hours that you know so about me 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.180
 also since I'm sure you 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.149
 follow several donations that will be either a 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.840
 youtube hours be a player known to 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.420
 game be a player 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.130
 very good maybe a little bit less 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.530
 known but who can also help me 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.800
 to comment on the class in question 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.879
 since I'm good, I know myself 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.590
 know in all classes more or 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.930
 less well who has some people 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.599
 rogue steamer that I did not have the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.810
 chance to play but I think 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.950
 to have an expert in the field so 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.349
 a person who to his character 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.019
 principal in the class that is 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.239
 presented it's a very good thing 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.849
 so this series will start very 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.950
 soon obviously the guests me 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.709
 I have many ideas that burst 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.060
 in my head 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.280
