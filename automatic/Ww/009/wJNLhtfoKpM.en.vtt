and iconic probably going to go for

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.609 
and iconic probably going to go for
weapon<00:01:42.329> expiratory<00:01:42.689> person<00:01:43.170> critical<00:01:43.470> attack

so<00:01:47.579> let's<00:01:47.759> look<00:01:47.790> at<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.000> load<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.299> now<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so let's look at the load out now so the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
so let's look at the load out now so the
first<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.329> anoint<00:01:52.049> what<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> does<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
first one is anoint what it does is it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.590 
first one is anoint what it does is it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
increases yours and up to three group

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.090 
increases yours and up to three group
members<00:01:54.899> precision<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.500> registration<00:01:55.950> for

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
members precision and registration for

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.609 
members precision and registration for
the<00:01:56.159> short<00:01:56.969> time<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.840> removes<00:01:58.200> all<00:01:58.439> your

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
damage to fifty percent for at least

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.200 
damage to fifty percent for at least
five<00:02:00.869> seconds<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.610> know<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
five seconds and as you know that the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.319 
five seconds and as you know that the
celestial<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:04.100> based<00:02:05.100> power<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
celestial is based power so this is a

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.270 
celestial is based power so this is a
really<00:02:06.450> important<00:02:07.020> one<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.799> really<00:02:08.129> short

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
really important one for a really short

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.670 
really important one for a really short
time<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:08.759> still<00:02:09.080> good<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.410> damage<00:02:10.649> bonus

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
time but still good for the damage bonus

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.830 
time but still good for the damage bonus
but<00:02:11.799> two<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.159> benediction<00:02:12.849> benediction

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
but two is benediction benediction

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.959 
but two is benediction benediction
increases<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.560> critical<00:02:15.129> attack<00:02:15.280> chance<00:02:15.700> of

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
increases the critical attack chance of

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.209 
increases the critical attack chance of
the<00:02:16.239> weapons<00:02:16.629> and<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.379> power<00:02:17.950> you're<00:02:18.099> going

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219 
the weapons and the power you're going

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.000 
the weapons and the power you're going
to<00:02:18.280> use<00:02:18.519> for<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.819> next<00:02:19.060> five<00:02:19.239> seconds<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
to use for the next five seconds and the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.740 
to use for the next five seconds and the
combination<00:02:21.579> the<00:02:21.790> solution<00:02:22.090> combination<00:02:22.569> is

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
combination the solution combination is

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.670 
combination the solution combination is
from<00:02:23.439> benediction<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.250> malediction<00:02:24.579> and<00:02:25.680> what

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
from benediction to malediction and what

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.199 
from benediction to malediction and what
it<00:02:26.769> does<00:02:26.859> is<00:02:26.920> it's<00:02:27.159> going<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.370> go<00:02:27.579> for<00:02:27.939> around

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
it does is it's going to go for around

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.149 
it does is it's going to go for around
it's<00:02:28.510> going<00:02:28.659> to<00:02:28.719> give<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.930> around<00:02:29.319> three<00:02:29.650> 3<00:02:30.129> 2

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
it's going to give you around three 3 2

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.429 
it's going to give you around three 3 2
4<00:02:30.719> X<00:02:31.719> 3<00:02:31.959> more<00:02:32.290> for<00:02:32.709> 25<00:02:33.209> proceed<00:02:34.209> based<00:02:34.439> takes

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
4 X 3 more for 25 proceed based takes

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.589 
4 X 3 more for 25 proceed based takes
damage<00:02:36.069> over<00:02:36.370> time<00:02:36.400> so<00:02:36.849> number<00:02:37.359> three<00:02:37.569> is

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
damage over time so number three is

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.720 
damage over time so number three is
plague<00:02:38.139> it's<00:02:38.469> Sir<00:02:38.769> damage<00:02:39.069> over<00:02:39.189> time<00:02:39.250> as<00:02:39.519> well

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
plague it's Sir damage over time as well

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.509 
plague it's Sir damage over time as well

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
and it's your AOE and the combination

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.140 
and it's your AOE and the combination
from<00:02:43.209> plague<00:02:43.569> to<00:02:43.930> plague<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:45.099> divine<00:02:45.849> light

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
so let's look at the rotation now okay

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.560 
so let's look at the rotation now okay
guys<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:31.500> I'm<00:04:31.590> using<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:32.130> 100<00:04:33.030> right<00:04:33.150> now<00:04:33.330> and

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
guys so I'm using a 100 right now and

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.660 
guys so I'm using a 100 right now and
this<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:33.930> how<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.440> weapon<00:04:34.860> mastery<00:04:35.340> combo

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
this is how the weapon mastery combo

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.850 
this is how the weapon mastery combo
looks<00:04:35.880> like<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.900> can<00:04:37.050> see<00:04:37.200> it<00:04:37.320> really<00:04:37.440> really

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
looks like you can see it really really

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.730 
looks like you can see it really really
nice<00:04:38.040> damage<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.670> the<00:04:39.510> first<00:04:40.320> power<00:04:40.470> we're

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
nice damage and the first power we're

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.800 
nice damage and the first power we're
going<00:04:40.890> to<00:04:40.950> use<00:04:41.130> is<00:04:41.310> anoint<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.600> first

actually let me take a soda so proceed
booster<00:04:51.870> my<00:04:52.020> procedure<00:04:52.410> 2476<00:04:53.400> now<00:04:53.670> and<00:04:53.910> when<00:04:54.900> I

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
booster my procedure 2476 now and when I

booster my procedure 2476 now and when I
but<00:04:55.320> i'm<00:04:55.410> going<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.650> use<00:04:55.860> anoint<00:04:56.370> it's<00:04:57.360> going

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
but i'm going to use anoint it's going

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.140 
but i'm going to use anoint it's going
to<00:04:57.600> give<00:04:57.750> me<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:57.960> boost<00:04:58.200> to<00:04:58.850> 2590<00:04:59.850> which<00:05:00.000> is<00:05:00.090> a

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
boost for a short period of time so

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.810 
boost for a short period of time so
annoyed<00:05:06.510> is<00:05:06.630> on<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:06.780> cool<00:05:07.020> down<00:05:07.170> right<00:05:07.350> now<00:05:07.530> and
