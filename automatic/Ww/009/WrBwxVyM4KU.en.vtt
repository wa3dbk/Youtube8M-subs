00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:36.959 
technology as what's behind this streak

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:38.540 
technology as what's behind this streak
it's<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.140> massive<00:01:37.530> directed<00:01:37.920> energy<00:01:38.069> laser

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
it's a massive directed energy laser

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.180 
it's a massive directed energy laser
beam<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.929> kills<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.739> warbird

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
beam that will get you kills the warbird

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.190 
beam that will get you kills the warbird
for<00:01:41.399> 800<00:01:41.849> a<00:01:41.910> standard<00:01:42.330> gunship<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.080> it's

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
for 800 a standard gunship but it's

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.389 
for 800 a standard gunship but it's
remotely<00:01:43.500> controlled<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.099> you<00:01:44.160> won't

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
remotely controlled so you won't

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
remotely controlled so you won't
actually<00:01:44.580> have<00:01:44.789> to<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.239> the<00:01:45.360> controlling<00:01:46.080> as

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
actually have to do the controlling as

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.010 
actually have to do the controlling as
far<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.590> i<00:01:46.739> know<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:47.789> excess<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.330> goliath<00:01:48.840> for

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
far as i know the excess one goliath for

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.690 
far as i know the excess one goliath for
800<00:01:49.440> this<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.709> just<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.979> similar<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.580> our

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
800 this is just a similar to our

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.940 
800 this is just a similar to our
juggernaut<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> new<00:01:52.050> take<00:01:52.289> on<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.679> and<00:01:52.830> if

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
juggernaut but a new take on it and if

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.930 
juggernaut but a new take on it and if
you're<00:01:53.069> one<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.310> those<00:01:53.369> people<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.910> to

you're one of those people that like to

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.180 
you're one of those people that like to
argue<00:01:54.300> well<00:01:54.989> it's<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.410> Titan<00:01:55.830> in<00:01:55.920> advanced

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
streak to count even through depth so a

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.330 
streak to count even through depth so a
normal<00:02:39.510> support<00:02:40.079> package<00:02:40.469> that<00:02:40.980> will<00:02:41.099> cost

normal support package that will cost

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.099 
normal support package that will cost
you<00:02:41.489> 300<00:02:41.730> as<00:02:42.030> well<00:02:42.269> but<00:02:42.540> before<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:42.870> go<00:02:42.930> any

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
you 300 as well but before we go any

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.199 
you 300 as well but before we go any
further<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.950> stack<00:02:44.489> as<00:02:44.700> many<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:45.120> these

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
further you can stack as many of these

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.149 
further you can stack as many of these
as<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.719> want<00:02:46.079> but<00:02:46.469> it<00:02:46.590> will<00:02:46.680> cost<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.129> more

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
as you want but it will cost you more

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.580 
as you want but it will cost you more
and<00:02:47.549> more<00:02:47.849> so<00:02:48.180> for<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.510> UAV<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:49.079> you<00:02:49.200> wanted<00:02:49.469> to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
and more so for the UAV if you wanted to

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.199 
and more so for the UAV if you wanted to
run<00:02:49.799> all<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.069> those<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.700> stack<00:02:50.909> them<00:02:51.060> all

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
run all of those and stack them all

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.899 
run all of those and stack them all
together<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:52.019> would<00:02:52.200> run<00:02:52.409> you<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> thousand<00:02:53.069> 150

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
together it would run you a thousand 150

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.819 
together it would run you a thousand 150
points<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.450> earn<00:02:54.599> your<00:02:54.689> streak<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.409> just<00:02:55.739> about

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
points to earn your streak so just about

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.460 
points to earn your streak so just about
10<00:02:56.129> kills<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.549> an<00:02:56.879> assist<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.329> TDM<00:02:57.840> or<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.109> few

on the radar the aerial assault drone my

on the radar the aerial assault drone my

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
guess is that it's going to be like the

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.000 
guess is that it's going to be like the
hunter<00:05:28.120> killer<00:05:28.390> from<00:05:28.540> black<00:05:28.780> ops<00:05:29.020> 2<00:05:29.230> system

similar<00:05:32.140> to<00:05:32.290> the<00:05:32.380> EMP<00:05:32.950> missile<00:05:33.820> strike<00:05:34.090> is

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
similar to the EMP missile strike is

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.150 
similar to the EMP missile strike is
going<00:05:34.540> to<00:05:34.660> be<00:05:34.750> what<00:05:34.960> we've<00:05:35.110> seen<00:05:35.380> already<00:05:35.620> any

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
going to be what we've seen already any

multiplayer reveal trailer but it's

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.510 
multiplayer reveal trailer but it's
going<00:05:38.260> to<00:05:38.410> be<00:05:38.560> like<00:05:38.830> the<00:05:39.070> hellstorm<00:05:39.490> missile

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
going to be like the hellstorm missile

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.370 
going to be like the hellstorm missile
war<00:05:40.000> you'll<00:05:40.150> be<00:05:40.240> able<00:05:40.390> to<00:05:40.540> cluster<00:05:41.020> it<00:05:41.110> into

war you'll be able to cluster it into

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.140 
war you'll be able to cluster it into
what<00:05:41.530> they<00:05:41.650> call<00:05:41.680> a<00:05:41.890> typhoon<00:05:42.460> cluster<00:05:42.970> and

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
what they call a typhoon cluster and

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.180 
what they call a typhoon cluster and
then<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.690> bombing<00:05:44.110> run<00:05:44.290> is<00:05:44.470> going<00:05:44.680> to<00:05:44.860> be<00:05:45.010> like

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
then the bombing run is going to be like

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.940 
then the bombing run is going to be like
the<00:05:45.370> Warthog<00:05:45.790> from<00:05:46.360> black<00:05:46.600> ops<00:05:46.870> 2<00:05:47.170> so<00:05:47.560> like<00:05:47.830> I

the Warthog from black ops 2 so like I

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.190 
the Warthog from black ops 2 so like I
said<00:05:48.010> that<00:05:48.580> is<00:05:48.760> the<00:05:48.970> stuff<00:05:49.240> right<00:05:49.600> now<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:50.050> we

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200

said that is the stuff right now that we
know<00:05:50.230> of<00:05:50.410> that<00:05:50.680> will<00:05:50.800> be<00:05:50.830> in<00:05:51.220> the<00:05:51.400> game<00:05:51.700> but

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
know of that will be in the game but

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.780 
know of that will be in the game but
