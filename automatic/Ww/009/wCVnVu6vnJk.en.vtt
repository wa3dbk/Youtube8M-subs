would have been clichy but he's around
15<00:01:14.700> 16<00:01:15.240> k<00:01:15.540> at<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.689> moment<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.170> i<00:01:16.590> did<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:17.040> want

15 16 k at the moment and i did not want

other games with him out with a

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.460 
other games with him out with a
different<00:04:11.010> team<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:12.200> really<00:04:13.200> really<00:04:13.260> good

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
different team so really really good

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.890

team<00:04:13.850> leavin<00:04:14.850> does<00:04:14.940> gets<00:04:15.209> forced<00:04:15.390> a<00:04:15.540> weak<00:04:15.690> foot

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
team leavin does gets forced a weak foot

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.320 
team leavin does gets forced a weak foot
force<00:04:16.140> of<00:04:16.290> skill<00:04:16.560> moves<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:16.980> so<00:04:17.520> dardo<00:04:17.970> has<00:04:18.299> a

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
force of skill moves and so dardo has a

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.420 
force of skill moves and so dardo has a
three-star<00:04:19.020> week<00:04:19.260> for<00:04:19.500> three<00:04:19.980> star<00:04:20.190> skill

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
three-star week for three star skill

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.650 
three-star week for three star skill
moves<00:04:20.669> but<00:04:21.479> I've<00:04:21.630> kind<00:04:22.289> of<00:04:22.350> found<00:04:22.620> that

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
moves but I've kind of found that

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.850 
moves but I've kind of found that
Soldado<00:04:24.660> is<00:04:25.020> more<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.500> clinical<00:04:25.860> finisher

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.529 
Soldado is more of the clinical finisher
in<00:04:26.919> my<00:04:27.069> opinion<00:04:27.310> but<00:04:27.789> that<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.240> going<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.449> be

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
in my opinion but that is going to be

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.510 
in my opinion but that is going to be
the<00:04:28.659> end<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.930> video<00:04:29.050> guys<00:04:29.409> as<00:04:30.219> you<00:04:30.280> can<00:04:30.430> see

there pally Nia does only get a

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.899 
there pally Nia does only get a
chemistry<00:04:32.409> but<00:04:32.740> if<00:04:32.949> I<00:04:33.189> change<00:04:33.430> them<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.699> a<00:04:33.729> CD

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
chemistry but if I change them to a CD

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.309 
chemistry but if I change them to a CD
m-sport<00:04:34.180> he<00:04:34.539> would<00:04:34.750> get<00:04:34.960> in<00:04:35.020> line<00:04:35.110> chemistry

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
m-sport he would get in line chemistry

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.240 
m-sport he would get in line chemistry
or<00:04:35.919> even<00:04:36.159> 10<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.699> so<00:04:37.569> yeah<00:04:37.990> I'll<00:04:38.949> leave<00:04:39.189> you
