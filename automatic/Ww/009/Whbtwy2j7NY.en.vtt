00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
it like a normal twist I just do it very

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.710 
it like a normal twist I just do it very
loosely<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.079> then<00:02:41.980> once<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.970> get<00:02:43.180> towards<00:02:43.359> the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
loosely and then once I get towards the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.039 
loosely and then once I get towards the
end<00:02:45.209> that's<00:02:46.209> when<00:02:46.569> about<00:02:46.989> maybe<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.660> one

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
end that's when about maybe to a one

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.110 
end that's when about maybe to a one
inch<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.709> two<00:02:50.889> inches<00:02:51.220> towards<00:02:51.609> the<00:02:51.700> end<00:02:51.880> I'll

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
inch to two inches towards the end I'll

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.890 
inch to two inches towards the end I'll
start<00:02:52.419> twisting<00:02:52.959> very<00:02:53.200> tightly<00:02:54.209> just<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.450> make

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
start twisting very tightly just to make

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.390 
start twisting very tightly just to make
sure<00:02:56.049> that<00:02:56.230> twist<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.919> an<00:02:57.040> unravel<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:58.569> just

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
sure that twist of an unravel then just

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.750 
sure that twist of an unravel then just
keep<00:02:59.760> my<00:02:59.940> ends<00:03:00.269> in<00:03:00.390> better<00:03:00.540> condition<00:03:00.989> as<00:03:01.110> well

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
keep my ends in better condition as well

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.699 
keep my ends in better condition as well
so<00:03:02.760> that's<00:03:03.000> why<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.180> do<00:03:03.360> for<00:03:03.540> my<00:03:03.629> loose<00:03:04.260> strand

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
so that's why I do for my loose strand

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.660 
so that's why I do for my loose strand
twist<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.360> also<00:03:06.360> too<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:07.440> experience<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.430> lot<00:03:08.640> of

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
twist and also too I experience a lot of

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.009 
twist and also too I experience a lot of
shrinkage<00:03:09.030> with<00:03:09.390> my<00:03:09.540> hair<00:03:10.099> as<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.340> can<00:03:11.489> see<00:03:12.019> my
