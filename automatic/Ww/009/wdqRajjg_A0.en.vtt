00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
here this doesn't have to be perfect

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.110 
here this doesn't have to be perfect
because<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.570> want<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.940> deteriorate<00:00:47.940> we

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
then kind of pull away the parts that

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.710 
then kind of pull away the parts that
aren't<00:01:12.330> sticking<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.909> I'm<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
aren't sticking and I'm just going to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.120 
aren't sticking and I'm just going to
repeat<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.560> over<00:01:17.189> his<00:01:17.369> face<00:01:18.979> latex<00:01:19.979> has

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
repeat this all over his face latex has

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.820 
repeat this all over his face latex has
a<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.640> bit<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.939> gnarly<00:01:21.270> smell<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.680> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
a little bit of a gnarly smell and it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.200 
a little bit of a gnarly smell and it
doesn't<00:01:23.130> feel<00:01:23.250> super<00:01:23.640> good<00:01:23.759> around<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.119> eye

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
doesn't feel super good around the eye

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.179 
doesn't feel super good around the eye
so<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.840> careful<00:01:25.229> around<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.530> area<00:01:25.830> or

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
so just be careful around that area or

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.780 
so just be careful around that area or
avoid<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> altogether<00:01:27.979> just<00:01:28.979> doing<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.430> really

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
avoid it altogether just doing a really

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.920 
avoid it altogether just doing a really
thin<00:01:30.210> layer<00:01:33.500> then<00:01:34.500> putting<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.250> tissue<00:01:35.579> on

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.649 

till<00:01:39.680> it<00:01:39.800> sticks<00:01:41.440> and<00:01:42.440> then<00:01:42.500> tearing<00:01:42.980> it<00:01:43.160> off

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.130 

these<00:01:47.289> square<00:01:47.740> edges<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:49.060> can<00:01:49.270> just<00:01:49.509> rip<00:01:49.780> so

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
these square edges you can just rip so

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.050 
these square edges you can just rip so
that<00:01:50.289> there<00:01:50.469> aren't<00:01:50.649> even<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:54.399> don't<00:01:54.609> want<00:01:54.759> any
