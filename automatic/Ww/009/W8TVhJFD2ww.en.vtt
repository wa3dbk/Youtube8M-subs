 present in the matches tariffs 5 and 7 is that I have very few chips

 48 and the Czech Republic and that he loses his mark 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.049
 the unpublished sequence 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.179
 so that's how it's written make it so bad that have been invited to 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.090
 to take it 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.090
 to return to height if not record growth 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.150
 the Touquet 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.270
 we have to take risks zero risk does not exist m 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.390
 I always say on the courses it's true 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.730
 it is that if you are ready he points out that he must be prosecuted 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.890
 yet for the intro you remain and games of the spirit of jacques tati 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.970
 what is a romand I am proud 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.970
 the goal 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.320
 tixier 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.440
 while I'm not yet because anyway here I go but the more he 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.499
 did not either 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:15.139
 he check I check me I look first but I think I win if the 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.109
 block the project etc 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:22.399
 here i think i'm going so m to troy davis an emphatic middle give 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:23.779
 these seats because 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:27.059
 this Wednesday with the King live so many landmarks 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.079
 it's going so fast we have to touch it 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.529
 moreover I was able I understand 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.529
 it's this hand 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.059
 45 10 points that allow us to think of a good cookbook 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:50.589
 good there I'm not desperate jerome good sense I'm painting what makes 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:55.529
 his 458 six civilians killed by judging no money and not a beautiful death I think 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.339
 he tries to take a little psychological ascendancy it's tremendously 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.779
 obviously great quote to win 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:05.719
 but I'm going to revive I'm against resistance at the table for the sector 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.090
 I wish I was a little jackson finally 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.410
 pair of ladies is one of the three best hurts to win on the 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.019
 lawn faced less than 3,250 more to go and if I had everything I was 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.650
 at my friend's house at 6:30 am on the flop 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.980
 alternation does not know what can happen the storm for the first time at 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.699
 during his tenure the flop 134 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.269
 I will send the text 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.510
 ten countries wrote by 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.510
 what is it for you 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.709
 what can I do 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.119
 it's true it's here it's free head-up display solution 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.769
 point finally almost 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.959
 if the farmhouses his money and a half 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.169
 Lamy-chappuis 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.309
 corbeil 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.309
 atos origin is still possible 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.759
 I am a crowd in the middle of my eyes 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.589
 I was won at the start I'm favorite plus I shot the ball 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:04.589
 would not need everything I wanted it was great 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.929
 jo London londres resumed yesterday still quite clearly 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.929
 while we are in a desperate situation of ten minutes 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.199
 hitch me I'm doing for over 50 years firm 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.199
 so here's a nice hand because I do not lose 3 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.270
 he does draw a straight draw at both ends of the two sides I have three 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.650
 four five six stories at least what you hold us 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.740
 gilles bellemare 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.740
 I check it sign here I'm happy 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.069
 she makes a lot of money in jumping I pass three centers that happens 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.090
 what can bet on a year against 3 cents better than the captain 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.509
 if we too 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.020
 jaw 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.020
 because I wear flare jeans and the handsome 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.979
 he has -4 like it's funny I saw nothing galls carwyn jones lose 3 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.610
 when he died 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.889
 already win than to lose 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.889
 now it's a game that the same straight draw at 11 o'clock 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.760
