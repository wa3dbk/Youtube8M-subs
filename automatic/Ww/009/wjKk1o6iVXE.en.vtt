I

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:05.500 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.959 

what<00:00:06.500> david<00:00:06.800> coulthard<00:00:06.950> is<00:00:07.309> very<00:00:07.580> fast

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:07.969 
what david coulthard is very fast

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:12.310 
what david coulthard is very fast
particularly<00:00:08.870> in<00:00:08.990> a<00:00:09.139> mercedes-benz<00:00:09.620> sls<00:00:11.320> we

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
particularly in a mercedes-benz sls we

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.409 
particularly in a mercedes-benz sls we
saw<00:00:12.559> him<00:00:12.679> in<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:12.950> Isle<00:00:13.459> of<00:00:13.639> Man<00:00:13.820> flying<00:00:14.209> around

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:14.419 
saw him in the Isle of Man flying around

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.789 
saw him in the Isle of Man flying around
I<00:00:14.570> think<00:00:14.690> he<00:00:14.749> frightened<00:00:15.110> himself<00:00:15.409> he<00:00:15.499> was<00:00:15.650> so

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 
I think he frightened himself he was so

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.920 
I think he frightened himself he was so
far<00:00:16.070> but<00:00:16.820> I<00:00:16.880> thought<00:00:17.210> initially<00:00:17.390> he<00:00:17.690> was<00:00:17.810> going

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
far but I thought initially he was going

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.350 
far but I thought initially he was going
to<00:00:17.990> be<00:00:18.080> racing<00:00:18.530> the<00:00:18.560> gamers<00:00:19.100> on<00:00:19.250> a<00:00:19.360> computer

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
to be racing the gamers on a computer

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.240 
to be racing the gamers on a computer
game<00:00:20.480> and<00:00:20.690> he's<00:00:20.780> absolutely<00:00:20.990> hopeless<00:00:21.830> at

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
game and he's absolutely hopeless at

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.580 
game and he's absolutely hopeless at
that<00:00:22.430> but<00:00:23.060> in<00:00:23.270> one<00:00:23.660> of<00:00:23.690> these<00:00:23.900> I<00:00:23.930> think<00:00:24.230> he'll

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
that but in one of these I think he'll

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.910 
that but in one of these I think he'll
give<00:00:24.740> them<00:00:24.890> a<00:00:24.980> good<00:00:25.100> run<00:00:25.310> for<00:00:25.340> their<00:00:25.580> money<00:00:25.640> I

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
give them a good run for their money I

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.410 
give them a good run for their money I
think<00:00:27.920> David<00:00:28.280> Coulthard<00:00:28.460> got<00:00:28.940> more<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:29.390> lose

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
think David Coulthard got more to lose

it<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:17.030> merging

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.899 

my<00:01:21.320> advice<00:01:21.620> to<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.920> game<00:01:22.100> is<00:01:22.370> is<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.729> finish

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
my advice to the game is is to finish

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.090 
my advice to the game is is to finish
first<00:01:23.210> first<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.750> must<00:01:23.960> finish<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:24.680> keep<00:01:24.979> it

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
first first you must finish so keep it

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.890 
first first you must finish so keep it
on<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.340> road<00:01:25.370> because<00:01:25.909> it's<00:01:26.090> no<00:01:26.270> no<00:01:26.630> point

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
on the road because it's no no point

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.320 
on the road because it's no no point
being<00:01:27.140> super<00:01:27.560> fast<00:01:27.800> but<00:01:28.130> almost<00:01:28.700> every<00:01:29.030> corner

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
being super fast but almost every corner

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.870 
being super fast but almost every corner
and<00:01:29.420> then<00:01:29.510> spinning<00:01:29.810> off<00:01:30.080> my<00:01:30.920> advice<00:01:31.160> to<00:01:31.190> David

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
and then spinning off my advice to David

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.300 
and then spinning off my advice to David
would<00:01:32.030> be<00:01:32.180> just<00:01:32.420> do<00:01:32.690> what<00:01:32.869> you<00:01:33.050> do<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:33.770> let

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
would be just do what you do you let

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.950 
would be just do what you do you let
your<00:01:34.340> natural<00:01:34.820> skills<00:01:35.119> come<00:01:35.330> out<00:01:35.479> drive<00:01:35.780> as

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
your natural skills come out drive as

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.530 
your natural skills come out drive as
fast<00:01:36.140> as<00:01:36.440> you<00:01:36.500> can<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:36.920> let's<00:01:37.610> see<00:01:37.910> reality

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
fast as you can and let's see reality

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.930 
fast as you can and let's see reality
and<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.530> digital<00:01:39.950> world<00:01:40.100> how<00:01:40.490> close<00:01:40.759> they

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
and the digital world how close they

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.510 
and the digital world how close they
really<00:01:41.210> are<00:01:44.650> I'd<00:01:45.650> love<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:45.979> be<00:01:46.160> doing<00:01:46.400> it<00:01:46.490> but

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
really are I'd love to be doing it but

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.130 
really are I'd love to be doing it but
I'm<00:01:46.670> just<00:01:46.700> too<00:01:47.119> fast<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:47.630> it<00:01:47.750> wouldn't<00:01:48.050> be

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
I'm just too fast and it wouldn't be

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.930 
I'm just too fast and it wouldn't be
fair<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:48.710> we<00:01:48.860> put<00:01:49.040> David<00:01:49.369> Coulthard<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.850> the

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
fair so we put David Coulthard in the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.400 
fair so we put David Coulthard in the
car<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.210> I'm<00:01:50.330> I'm<00:01:50.660> gonna<00:01:50.930> talk<00:01:51.170> because
