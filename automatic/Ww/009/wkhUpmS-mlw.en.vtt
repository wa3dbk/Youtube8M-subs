00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.300 

green<00:02:28.050> up<00:02:28.230> here<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.710> then<00:02:28.800> lengthen<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
green up here and then lengthen the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.560 
green up here and then lengthen the
really<00:02:29.550> bright<00:02:29.700> teal<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:31.290> joints<00:02:32.570> not

much<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:33.840> kind<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.080> nice<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:35.340> then<00:02:35.490> hot<00:02:35.730> rod<00:02:35.940> is

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
much is kind of nice and then hot rod is

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.730 
much is kind of nice and then hot rod is
mid<00:02:37.350> transformation<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.420> guess<00:02:39.650> from<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
mid transformation I guess from the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.550 
mid transformation I guess from the
matrix<00:02:41.960> glowing<00:02:43.010> clear<00:02:44.010> translucent<00:02:45.000> blue

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
matrix glowing clear translucent blue

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.380 
matrix glowing clear translucent blue
that<00:02:46.560> was<00:02:46.710> some<00:02:47.220> translucent<00:02:47.610> green<00:02:47.940> as<00:02:48.240> well

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
that was some translucent green as well

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.740 
that was some translucent green as well
and<00:02:49.110> then<00:02:49.290> his<00:02:49.440> missile<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:50.420> snapped<00:02:51.420> into<00:02:51.600> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
and then his missile is snapped into the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.210 
and then his missile is snapped into the
package<00:02:52.140> there<00:02:52.350> like<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:55.100> then<00:02:56.100> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
package there like that and then the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.800 
package there like that and then the
Decepticon<00:02:56.760> set<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.120> i<00:02:57.150> think<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
Decepticon set and i think the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.020 
Decepticon set and i think the
Decepticon<00:02:58.350> set<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.370> better<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.760> two

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
Decepticon set is the better of the two

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.990 
Decepticon set is the better of the two
if<00:03:00.210> you<00:03:00.330> can<00:03:00.450> only<00:03:00.570> get<00:03:00.750> once<00:03:00.960> set<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
if you can only get once set this is the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.550 
if you can only get once set this is the
one<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.240> get<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.960> again<00:03:04.230> there<00:03:04.380> in<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
one to get and again there in the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.370 
one to get and again there in the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
are folded up in a bigger rectangle so

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.830 
are folded up in a bigger rectangle so
there's<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.460> then<00:03:12.300> there's<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.600> three

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
there's that and then there's the three
