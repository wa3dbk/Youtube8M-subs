your interview right in it the little
mermaid<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.849> a<00:03:38.880> classic<00:03:39.480> film<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:40.080> I<00:03:40.260> think

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
mermaid is a classic film that I think

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.770 
mermaid is a classic film that I think
still<00:03:40.890> resonates<00:03:41.370> with<00:03:41.520> all<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.849> us<00:03:41.940> today<00:03:42.300> so

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
still resonates with all of us today so

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.150 
still resonates with all of us today so
that's<00:03:43.020> why<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.260> think<00:03:43.560> it's<00:03:43.650> going<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.800> be<00:03:43.890> so

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
that's why I think it's going to be so

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:52.870 
that's why I think it's going to be so
exciting<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.700> bring<00:03:44.910> this<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.330> ass

RNA<00:04:09.140> springs<00:04:09.470> racers<00:04:09.620> we<00:04:10.310> think<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.760> as<00:04:10.910> a

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
RNA springs racers we think of it as a

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.450 
RNA springs racers we think of it as a
giant<00:04:11.270> slot<00:04:11.870> car<00:04:12.170> so<00:04:12.620> if<00:04:12.710> you<00:04:12.830> look<00:04:12.950> at<00:04:13.100> it<00:04:13.160> as<00:04:13.310> a

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
giant slot car so if you look at it as a

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.680 
giant slot car so if you look at it as a
sweat<00:04:13.730> in<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:13.970> middle<00:04:14.270> of<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.390> track<00:04:14.660> that

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
sweat in the middle of the track that

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.320 
sweat in the middle of the track that
the<00:04:15.350> car<00:04:15.620> will<00:04:15.770> follow<00:04:16.040> along<00:04:16.459> it's<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.090> same

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
the car will follow along it's the same
