start by pouring your almonds into your
glass<00:00:27.419> container<00:00:27.989> next<00:00:28.770> you<00:00:28.860> want<00:00:29.040> to<00:00:29.070> add

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:29.129 
glass container next you want to add

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.889 
glass container next you want to add
your<00:00:29.460> half<00:00:29.700> a<00:00:29.759> tablespoon<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.450> sea<00:00:30.660> salt

finally<00:00:31.829> you're<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.129> add<00:00:32.309> your

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
finally you're going to add your

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.670 
finally you're going to add your
filtered<00:00:33.000> water<00:00:33.239> now<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.020> want<00:00:34.379> to<00:00:34.469> add<00:00:34.649> a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
filtered water now you want to add a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.560 
filtered water now you want to add a
generous<00:00:35.370> amount<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.910> water<00:00:36.149> since<00:00:36.390> your

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
generous amount of water since your

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.840 
generous amount of water since your
almonds<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.079> well<00:00:37.350> covered<00:00:37.829> because<00:00:38.039> they

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
almonds are well covered because they

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.389 
almonds are well covered because they
will<00:00:39.000> expand<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:40.050> soaking<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.680> also<00:00:40.980> absorb

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
will expand with soaking and also absorb

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.400 
will expand with soaking and also absorb
some<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> water<00:00:41.930> now<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.020> reason<00:00:43.290> why<00:00:43.380> we

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
some of the water now the reason why we

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380 
some of the water now the reason why we
soak<00:00:43.829> our<00:00:44.010> almonds<00:00:44.400> overnight<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:45.030> salt<00:00:45.329> water

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
soak our almonds overnight in salt water

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.139 
soak our almonds overnight in salt water
is<00:00:45.810> because<00:00:46.500> most<00:00:47.010> nuts<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.489> seeds<00:00:47.700> contain

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
is because most nuts and seeds contain

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
is because most nuts and seeds contain
anti<00:00:48.570> nutrients<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.560> make<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.829> difficult

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
anti nutrients that make it difficult

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.460 
anti nutrients that make it difficult
for<00:00:50.370> us<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.790> fully<00:00:50.970> absorb<00:00:51.239> minerals<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.350> our

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
for us to fully absorb minerals in our

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.260 
for us to fully absorb minerals in our
digestive<00:00:52.950> tract<00:00:53.220> kind<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.880> a<00:00:53.940> bummer<00:00:54.149> right

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
digestive tract kind of a bummer right

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.860 
digestive tract kind of a bummer right
but<00:00:54.989> when<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.380> soak<00:00:55.680> them<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.010> salty<00:00:56.460> brine

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
but when we soak them in a salty brine

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.600 
but when we soak them in a salty brine
overnight<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.680> will<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.070> help<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
overnight this will have help to

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.120 
overnight this will have help to
neutralize<00:00:59.910> those<00:01:00.750> anti<00:01:01.140> nutrients<00:01:01.739> so

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
neutralize those anti nutrients so

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.500 
neutralize those anti nutrients so
that's<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.399> we're<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.850> now<00:01:03.450> you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
that's what we're going to do now you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.420 
that's what we're going to do now you
can<00:01:03.899> leave<00:01:04.049> these<00:01:04.229> uncovered<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.040> want<00:01:05.250> to

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
can leave these uncovered if you want to

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.709 
can leave these uncovered if you want to
you<00:01:05.640> could<00:01:05.759> put<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> paper<00:01:06.180> towel<00:01:06.509> with<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
you could put a paper towel with a

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.600 
you could put a paper towel with a
rubber<00:01:06.990> band<00:01:07.200> something<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.189> like

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
rubber band something like that I like

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.609 
rubber band something like that I like
to<00:01:08.759> use<00:01:08.790> kind<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> sprouting<00:01:10.020> lid<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.560> so

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.670 
to use kind of a sprouting lid like so
that<00:01:11.460> way<00:01:11.640> they<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:11.969> still<00:01:12.180> breathe<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:13.140> no

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
that way they can still breathe but no

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.859 
that way they can still breathe but no
little<00:01:13.829> gnats<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.609> in<00:01:14.700> there<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.569> I'll

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:36.389 
like to rinse them pretty well just to

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:39.289 
like to rinse them pretty well just to
get<00:01:36.509> all<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.469> anti-nutrients<00:01:38.429> off<00:01:38.609> and<00:01:39.149> just

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
get all the anti-nutrients off and just

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.019 
get all the anti-nutrients off and just
be<00:01:39.389> sure<00:01:39.539> they're<00:01:39.689> nice<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.869> clean<00:01:40.939> as<00:01:41.939> you

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:42.029

can<00:01:42.179> see<00:01:42.630> they've<00:01:43.049> kind<00:01:43.349> of<00:01:43.469> are<00:01:44.369> swollen

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
can see they've kind of are swollen

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.789 
can see they've kind of are swollen
because<00:01:45.719> they've<00:01:46.020> absorbed<00:01:46.349> some<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.740> that

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
because they've absorbed some of that

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.179 
because they've absorbed some of that
water

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
