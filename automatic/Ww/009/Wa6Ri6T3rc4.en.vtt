00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 I thought that yesterday they had touched the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.410
 fund on tv in the newspapers on the radio up 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.070
 tiki taka and so on and so forth 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.150
 as usual obfuscating 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.089
 voluntarily voluntarily 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.699
 rigor on the result of 1 a 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.310
 0 for juventus even before that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.800
 before the penalty on el kaduri or 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.199
 the charge on vidal accusing him of 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.080
 having made a rude gesture to the referee 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.550
 when in reality it is not true because they have 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.470
 taken picture 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.420
 apart from that fuzzy yes but the image 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.610
 nike canor and have put a tiki taka in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.250
 reality vidal did with index the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.860
 sign 1 to indicate is the first time 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.840
 what I do is the first time instead 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.000
 they took a picture cut by one 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.340
 perspective that made it look like that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.489
 which in reality has not happened here 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.710
 I thought this was precisely the apex 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.620
 of injustice and degradation 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.530
 this until today when I saw 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.629
 an image on facebook I saw 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.170
 an image that made me creep 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.270
 the skin made me for a moment 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.790
 be ashamed to be Italian here 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.479
 the boys picture or low 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.150
 Saturday, March 1, 2014 at the FIG via 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.280
 gregorio allegri 14 rome from 10 am 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.810
 make your voice heard protest 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.400
 peacefully against the continuous 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.229
 lack of respect by the FIGC 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.820
 and of the arbitration class with regard to 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.250
 of Rome and its fans 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.619
 then there is another bomb on Saturday 1 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.170
 March spontaneous and civil manifestation 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.000
 of whom has broken definitively because 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.979
 the public everything we are 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.350
 undergoing Romanists ahead 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.119
 Annamus is a pillar shield among the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.340
 alleys it's time to leave 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.649
 facebook and twitter and be heard 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.750
 because they are perpetrating yet another 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.430
 theft to those who love honest football and the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.000
 time to abandon facebook e 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.619
 twitter and go protest 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.130
 because you don't win a game 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.399
 you are the mirror of Italian society 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.729
 ridiculous you are ridiculous VIPs ignore the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.799
 houses b seize cars failed to 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.840
 find a job even in a dream e 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.530
 what do you do went under the headquarters of the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.569
 figc to complain about the referee because 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.629
 The referee rigor to me 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:20.790
 vito for this excess of stupidity 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:23.519
 the pitchforks in figc guys but if 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.370
 I had to do a ranking of things 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.049
 more useful to humanity more to put to 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.409
 first place 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:34.530
 man second place animals at 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.819
 third place the shit and then put you 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.639
 is there now 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.540
 speaking purely from the point of view 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.999
 no football so we leave it aside 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.859
 your mental degradation 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.510
 but what do you plan to do by doing 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.040
 this protest is yours 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.719
 team there is more than this you can not 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.879
 do because you do n't have the skills you do 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.349
 laughter there are four with pitchforks 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.150
 the only pitchforks I've seen are 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.150
 those three that we got you for 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.730
 straight to torino that is those I have seen e 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.290
 if juve had taken advantage of the two 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.829
 expulsions of Rome had not played 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.689
 so passively we would have won 4 5 a 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.030
 0 and you still have the courage to 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.560
 talk about goodbye to helpers of errors 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.750
 without gervinho totti 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.560
 you have a half rose 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.019
 Ranking 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.290
 you have won a suffered game with 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.030
 bologna thanks to a goal from nainggolan 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.389
 which has the juve one like that but still 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.909
 forum makes juventus allows itself 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:30.840
 luxury to keep a bench on the bench 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:33.620
 marchisio one as marchisio osvaldo 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.389
 osvaldo that for you was the undisputed 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.909
 rome driver for us is a 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.859
 panchinaro this to make you understand the 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.930
 difference between the two teams in the cup 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:46.189
 italy cup itali you have played with 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.599
 seven elevenths of our benches 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:51.389
 you won 1 0 by canceling a goal 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.060
 regular to peluso you celebrated for 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.340
 him for weeks to have partied 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.930
 having beaten our reserves then 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.150
 week after taking three pears from the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.669
 naples and at home you did postpone one 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.709
 match against the parma when you were 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.109
 in a waning season of the championship 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.509
 against a parma in very good condition 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.609
 these are the little help these are the 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:13.949
 help Sunday Sunday 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.019
 the only team that has the right to 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:18.150
 getting angry between juventus and turin is the 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.930
 juventus for an unallocated penalty 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.510
 lorente even before the penalty 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.190
 assigned to the guard or the alleged 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.620
 expulsion to vidal 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.530
 we would have closed the first page game 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.440
 the Juventus Gazette wins with a penalty 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.360
 not given to the bull and a failed expulsion 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.160
 vital there is not a dog that talks about the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.390
 rigor of lorente and this thing makes me 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.770
 pissed off like a beast in description 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.690
 find a list since you like them 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.880
 the statistics find a list of 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.450
 all arbitration errors against 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.580
 of juventus because it is full but none 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.530
 I speak of course after six or seven 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.310
 Championship matches you've done 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.080
 I forget a song called to one 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.140
 killed the championship you can find it 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.850
 some turning up here the veiled ones 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.360
 to see after the video not now 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.130
 that this is a shit figure 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.390
 colossal this is something here 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.490
 video I do finish it here so there isn't 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.280
 nothing more to say I said everything bye to 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:23.450
 all text turns over for the quarries 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.450
 datamatic to the cup pocket 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.460
 arturo's favorite victim here 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.449
 here they help him, here he is 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.990
 around but 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.990
 or not 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.680
 just after the juve con burns nine 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.680
 nations 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.889
 the text ban 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.810
 then dear 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.810
 juventus has a third time
