00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:09.200
 Hello my dear, that can happen 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.690
 if you do not have non-slip socks 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:17.260
 I wanted to show you today how to 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.470
 can make his sock slip resistant 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:25.060
 in the cold season I wear 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:28.090
 rather thick socks than slippers these 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.340
 Socks are four threads at the same time 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.520
 Knitted that keeps beautiful 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.400
 but it is not completely safe either 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.220
 because you can use it on laminate parquet or 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.530
 wooden floors can easily slip 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.649
 can 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.269
 That's why we're doing ours now 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.899
 to care 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:53.910
 Non-slip in the trade you get this 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.780
 to buy antiskid mats 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.030
 it is not expensive this role is here 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.030
 Example has cost only one euro 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.260
 You get this mat in different 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.730
 structures and also in different ways 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.090
 to dye 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:20.040
 Now we take the role and 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.950
 cut out of it symbols 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.720
 whether heart-shaped or in a circle 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:32.710
 Shamrock shaped or oval always two 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.410
 Couple cut it out for them 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.500
 the socks fit that 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.170
 has anti-slip mats holes leaves you 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.380
 thus easily absorb 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.960
 you can as well as here big symbols 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.960
 choose or several small ones 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.610
 so there is no slip up much 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.950
 fun while copying 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.950
 hey you have watched to the end 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.950
 Thank you
