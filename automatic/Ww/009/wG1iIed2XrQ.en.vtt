layers the brass helps to ground the
strings<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.380> also<00:02:37.100> serves<00:02:37.490> as<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.760> really<00:02:38.120> nice

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
strings and also serves as a really nice

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.410 
strings and also serves as a really nice
solid<00:02:39.520> fixture<00:02:40.520> for<00:02:40.700> them<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:41.590> be<00:02:42.590> anchored<00:02:42.950> on

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
solid fixture for them to be anchored on

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.300 
solid fixture for them to be anchored on
there's<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.660> end<00:02:45.080> pin<00:02:45.350> whoops<00:02:45.890> don't<00:02:46.160> know

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
there's the end pin whoops don't know

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.170 
there's the end pin whoops don't know
which<00:02:46.460> way<00:02:46.580> I'm<00:02:46.700> pointing<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.570> end<00:02:47.720> pin<00:02:47.900> jack

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
which way I'm pointing the end pin jack

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.020 
which way I'm pointing the end pin jack
so<00:02:50.260> anyway<00:02:51.260> here's<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.710> way<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.550> pickup<00:02:52.880> is

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
so anyway here's the way the pickup is

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.400 
so anyway here's the way the pickup is
attached<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.780> neck<00:02:55.480> with<00:02:56.480> screws<00:02:57.080> and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
attached to the neck with screws and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.200 
attached to the neck with screws and
there's<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.040> bracket<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:58.550> kind<00:02:58.820> of<00:02:58.850> holds<00:02:59.000> it

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
there's a bracket that kind of holds it

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.450 
there's a bracket that kind of holds it
very<00:02:59.510> securely<00:03:00.080> does<00:03:00.440> not<00:03:00.710> touch<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.220> top

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
very securely does not touch the top

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.710 
very securely does not touch the top
even<00:03:01.790> though<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.030> looks<00:03:02.060> like<00:03:02.390> it's<00:03:02.570> very

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
even though it looks like it's very

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.350 
even though it looks like it's very
close<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.410> actually<00:03:03.590> is<00:03:03.950> very<00:03:03.980> close<00:03:04.430> no

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
close and it actually is very close no

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.540 
close and it actually is very close no
contact

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.330 

is<00:03:11.090> backing<00:03:11.450> away<00:03:11.750> a<00:03:11.900> little<00:03:12.170> bit<00:03:12.260> here<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:13.250> you

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
is backing away a little bit here so you

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.300 
is backing away a little bit here so you
can<00:03:13.490> see<00:03:13.520> the<00:03:13.820> full<00:03:15.070> effect<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.190> the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
can see the full effect of the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:28.560 
can see the full effect of the
instrument<00:03:16.340> there<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.180> is<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:23.620> rear<00:03:24.620> view

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:04:07.670 

so<00:03:29.570> there<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.930> is

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:54.890 

you

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.960
