00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
should probably not go to importance and

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.110 
should probably not go to importance and
the<00:03:34.800> foods<00:03:35.010> reducing<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.490> same<00:03:35.670> day<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.000> then

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
the foods reducing the same day and then

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.790 
the foods reducing the same day and then
expect<00:03:36.510> me<00:03:36.600> not<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.840> feel<00:03:37.050> guilty<00:03:37.080> for<00:03:37.440> eating

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
expect me not to feel guilty for eating

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.880 
expect me not to feel guilty for eating
dinner<00:03:37.980> I've<00:03:38.459> never<00:03:38.820> felt<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.330> I<00:03:39.650> can't<00:03:40.650> eat

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
dinner I've never felt that I can't eat

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.580 
dinner I've never felt that I can't eat
something<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.400> been<00:03:41.580> hungry<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:42.209> always<00:03:42.900> feel

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
something and been hungry I always feel

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.770 
something and been hungry I always feel
like<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:44.010> had<00:03:44.160> just<00:03:44.760> had<00:03:44.970> enough<00:03:45.030> calories<00:03:45.510> for

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
like I had just had enough calories for

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.960 
like I had just had enough calories for
the<00:03:46.110> day<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.470> I'm<00:03:46.890> like<00:03:47.100> satisfied<00:03:47.700> I'm<00:03:47.790> not

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
the day and I'm like satisfied I'm not

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.900 
the day and I'm like satisfied I'm not
like<00:03:48.180> hungry<00:03:48.540> I'm<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:48.989> too<00:03:49.650> full<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.310> it's

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
like hungry I'm not too full and it's

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.520 
like hungry I'm not too full and it's
perfect<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.570> think<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.930> reason<00:03:52.260> for<00:03:52.290> that

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
perfect and I think the reason for that

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.890 
perfect and I think the reason for that
is<00:03:52.860> because<00:03:52.890> I'm<00:03:53.340> also<00:03:53.610> drinking<00:03:54.120> 3<00:03:54.630> litres<00:03:54.870> of

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
is because I'm also drinking 3 litres of

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.690 
is because I'm also drinking 3 litres of
water

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
water

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.400 
water
and<00:03:55.880> the<00:03:56.180> real<00:03:56.330> eternal<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:56.840> of<00:03:56.990> water<00:03:57.140> is<00:03:57.380> a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
and the real eternal so of water is a

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.760 
and the real eternal so of water is a
lot<00:03:57.740> but<00:03:58.460> it's<00:03:59.270> how<00:03:59.720> much<00:04:00.050> water<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:00.500> was

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
lot but it's how much water I was

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.980 
lot but it's how much water I was
supposed<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.069> drink<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.760> day<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.000> lose<00:04:02.750> weight

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
supposed to drink a day to lose weight

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.449 
supposed to drink a day to lose weight
there's<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.319> certain<00:04:03.620> amount<00:04:03.680> of<00:04:04.100> water<00:04:04.250> you

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
there's a certain amount of water you

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.300 
there's a certain amount of water you
supposed<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.730> drink<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.420> lose<00:04:05.600> weight<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.310> for

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
supposed to drink to lose weight and for

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.890 
supposed to drink to lose weight and for
me<00:04:07.490> when<00:04:07.640> I<00:04:07.700> calculated<00:04:08.270> up<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.600> was<00:04:08.690> three

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
me when I calculated up it was three

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.150 
me when I calculated up it was three
liters<00:04:09.110> of<00:04:09.230> water<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:09.650> three<00:04:09.890> liters<00:04:10.130> of

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
liters of water so three liters of

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.490 
liters of water so three liters of
waters<00:04:10.520> is<00:04:10.790> my<00:04:11.120> goal<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:11.540> even<00:04:11.930> on<00:04:12.020> days<00:04:12.230> where

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
waters is my goal and even on days where

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.980 
waters is my goal and even on days where
I've<00:04:12.590> fallen<00:04:12.890> off<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.310> wagon<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.790> eaten<00:04:14.540> way

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
I've fallen off the wagon and eaten way

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.349 
I've fallen off the wagon and eaten way
more<00:04:15.350> and<00:04:15.590> then<00:04:15.680> 1,200<00:04:15.950> calories<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.760> still

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
more and then 1,200 calories I still

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.630 
more and then 1,200 calories I still
managed<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.660> either<00:04:18.260> lose<00:04:18.530> weight<00:04:18.799> or<00:04:19.190> not

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
managed to either lose weight or not

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.670 
managed to either lose weight or not
gain<00:04:19.880> any<00:04:20.120> weight<00:04:20.239> back<00:04:20.660> so<00:04:21.019> I<00:04:21.049> really<00:04:21.530> think

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
gain any weight back so I really think

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.080 
gain any weight back so I really think
it<00:04:21.829> has<00:04:21.950> a<00:04:21.980> lot<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.250> do<00:04:22.550> with<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.910> water

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
it has a lot to do with the water

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.060 
it has a lot to do with the water
because<00:04:23.390> drinking<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.290> much<00:04:24.440> water<00:04:24.740> also

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
because drinking that much water also

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.950 
because drinking that much water also
you<00:04:25.520> can't<00:04:25.730> snack<00:04:26.090> that<00:04:26.330> much<00:04:26.510> because<00:04:26.720> you're

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
you can't snack that much because you're

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.900 
you can't snack that much because you're
so<00:04:27.320> full<00:04:27.620> from<00:04:27.650> cooking<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.280> much<00:04:28.310> water<00:04:28.580> I

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
so full from cooking that much water I

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.450 
so full from cooking that much water I
think<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.990> 1,200<00:04:30.650> calories<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.400> the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
think that the 1,200 calories and the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.830 
think that the 1,200 calories and the
three<00:04:31.640> layers<00:04:31.820> of<00:04:31.970> water<00:04:32.090> has<00:04:32.360> been<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.570> really

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
three layers of water has been a really

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.500 
three layers of water has been a really
good<00:04:32.930> balance<00:04:33.290> for<00:04:33.320> me<00:04:33.440> I<00:04:33.560> can<00:04:33.830> still<00:04:34.040> eat<00:04:34.760> eat

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
good balance for me I can still eat eat

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.930 
good balance for me I can still eat eat
stuff<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:35.900> wanted<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.530> don't<00:04:37.520> really<00:04:37.760> feel

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
stuff I wanted to I don't really feel

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.990 
stuff I wanted to I don't really feel
like<00:04:38.000> I<00:04:38.270> have<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:39.110> really<00:04:39.290> make<00:04:39.860> really<00:04:40.820> smart
