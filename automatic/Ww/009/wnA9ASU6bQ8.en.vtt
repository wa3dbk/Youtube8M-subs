I<00:03:17.960> think<00:03:18.290> there's<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.500> flaw<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.160> human<00:03:19.670> nature

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
I think there's a flaw in human nature

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.550 
I think there's a flaw in human nature
that<00:03:20.180> we're<00:03:20.360> always<00:03:20.510> thinking<00:03:21.020> that<00:03:21.260> there's

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
that we're always thinking that there's

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.800 
that we're always thinking that there's
a<00:03:21.620> free<00:03:21.890> lunch<00:03:22.100> in<00:03:22.370> this<00:03:22.490> world<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.660> free

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
a free lunch in this world and a free

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.780 
a free lunch in this world and a free
lunch<00:03:23.960> comes<00:03:24.350> one<00:03:24.800> way<00:03:24.950> from<00:03:25.250> printing<00:03:25.670> money

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
lunch comes one way from printing money

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.180 
lunch comes one way from printing money
but<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:26.270> reality<00:03:26.420> there<00:03:27.200> is<00:03:27.320> no<00:03:27.380> free<00:03:27.770> lunch<00:03:27.980> in

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
but in reality there is no free lunch in

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.010 
but in reality there is no free lunch in
printing<00:03:28.550> money<00:03:28.700> ultimately<00:03:29.300> leads<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.690> a

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
printing money ultimately leads to a

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.170 
printing money ultimately leads to a
financial<00:03:30.680> or<00:03:31.010> monetary<00:03:31.430> crisis<00:03:31.940> which<00:03:32.150> is

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
financial or monetary crisis which is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.610 
financial or monetary crisis which is
what<00:03:32.480> happened<00:03:32.840> with<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.080> Mississippi

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620

what happened with the Mississippi
bubble<00:03:33.920> yeah<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.459> ultimately<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.600> stocks

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
bubble yeah and ultimately the stocks

rose
they<00:03:38.840> eventually<00:03:39.380> collapsed<00:03:40.010> what<00:03:40.459> were<00:03:40.550> the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
they eventually collapsed what were the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.940 
they eventually collapsed what were the
consequences<00:03:40.850> of<00:03:41.630> that<00:03:41.750> collapse<00:03:42.290> the

consequences of that collapse the

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.640 
consequences of that collapse the
consequences<00:03:43.700> were<00:03:44.300> tremendous<00:03:44.990> first<00:03:45.260> first

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
consequences were tremendous first first

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.229
