00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
good shift pattern to it up is reversed

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.099 
good shift pattern to it up is reversed
down<00:02:32.099> first<00:02:32.459> second<00:02:33.120> third<00:02:33.359> and<00:02:33.659> then<00:02:33.750> four

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
fourth instead of going up to where v is

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.170 
fourth instead of going up to where v is
you<00:02:36.389> come<00:02:36.599> over<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.989> go<00:02:37.109> down<00:02:37.909> so<00:02:38.909> that<00:02:39.030> takes

you come over and go down so that takes
a<00:02:39.329> little<00:02:39.480> bit<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.719> use<00:02:39.870> getting<00:02:40.260> used<00:02:40.469> to<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.799> I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
a little bit of use getting used to it I

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.479 
a little bit of use getting used to it I
said<00:02:42.269> it's<00:02:42.419> a<00:02:42.480> five-speed<00:02:43.079> this<00:02:44.040> your<00:02:44.310> high

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
said it's a five-speed this your high

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.420 
said it's a five-speed this your high
and<00:02:44.519> low<00:02:44.989> all<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.260> way<00:02:46.319> downs<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.829> low<00:02:47.010> of

and low all the way downs and low of
highs<00:02:47.879> for<00:02:48.590> up<00:02:49.590> here<00:02:49.650> that's<00:02:50.250> for<00:02:50.489> high<00:02:50.669> speed

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
highs for up here that's for high speed

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.920 
highs for up here that's for high speed
and<00:02:52.519> pretty<00:02:53.519> much<00:02:53.609> if<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.030> use<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:54.480> from<00:02:54.810> the
