00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.360
 hi to all the good guys the junkies of 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.890
 my channel i'm plastics in 68 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.230
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.450
 we are in the 35th part of dragon ball z 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.099
 budokan cacit and therefore boys banishment 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.320
 let's talk about this right away 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.660
 clash after a thousand years is revived a 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.970
 legendary hero but the sealed monster 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.680
 in his body he wakes up with him 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.050
 goku launches a new special attack 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.260
 to prevent majin bu from destroying the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.260
 city 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.380
 ok guys we immediately got the fight 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.300
 obviously the boys then I will 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.370
 I say I have already tried it but it has me 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.260
 devastated in a moment then that 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.510
 he practically does not suffer at the moment 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.579
 damage now that I show I had 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.309
 also made the whole dragon archive 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.680
 but nothing had broken me down and we must 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.630
 resist with this energy now vi 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.229
 I show a program for example 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.670
 take a picture for rooms I love is one 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.210
 move that takes away a lot like 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.580
 we know 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.350
 Please play in the deal try load 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.810
 that the sending hereinafter 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.060
 look at four five six shots that 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.729
 they are many and for a supercar at least mm 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.259
 I believe they are normal and nothing has nothing 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.660
 suffered no damage so boys was 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.060
 we must give the escape here do not tell me 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.680
 nothing but it is better if we are not damaged 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.630
 because otherwise this makes me fail 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.000
 again the clash was not given in 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.759
 this horrible move is something 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.600
 of horrible then we continue to 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.110
 run away a little bit there is also there 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.900
 we 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.500
 let us go 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:56.090
 yes that's okay ok we can continue 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.090
 we at nadia 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.410
 here precisely who will do it so let's see 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.010
 to destroy it now already undergoes gods 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.980
 damage to CIACE if I'm saying good 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.959
 attention my mom is forbidden but not 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.760
 I don't even know the move as inevitable 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.630
 then we load a super kamehameha 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.480
 dyck and luckily we got caught 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.950
 I wanted to pit the two moves only 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.350
 which then recalled that his is not 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.020
 that goes straight for straight but practically 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.860
 turns around 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.670
 I repeat a really horrible move 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:44.150
 that is to say just cagacazzi as rice say 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.270
 then come on we immediately do that with 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.610
 the explosion goes to type at the via lama 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:55.100
 vegeta gene epochs super-exclusive wave 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:59.600
 vast exhibition sucks europe I have to say 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:03.380
 sucks then we continue to turn a 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.910
 around a little bit if 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.040
 we can do something but it is 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:13.070
 very good not very good so 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:15.470
 very good and to the building by which not 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:22.100
 can do anything about it 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.780
 we load another super room in nova 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.050
 well this time we don't have a market 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.790
 just for nothing that we're not 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.200
 going bad we did n't go wrong 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.610
 really 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.730
 we conclude the perfect we have it 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.440
 ended here the combo Prague I want 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.030
 try the dragon archive because 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.930
 otherwise we will not forget this 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.930
 study ours 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.650
 or we can continue attention 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.310
 look 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.610
 ok guys so this too 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.080
 35th episode saying that you can 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.000
 I was expecting it to end here 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.830
 sincerely that he took initiative 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.900
 suddenly and concludes me goes to 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.670
 clash alone then in europe was 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.950
 better this way he was missing more or less 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.470
 however, another three bars of life and al 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.210
 monster there ok anyway I hope that 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.950
