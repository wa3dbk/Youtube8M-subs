00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 good morning big boy the like 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.540
 I hope this is refreshed 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.769
 a little bit of air because it 's still here 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.190
 terribly hot good as mine 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.839
 brain does not fuel with this heat e 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.480
 already with difficulty normally when there 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.310
 fresh I decided that instead of making you 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.930
 the book review I read in 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.990
 mountain 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.760
 I will make you yet another video tag 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.900
 actually I did another day 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.760
 that of the indiscreet questions 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.790
 with the film there and the problem 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.200
 is that you hear a background noise 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.680
 openable all the time is one thing 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.340
 chilling to hear for which it 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.450
 we will withdraw when we meet again 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.180
 consequences I can put this to you 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.530
 they said this around this other one I have 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.300
 visa was created by louise brown e 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.090
 then they did a lot of others 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.640
 people including the ma also 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.680
 the opportunity to say goodbye I loved the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.030
 his video then I told you below where 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.860
 what I know has intruded 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.960
 maurito is really wonderful well 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.570
 let's start this video tag is called 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.100
 describe of those books for which there is all 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.390
 a series of questions of a more or 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.420
 less staff to be answered 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.770
 obviously quoting books this 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.979
 time I was not bent played 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.960
 also to take them looking for them among the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.439
 bookstores and the mess that exists because then 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.470
 had to empty them to bring some in 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.600
 new job for which a mess 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.540
 infamous is around the house especially 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.979
 as far as libraries are concerned 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.689
 let's start with the first question six 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.390
 male 6 feline will be line cayman 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.090
 describe yourself as a witch banner styling 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.020
 visit the software what the tests prove 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.930
 what are they all standing on 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.350
 on the rainbow of frank schleck are 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.270
 a modest person you describe yours 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.130
 previous report 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.070
 love at the time of gabriel 's cholera 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.920
 garcia marquez describe your relationship 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.160
 present the desert of the Tartars of Dino 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.050
 buzzed where you would like to find me there 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.660
 tried 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.840
 I swear I searched for books I have 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.220
 tried simply but all that 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.640
 it occurred to me at that time is 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.360
 was only so the guide of the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.220
 lonely planet 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.480
 if I'm sorry but unfortunately I thought 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.190
 also other things but they were not 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.550
 intelligent I would have won to print you some 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:39.500
 photos only hand can understand and turned on 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.570
 but I can say the same thing and not me 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.290
 it seemed something would span 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:49.280
 dictated by us we do as you do 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.490
 feel me regards love right and 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.170
 feeling of coin as of writing 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.880
 intended for John Fante's full flight life 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.340
 what would you ask if he had available 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.310
 one wish a time map of 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.550
 alone on the palms I feel they are going to 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.360
 to finish these free of something uneasy 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.430
 everything is illuminated inhabited by one 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.350
 half-night dream music 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.180
 shakespeare summer 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:22.780
 what do you fear all vague tactical a 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.200
 replanting not only the book because it is 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.700
 a kind of myth like something else to define it 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.800
 that more or less 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.420
 nothing about facilities and no remorse 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.030
 because one lives only once and two 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.050
 it is useless to mull over the past 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.550
 why so much even if we think of the 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.130
 past we have regrets or remorse 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.510
 so it's not that you can change them 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.100
 what's this 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.770
 that is, if things we have not done so 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.880
 if instead they are things I would do a lot 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.470
 let's say so we can do it at least 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.850
 this thought of mine 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.940
 then now we launch this jumble 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.980
 of how to say banality but for me but 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.600
 not only 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.360
 let's move forward a tip for those more 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:14.330
 young little women of louisa may 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.970
 alcott to avoid the fair carefully 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.250
 of good vanities is a song 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.709
 ragazzuoli this visit is over and 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.840
 I did a lot of things, among other things 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.080
 really know how to print to this video 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.000
 it's really a lot should I promise though 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.660
 and I swear solemnly that now though 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.789
 this video review in doubt that 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.919
 the tv tv and that I would also like to do gods 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.389
 video that talks about cinema because 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.150
 absolute of a surprise the week 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.740
 next maybe two surprises you could 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.300
 wait for you next week 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.789
 think of teenagers coming out of the week 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.470
 next and make a local comment for 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.780
 which you can imagine what you can 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.370
 expect if you want clarifications on 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.539
 because I certainly have this other one 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.349
 book you can see the photo 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.740
 I didn't explain why maybe 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.889
 absolutely nothing 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.630
 rightly or otherwise because I know you 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.190
 you are extremely intelligent people 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.449
 and the present has come to us from 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.780
 facts so distant that it should do so 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.639
 explains however 8 as perhaps with the 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.520
 choices are not immediate you are 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.680
 interested you can ask what how 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.199
 you know I always answer with my parents 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.610
 times so if you see that I don't 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.159
 I will also reply immediately 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.820
 private so it is simply because I 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:31.610
 I lick them but I have little time to afford them 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.470
 to respond by giving him answers 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.710
 sensible but another thing I wanted to say 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.479
 a person of his own escapes me 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.930
 absolutely the name of a pardon 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.539
 he asked me to make a video 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:48.560
 frequently asked questions ifac il 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:50.150
 reminder that it is ugly to say not 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.830
 I know you often ask me questions 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.539
 because I don't realize it though 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.460
 maybe you often do the same 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.440
 questions I have to repeat 20 times 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.210
 same things as problems I do not 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.130
 I realize this is why I am there 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.570
 than 20 times people are things 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:07.759
 if you have any questions for me 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.500
 always gender questions like saying 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.560
 literary and cinematographic series 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.400
 television away saying fatemele me here 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.840
 under 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.800
 so I see them sign them 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.780
 eventually tour this video if you have 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:27.090
 requests on videos if you have 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:29.100
 if you want greece you are a book of which 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.110
 I spoke 8,500 times a series 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.240
 television a movie you say melons but 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.060
 in the sign all these things then you must 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.010
 to know it every so often that I repeat it 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.870
 the fact that I don't light right away is why 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.490
 I don't have time I have to think kind of is one 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.930
 life I want to shoot a video on 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.639
 novels set in the Victorian age 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.710
 on novels written during age 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.630
 Victorian the problem that ninth time 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.120
 because it's something that would take me 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:55.290
 like 40 minutes believe accordingly 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.430
 they have to think about it and nothing 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.630
 do all the requests you want 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.850
 ask any questions you want 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.180
 do write below this part 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:06.270
 Video tags that what I have said 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.030
 visual and incorrect between horus I greet you 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.169
 mango peace and wish good readings 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.169
 Hi guys
