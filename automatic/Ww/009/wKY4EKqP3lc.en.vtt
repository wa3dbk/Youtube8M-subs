all<00:01:29.030> right<00:01:29.210> now<00:01:29.360> we<00:01:29.420> need<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.689> talk<00:01:29.899> a<00:01:29.929> little

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
all right now we need to talk a little

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.149 
all right now we need to talk a little
bit<00:01:30.229> about<00:01:30.610> flexibility<00:01:32.170> very<00:01:33.170> very<00:01:33.710> very

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
bit about flexibility very very very

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.800 
bit about flexibility very very very
into<00:01:34.549> flexibility<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.210> reason<00:01:35.479> being<00:01:35.630> is

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
into flexibility the reason being is

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.050 
into flexibility the reason being is
because<00:01:35.840> as<00:01:36.380> you<00:01:36.530> put<00:01:36.710> on<00:01:36.799> muscle<00:01:37.069> you<00:01:37.850> lose

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
because as you put on muscle you lose

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.109 
because as you put on muscle you lose
function<00:01:38.539> and<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:39.140> lose<00:01:39.319> mobility<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.280> you

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
function and you lose mobility and you

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.240 
function and you lose mobility and you
lose<00:01:41.329> flexibility<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.049> for<00:01:42.709> me<00:01:42.890> it's<00:01:43.189> very

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
lose flexibility and for me it's very

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.600 
lose flexibility and for me it's very
important<00:01:43.759> for<00:01:43.850> me<00:01:43.969> to<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.780> know<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.959> keep<00:01:45.259> my

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
important for me to you know to keep my

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.789 
important for me to you know to keep my
my<00:01:46.610> function<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.149> my<00:01:47.270> body<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:48.350> lot<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.560> you

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
my function of my body and a lot of you

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.050 
my function of my body and a lot of you
know<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:48.950> see<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.189> lot<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.369> guys<00:01:49.579> they<00:01:49.759> get<00:01:49.909> so

know you see a lot of guys they get so

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.429 
know you see a lot of guys they get so
muscle-bound<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:50.659> know<00:01:50.780> they<00:01:50.899> it's<00:01:51.170> hard<00:01:51.350> for

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
muscle-bound you know they it's hard for

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.749 
muscle-bound you know they it's hard for

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
hard to and to me that makes no logical

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.050 
hard to and to me that makes no logical
sense<00:01:55.099> you<00:01:55.459> know<00:01:55.549> if<00:01:55.610> you're<00:01:55.729> going<00:01:55.819> to<00:01:55.909> build

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
sense you know if you're going to build

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.460 
sense you know if you're going to build
muscle<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.479> want<00:01:56.599> to<00:01:56.780> keep<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.020> function<00:01:57.380> of

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
muscle you want to keep the function of

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.020 
muscle you want to keep the function of
the<00:01:57.530> body<00:01:57.679> you<00:01:58.159> know<00:01:58.250> you<00:01:58.310> want<00:01:58.579> to<00:01:58.640> improve

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
the body you know you want to improve

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.779 
the body you know you want to improve
yourself<00:01:59.479> not<00:01:59.869> go<00:02:00.679> backwards<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.429> I<00:02:01.520> feel

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
yourself not go backwards and I feel

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.039 
yourself not go backwards and I feel
like<00:02:01.970> if<00:02:02.090> you're<00:02:02.239> losing<00:02:02.539> function<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.989> the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
like if you're losing function of the

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.109 
like if you're losing function of the
body<00:02:03.200> you're<00:02:04.009> going<00:02:04.250> backwards<00:02:04.670> in<00:02:04.819> a<00:02:04.880> sense

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
body you're going backwards in a sense

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.370 
body you're going backwards in a sense
so<00:02:05.689> my<00:02:06.319> big<00:02:06.950> believer<00:02:07.250> in<00:02:07.340> stretchy<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.380> I've

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
so my big believer in stretchy and I've

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.779 
so my big believer in stretchy and I've
always<00:02:09.619> told<00:02:09.769> people<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.190> have<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.519> stretch

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
always told people you have to stretch

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.610 
always told people you have to stretch
you<00:02:11.090> know<00:02:11.180> stretch<00:02:11.450> between<00:02:11.599> sets<00:02:12.079> stretch

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
you know stretch between sets stretch

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.120 
you know stretch between sets stretch
after<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.010> workout<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.610> stay<00:02:14.540> limber<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
after you workout and stay limber and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.860 
after you workout and stay limber and
I've<00:02:16.130> always<00:02:16.340> stretched<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.150> I'm<00:02:17.690> very

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
I've always stretched and I'm very

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.619 
I've always stretched and I'm very
limber<00:02:18.110> very<00:02:18.379> mobile<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:19.090> basically<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.209> can

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
limber very mobile I basically I can

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.229 
limber very mobile I basically I can
dunk<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.870> basketball<00:02:20.989> I<00:02:21.590> can<00:02:21.829> run<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.010> 4.7<00:02:22.700> 40

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
dunk a basketball I can run a 4.7 40

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.650 
dunk a basketball I can run a 4.7 40
believe<00:02:24.049> it<00:02:24.140> or<00:02:24.230> not<00:02:24.350> but<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.950> can<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:26.480> that's

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
believe it or not but I can and that's

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.910 
believe it or not but I can and that's
just<00:02:26.840> because<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.260> years<00:02:27.410> are<00:02:27.560> stretching

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
just because the years are stretching

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.470 
just because the years are stretching
and<00:02:28.010> staying<00:02:28.280> athletic<00:02:28.760> I'm<00:02:28.970> not<00:02:29.180> just

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
and staying athletic I'm not just

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.690 
and staying athletic I'm not just
spending<00:02:30.139> all<00:02:30.290> my<00:02:30.440> time<00:02:30.470> trying<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.430> big

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
spending all my time trying to get big

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.580 
spending all my time trying to get big
so<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.510> think<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.870> have<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.350> know<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.470> have

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
so I think you have to you know you have

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.140 
so I think you have to you know you have
to<00:02:33.769> do<00:02:33.859> a<00:02:33.889> variety<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.370> things<00:02:34.639> you<00:02:34.790> can't<00:02:34.970> just

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
to do a variety of things you can't just

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.270 
to do a variety of things you can't just
do<00:02:35.269> one<00:02:35.540> thing<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.530> flexibility<00:02:37.130> is<00:02:37.190> very

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
do one thing so flexibility is very

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.520 
do one thing so flexibility is very
important<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.000> also<00:02:38.450> flexibility<00:02:39.079> will<00:02:39.230> help

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
important and also flexibility will help

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.559 
important and also flexibility will help
improve<00:02:39.980> muscle<00:02:40.430> growth

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
improve muscle growth

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.050 
improve muscle growth
stretching<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.709> FASTA<00:02:43.130> tissue<00:02:43.340> will<00:02:43.790> allow

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
stretching the FASTA tissue will allow

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.050 
stretching the FASTA tissue will allow
the<00:02:44.120> muscle<00:02:44.569> to<00:02:44.630> grow<00:02:44.780> at<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:44.959> faster<00:02:44.989> rate<00:02:45.500> and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
the muscle to grow at a faster rate and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.160 
the muscle to grow at a faster rate and
bring<00:02:47.060> blood<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.389> the<00:02:47.480> muscle<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:47.810> help<00:02:48.019> heal

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
bring blood to the muscle and help heal

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.229 
bring blood to the muscle and help heal
the<00:02:48.290> muscle<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:48.980> stretching<00:02:49.579> is<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.880> great

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
the muscle so stretching is a great

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.349 
the muscle so stretching is a great
thing<00:02:50.480> that's<00:02:50.680> overlooked<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:52.030> very<00:02:53.030> seldom

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
thing that's overlooked I very seldom

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.300 
thing that's overlooked I very seldom
see<00:02:53.780> people<00:02:54.079> stretching<00:02:54.500> at<00:02:54.620> least<00:02:54.799> in<00:02:55.010> the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
see people stretching at least in the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.670 
see people stretching at least in the
bodybuilding<00:02:55.790> weightlifting<00:02:56.239> powerlifting

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
bodybuilding weightlifting powerlifting

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.490 
bodybuilding weightlifting powerlifting
so<00:02:57.700> my<00:02:58.700> advice<00:02:59.030> start<00:02:59.389> stretching<00:02:59.840> it's<00:03:00.319> going

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
so my advice start stretching it's going
