00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.730
 but let us say that I have returned to one 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.650
 city ​​in a team where I made two 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.619
 fantastic years 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.640
 I returned sincerely to a team 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.949
 where there have also been changes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.810
 especially from the point of view of where 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.699
 he trains things when I was there 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.920
 I didn't train the massive campini 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.619
 that is, now we are undressing it 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.840
 really a great sports center 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.020
 however they remained the same 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.280
 warehousemen chickpea physiotherapists themselves 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.950
 many people when I was there and then 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.550
 honestly it doesn't seem to have been 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.960
 away for six years and I still had one 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.120
 great desire to play to do well 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.030
 because I still feel the urge to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.360
 feel the adrenaline of people 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.980
 pressure things up when mine 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.649
 prosecutor said there was 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.870
 Florentine who was looking for several 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.539
 strikers and so maybe including us 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.129
 it could be mine 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.310
 my hypothesis of a return to Florence 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.780
 so then I followed this is a bit 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.729
 these events they were about to take 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.740
 berbatov then they didn't take me 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.390
 honestly he was a little happy though 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.720
 it didn't come close to the end so I have 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.369
 I said jokes aside when there is 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.710
 That was the chance I gave it to him 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.820
 said with 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.500
 I told him with my prosecutors 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.509
 see if there's a chance to come back 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.700
 in florence because if i have become 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.520
 what I am and what I did is 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.350
 clear that I owe it above all to these 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.759
 two years I have done in Florence then 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.680
 return 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.299
 I had some worries because if 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.649
 you've got a square back where you did 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.390
 very well it is difficult however I wanted 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.720
 come back here to try to give one 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.610
 hand to the team and then again I am 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.110
 really very heavy and so when 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.850
 there was this possibility 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.259
 honestly the manager didn't want to 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.050
 not even know of the entities of the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.319
 contract things but I said I'm going with 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.179
 enthusiasm because I like it is a challenge 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.429
 which I like is a challenge that I want 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.130
 come back into play and I still feel like 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.930
 give so much to football no now me 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.819
 I'm training with the team is clear 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.819
 maybe I try to integrate with 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.440
 something else because after I did 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.510
 a bit of vacation that I need 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.459
 disconnect after what is that also a 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.720
 it hadn't happened to me 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.450
 train with a trainer of mine 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.190
 modena that you know when you grow with the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.600
 team 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.340
 jokes even more when such 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.870
 nest are even worse because you don't 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.959
 comparisons so there is always want to 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.359
 train you and I think I've trained 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.329
 the staff is also quite good but 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:45.269
 found quite well did not think that 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.340
 same not good because you train yourself 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.900
 different that lassassi with the team is 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.940
 clear what I miss most of all 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.609
 it's the game because I could train with 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.350
 my friends after maybe physical work 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.710
 he went to play in the morning 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.960
 soccer with 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.670
 some people with a team of my own 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.770
 country but what I miss 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.380
 above all it is an intense game one 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.360
 real game that now training with 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.260
 the companions are slowly recovering the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.300
 rhythm but let's say that the desire to do 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.160
 well it goes beyond the match with the 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.100
 juve I repeat I get back in the game because 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.630
 I still want to do well, I also remember 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.280
 the goal we did against turin 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.900
 the juve where I broke the record of 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.430
 baptized the twenty-eighth goal me it 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.080
 remember I did it right in Turin with 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.780
 juve i know how you feel about this game 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.510
 I do n't like to say what it does and what it doesn't 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.100
 I the only thing I can say if I have 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.800
 the chance to play will try 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.720
 help my trainer to the maximum 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.240
 definitely give hundred percent 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.010
 all I have from that one 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.780
 what can I say that my two years is there 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.560
 was a fantastic group because the 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.390
 first year they came from a salvation 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.910
 on the last day with brescia mi 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.250
 I remembered we were left with shreds 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.830
 a young group, however, was a group 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.120
 great a group that was fine 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.550
 together it was a ride 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.050
 beautiful towards the champions also 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.120
 the next year 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:12.070
 despite the fact that we started from less than me 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.250
 it seems to be 16 or 17 19 exactly then after 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.630
 we succeeded language and arrive in uefa 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.750
 even there besides being a team 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.820
 strong because he was a strong team there was 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.980
 a fantastic group and from me 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.140
 they have told me in recent years 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.570
 there was no longer that group enthusiasm 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.970
 with the enthusiasm of training that one 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.790
 enthusiasm to help each other that 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.920
 I think it's secret for a city and 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.860
 a school of the Florentine chamber e 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.530
 so from the first days I see that there is 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.940
 new air I tell you more of those 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.480
 that there were last year which I am 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.480
 few left 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.699
 but they said he certainly returns to 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.229
 breathe that air that maybe those 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.849
 years where there was me too which I think it is 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.379
 fundamental for a team like the 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.729
 Florentine that there is a desire to 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.729
 play together to help each other
