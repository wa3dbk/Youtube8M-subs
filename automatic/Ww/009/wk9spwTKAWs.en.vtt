they did do a an updated crafting screen

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370 
they did do a an updated crafting screen
thing<00:01:56.820> where<00:01:57.090> all<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.600> stuff<00:01:57.840> comes<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
thing where all the stuff comes to the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.969 
thing where all the stuff comes to the
top<00:01:58.700> if<00:01:59.700> it's<00:01:59.939> available<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.869> craft<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.469> all

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
top if it's available to craft and all

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.069 
top if it's available to craft and all
the<00:02:02.100> other<00:02:02.189> stuff<00:02:02.390> stays<00:02:03.390> at<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.630> bottom<00:02:03.869> um

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the other stuff stays at the bottom um

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.300 
the other stuff stays at the bottom um
so<00:02:04.530> yeah<00:02:05.250> hopefully<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.180> pc

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
so yeah hopefully that is like the pc

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.870 
so yeah hopefully that is like the pc
crafting<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.539> pc<00:02:09.899> crafting<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
crafting because the pc crafting is a

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.080 
crafting because the pc crafting is a
a lot<00:02:12.360> better<00:02:12.540> than<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.880> mCP<00:02:14.880> see<00:02:15.300> our<00:02:15.630> MCPE

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
a lot better than the mCP see our MCPE

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.880 
a lot better than the mCP see our MCPE
one<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.270> at<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> moment<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.140> also<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.650> new

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
one is at the moment and it also the new

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.920 
one is at the moment and it also the new
survival<00:02:20.310> inventory<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.660> could<00:02:21.810> be
