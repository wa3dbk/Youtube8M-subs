keyboard feels no real nice there's no
flex<00:00:19.640> at<00:00:19.940> all<00:00:20.120> so<00:00:21.020> that's<00:00:21.800> really<00:00:21.920> nice<00:00:22.160> I<00:00:23.950> got

flex at all so that's really nice I got
the<00:00:25.130> 720p<00:00:25.850> screen<00:00:26.090> I<00:00:26.510> did<00:00:26.870> not<00:00:27.050> get<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.410> 1600<00:00:28.130> x

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
the 720p screen I did not get the 1600 x

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.230 
the 720p screen I did not get the 1600 x
900<00:00:29.380> but<00:00:30.380> it<00:00:30.620> does<00:00:30.890> does<00:00:31.670> look<00:00:31.850> really<00:00:32.059> good

gigabyte<00:00:37.760> TT<00:00:38.120> 555<00:00:38.810> m<00:00:39.020> I<00:00:39.400> was<00:00:40.400> running<00:00:40.670> some

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
gigabyte TT 555 m I was running some

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.110 
gigabyte TT 555 m I was running some
videos<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:42.380> stuff<00:00:42.650> so<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.520> temperature<00:00:44.000> is<00:00:44.090> a

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
videos and stuff so the temperature is a

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.790 
videos and stuff so the temperature is a
little<00:00:44.390> high<00:00:44.570> but<00:00:45.500> it<00:00:45.739> typically<00:00:46.180> runs<00:00:47.180> around

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
little high but it typically runs around

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.830 
little high but it typically runs around
45<00:00:48.800> 46<00:00:49.430> degrees<00:00:49.730> Celsius<00:00:50.350> I<00:00:51.350> got<00:00:52.130> the<00:00:52.660> core<00:00:53.660> two

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
45 46 degrees Celsius I got the core two

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.250 
45 46 degrees Celsius I got the core two
core<00:00:54.710> i7<00:00:55.660> 26-30<00:00:56.660> qm<00:00:57.399> processor<00:00:59.020> it's<00:01:00.020> really

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
core i7 26-30 qm processor it's really

core i7 26-30 qm processor it's really
nice<00:01:00.380> real<00:01:00.649> fast<00:01:00.890> it's<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.460> basic<00:01:01.910> model<00:01:01.940> but

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
nice real fast it's the basic model but

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.289 
nice real fast it's the basic model but
still<00:01:03.620> more<00:01:04.129> than<00:01:04.369> enough<00:01:04.689> um<00:01:05.710> oh<00:01:06.939> and<00:01:07.939> i<00:01:08.090> might

still more than enough um oh and i might

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:15.309 
still more than enough um oh and i might
add<00:01:08.329> the<00:01:08.960> GT<00:01:09.770> 555<00:01:10.369> m<00:01:10.549> on<00:01:10.759> load<00:01:11.149> is<00:01:11.719> around<00:01:12.969> 65<00:01:14.319> 66

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
add the GT 555 m on load is around 65 66

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.819 
add the GT 555 m on load is around 65 66
degrees<00:01:15.560> celsius<00:01:16.159> which<00:01:17.030> is<00:01:17.499> very<00:01:18.499> pretty

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
degrees celsius which is very pretty

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.819 
degrees celsius which is very pretty
pretty<00:01:19.280> good<00:01:19.569> for<00:01:20.569> a<00:01:20.600> laptop<00:01:20.840> graphics<00:01:21.319> card

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.640 
integrated is 5.9 the dedicated to
expose<00:02:22.930> 6.9<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.970> primary<00:02:25.360> hard<00:02:25.840> disk<00:02:25.900> the

expose 6.9 and the primary hard disk the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.870 
expose 6.9 and the primary hard disk the
disk<00:02:27.040> right<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:28.239> 5.9<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:28.930> got<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.260> 500<00:02:29.739> gig<00:02:29.890> 7200

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
disk right so 5.9 I got the 500 gig 7200

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.900 
disk right so 5.9 I got the 500 gig 7200
rpm<00:02:31.180> it's<00:02:32.050> not<00:02:32.200> gonna<00:02:32.640> not<00:02:33.640> gonna<00:02:33.760> give<00:02:33.880> you

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
rpm it's not gonna not gonna give you

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.580 
rpm it's not gonna not gonna give you
the<00:02:34.030> best<00:02:36.150> transfer<00:02:37.150> rates<00:02:37.330> all<00:02:38.110> right<00:02:38.290> so

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
the best transfer rates all right so

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.430 
the best transfer rates all right so
anyway<00:02:38.709> let's<00:02:39.700> get<00:02:40.030> down<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.540> hardware<00:02:40.930> I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
anyway let's get down to the hardware I

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.040 
anyway let's get down to the hardware I
guess<00:02:42.269> feels<00:02:43.269> real<00:02:43.540> nice<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.959> touch

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
guess feels real nice to the touch

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.780 
guess feels real nice to the touch
that's<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.500> soft<00:02:44.829> touch<00:02:45.040> rubberized<00:02:45.640> finish

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
that's that soft touch rubberized finish

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.110 
that's that soft touch rubberized finish
to<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.750> code<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.650> LEDs<00:02:48.370> feel<00:02:48.730> really<00:02:49.000> nice

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
to the code the LEDs feel really nice

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.920 
to the code the LEDs feel really nice
yelling<00:02:49.959> command<00:02:50.260> center<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.590> awesome<00:02:51.090> Freya

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
nice today very nice um it does get a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.580 
nice today very nice um it does get a
little<00:03:15.910> warm<00:03:16.239> with<00:03:16.780> everyday<00:03:17.019> use<00:03:17.350> that's

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
little warm with everyday use that's

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.860 
little warm with everyday use that's
mainly<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.340> area<00:03:18.640> here<00:03:18.910> which<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.390> think

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
mainly this area here which is I think

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.970 
mainly this area here which is I think
the<00:03:20.290> hard<00:03:20.500> drive<00:03:20.859> on<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:22.420> GPU<00:03:22.840> right<00:03:23.709> here

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
the hard drive on the GPU right here

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.039 
the hard drive on the GPU right here
stays<00:03:24.280> pretty<00:03:24.489> cool<00:03:24.820> when<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.209> cpu<00:03:25.390> stays

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
stays pretty cool when the cpu stays

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.710 
stays pretty cool when the cpu stays
relatively<00:03:26.470> cool<00:03:26.920> i've<00:03:27.640> ran<00:03:28.000> core<00:03:28.269> temp<00:03:28.540> and

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
relatively cool i've ran core temp and

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.380 
relatively cool i've ran core temp and
the<00:03:28.810> cpu<00:03:29.320> runs<00:03:29.890> at<00:03:30.040> around<00:03:30.250> 30<00:03:30.640> degrees

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
the cpu runs at around 30 degrees

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.180 
the cpu runs at around 30 degrees
celsius<00:03:32.140> on<00:03:32.320> idle<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.780> around<00:03:34.780> 60<00:03:35.769> on<00:03:35.920> load

which<00:03:36.790> is<00:03:36.820> not<00:03:37.480> that<00:03:37.810> bad<00:03:38.549> um<00:03:39.720> battery<00:03:40.720> life<00:03:40.900> is

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
which is not that bad um battery life is

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.470 
which is not that bad um battery life is
pretty<00:03:41.230> good<00:03:41.459> it's<00:03:42.459> off<00:03:42.790> v6<00:03:43.359> our<00:03:43.950> claim

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
pretty good it's off v6 our claim

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.410 
pretty good it's off v6 our claim
but<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.590> is<00:03:46.709> nice<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.519> get<00:03:47.730> around<00:03:47.940> four<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:48.330> a

half hours with every day used with some
video<00:03:51.629> watching<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.230> stuff<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:53.120> long<00:03:54.120> balance

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
video watching and stuff a long balance

money<00:03:54.870> one<00:03:55.080> power<00:03:55.319> saver<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.950> enough<00:03:56.159> for<00:03:56.370> a

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
money one power saver is enough for a

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.140 
money one power saver is enough for a
half<00:03:57.480> hours<00:03:57.980> maybe<00:03:58.980> with<00:03:59.310> all<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.909> LEDs

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
half hours maybe with all the LEDs

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.259 
half hours maybe with all the LEDs
turned<00:04:00.810> off<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.310> power<00:04:02.310> saver<00:04:02.790> mode<00:04:02.819> i<00:04:03.090> might

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
turned off and power saver mode i might

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.220 
turned off and power saver mode i might
squeeze<00:04:03.540> up<00:04:03.720> five<00:04:03.930> five<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.349> a<00:04:04.410> half<00:04:06.230> um

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
squeeze up five five and a half um

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.430 
squeeze up five five and a half um
anyway<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.610> little<00:04:08.760> bit<00:04:08.910> heavy<00:04:09.440> it's

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
anyway it is a little bit heavy it's

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.220 
anyway it is a little bit heavy it's
about<00:04:10.860> six<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.700> half<00:04:11.760> pounds<00:04:12.420> which<00:04:13.200> is

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
about six and a half pounds which is

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.800 
about six and a half pounds which is
really<00:04:13.530> not<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:14.040> heavy<00:04:14.280> but<00:04:15.180> I'm<00:04:15.420> comparing

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
really not that heavy but I'm comparing

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.439 
really not that heavy but I'm comparing
it<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:15.989> other<00:04:16.220> 14<00:04:17.220> inch<00:04:17.370> laptops<00:04:17.820> which<00:04:18.060> again

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
it to other 14 inch laptops which again

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:25.400 
it to other 14 inch laptops which again
is<00:04:18.510> kind<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.229> ridiculous<00:04:19.489> um<00:04:22.100> but<00:04:23.100> yeah<00:04:24.410> she
