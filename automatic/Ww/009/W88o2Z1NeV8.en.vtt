take<00:02:17.860> cards<00:02:18.310> are<00:02:18.430> actually<00:02:18.790> tunable<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.659> any

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
take cards are actually tunable in any

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.899 
take cards are actually tunable in any
way<00:02:20.200> not<00:02:20.620> even<00:02:20.769> me<00:02:21.099> on<00:02:21.280> switch<00:02:21.670> i<00:02:21.819> think<00:02:22.060> was

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
way not even me on switch i think was

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.360 
way not even me on switch i think was
previously<00:02:24.909> available<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:26.019> actually<00:02:26.190> put<00:02:27.190> on

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
previously available to actually put on

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.130 
previously available to actually put on
a<00:02:27.400> fast<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.909> furious<00:02:27.940> card<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.690> I'll<00:02:29.110> just

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
a fast and furious card so I'll just

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.979 
a fast and furious card so I'll just
demonstrate<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:30.069> hold<00:02:30.400> on<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.690> here<00:02:31.900> you

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
demonstrate that hold on so here you

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.759 
demonstrate that hold on so here you
have<00:02:33.599> ugly<00:02:36.060> fast<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.269> furious<00:02:37.569> car<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:37.989> if<00:02:38.530> we

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
have ugly fast and furious car and if we

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.910 
have ugly fast and furious car and if we
see<00:02:39.010> over<00:02:39.220> here<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:40.030> come<00:02:40.269> by<00:02:40.810> neons<00:02:41.560> and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
see over here you come by neons and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.330 
see over here you come by neons and
that's<00:02:42.849> a<00:02:43.420> little<00:02:43.900> bit<00:02:44.079> weird<00:02:44.410> probably

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
that's a little bit weird probably

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.500 
that's a little bit weird probably
because<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.700> licensing<00:02:46.599> problems<00:02:46.930> but<00:02:48.150> yeah<00:02:49.150> I

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
because of licensing problems but yeah I

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.920 
because of licensing problems but yeah I
mean<00:02:49.959> who<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.410> who<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.220> hell<00:02:51.400> puts<00:02:51.760> me<00:02:52.450> on<00:02:52.480> a

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
mean who the who the hell puts me on a

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.160 
mean who the who the hell puts me on a
Ford<00:02:53.260> Escort<00:02:53.470> make<00:02:54.010> one<00:02:54.250> anyway<00:02:54.700> um<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.930> that's

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
Ford Escort make one anyway um so that's

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.259 
Ford Escort make one anyway um so that's
pretty<00:02:56.560> much<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.950> for<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.190> one<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.609> sells<00:02:57.879> for

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
pretty much it for this one it sells for

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.460 
pretty much it for this one it sells for
the<00:02:58.480> 17<00:02:59.290> grand<00:02:59.560> so<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:01.170> really<00:03:02.170> have<00:03:02.260> not

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
the 17 grand so I really have not

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.009 
the 17 grand so I really have not
considered<00:03:02.980> selling<00:03:03.489> this<00:03:03.790> because<00:03:04.060> it's<00:03:04.900> a

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
considered selling this because it's a

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.559 
considered selling this because it's a
classic<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.890> don't<00:03:06.519> think<00:03:06.700> that<00:03:06.909> that<00:03:07.180> will

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
classic and I don't think that that will

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.710 
classic and I don't think that that will
ever<00:03:07.780> be<00:03:08.109> another<00:03:08.349> way<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.650> get<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.129> so<00:03:09.340> we

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
ever be another way to get it so we

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.140 
ever be another way to get it so we
should<00:03:10.720> keep<00:03:10.959> it<00:03:11.200> now<00:03:11.799> we<00:03:11.859> move<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.400> doms

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
should keep it now we move on to doms

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:22.289 
should keep it now we move on to doms
charger<00:03:14.099> this<00:03:15.099> is<00:03:15.720> basically<00:03:17.400> um<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:21.299> main

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
charger this is basically um the main

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.690 
charger this is basically um the main
card<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.930> movie<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.889> mean<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.310> didn't

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
card of the movie and I mean I didn't

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.839 
card of the movie and I mean I didn't
see<00:03:24.849> the<00:03:24.970> movie<00:03:25.180> but<00:03:25.560> no<00:03:26.560> why<00:03:27.069> i<00:03:27.129> saw<00:03:27.430> i<00:03:27.579> think

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
see the movie but no why i saw i think

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.990 
see the movie but no why i saw i think
this<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.299> think<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.200> also<00:03:29.500> gets<00:03:29.889> destroyed<00:03:30.280> but

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
this I think it also gets destroyed but

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.710 
this I think it also gets destroyed but
um<00:03:32.160> well<00:03:33.160> as<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:33.459> said<00:03:33.910> before<00:03:33.940> which<00:03:34.510> cut

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
um well as I said before which cut

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.720 
um well as I said before which cut
doesn't<00:03:35.139> um<00:03:36.000> yeah<00:03:37.000> uh<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:39.310> fully

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
doesn't um yeah uh it's fully

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.770 
doesn't um yeah uh it's fully
upgradeable<00:03:40.859> oh<00:03:41.859> my<00:03:42.609> god<00:03:43.000> yeah<00:03:43.389> you<00:03:43.449> can

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
upgradeable oh my god yeah you can

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.629 
upgradeable oh my god yeah you can
upgrade<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.290> performance<00:03:44.980> otherwise<00:03:45.400> it's

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
upgrade the performance otherwise it's

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.240 
upgrade the performance otherwise it's
locked<00:03:45.940> um<00:03:46.299> it's<00:03:47.049> more<00:03:47.139> expensive<00:03:47.470> but<00:03:47.919> if<00:03:48.099> I

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
locked um it's more expensive but if I

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.140 
locked um it's more expensive but if I
think<00:03:48.489> it's<00:03:48.639> a<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:50.370> exact<00:03:51.370> same<00:03:51.609> speed<00:03:51.940> as<00:03:52.090> the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
think it's a the exact same speed as the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.229 
think it's a the exact same speed as the
golden<00:03:52.810> version<00:03:53.199> effete<00:03:53.500> would<00:03:53.680> get<00:03:54.239> by

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
golden version effete would get by

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.289 
golden version effete would get by
complete<00:03:55.720> my<00:03:55.930> collection<00:03:56.730> um<00:03:59.849> yeah<00:04:00.849> right

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
complete my collection um yeah right

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.039 
complete my collection um yeah right

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
here oh now i'm not going to compare it

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.809 
here oh now i'm not going to compare it
because<00:04:05.440> i<00:04:05.530> kind<00:04:05.769> of<00:04:05.889> have<00:04:06.129> to<00:04:06.160> do<00:04:06.579> something

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
for school but yeah it's a pretty much

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.659 
for school but yeah it's a pretty much

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
it's quite fast for motorcycle it's not

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.010 
it's quite fast for motorcycle it's not
nearly<00:04:31.570> as<00:04:31.750> fast<00:04:32.170> as<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.410> tomahawk<00:04:33.120> but<00:04:34.120> it's

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
nearly as fast as a tomahawk but it's

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.520 
nearly as fast as a tomahawk but it's
not<00:04:35.290> bad<00:04:35.740> for<00:04:36.040> a<00:04:36.070> motor<00:04:36.310> sulking<00:04:36.880> more

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
upgradable except for the performance of

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.360 
upgradable except for the performance of
course<00:04:46.230> but<00:04:47.230> I<00:04:47.740> know<00:04:48.010> it's<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.280> baby<00:04:48.730> so<00:04:49.950> not<00:04:50.950> why
