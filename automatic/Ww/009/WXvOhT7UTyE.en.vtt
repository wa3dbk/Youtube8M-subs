did<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> couple<00:00:45.719> new<00:00:45.930> things<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.440> board

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
did a couple new things for the board

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.770 
did a couple new things for the board
this<00:00:46.770> year<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:47.730> took<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.059> board<00:00:48.390> which<00:00:48.629> was

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
this year we took this board which was

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
this year we took this board which was
only<00:00:48.989> available<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> PVC<00:00:49.829> high-end<00:00:50.489> core

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
only available in a PVC high-end core

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.160 
only available in a PVC high-end core
before<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.930> came<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> new<00:00:53.039> BioLite

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
before and we came up with a new BioLite

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.590 
before and we came up with a new BioLite
polyurethane<00:00:55.170> foam<00:00:55.440> internal<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> it's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
polyurethane foam internal to it so it's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.270 
polyurethane foam internal to it so it's
got<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> way<00:00:58.020> more<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.379> basic<00:00:58.739> price<00:00:58.949> point

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
got a way more of a basic price point

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.459 
got a way more of a basic price point
now<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.910> line<00:01:00.090> versus<00:01:00.960> being<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> highest

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
now in the line versus being the highest

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.799 
now in the line versus being the highest
end<00:01:01.770> board<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:03.120> still<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.600> try

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
end board that it was but still to try

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.440 
end board that it was but still to try

the true shape that's always been Mitch

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.289 
the true shape that's always been Mitch
actually<00:01:06.960> rode<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.680> exact<00:01:08.159> model<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:09.150> win

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
actually rode this exact model to win

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.969 
actually rode this exact model to win
the<00:01:09.420> world<00:01:09.570> title<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.049> year<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.799> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the world title this year on on this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.789 
the world title this year on on this
board<00:01:11.600> we<00:01:12.600> did<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> new<00:01:13.200> glass<00:01:13.470> construction

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
board we did do a new glass construction

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.429 
board we did do a new glass construction
on<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.220> board<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.610> well<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> double

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
on this board as well it's got a double

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.830 
on this board as well it's got a double
lap<00:01:16.619> construction<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.520> basically<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> bottom

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
lap construction so basically the bottom

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.890 
lap construction so basically the bottom
glass<00:01:19.080> wraps<00:01:19.890> over<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> top<00:01:20.490> rail<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.689> top

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
glass wraps over the top rail in the top

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
glass wraps over the top rail in the top
class<00:01:22.170> wraps<00:01:22.500> over<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.890> bottom<00:01:23.220> rail<00:01:23.400> which

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
class wraps over the bottom rail which

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.070 
class wraps over the bottom rail which
what<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.060> basically<00:01:24.240> does<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.810> reinforce

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
what this basically does is reinforce

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.469 
what this basically does is reinforce
this<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> whole<00:01:25.770> perimeter<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> board<00:01:26.640> all

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this a whole perimeter of the board all

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.539 
this a whole perimeter of the board all
my<00:01:27.720> glass<00:01:27.930> technology<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.680> byerly<00:01:29.100> really

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
my glass technology with byerly really

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.609 
my glass technology with byerly really
focusing<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.270> having<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.750> main<00:01:30.960> construction

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
focusing on having the main construction

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.480 
focusing on having the main construction
of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> glass<00:01:32.840> wrap<00:01:33.840> around<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.500> support<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
of the glass wrap around and support the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.179 
of the glass wrap around and support the
rails<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.509> glass<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.960> flats<00:01:37.259> actually

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
rails the glass on the flats actually

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.560 
rails the glass on the flats actually
doesn't<00:01:38.460> add<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> lot<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.970> strength<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
doesn't add a lot of strength to the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.480 
doesn't add a lot of strength to the
board<00:01:39.810> or<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.590> really<00:01:40.799> gain<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
board or you really gain all the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.120 
board or you really gain all the
strength<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.229> rigidity<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.649> board<00:01:43.950> is

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
strength and rigidity of the board is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.040 
strength and rigidity of the board is
around<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> perimeter<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> board

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
around the perimeter of the board

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.620 
around the perimeter of the board
we<00:01:46.650> did<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.830> new<00:01:46.980> graphic<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.730> board<00:01:48.000> it's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
we did a new graphic on this board it's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.270 
we did a new graphic on this board it's
going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:48.900> available<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.500> year<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.920> three

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
going to be available this year in three

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
going to be available this year in three
sizes<00:01:50.460> you'll<00:01:50.910> have<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.270> 56<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.640> 5452<00:01:54.290> did<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.500 
sizes you'll have it a 56 a 5452 did a
really<00:01:55.590> cool<00:01:55.860> new<00:01:55.890> black<00:01:56.310> graphic<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:57.480> a

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
really cool new black graphic with a

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.870 
really cool new black graphic with a

the<00:02:00.750> three<00:02:01.020> different<00:02:01.140> sizes<00:02:01.470> are<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.610> to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the three different sizes are going to

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.100 
the three different sizes are going to
look<00:02:02.760> really<00:02:03.000> similar<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.630> main<00:02:03.780> difference

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
look really similar the main difference

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.190 
look really similar the main difference
is<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.410> be<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> 56<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.580> red<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.540> 54
