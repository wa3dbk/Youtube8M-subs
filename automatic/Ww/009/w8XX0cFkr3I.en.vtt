00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.930 
the only thing I can think of after
using<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.120> for<00:02:35.350> over<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.380> month<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.130> it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
using it for over a month is that it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.940 
using it for over a month is that it
only<00:02:38.150> works<00:02:38.300> standing<00:02:38.990> up<00:02:39.140> because<00:02:39.800> the

only works standing up because the

only works standing up because the
speakers<00:02:40.040> around<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.880> sides<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.840> if<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:41.990> put

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
speakers around the sides so if you put

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.720 
speakers around the sides so if you put
it<00:02:42.260> down<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.470> can<00:02:42.680> definitely<00:02:42.950> hear<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.640> the
