00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.710
 I love to do 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.750
 And how long before it takes again? 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.190
 It's because I had no news, I did not have 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.660

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.190

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.800

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.110

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.420

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.489
 going to have from your school to mac already had 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.680
 said this before in the video that was 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.269
 acting last month still obviously 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.850
 not even a month has started now 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.040
 But finally, I'm sorry about January. 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.440
 middle of January as honey version 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.630
 for Mac 24 10 in February so now 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.720
 they even announced the definite date of 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.909
 February 17 has 2004 for mac 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.040
 some questions you can ask me 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.500
 I'll answer you 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.880
 she will not be sold and physical media 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.760
 it will only be sold in some stores 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.640
 online type amazon and something like that and 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.890
 time the ihg's own if you have 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.060
 the version for PC and that the version of your 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.190
 school for me is that you will not 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.170
 need to buy a new game 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.640
 you will get the same code will use 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.340
 on your mac then you do not need 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.230
 make that transition there is like you 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.520
 buy a game for pc and to buy 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.860
 one for me is that they will make you 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.560
 make you do it and also if you 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.320
 had to adele sena removed free 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.900
 it also will not be hard to buy 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.700
 mac and future versions should be 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.830
 also it will be released 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.690
 simultaneously both for both 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.980
 baby how much for mac so now yes 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.510
 they are kind of gone 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.520
 difference between the two and now the game 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.590
 is running for both pc and me 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.060
 here they said this is a mac is a 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.980
 bit harder than you 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.470
 not play games, so he needed a 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.150
 work better there much more thing 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.470
 to be able to perform well as well 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
 for the mac 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.220
 so that's why it took a 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.680
 A little more to go out to the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.450
 Mac version but now it's gone 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.700

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.439

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.010

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:04.639

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.620
 talk celebrate the sims day 4 of 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.560

 frank the sims then we are there 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.959
 waiting for news and waiting for 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.419
 more things you can have 2004 right? 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.040
 As you know, last year, if not 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.510
 I'm wrong, they 'll make me advertise. 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.069
 some things we've waited so long for 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.769
 cause of sewage that did not end 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.750
 leaving nothing 64 and left with some 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.239
 videos some images by celebrating 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.370
 same date but nothing jealous 4 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.049
 now as it has been released and how we 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.760
 Are you expecting something like that? 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.680
 expand some news 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.560
 we wait for bigger things 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.079
 that will be announced to leave on day 4 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.120
 of February taking advantage there in gauchão 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.609
 There you are in the sims four that is already 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.989
 released and have to withdraw free 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.299
 so I think it would be a very hype 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.370
 big they will advertise on something 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.049
 these days, of course, and also 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.370
 some things the images that are new 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.620
 and that we are waiting for them 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.780
 announce that this is what they are 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.329
 scheduling for us could 4 of that 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.040
 police clothes can veto there 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.870
 with the clothes it looks like he's with 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.970
 police clothing for the crime of the navy 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.310
 new army school she has a 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.319
 police hat and everything else has 80 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.120
 with a stranger has some items 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.340
 of the new line 166 that the 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.199
 people have not seen it yet in 2004 and that 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.299
 They'll probably tell us the 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.229
 that's what they're programmed 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.990
 for us 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.570
 on day 4 so let's wait let's go 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.070
 wait for this date to reach 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.800
 any news I'm obviously going to 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.199
 bring the channel probably i would 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.900
 I do not believe I do not know, I can be wrong. 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.449
 obviously I believe they will get 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.509
 launch some update to speak 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.940
 about these new new clothes and everything 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.330
 more than 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.550
 they can announce this update that 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.730
 Bring some new clothes some interactions 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.620
 Maybe, but it 's just a date 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.530
 To celebrate, I do not even believe they 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.840
 will announce an expansion promises 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.730
 so on day 4 but it would be very cool if 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.170
 they announce why we are already 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.940
 angry is too big the first time 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.620
 expansion of these four and if it was a 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.990
 expulsion that they can anticipate. 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.300
 caracas is this expansion that I wanted 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.710
 we start there so fast a lot 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.740
 great power is discovered the galley goes 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.600
 buy a lot because it's a game that 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.580
 people are waiting for new things 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.320
 reach expansions to reach 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.640
 be able to move and as soon as they are 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.740
 We're going to stay with the team. 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.720
 very big and there is always that addiction 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.670
 in that cycle that we had 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.830
 who were not the sims 3 right? 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.890
 should be the object position of 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.960
 accuracy in 2003 did not have a license 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.610
 invest but had the objects expansion 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.470
 with function objects now we are 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.930
 content yesterday should be expanding 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.060
 of this legislation then I decided to abc 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.160
 I liked to buy more than I liked 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.530
 to buy the object then it is a 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.960
 hype that has produced the four 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.460
 basically your 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.990
 Today you liked the survey of NGOs at 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.620
 favor of these criminals and liked the 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.900
 content 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.060
 are pretty basic stuff but things that are not 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.560
 Let's go, could not stop talking to 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.570
 you because there are many people who 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.370
 accompany me and do not accompany my 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.800
 fan page or do not follow the fan page 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.780
 the sims no then would not 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.419
 knowing this from information like this and 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.800
 as I always do videos going by 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.630
 any information of any kind 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.760
 information even so I find 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.950
 needed for the videos and then I go there 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.870
 and then I could not stop doing 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.820
 a video talking about information 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.590
 So that's it and I do not want to comment here on 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.480
 comments what you thought you 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.460
 think they will do on the 4th that they are 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.680
 these images what these new things 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.880
 on this image of the cover of the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.560
 sims mean 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.150
 and so we will wait for day 4 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.490
 to get any information I have to 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.620
 you and do not forget that there is another 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.050
 Video talking about the draw 2004 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.820
 exactly what you are going to do in 2004 in 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.910
 digital version or follow the code 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.220
 just in time under the game that chance 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.710
 I will speak of three types of draw three 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.570
 chances of you winning then 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.520
 in today's video of draw still I will 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.410
 tell you how it's going to work 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.380
 It's going to be really cool for you, I have. 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.300
 sure that's what I want to talk about 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.260
 favorite've talked so installation 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.260
 since then it has been
