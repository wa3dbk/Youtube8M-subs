if<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.400> wanted<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.880> apply<00:00:06.270> hyper<00:00:06.660> voxels<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
if I wanted to apply hyper voxels to the

if I wanted to apply hyper voxels to the
surface<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.430> this<00:00:08.550> object<00:00:09.120> what<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:09.990> could<00:00:10.170> do

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
surface of this object what I could do

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.789 
surface of this object what I could do
is<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.559> could<00:00:10.590> go<00:00:10.860> over<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.660> control<00:00:12.660> f<00:00:12.930> 64<00:00:13.709> the

going to double-click and just move this
over<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:20.190> and<00:00:20.900> for<00:00:22.880> for<00:00:23.880> what<00:00:24.179> i<00:00:24.240> want<00:00:24.480> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
over here and for for what i want to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.659 
over here and for for what i want to
apply<00:00:24.749> my<00:00:24.869> hyper<00:00:25.740> box<00:00:26.009> so<00:00:26.249> i'm<00:00:26.339> just<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
apply my hyper box so i'm just going to

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.339 
apply my hyper box so i'm just going to
double<00:00:26.849> click<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.240> box<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:28.169> going<00:00:28.289> to

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
double click on box it's going to

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.739 
double click on box it's going to
automatically<00:00:29.099> set<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.029> object<00:00:30.449> type<00:00:30.570> to

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:30.749 
automatically set the object type to

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.150 
automatically set the object type to
surface<00:00:31.109> that's<00:00:31.259> default<00:00:31.769> let's<00:00:32.009> go<00:00:32.099> ahead

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
surface that's default let's go ahead

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.610 
surface that's default let's go ahead
and<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.400> an<00:00:32.520> f<00:00:32.759> 9<00:00:33.120> render<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.590> that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
and do an f 9 render and we can see that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.180 
and do an f 9 render and we can see that
for<00:00:35.040> every<00:00:35.520> point<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.390> object<00:00:37.190> its

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
for every point on the object its

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.100 
for every point on the object its
placing<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.000> surface<00:00:39.420> voxel<00:00:39.750> i'm<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:39.990> to<00:00:40.050> go

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
placing a surface voxel i'm going to go

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.640 
placing a surface voxel i'm going to go
ahead<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.350> size<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.830> down<00:00:41.040> some<00:00:41.400> and<00:00:42.650> do

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
ahead and size that down some and do

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.770 
ahead and size that down some and do
another<00:00:43.770> render<00:00:44.250> okay<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.210> let's<00:00:45.630> do

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
another render okay and let's do

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.090 
another render okay and let's do
something<00:00:46.080> other<00:00:46.260> than<00:00:46.290> grey<00:00:46.680> i'm<00:00:46.860> gonna<00:00:46.980> just

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
something other than grey i'm gonna just

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.880 
something other than grey i'm gonna just
come<00:00:47.220> over<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> shading<00:00:47.790> and<00:00:48.150> pick<00:00:48.960> blue<00:00:49.290> just

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
come over to shading and pick blue just

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.140 
come over to shading and pick blue just
so<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.040> shows<00:00:50.220> up<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.780> go<00:00:51.900> okay<00:00:52.230> so

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
so it shows up and there we go okay so

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.050 
so it shows up and there we go okay so
what<00:00:54.150> if<00:00:54.240> i<00:00:54.360> want<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.770> them<00:00:55.950> randomly<00:00:56.550> on

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
what if i want to have them randomly on

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.900 
what if i want to have them randomly on
the<00:00:57.330> surface<00:00:57.750> well<00:00:58.410> i<00:00:58.710> could<00:00:59.190> go<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.520> add

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the surface well i could go and add

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.280 
the surface well i could go and add
segments<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.710> box<00:01:01.950> but<00:01:02.310> it's<00:01:02.490> going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.290> be

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
segments to the box but it's going to be

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.890 
segments to the box but it's going to be
this<00:01:04.439> uniform<00:01:05.100> pattern<00:01:05.460> where<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.479> segments

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
this uniform pattern where the segments

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.060 
this uniform pattern where the segments
are<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> place<00:01:07.830> them

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
are because it's going to place them

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.219 
are because it's going to place them
where<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.759> points<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:09.840> i<00:01:09.929> want<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
where the points are so if i want to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
where the points are so if i want to
randomly<00:01:10.710> place<00:01:11.039> it<00:01:11.219> there's<00:01:11.399> a<00:01:11.460> few<00:01:11.759> ways

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
randomly place it there's a few ways

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.419 
randomly place it there's a few ways
that<00:01:11.939> i<00:01:12.149> can<00:01:12.299> go<00:01:12.390> about<00:01:12.509> doing<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.079> but<00:01:13.310> one<00:01:14.310> way

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
that i can go about doing it but one way

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:15.529 
that i can go about doing it but one way
I<00:01:14.460> thought<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.789> could<00:01:14.909> take<00:01:14.999> a<00:01:15.060> look<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.390> is

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
I thought we could take a look at is

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.099 
I thought we could take a look at is
using<00:01:15.929> a<00:01:17.210> seldom-used<00:01:18.210> tool<00:01:18.630> over<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109 
using a seldom-used tool over and

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.109 
using a seldom-used tool over and
modeler<00:01:19.499> and<00:01:19.679> we'll<00:01:20.130> take<00:01:20.369> advantage<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.999> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
modeler and we'll take advantage of it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.099 
modeler and we'll take advantage of it
for<00:01:21.929> randomly<00:01:22.619> placing<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.850> voxels<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.840> this

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 
for randomly placing the voxels on this

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:26.959 
for randomly placing the voxels on this
box<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.130> hop<00:01:26.280> over<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.549> modeler

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
box so I'm going to hop over to modeler

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:32.719 
box so I'm going to hop over to modeler
and<00:01:27.319> with<00:01:28.319> the<00:01:29.329> with<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.509> box<00:01:30.899> and<00:01:31.729> this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
and with the with this box and this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
and with the with this box and this
layer<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.149> going<00:01:33.179> to<00:01:33.329> go<00:01:33.420> over<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.920> multiply

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
layer I'm going to go over to multiply

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.179 
layer I'm going to go over to multiply
subdivide<00:01:35.909> more<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.810> choose<00:01:37.109> random<00:01:37.799> Prix

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
subdivide more and choose random Prix

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.760 
subdivide more and choose random Prix
and<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.210> decide<00:01:39.479> how<00:01:39.539> many<00:01:39.869> points<00:01:40.319> I<00:01:40.590> want

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and I can decide how many points I want

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.669 
and I can decide how many points I want
to<00:01:40.799> add<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.340> my<00:01:42.049> box<00:01:43.049> here<00:01:43.319> i'm<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.619> go

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
to add to my box here i'm going to go

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.499 
to add to my box here i'm going to go
ahead<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.859> well<00:01:44.549> let's<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.909> use<00:01:45.359> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
ahead and well let's just use the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.699 
ahead and well let's just use the
default<00:01:45.869> 100<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.459> randomly<00:01:47.999> places<00:01:48.749> points

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
default 100 so it randomly places points

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.870 
default 100 so it randomly places points
on<00:01:49.859> the<00:01:50.369> geometry<00:01:50.929> and<00:01:52.459> don't<00:01:53.459> worry<00:01:53.639> about

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
on the geometry and don't worry about

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.270 
on the geometry and don't worry about
the<00:01:54.060> extra<00:01:54.709> segments<00:01:55.709> in<00:01:55.799> there<00:01:55.920> they're<00:01:56.130> not

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the extra segments in there they're not

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.859 
the extra segments in there they're not
going<00:01:56.459> to<00:01:56.520> render<00:01:56.729> unless<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.329> want<00:01:57.689> them<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
going to render unless you want them to

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.559 
going to render unless you want them to
we<00:01:58.319> could<00:01:58.499> turn<00:01:58.709> edges<00:01:59.249> on<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.999> rendering<00:02:00.240> but

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
we could turn edges on for rendering but

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.209 
we could turn edges on for rendering but
it's<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.560> change<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.920> look<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
it's not going to change the look of the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.489 
it's not going to change the look of the
render<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.789> we've<00:02:03.600> got<00:02:03.810> all<00:02:03.959> these<00:02:04.229> extra

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
render but we've got all these extra

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.050 
render but we've got all these extra
points<00:02:04.979> let<00:02:05.100> me<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.340> go<00:02:05.429> to<00:02:05.520> point<00:02:05.759> mode<00:02:05.909> we

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
points let me just go to point mode we

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.459 
points let me just go to point mode we
got<00:02:06.149> all<00:02:06.299> these<00:02:06.450> extra<00:02:06.689> points<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.170> work<00:02:07.289> with

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
got all these extra points to work with

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.230 
got all these extra points to work with
so<00:02:07.979> let's<00:02:08.130> see<00:02:08.250> what<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.490> looks<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.789> over

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
so let's see what this looks like over

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.350 
so let's see what this looks like over
in<00:02:09.450> layout<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:10.500> going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.679> synchronize

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
in layout so I'm going to synchronize

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.860 
in layout so I'm going to synchronize
come<00:02:12.360> over<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.659> layout<00:02:13.400> do<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> render<00:02:14.879> look<00:02:15.780> at

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
come over to layout do a render look at

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.290 
come over to layout do a render look at
this<00:02:15.989> I've<00:02:16.260> randomly<00:02:17.220> placed

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
this I've randomly placed

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.860 
this I've randomly placed
voxels<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.110> my<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:20.400> my<00:02:20.460> box<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.120> want<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.810> can

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
voxels on my on my box if I want I can

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.260 
voxels on my on my box if I want I can
go<00:02:22.800> back<00:02:23.010> over<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.490> geometry<00:02:24.120> tab<00:02:24.330> and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
go back over to the geometry tab and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.880 
go back over to the geometry tab and
just<00:02:27.270> increase<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:30.350> okay<00:02:31.350> increase<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
just increase this okay increase the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.250 
just increase this okay increase the
size<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.130> now<00:02:32.580> they're<00:02:33.420> kind<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.690> mixing

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
size and now they're kind of mixing

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.470 
size and now they're kind of mixing
together<00:02:34.440> they're<00:02:35.160> blending<00:02:35.580> together<00:02:35.730> but

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
together they're blending together but

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.540 
together they're blending together but
they're<00:02:36.660> random<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.740> not<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.160> same<00:02:38.370> as

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
they're random it's not the same as

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.220 
they're random it's not the same as
going<00:02:38.700> over<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.180> adding<00:02:39.510> segments<00:02:40.080> I've

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
going over and adding segments I've

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.460 
going over and adding segments I've
randomly<00:02:41.130> added<00:02:41.310> points<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.840> turn<00:02:43.140> off

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
randomly added points and if I turn off

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.230 
randomly added points and if I turn off
the<00:02:43.680> voxels<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.460> just<00:02:44.610> want<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.850> do<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.940> quick

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
the voxels I just want to do a quick

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.270 
the voxels I just want to do a quick
render<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:46.140> can't<00:02:46.380> tell<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.010> got

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
render you can't tell that it's got

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.380 
render you can't tell that it's got
those<00:02:47.490> extra<00:02:47.790> points<00:02:48.060> because<00:02:48.210> remember

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
those extra points because remember

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.440 
those extra points because remember
points<00:02:48.900> don't<00:02:49.050> render<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.150> one<00:02:51.420> way

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
points don't render so this is one way

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.150 
points don't render so this is one way
of<00:02:51.900> going<00:02:52.140> I'm<00:02:52.380> going<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.590> turn<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:52.890> back<00:02:53.130> on

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
of going I'm going to turn that back on

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.750 
of going I'm going to turn that back on
and<00:02:53.670> just<00:02:54.150> reduce<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.660> size<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.870> little<00:02:55.230> bit

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
and just reduce the size a little bit

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.320 
and just reduce the size a little bit
this<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.910> one<00:02:57.180> way<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.740> quickly<00:02:58.740> adding<00:02:59.490> random

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
this is one way of quickly adding random

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.860 
this is one way of quickly adding random
points<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.170> your<00:03:01.260> object<00:03:02.090> where<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.210> won't<00:03:03.390> it

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
points to your object where it won't it

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.870 
points to your object where it won't it
won't<00:03:03.900> affect<00:03:04.380> rendering<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.580> help

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
won't affect rendering but it can help

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.550 
won't affect rendering but it can help
with<00:03:06.180> things<00:03:06.420> like<00:03:06.570> hyper<00:03:06.900> voxels<00:03:07.380> to
