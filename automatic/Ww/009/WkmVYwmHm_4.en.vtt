 We enrolled students in the second and third grades. At first they were not confident, but after completing the TDU season, after they went to college, they completely became rookies and were keen on science and engineering and mathematics (STEM) and TDU.

 When I first joined the team, I thought, the robot is cool, but engineering is boring. Why should I become an engineer? Looking back now, this is a very stupid idea. I realize that engineering is the solution. I can solve problems continuously in the future.
