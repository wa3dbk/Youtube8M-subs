00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
something that I'm gonna pursue a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.660 
something that I'm gonna pursue a
sparkly<00:01:25.770> let's<00:01:25.980> see<00:01:26.100> how<00:01:26.160> much<00:01:26.280> further<00:01:26.520> we

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
sparkly let's see how much further we

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.340 
sparkly let's see how much further we
can<00:01:26.850> go<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:27.660> see<00:01:27.690> snowboarders

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
can go like you don't see snowboarders

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.870 
can go like you don't see snowboarders
going<00:01:28.620> like<00:01:28.800> let's<00:01:29.100> build<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.370> bigger<00:01:29.580> kicker

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
going like let's build a bigger kicker

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880 
going like let's build a bigger kicker
and<00:01:30.060> see<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.270> far<00:01:30.300> we<00:01:30.660> can<00:01:30.720> go<00:01:30.870> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
and see how far we can go I think it's a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.500 
and see how far we can go I think it's a
little<00:01:32.130> more<00:01:32.310> evolved<00:01:32.760> into<00:01:33.000> something<00:01:33.150> like

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
little more evolved into something like

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.030 
little more evolved into something like
like<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> big<00:01:34.080> air<00:01:34.230> snowboard<00:01:34.260> kicker<00:01:34.830> word

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
like a big air snowboard kicker word

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.390 
like a big air snowboard kicker word
it'll<00:01:35.730> be<00:01:35.790> more<00:01:35.970> about<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> tricks<00:01:36.510> you<00:01:36.930> know

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
it'll be more about the tricks you know

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.220 
it'll be more about the tricks you know
that<00:01:38.400> guys<00:01:38.580> are<00:01:38.760> doing<00:01:39.000> rather<00:01:39.540> than<00:01:39.690> just<00:01:39.930> see

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
that guys are doing rather than just see

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:48.470 
that guys are doing rather than just see
how<00:01:40.380> many<00:01:40.560> more<00:01:40.740> inches<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:47.270> +<00:01:48.270> return

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
how many more inches for the + return

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.870 
how many more inches for the + return
