00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.779
 hence the good ETTU you today I will show 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.809
 how to paint the white on a white background 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.830
 namely being primarily about light and 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.929
 shadow 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.480
 you will need only a pencil 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.250
 black color that I'm going to use the prism 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.470
 collor number 1 935 with this is the drawing 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.740
 that I'll be painting and already painted 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:31.170
 essential of the technical pedro and face 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.969
 now the pictures quintal dress to 6 and the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.020
 14 that will be white 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.510
 like I said it 's basically us and shadow 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.090
 so you will paint this way in the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.520
 Make sure that the ends of the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.070
 black pencil a gradient toward the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.469
 center or if the tips will be more 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.480
 dark and goes going goes by varying until 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.070
 completely white 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.649
 everything that has shade you will do 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.649
 this black shadow to give volume 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.010
 in the stocking will be the same with 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.880
 highlighted in the shadow behind the knees in 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.400
 folding looks 6 from brazil allow black 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.520
 Whenever I'm well, aim to do well. 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.520
 almost nothing almost white 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.290
 the shoe does not even paint because the 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.770
 his shadow will basically be a 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.770
 contour 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.800
 now just sign below that you 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.360
 learned to paint in white without the pencils 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.140
 white that after all is no good 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.290
 for nothing 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.640
