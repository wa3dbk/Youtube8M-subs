00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.050
 I believe that 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.749
 50 percent 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:10.829
 Herbert Beck 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.829
 one of the best watercolor paintings of his generation 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:17.779
 Even with almost 90 years he is present that the pictures issued by him 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.199
 become 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.400
 a gallery in Dusseldorf work put together from his life's work 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.179
 a selection of 40 years 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.179
 according to watercolors that often do not look that way 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.409
 he says, says Heidel 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.920
 there is the color of the per 1 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.980
 compressed on the map 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.350
 that you are actually more in a single world cup but not an easy one 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.590
 Damper is a watercolor and that's why I think he has this technique 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.450
 developed in such a way that then suddenly he can say 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.450
 for his generation of 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.960
 could be the focus of the exhibition 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.230
 Faces of the World with Herbert Mandl 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.170
 recently 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.300
 they were shown at a big exhibition in Beijing 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.280
 several times in all variations 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.240
 different characters 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.710
 facial expressions 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.670
 from his studio in the Bavarian stands at the Tegernsee near Munich had this 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.740
 Look inspired again and again 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.250
 Despite his advanced age, Herbert Beck still works every day today 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.580
 painted on wet handmade paper his technique is considered perfect 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.550
 the rest is intuition 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.170
 d 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.170
 nevertheless no motive is recognizable 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.600
 but the artist Andreas has an idea of ​​what is happening here 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 could 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.870
 This is one of his faces again 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.980
 that is not true 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.850
 Obama, I want to take a minute. Small is a document 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.939
 9 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.939
 the faces of our time 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.559
 Part noise 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:16.929
 to the finish 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.239
 Cowen 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.239
 you can lie here Klapisch I would like 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:25.899
 it comes as a surprise 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:29.419
 his pictures are large-format and stronger color 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.519
 Motives are flowers and still lifes 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.519
 as well as meditative landscapes from several horizons 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.669
 a few small of strong watch I love 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.789
 for Lohre 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:42.979
 powerful 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.699
 colourfulness 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.999
 that likes 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:49.959
 we are from 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.129
 many years ago I had here in the newly formed and against his 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.679
 powerful chords 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.899
 are still a role model today 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:08.849
 when painting the parts list, paint the brush and white paper strips 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.039
 they are the basis of Beck's miniatures 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.299
 Pictures in small format that happen to be created z 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:21.290
 For example, I discovered something here which is more pleasurable. Hundreds 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:23.789
 such becomes a sign 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:25.669
 I pick myself up 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:31.739
 and then he shows where not these little passepartouts anymore 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.209
 I have prepared for example here 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.789
 a little Selina 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.009
 dramatic 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:47.219
 a dwelling or sona it is already it is a small festival playing it 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:52.739
 makes me very happy and I also think that I am now 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:53.609
 serious 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:54.529
 have 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.719
 I go a little further and already goes a completely different picture 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:02.719
 For example, you can see that benefits I have benefited from here 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.679
 wonderful Popov 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.639
 DAB bank 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.539
 the six brightness in the center that's almost a small «abstract image» 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.719
 however prevail in Dusseldorf a great success 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.900
 already on the first day several pictures were sold 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:28.759
 The lucky collectors have every reason to bang their heads proudly 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.080
 after all, you will not get one every day
