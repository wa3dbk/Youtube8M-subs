00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:10.539
 Welcome 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:11.610
 Principality of Gallia 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.049
 At the boy's law school 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.049
 You showed me how to live on the battlefield 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.289
 This game is 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.099
 Active simulation rpg 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.480
 Put simply 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.730
 It is a strategy to fight on the map 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.720
 Operate the police in real time 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.689
 Win the battle 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:32.700
 The battle is 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.550
 Phrases in your facebook 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.550
 I died by repeating Kobe 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.540
 It's about time 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.280
 Enter from the mode description 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.640
 This game consists of two modes 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.810
 One is command mode 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.340
 Here is the strategy 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.340
 Give orders to units 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.510
 What is a conventional simulation game 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.230
 Different 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.560
 Enemy placement etc 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.000
 Not all information has been exposed from the beginning 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.950
 Fast-changing elections 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.950
 Correspondence of the parliamentary change is required 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.150
 Another action mode 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.290
 Here, in the unit 3d space where the instruction was given, 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.620
 Move 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.420
 Not only give orders 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.799
 It is a brain training hated to carry out the operation which put a bullet 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.260
 Pulled 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.410
 Command mode 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.590
 Advance the battle while repeating the action mode alternately 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.350
 Are 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.350
 Let's explain each center 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.180
 At first from explanation of command mode 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.520
 Is it displayed in the upper left in command mode 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.590
 It was commonly called command prompt 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.950
 It sounds like a medal at the top of the screen that is blinking now 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.039
 cp1 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.039
 It will be extended each time you move the unit 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.610
 Moveable unit 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.709
 Various types 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.609
 At first it is called a soldier 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.609
 There is no movement ability 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.619
 Assault charge high charge 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.749
 High accuracy 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.309
 To support recovery of allied units 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.389
 He 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.789
 In this way soldier units are rich in variety 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.020
 According to the situation 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.269
 Use properly 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.399
 Next is the tank unit 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.399
 Mobile ability attack ability is high 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.229
 High defense 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.979
 Masanobu that the group does not communicate at all 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.979
 Two wins the horseman 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.319
 Finally 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.229
 Anti-tank unit 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.009
 Such as Tokushima part 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.009
 Can only compete with 1000 companies 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.599
 These units 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.599
 I do not assume the number of cps again and again 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.289
 Soldier unit 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:21.599
 Tank unit 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.849
 water resistant 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.959
 Each has a relationship of 3 freezing 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.389
 I went to a soldier 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.539
 Strong against anti-tank unit 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.099
 There is a system maintenance example 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.219
 Strong against tank units 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:33.569
 All players 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.709
 Strong against soldier units 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.029
 Beyond this relationship 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.029
 Advance the battle in favor 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.129
 In action mode 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.129
 Explain the basic operation of the unit 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.759
 I chose a soldier in command mode 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.009
 Transition to action mode when unit is selected 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.199
 it can 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.369
 The action in action mode is called action point ap 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:04.829
 Controlled 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.149
 It is a detective at the bottom of the screen 

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:09.989
 It varies according to Nakazawa unit of Motoichi 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.989
 The unit can move until the geisha dies 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:17.309
 Feed is done with an analog pad 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.029
 Moving in action mode All happening in real time 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.609
 Be 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.659
 It will be caked on the move if it is found in the partnership 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.979
 Be careful as there are enemies in the direction of the design 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.259
 When approaching the enemy 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.819
 You can aim when you press the button nearby 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.930
 Because the enemy does not come to the Demon Lord when aiming 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.449
 Aim slowly 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.770
 Once you set your aim, it's shooting with a circle button 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.770
 If hit, you can damage the enemy 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:52.939
 Then here 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.939
 Let's explain the battle in action mode 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:04:59.450
 First of all 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.379
 It is important that you aim carefully 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.619
 The aim of the enemy's field is to do great damage 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.919
 It is also important to dodge enemy guns 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.749
 Which one hides behind 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:14.749
 I do not receive business cards that had been in the rain 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.650
 Make tanks precede and hide behind them 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:22.309
 The tank will not endure and will not be damaged 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.819
 If you retaliate in the battlefield, you won't see the target here. 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.819
 Become 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.990
 Let's introduce strategic tips in action mode 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.319
 The fact of the past is 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.960
 Strong players also have weaknesses 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.279
 The back engine is a weak point 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:51.879
 No one attacks here 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.360
 Can do great damage 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360
 Besides 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.539
 Choosing where to attack is also important 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.659
 For example, if you climb up to the top using a ladder, you will be behind the enemy 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.659
 be able to 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.360
 Using the back of the building 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.639
 You can also Kishu from an enemy's inconvenient place 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.349
 Part of ladders and back roads 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.349
 Find out myself 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.909
 When I attacked next to a friend, I fired for support 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.639
 I understood the position of my opponent and my position well 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.930
 It may be good to attack the same 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.909
 Shindai feature 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.089
 I can not do anything in action mode 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:40.009
 Stop the action by pressing the start button and return to the command mode 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.009
 I was working on a strategy 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.680
 Let's explain the end of production 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.680
 Regions can move units to participation 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:59.249
 Can you move on the same schedule 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:02.249
 There is not much ap 

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:04.830
 When cp is gone 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.830
 So use manufacturing repair 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:11.259
 End the phrase and it will be an enemy case 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:13.279
 Considering the attack from the enemy 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:16.279
 Don't forget to keep the unit moving 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:18.830
 Another one. 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.220
 It changed from this work 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.129
 Explain collar and behavior 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:26.099
 If you occupy the base of the prefecture at the end of the area 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:29.099
 We can use base of next area 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:33.509
 It is said that it will stand backward at your own base 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:36.159
 Unit can be lowered backwards 

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:38.059
 Dislike the base in the next area 

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:40.080
 Do you choose a rear standby unit 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.080
 It can be made known to the next area 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.919
 While being careful not to be based in the enemy 

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:51.939
 Overwhelm the base one after another 

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:54.939
 Aim for the enemy base 

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.449
 The training ends above 

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:04.449
 You also became big cadets 

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:06.710
 The final goal is 

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.520
 Select an enemy position 

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.559
 From here onward was the battlefield 

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:13.079
 Pray for disposal
