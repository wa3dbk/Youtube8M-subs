00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
every anytime I see I could see a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.510 
every anytime I see I could see a
trailer<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.500> any<00:01:52.710> horror<00:01:52.950> movie<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> go

trailer for any horror movie and I go
but<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.090> looks<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.479> could<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.630> really

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
but I looks like it could be really

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.139 
but I looks like it could be really
scary<00:01:55.409> or<00:01:55.680> really<00:01:56.100> bad<00:01:56.280> yeah<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.000> just

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
scary or really bad yeah and I just

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.060 
scary or really bad yeah and I just
feels<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.960> about<00:01:58.140> yeah<00:01:58.500> definitely

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
feels like that about yeah definitely

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.499 
feels like that about yeah definitely
pretty<00:01:59.310> much<00:01:59.430> everything<00:01:59.759> but<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.180> will<00:02:00.360> say

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
pretty much everything but I will say

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.429 
pretty much everything but I will say
that<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.719> doesn't<00:02:01.020> look<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.290> would<00:02:01.380> be

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
that it doesn't look like it would be

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.050 
that it doesn't look like it would be
bad<00:02:01.710> from<00:02:02.159> uh<00:02:02.219> like<00:02:02.640> putting<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:02.969> together

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
bad from uh like putting it together

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.370 
bad from uh like putting it together
standpoint<00:02:03.509> would<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.049> story

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
standpoint would just be the story

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.679 
standpoint would just be the story
probably<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.030> last<00:02:06.210> trail<00:02:06.450> we're<00:02:06.600> gonna

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
probably but the last trail we're gonna

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.520 
probably but the last trail we're gonna
talk<00:02:06.930> about<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.500> oculus<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:09.140> I've<00:02:10.140> been
