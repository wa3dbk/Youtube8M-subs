00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300
 there are very good we are all here in 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.790
 another video where I'm going to teach you 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.170
 Today I fear that this mechanism is not very 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.560
 I will explain to you little by little what it is 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.590
 now 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.770
 to start a little history 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.340
 good story 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:25.650
 of how it occurred to me and why and 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.140
 why I'm going to teach him vale 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.379
 surely some of you if 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.980
 you have a world of very advanced normal 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:40.090
 so having passed this you have a 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.210
 chest full of enchanted books and 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.940
 later you will have to be looking for or 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.199
 some say what I'm going to organize and you put 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.769
 chests but there are times that you go with this 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.150
 empty good there is but 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.240
 it is empty 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.040
 and the truth is that it is a bit annoying 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.820
 good 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.100
 so 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.840
 What I have decided is to do this 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.080
 simple system 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.110
 and easy 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.240
 how it works if you leave something goes on 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.430
 the light if you remove it goes off how it's done 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.890
 easy 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.060
 the coffer site would be the chest with what 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.290
 there are two blocks whatever behind 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.800
 it does not have to be a cheat trap 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.600
 a normal comfort would work just as 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.510
 all right 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.630
 and now block 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:48.620
 put the comparator comparator where 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.620
 be of the torch block chest 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.990
 block torch 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.680
 after block 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.680
 block above 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.030
 torch here 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.670
 Y 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.050
 here 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.980
 no os 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.659
 since the lights would go 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.670
 at the end it's how it happens to me 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.080
 doing tests because before 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.780
 principle was going to be different 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.110
 I decided to do it so ladies 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.560
 nice for my taste and we would have it 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.650
 done now we check that it works 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.630
 it is understood 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.540
 she pays 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.460
 and good good and it's all I hope that you 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.810
 will have liked and surely many already 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.630
 they are going to do this nonsense 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:51.400
 and if you did not know well then I hope that you 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.910
 serve from now on as it is 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.840
 quite economical 3 of reston two 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.840
 torches 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.510
 and a comparator 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.010
 good that according to what you want to do 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.760
 if you want to make a row of 64 then you 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.280
 it's going to cost a little more expensive 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.940
 and good here I leave it 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.940
 goodbye
