00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
use a point bond polyester you can

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.680 
use a point bond polyester you can
actually<00:01:25.460> feel<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.790> fabric<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.330> actually

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690

looks almost like a cloth material
compared<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.050> other<00:01:30.170> two<00:01:30.409> cartridges<00:01:30.770> the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
compared to the other two cartridges the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.310 
compared to the other two cartridges the
unit<00:01:31.910> cell<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.420> Philbert<00:01:32.840> use<00:01:33.080> the

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
unit cell and the Philbert use the

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.859 
unit cell and the Philbert use the

feel more like a cloth material so the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.420 
feel more like a cloth material so the
Plinko<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.259> excel<00:01:42.650> cartridge<00:01:43.070> have<00:01:43.250> a

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
lot more fibers in their media versus

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.389 
lot more fibers in their media versus

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
the unit cell and the Philbert which are

00:01:49.399 --> 00:02:00.480 
the unit cell and the Philbert which are
using<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.759> reamain<00:01:50.119> material

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
and applique co uses a super bond band

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.130 
and applique co uses a super bond band
here<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.060> it's<00:02:05.210> almost<00:02:05.330> like<00:02:05.540> super<00:02:05.840> glued<00:02:05.990> on

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.390 
here and it's almost like super glued on
here<00:02:06.470> they<00:02:06.619> have<00:02:06.740> four<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.040> them<00:02:07.100> on<00:02:07.250> their

here they have four of them on their

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.279 
here they have four of them on their
cartridges<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:08.690> what<00:02:08.810> these<00:02:08.990> do<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.170> they

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
cartridges and what these do is they

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.350 
cartridges and what these do is they
keep<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.709> cartridge<00:02:10.130> pleats<00:02:10.880> from<00:02:11.060> opening

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
keep the cartridge pleats from opening

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.510 
keep the cartridge pleats from opening
up<00:02:11.540> here<00:02:11.780> which<00:02:11.990> will<00:02:12.230> help<00:02:12.380> with<00:02:13.220> the

filbert bands are on there pretty good

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.479 
filbert bands are on there pretty good
also<00:02:41.239> not<00:02:41.750> quite<00:02:41.900> as<00:02:42.080> good<00:02:42.230> as<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.500> unit<00:02:42.890> cell<00:02:43.130> or

also not quite as good as a unit cell or
the<00:02:44.209> pleat<00:02:44.510> coat<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:45.200> they're<00:02:45.350> on<00:02:45.440> there<00:02:45.620> good

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.980 

okay<00:02:56.550> all<00:02:56.730> four<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.030> these<00:02:57.180> cartridges<00:02:57.630> use

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
okay all four of these cartridges use

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.540 
okay all four of these cartridges use
antimicrobial<00:02:58.470> end<00:02:59.280> caps<00:03:00.210> on<00:03:00.480> their<00:03:00.630> filters

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
antimicrobial end caps on their filters

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.770 
antimicrobial end caps on their filters
and<00:03:02.550> one<00:03:02.730> difference<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.360> Excel

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
and one difference is that the Excel

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.600 
and one difference is that the Excel
cartridge<00:03:04.140> actually<00:03:04.470> uses<00:03:04.740> antimicrobial<00:03:05.520> on

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
cartridge actually uses antimicrobial on

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.460 
cartridge actually uses antimicrobial on
top<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.120> also<00:03:06.240> in<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.600> core<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:06.870> their<00:03:07.110> filter

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
top and also in the core of their filter

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.590 
top and also in the core of their filter
cartridges<00:03:07.980> okay<00:03:08.850> if<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.060> look<00:03:09.180> at<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.360> cores

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
cartridges okay if you look at the cores

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.150 
cartridges okay if you look at the cores
of<00:03:09.720> these<00:03:09.870> cartridges<00:03:10.230> here<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.800> film<00:03:11.040> burr

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
of these cartridges here the film burr

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.449 
of these cartridges here the film burr
and<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.370> unicel<00:03:11.820> they<00:03:12.000> use<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.500> punch<00:03:13.500> PVC<00:03:14.190> you

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
and the unicel they use a punch PVC you

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:23.320 
and the unicel they use a punch PVC you
can<00:03:14.610> see<00:03:14.730> all<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.970> holes<00:03:15.150> punched<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.750> there

in the excel and the Clicquot use an
open<00:03:26.380> flow<00:03:27.380> core<00:03:27.740> so<00:03:28.100> there<00:03:28.250> are<00:03:28.310> more<00:03:28.490> squares

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
open flow core so there are more squares
