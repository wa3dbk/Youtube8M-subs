pre-order you can pre-order it now so
it's<00:00:50.789> not<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.899> amazon<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.469> been

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
it's not like what amazon have been

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.650 
it's not like what amazon have been
doing<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:53.010> previous<00:00:53.579> leaks<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> GTA<00:00:54.420> 5

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660

doing with previous leaks like the GTA 5
pc<00:00:55.199> where<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.250> says<00:00:56.460> available<00:00:56.910> soon<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
pc where it says available soon and you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.330 
pc where it says available soon and you
can't<00:00:58.109> actually<00:00:58.230> physically<00:00:58.680> pre-order<00:00:59.129> yes

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you can actually pre-order the game so

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.939 
you can actually pre-order the game so
it's<00:01:01.829> pretty<00:01:02.550> much<00:01:02.670> sounding<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.359> already

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
it's pretty much sounding like already

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
I did a quick bit of research on google

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.310 
I did a quick bit of research on google
and<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.280> box<00:01:29.880> art<00:01:30.119> shown<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.720> living<00:01:31.079> has

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and the box art shown on this living has

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560 
and the box art shown on this living has
never<00:01:31.619> been<00:01:31.860> uploaded<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> Internet<00:01:33.329> in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
never been uploaded to the Internet in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.410 
never been uploaded to the Internet in
any<00:01:33.930> shape<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.590> form<00:01:34.799> anywhere<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.640> cannot<00:01:36.150> find

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
any shape or form anywhere I cannot find

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.859 
any shape or form anywhere I cannot find
it<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:37.280> there's<00:01:38.280> literally<00:01:38.549> nothing<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.840> it

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it I there's literally nothing about it

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.020 
it I there's literally nothing about it
apart<00:01:40.350> from<00:01:40.470> one<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.920> listing<00:01:41.369> three<00:01:41.820> days

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
apart from one this listing three days

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.899 
apart from one this listing three days
ago<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:43.290> looks<00:01:43.470> very<00:01:43.560> very<00:01:43.799> probable<00:01:44.490> they

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
ago so it looks very very probable they

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.830 
ago so it looks very very probable they
didn't<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.210> take<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.630> off<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> internet

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
didn't just take it off the internet

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.190 
didn't just take it off the internet
like<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.829> fake<00:01:47.040> listings<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.020> more<00:01:49.020> than

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
like all the fake listings and more than

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.830 
like all the fake listings and more than
microsoft<00:01:49.920> sent<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.520> them<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.240> when<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.720> was
