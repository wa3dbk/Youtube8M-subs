00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
are just the brainstorming ones to start

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.630 
are just the brainstorming ones to start
with<00:00:33.940> the<00:00:34.600> first<00:00:34.810> one<00:00:34.960> here<00:00:35.230> you<00:00:35.290> can<00:00:35.440> see<00:00:35.640> this

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
with the first one here you can see this

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.540 
with the first one here you can see this
was<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:37.000> first<00:00:37.540> of<00:00:37.899> the<00:00:38.309> brainstorming<00:00:39.309> phase

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
was the first of the brainstorming phase

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.000 
was the first of the brainstorming phase
here<00:00:39.820> I<00:00:40.630> tried<00:00:41.380> with<00:00:41.920> wheels<00:00:42.460> a<00:00:43.390> little

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
here I tried with wheels a little

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.220 
here I tried with wheels a little
motorcycle<00:00:45.010> e<00:00:45.430> 4<00:00:46.000> gameplay<00:00:46.149> purposes<00:00:46.840> we<00:00:47.020> want

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
motorcycle e 4 gameplay purposes we want

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.150 
motorcycle e 4 gameplay purposes we want
the<00:00:47.760> cannon<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:48.820> be<00:00:48.940> able<00:00:49.090> to<00:00:49.650> move<00:00:50.650> and<00:00:51.010> then

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
the cannon to be able to move and then

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.460 
the cannon to be able to move and then
stop<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:51.790> fire<00:00:52.150> I<00:00:52.450> felt<00:00:52.810> that<00:00:52.930> when<00:00:53.170> this<00:00:53.260> one

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
stop and fire I felt that when this one

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.870 
stop and fire I felt that when this one
would<00:00:53.680> like<00:00:53.890> stop<00:00:54.160> it<00:00:54.430> looks<00:00:54.580> like<00:00:54.700> it<00:00:54.790> would

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
would like stop it looks like it would

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.810 
would like stop it looks like it would
just<00:00:55.330> fall<00:00:55.840> over<00:00:55.870> so<00:00:56.410> I<00:00:56.890> mean<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.400> had<00:00:57.610> like

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
just fall over so I mean I had like

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.300 
just fall over so I mean I had like
worked<00:00:58.210> in<00:00:58.330> some<00:00:59.040> stabilizers<00:01:00.040> that<00:01:00.220> would

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
worked in some stabilizers that would

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.400 
worked in some stabilizers that would
pop<00:01:00.490> down<00:01:00.730> but<00:01:01.060> even<00:01:01.300> so<00:01:01.480> it's<00:01:01.750> dissident

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
pop down but even so it's dissident

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.619 
pop down but even so it's dissident
because<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.430> think<00:01:03.790> if<00:01:03.850> we<00:01:03.940> had<00:01:03.970> a<00:01:04.089> kickstand

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
because I think if we had a kickstand

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.120 
because I think if we had a kickstand
they<00:01:04.839> could<00:01:04.989> just<00:01:05.229> feel<00:01:05.500> like<00:01:05.890> really

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
they could just feel like really

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.219 
they could just feel like really
rinky-dink<00:01:06.700> yeah<00:01:06.970> it<00:01:07.570> looks<00:01:07.720> like<00:01:07.780> it's<00:01:08.049> meant

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
rinky-dink yeah it looks like it's meant

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.020 
rinky-dink yeah it looks like it's meant
to<00:01:08.320> go<00:01:08.439> really<00:01:08.619> fast<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.369> like<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:09.729> said<00:01:09.909> it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
to go really fast and like you said it

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.600 
to go really fast and like you said it
was<00:01:10.119> unstable<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.710> last<00:01:11.890> thing<00:01:12.100> we<00:01:12.369> want

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
was unstable and the last thing we want

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.399 
was unstable and the last thing we want
is<00:01:12.729> like<00:01:12.909> really<00:01:13.119> fast<00:01:13.450> mobile<00:01:13.990> siege

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
is like really fast mobile siege

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.469 
is like really fast mobile siege
candidates<00:01:14.829> because<00:01:15.369> then<00:01:15.579> it's<00:01:15.939> just<00:01:16.149> it'll

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
candidates because then it's just it'll

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.240 
candidates because then it's just it'll
be<00:01:16.570> totally<00:01:16.689> ridiculous<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.470> happen<00:01:17.740> flying

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
be totally ridiculous to happen flying

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.590 
be totally ridiculous to happen flying
on<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.520> macro<00:01:18.700> fast<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.300> blowing<00:01:19.479> up

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
on the macro fast and blowing up

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.310 
on the macro fast and blowing up
everything<00:01:19.930> so<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:22.030> I<00:01:22.060> do<00:01:22.180> like<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.510> elegance

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
everything so but I do like the elegance

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.170 
everything so but I do like the elegance
of<00:01:23.440> it<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.680> simplicity<00:01:24.070> of<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.460> ok<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.030> number

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
of it the simplicity of it ok so number

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.960 
of it the simplicity of it ok so number
two<00:01:25.330> was<00:01:25.990> obviously<00:01:26.590> one<00:01:27.310> big<00:01:27.580> thing<00:01:27.610> was

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
two was obviously one big thing was

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.000 
two was obviously one big thing was
moving<00:01:28.090> from<00:01:28.390> wheels<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.930> treads<00:01:29.170> because<00:01:29.979> I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
moving from wheels to treads because I

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.590 
moving from wheels to treads because I
wanted<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.370> explore<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.760> bunch<00:01:30.909> options<00:01:31.330> it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
wanted to explore a bunch options it

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.680 
wanted to explore a bunch options it
would<00:01:32.440> have<00:01:32.950> panels<00:01:33.640> that<00:01:33.820> open<00:01:34.090> up<00:01:34.210> things

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
would have panels that open up things

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.760 
would have panels that open up things
that<00:01:34.870> move<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.140> make<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.350> animation

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
that move just to make that animation

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.740 
that move just to make that animation
exciting<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:39.490> interesting<00:01:39.729> like<00:01:40.150> when<00:01:40.360> you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
exciting and interesting like when you

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.630 
exciting and interesting like when you
know<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:41.170> players<00:01:41.409> standing<00:01:41.950> there

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
know the players standing there

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.440

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
so some of the things people didn't

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.600 
so some of the things people didn't
respond<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.350> well<00:01:50.590> on<00:01:50.620> this<00:01:50.800> one<00:01:51.010> was<00:01:51.220> this

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
respond so well on this one was this

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.120 
respond so well on this one was this
front<00:01:51.850> part<00:01:52.060> opens<00:01:52.600> up<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.080> pop<00:01:53.320> sound<00:01:53.619> is

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
front part opens up and pop sound is

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.859 
front part opens up and pop sound is
like<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.400> stabilizer<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.360> help<00:01:55.510> it<00:01:55.630> when<00:01:55.750> it

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
like a stabilizer to help it when it

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.920 
like a stabilizer to help it when it
fires<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.530> recoil<00:01:56.979> but<00:01:57.909> i<00:01:58.180> think<00:01:58.660> it's<00:01:58.750> three

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
fires and recoil but i think it's three

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.210 
fires and recoil but i think it's three
people<00:01:59.110> thought<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.259> was<00:01:59.380> pretty<00:01:59.530> dorky<00:01:59.800> to<00:02:00.100> do

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
people thought it was pretty dorky to do

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.359 
people thought it was pretty dorky to do
so<00:02:00.520> yeah<00:02:00.910> but<00:02:01.270> what<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:01.780> do<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:02.950> do<00:02:03.070> like

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.719 
know just the overall shape and it just
looks<00:02:07.960> like<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.170> packs<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.739> punch<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:09.130> guess<00:02:09.340> one

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
looks like it packs a punch I guess one

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.720 
looks like it packs a punch I guess one
advantage<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.420> this<00:02:10.600> design<00:02:11.400> from<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
advantage of this design from the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.479 
advantage of this design from the
programming<00:02:13.510> side<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.280> can

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
programming side that is that it can

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.760 
programming side that is that it can
actually<00:02:15.820> would<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.330> able<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:16.780> spin<00:02:17.620> in

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
actually would be able to like spin in

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.110 
actually would be able to like spin in
place<00:02:17.800> so<00:02:18.190> like<00:02:18.340> when<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.580> turns<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:19.030> would

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
place so like when it turns it would

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.090 
place so like when it turns it would
just<00:02:19.239> rotate<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:20.140> at<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.380> one<00:02:20.530> it's<00:02:20.709> kind<00:02:21.010> of

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
just rotate so at this one it's kind of

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.000 
just rotate so at this one it's kind of
I<00:02:21.310> was<00:02:21.750> thinking<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.840> even<00:02:23.080> like<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
I was thinking of even like the the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.729 
I was thinking of even like the the
sculpt<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.519> little<00:02:24.760> bit<00:02:25.019> with<00:02:26.019> profile<00:02:26.500> looks

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
sculpt a little bit with profile looks

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.940 
sculpt a little bit with profile looks
yeah<00:02:27.300> Edison<00:02:28.300> wanted<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.690> be<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.530> know<00:02:29.650> just

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
yeah Edison wanted to be you know just

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.920 
yeah Edison wanted to be you know just
treads<00:02:30.250> with<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.489> gun<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:30.730> top<00:02:31.090> actually<00:02:31.750> have

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
treads with a gun on top actually have

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.550 
treads with a gun on top actually have
some<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.230> these<00:02:32.290> automated<00:02:33.360> gun<00:02:34.360> robot<00:02:34.959> things

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
some of these automated gun robot things

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.370 
some of these automated gun robot things
yeah<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.670> think<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.120> best<00:02:37.300> some<00:02:37.450> even<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:38.080> Iraq

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
yeah I think the best some even in Iraq

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.890 
yeah I think the best some even in Iraq
they<00:02:38.680> were<00:02:38.769> trying<00:02:38.980> out<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.600> they're<00:02:40.600> all

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
they were trying out and they're all

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.810 
they were trying out and they're all
pretty<00:02:41.140> much<00:02:41.380> just<00:02:41.560> like<00:02:41.739> it's<00:02:42.100> like<00:02:42.250> treads

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
pretty much just like it's like treads

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.580 
pretty much just like it's like treads
and<00:02:43.120> then<00:02:43.239> they<00:02:43.390> take<00:02:43.570> like<00:02:43.810> an<00:02:43.989> actual<00:02:44.140> gun

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
and then they take like an actual gun

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.830 
and then they take like an actual gun
and<00:02:44.890> displace<00:02:45.250> jammed<00:02:46.209> like<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.360> soldier's

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
and displace jammed like a soldier's

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.979 
and displace jammed like a soldier's
cognac<00:02:47.440> welcome<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.970> mean<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.780> know<00:02:49.840> they

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
cognac welcome so I mean you know they

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.270 
cognac welcome so I mean you know they
have<00:02:50.260> some<00:02:50.380> interesting<00:02:50.799> things<00:02:50.920> going<00:02:51.040> on

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
have some interesting things going on

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.920 
have some interesting things going on
male<00:02:51.519> looked<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.790> lot<00:02:51.940> of<00:02:52.060> those<00:02:52.180> reference<00:02:52.630> but

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
male looked a lot of those reference but

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.530 
male looked a lot of those reference but
in<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.650> end<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:54.010> just<00:02:54.040> doesn't<00:02:54.700> have<00:02:55.150> kind<00:02:55.480> of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
in the end it just doesn't have kind of

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.870 
in the end it just doesn't have kind of
the<00:02:55.690> visual<00:02:56.290> pizzette<00:02:57.040> right<00:02:57.340> yeah<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.610> what<00:02:57.850> I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
the visual pizzette right yeah so what I

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.180 
the visual pizzette right yeah so what I
get<00:02:58.720> from<00:02:58.840> this<00:02:59.019> is<00:02:59.320> that<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.950> fifth

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
get from this is that is the fifth

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.190 
get from this is that is the fifth
pillar<00:03:00.370> that's<00:03:00.760> what<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.299> get<00:03:01.480> one<00:03:01.930> thing<00:03:02.079> that

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
pillar that's what I get one thing that

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.319 
pillar that's what I get one thing that
we<00:03:02.290> all<00:03:02.410> love<00:03:02.680> tho<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.340> really<00:03:03.640> small<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.150> this

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
we all love tho is really small is this

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.600 
we all love tho is really small is this
little<00:03:04.600> suck<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:05.049> on<00:03:05.260> your<00:03:05.560> which<00:03:06.250> she<00:03:06.400> looks

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
little suck it on your which she looks

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.970 
little suck it on your which she looks
at<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:06.910> build<00:03:07.239> detail<00:03:07.600> but<00:03:07.900> like<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.680> idea

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
at just build detail but like the idea

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.610 
at just build detail but like the idea
that<00:03:09.239> TSA<00:03:10.239> would<00:03:10.480> like<00:03:10.630> personalize<00:03:11.230> their

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
that TSA would like personalize their

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.740 
that TSA would like personalize their
siege<00:03:12.190> cannons<00:03:12.640> was<00:03:12.850> really<00:03:13.239> appealing<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.720> us

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
siege cannons was really appealing to us

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.289 
siege cannons was really appealing to us
this<00:03:14.560> was<00:03:14.739> again<00:03:14.950> another<00:03:15.130> version<00:03:15.370> with<00:03:16.060> four

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
this was again another version with four

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.920 
this was again another version with four
treads<00:03:16.630> now<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:18.480> one<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.600> things<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.780> liked

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
treads now and one of the things I liked

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.670 
treads now and one of the things I liked
about<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.230> design<00:03:20.739> was<00:03:21.570> Lyman<00:03:22.570> yeah<00:03:23.470> both

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
about this design was Lyman yeah both

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.199 
about this design was Lyman yeah both
the<00:03:23.799> deployment<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.370> also<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.640> like<00:03:25.030> these

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
the deployment and also I like these

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.940 
the deployment and also I like these
front<00:03:25.570> raise<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.870> lot<00:03:26.340> because<00:03:27.340> there

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
front raise a lot because there

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.160 
front raise a lot because there
it<00:03:28.099> would<00:03:28.220> be<00:03:28.280> very<00:03:28.430> maneuverable<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.330> the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
it would be very maneuverable so the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.710 
it would be very maneuverable so the
same<00:03:30.819> we're<00:03:31.819> thinking<00:03:32.120> oh<00:03:32.209> maybe<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.540> needs<00:03:32.660> to

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
same we're thinking oh maybe it needs to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.530 
same we're thinking oh maybe it needs to
go<00:03:32.840> upstairs<00:03:33.260> in<00:03:33.860> one<00:03:34.610> of<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.849> you<00:03:35.209> know<00:03:35.330> the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
go upstairs in one of the you know the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.020 
go upstairs in one of the you know the
rooms<00:03:35.750> or<00:03:35.989> something<00:03:36.290> so<00:03:36.530> those<00:03:37.190> treads<00:03:37.580> would

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
rooms or something so those treads would

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.600 
rooms or something so those treads would
be<00:03:38.180> able<00:03:38.330> to<00:03:38.390> move<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.930> allow<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:40.519> know

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
be able to move and allow it to you know

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.970 
be able to move and allow it to you know
troopers<00:03:41.120> furious<00:03:41.599> you<00:03:42.170> know<00:03:42.290> elevations

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
troopers furious you know elevations

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.009 
troopers furious you know elevations
like<00:03:43.190> that<00:03:43.400> strange<00:03:44.030> designing<00:03:44.510> a<00:03:44.569> tank<00:03:44.810> for

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
like that strange designing a tank for

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.990 
like that strange designing a tank for
the<00:03:45.080> indoors<00:03:45.440> yeah<00:03:46.190> just<00:03:46.489> basically<00:03:46.819> what

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
the indoors yeah just basically what

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.089 
the indoors yeah just basically what
this<00:03:47.150> is<00:03:47.209> exactly<00:03:47.959> actually<00:03:48.800> one<00:03:48.920> thing<00:03:49.040> I

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
this is exactly actually one thing I

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.800 
this is exactly actually one thing I
really<00:03:49.190> like<00:03:49.430> about<00:03:49.459> this<00:03:49.700> one<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:50.300> may<00:03:50.750> not

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
really like about this one is I may not

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.180 
really like about this one is I may not
know<00:03:50.870> if<00:03:51.019> it's<00:03:51.140> good<00:03:51.290> or<00:03:51.319> bad<00:03:51.410> but<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.920> looks<00:03:52.099> a

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
know if it's good or bad but it looks a

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.070 
know if it's good or bad but it looks a
little<00:03:52.340> bit<00:03:52.550> less<00:03:52.730> like<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:52.970> gun<00:03:53.300> and<00:03:53.569> a<00:03:53.840> little

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
little bit less like a gun and a little

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.690 
little bit less like a gun and a little
bit<00:03:54.170> more<00:03:54.319> on<00:03:54.380> some<00:03:54.560> kind<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.830> like<00:03:55.099> electronic

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
bit more on some kind of like electronic

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.970 
bit more on some kind of like electronic
device<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:56.780> think<00:03:57.019> this<00:03:57.140> started<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.769> path

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
device and I think this started the path

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.240 
device and I think this started the path
to<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.280> final<00:03:58.840> concept<00:03:59.840> right<00:04:00.140> which<00:04:00.799> is<00:04:00.830> it

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
to the final concept right which is it

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.400 
to the final concept right which is it
it's<00:04:01.670> really<00:04:01.940> not<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.209> ballistic<00:04:02.780> weapon<00:04:03.140> it's

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
it's really not a ballistic weapon it's

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.990 
it's really not a ballistic weapon it's
not<00:04:03.560> shooting<00:04:03.920> bullets<00:04:04.099> it's<00:04:04.400> not<00:04:04.549> shooting

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
not shooting bullets it's not shooting

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.350 
not shooting bullets it's not shooting
like<00:04:05.840> any<00:04:06.500> kind<00:04:06.709> of<00:04:06.739> any<00:04:07.489> projectiles<00:04:08.030> at<00:04:08.239> all

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
like any kind of any projectiles at all

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.009 
like any kind of any projectiles at all
it's<00:04:08.840> an<00:04:08.959> electronic<00:04:09.349> weapon<00:04:09.829> or<00:04:10.040> it's<00:04:10.190> like<00:04:10.400> a

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
it's an electronic weapon or it's like a

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.319 
it's an electronic weapon or it's like a
magnetic<00:04:12.019> or<00:04:12.519> nuclear<00:04:13.519> energy<00:04:13.970> based

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
magnetic or nuclear energy based

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.640 
magnetic or nuclear energy based
something<00:04:14.720> that's<00:04:14.900> like<00:04:14.989> different<00:04:15.500> than<00:04:15.620> a

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
something that's like different than a

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.770 
something that's like different than a
regular<00:04:15.739> gun<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:16.850> taking<00:04:17.419> all<00:04:17.479> that<00:04:17.570> feedback

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
regular gun so taking all that feedback

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.800 
regular gun so taking all that feedback
when<00:04:18.709> did<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.190> final<00:04:19.519> pass<00:04:19.639> on<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:20.090> try<00:04:20.750> to

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
when did the final pass on it try to

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.270 
when did the final pass on it try to
incorporate<00:04:21.049> as<00:04:21.440> much<00:04:21.590> of<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.859> elements<00:04:22.250> that

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
incorporate as much of the elements that

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.409 
incorporate as much of the elements that
I<00:04:22.430> like<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:23.120> know<00:04:23.150> people<00:04:23.389> liked<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:25.300> came<00:04:26.300> up

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
I like to know people liked and came up

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.950 
I like to know people liked and came up
with<00:04:26.450> this<00:04:26.720> final<00:04:27.139> design<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:27.950> think<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.870> one<00:04:29.870> of

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
with this final design I think it one of

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.230 
with this final design I think it one of
the<00:04:30.080> problems<00:04:30.680> ahead<00:04:30.979> with<00:04:31.370> a<00:04:31.639> lot<00:04:32.090> of<00:04:32.120> the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
the problems ahead with a lot of the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.270 
the problems ahead with a lot of the
other<00:04:32.360> designs<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.200> in<00:04:33.560> general<00:04:33.770> trying<00:04:34.160> to

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
other designs and in general trying to

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.890 
other designs and in general trying to
work<00:04:34.460> through<00:04:34.729> the<00:04:34.850> gameplay<00:04:35.270> aspect<00:04:35.690> was

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
work through the gameplay aspect was

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.740 
work through the gameplay aspect was
again<00:04:36.289> that<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:37.130> aspect<00:04:37.850> where<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.419> should

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
again that that aspect where it should

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.620 
again that that aspect where it should
stop<00:04:39.139> and<00:04:39.440> fire<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.250> not<00:04:40.490> be<00:04:40.669> able<00:04:40.729> to<00:04:40.850> fire

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
stop and fire and not be able to fire

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.170 
stop and fire and not be able to fire
while<00:04:41.930> moving<00:04:42.169> so<00:04:43.160> some<00:04:43.880> of<00:04:43.910> these<00:04:44.030> other

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
while moving so some of these other

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.360 
while moving so some of these other
designs<00:04:44.539> the<00:04:44.840> gun<00:04:45.050> was<00:04:45.350> kind<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:45.680> big<00:04:46.160> an

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
designs the gun was kind of big an

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.240 
designs the gun was kind of big an
armored<00:04:46.700> up<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:48.380> didn't<00:04:48.680> really<00:04:48.860> have<00:04:49.220> a

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
armored up and it didn't really have a

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.450 
armored up and it didn't really have a
reason<00:04:49.550> why<00:04:49.940> it<00:04:50.600> would<00:04:51.080> need<00:04:51.350> to<00:04:51.500> stop<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:52.010> why

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
reason why it would need to stop and why

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.310 
reason why it would need to stop and why
is<00:04:52.520> it<00:04:52.610> wise<00:04:52.970> they<00:04:53.090> need<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.300> transform<00:04:53.720> ya<00:04:54.139> why

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
is it wise they need to transform ya why

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.870 
is it wise they need to transform ya why
does<00:04:54.440> it<00:04:54.560> need<00:04:54.620> a<00:04:54.680> transport<00:04:55.070> gun<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:55.610> I<00:04:55.639> mean

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
does it need a transport gun so I mean

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.670 
does it need a transport gun so I mean
sometimes<00:04:56.090> it's<00:04:56.660> cool<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:56.990> transform<00:04:57.410> but<00:04:57.590> at

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
sometimes it's cool to transform but at

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.629 
sometimes it's cool to transform but at
same<00:04:57.770> time<00:04:57.950> like<00:04:58.100> why<00:04:58.220> would<00:04:58.400> they<00:04:58.490> build

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
same time like why would they build

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.250 
same time like why would they build
something<00:04:58.940> that's<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.300> complicated<00:04:59.900> right

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
something that's that complicated right

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.750 
something that's that complicated right
so<00:05:00.680> this<00:05:00.979> one<00:05:01.100> I<00:05:01.130> think<00:05:01.190> makes<00:05:01.460> a<00:05:01.520> little<00:05:01.610> more

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
so this one I think makes a little more

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.570 
so this one I think makes a little more
sense<00:05:02.000> because<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.600> has<00:05:03.100> when<00:05:04.100> you<00:05:04.190> see<00:05:04.370> the

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
sense because it has when you see the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.659 
sense because it has when you see the
weapon<00:05:04.910> inside<00:05:05.410> it's<00:05:06.410> this<00:05:06.620> sort<00:05:06.919> of<00:05:07.070> it<00:05:07.460> looks

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
weapon inside it's this sort of it looks

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.420 
weapon inside it's this sort of it looks
kind<00:05:07.850> of<00:05:07.880> like<00:05:07.940> this<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.389> new<00:05:09.229> experimental<00:05:09.860> and

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
kind of like this a new experimental and

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.520 
kind of like this a new experimental and
a<00:05:10.490> few<00:05:10.669> days<00:05:10.820> you<00:05:11.120> know<00:05:11.289> weapon<00:05:12.289> that<00:05:12.380> they've

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
a few days you know weapon that they've

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.090 
a few days you know weapon that they've
just

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
just

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.220 
just
is<00:05:13.340> really<00:05:13.580> powerful<00:05:13.850> i<00:05:14.210> can<00:05:14.300> do<00:05:14.480> crazy<00:05:14.840> stuff

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
is really powerful i can do crazy stuff

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.530 
is really powerful i can do crazy stuff
these<00:05:15.740> assignments<00:05:16.160> you<00:05:16.880> know<00:05:16.970> you<00:05:17.030> see<00:05:17.330> all

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
these assignments you know you see all

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.260 
these assignments you know you see all
the<00:05:17.720> exposed<00:05:18.140> workings<00:05:18.950> of<00:05:19.100> it<00:05:19.310> very<00:05:19.760> delicate

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
the exposed workings of it very delicate

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.090 
the exposed workings of it very delicate
yeah<00:05:20.510> it's<00:05:20.630> like<00:05:20.690> no<00:05:20.900> case<00:05:21.170> on<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.560> outside<00:05:21.890> of

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
yeah it's like no case on the outside of

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.070 
yeah it's like no case on the outside of
it<00:05:22.250> like<00:05:22.520> wires<00:05:22.820> in<00:05:23.120> case<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.480> will<00:05:23.540> sense<00:05:23.960> it

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
it like wires in case I will sense it

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.050 
it like wires in case I will sense it
acquires<00:05:24.440> it<00:05:24.740> like<00:05:24.950> maybe<00:05:25.160> even<00:05:25.370> like<00:05:25.550> liquid

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
acquires it like maybe even like liquid

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.450 
acquires it like maybe even like liquid
going<00:05:26.660> between<00:05:26.840> like<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.560> barrel<00:05:27.920> and<00:05:28.100> some

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
going between like the barrel and some

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.760 
going between like the barrel and some
other<00:05:28.760> part<00:05:29.180> right<00:05:29.780> it's<00:05:30.170> large<00:05:30.410> enough<00:05:30.500> that

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
other part right it's large enough that

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.440 
other part right it's large enough that
it<00:05:31.130> feels<00:05:31.310> like<00:05:31.490> it's<00:05:31.640> a<00:05:31.670> massive<00:05:32.060> cam<00:05:32.210> it's

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
it feels like it's a massive cam it's

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.480 
it feels like it's a massive cam it's
going<00:05:32.600> to<00:05:32.660> do<00:05:32.720> a<00:05:32.750> lot<00:05:32.930> of<00:05:32.990> damage<00:05:33.230> but<00:05:34.190> at<00:05:34.400> the

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
going to do a lot of damage but at the

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.000 
going to do a lot of damage but at the
same<00:05:34.640> time<00:05:34.910> it's<00:05:35.900> not<00:05:36.140> to<00:05:36.470> heat<00:05:36.650> you<00:05:36.740> can<00:05:36.860> have

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
same time it's not to heat you can have

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
same time it's not to heat you can have
several<00:05:37.220> of<00:05:37.340> these<00:05:37.490> moving<00:05:37.880> through<00:05:38.000> a

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
several of these moving through a

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.060 
several of these moving through a
hallway<00:05:38.240> without<00:05:38.810> too<00:05:39.320> many<00:05:39.410> problems<00:05:39.530> and

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
hallway without too many problems and

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.980 
hallway without too many problems and
maybe<00:05:40.250> players<00:05:41.150> will<00:05:41.360> be<00:05:41.450> able<00:05:41.480> to<00:05:41.660> jump<00:05:41.840> on

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
maybe players will be able to jump on

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.270 
maybe players will be able to jump on
top<00:05:42.110> of<00:05:42.170> it<00:05:42.440> and<00:05:42.470> go<00:05:42.740> along<00:05:42.770> for<00:05:43.130> the<00:05:43.250> ride

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
top of it and go along for the ride

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.650 
top of it and go along for the ride
right<00:05:43.610> now<00:05:43.760> there's<00:05:43.940> little<00:05:44.360> things<00:05:44.480> like

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
right now there's little things like

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.030 
right now there's little things like
that<00:05:44.720> that<00:05:44.870> you<00:05:45.260> know<00:05:45.320> people<00:05:45.650> always<00:05:45.710> like<00:05:45.920> to

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
that that you know people always like to

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.430 
that that you know people always like to
do<00:05:46.130> in<00:05:46.250> games<00:05:46.480> you<00:05:47.480> know<00:05:47.600> goofing<00:05:48.080> around<00:05:48.320> and

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
do in games you know goofing around and

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.920 
do in games you know goofing around and
stuff<00:05:48.590> so<00:05:48.920> we<00:05:49.790> think<00:05:49.910> it's<00:05:50.270> going<00:05:50.450> to<00:05:50.510> achieve

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
stuff so we think it's going to achieve

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.260 
stuff so we think it's going to achieve
what<00:05:51.290> we<00:05:51.320> want<00:05:51.440> is<00:05:51.860> pretty<00:05:52.490> complicated<00:05:52.850> it'll

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
what we want is pretty complicated it'll

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.480 
what we want is pretty complicated it'll
have<00:05:53.360> a<00:05:53.390> lot<00:05:53.600> of<00:05:53.650> interesting<00:05:54.650> animations

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
have a lot of interesting animations

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.760 
have a lot of interesting animations
with<00:05:55.700> parts<00:05:56.030> that<00:05:56.180> pop<00:05:56.390> out<00:05:56.540> open<00:05:56.900> up<00:05:57.020> you<00:05:57.650> know

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
with parts that pop out open up you know

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.540 
with parts that pop out open up you know
unfold<00:05:58.510> I<00:05:59.770> think<00:06:00.770> it's<00:06:00.860> going<00:06:00.980> to<00:06:01.040> be<00:06:01.100> dramatic

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
unfold I think it's going to be dramatic

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.310 
unfold I think it's going to be dramatic
when<00:06:01.700> it<00:06:01.820> is<00:06:02.150> deployed<00:06:02.570> in<00:06:02.750> combat<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.260> I

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
when it is deployed in combat and I

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.740 
when it is deployed in combat and I
think<00:06:03.530> it's<00:06:04.060> going<00:06:05.060> to<00:06:05.120> like<00:06:05.270> change<00:06:05.510> the

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
think it's going to like change the

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.650 
think it's going to like change the
whole<00:06:06.550> change<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:07.790> battleground<00:06:08.300> when<00:06:08.540> it

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
whole change the battleground when it

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.370 
whole change the battleground when it
happens<00:06:09.110> so<00:06:09.860> that's<00:06:10.280> a<00:06:10.430> seizure<00:06:10.610> cannon

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
happens so that's a seizure cannon

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.970 
happens so that's a seizure cannon
hopefully<00:06:12.380> this<00:06:12.530> gives<00:06:12.650> you<00:06:12.770> a<00:06:12.830> little

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980 
hopefully this gives you a little

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.540 
hopefully this gives you a little
insight<00:06:13.370> into<00:06:13.900> how<00:06:14.900> kind<00:06:15.680> of<00:06:15.740> the<00:06:15.800> concept<00:06:16.310> and

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
insight into how kind of the concept and

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.800 
insight into how kind of the concept and
actually<00:06:16.790> to<00:06:16.880> an<00:06:16.970> extent<00:06:17.300> the<00:06:17.390> gameplay

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
actually to an extent the gameplay

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.460 
actually to an extent the gameplay
involves<00:06:18.170> from<00:06:18.620> these<00:06:18.980> high-level<00:06:19.220> ideas<00:06:19.730> and
