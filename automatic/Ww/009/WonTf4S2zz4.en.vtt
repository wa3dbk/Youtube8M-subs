00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.469
 Hello 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.240
 playing a new song the consell a 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.240
 most sublime grace 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.990
 it's a very little house 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.010
 the chance is in me only 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.310
 that 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.440
 three chords are used therefore it is 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.440
 a bit simple to learn 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.460
 a third song with the lyrics is a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.490
 little extensive but the actors are very 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.780
 very easy then says that song is 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.989
 in me my greatest 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.940
 come on let's use it the suspended ones 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.760
 seconds 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.760
 and a yes suspended second 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.870
 I will explain 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.150
 he suspended them second is like the but 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.010
 taking away the biggest loss but 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.950
 removing the third I only have left 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.880
 12 and the emergencies according to it used 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.770
 those 2 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.710
 yes 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.950
 it's as if we do not have here in the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.700
 suspended second we go through 12 frets 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.810
 and we add this the first finger here in 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.810
 the fifth fourth second behind 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:38.210
 ok then what corresponds chords 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.210
 the kingdom would be more or less like that 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.760
 then it would be 2 down 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.770
 and all down 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.490
 one up down down up and down 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.490
 would be like that 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.520
 in the remembered of there is where it lasts 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.150
 more time compared to the cord 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.150
 he explained he says 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.920
 towards me 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.439
 yes 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.900
 and if he says again 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.650
 the first 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.910
 I do not 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.600
 and everyone 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 but 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.370
 i 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.730
 because we can already listen and so 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.910
 He says 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.830
 p 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.960
 Y 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.900
 as he says 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.499
 and so they go with each of the 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.499
 stanzas say the last says and when 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.620
 2000 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.510
 I never 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.259
 if 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.259
 h 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.680
 I think there is no greater difficulty in 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.040
 that then the rhythm would be like this again 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.040
 shape 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.850
 generation 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.139
 bye 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.100
 ok I really hope that it has 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.790

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.110
