00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.460
 16 32 or 64 GB and basically it's the same 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.470
 design than the iphone 5 the only one that 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.300
 change is the color the processor the 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.010
 camera and the new sensor on the button 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.050
 start and when you buy the phone 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.329
 iphone 5 that comes in different box 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.780
 Now you can notice the phone in front 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.230
 here says airbus 5 s here the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.550

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.790
 I would have it but there is no problem for 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.489
 you are going to be in a blog without yet 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.860
 then here is the phone is the 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.290
 same design as the iphone 5 here is 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.850
 the iphone 5 same design the only thing 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.680
 changes the color the phone is golden 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.290
 the back is golden and the rest 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.880
 it is white the whole shore is golden and 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.280
 citizens the silver will be the same 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.409
 but behind it's going to be golden and it's going to be 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.110
 white and when they do that black what's 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.250
 back is going to be like gray color and all the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.960
 phone is going to be black 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.060
 the other thing that changes is the design 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.299
 where the flash comes out compared to the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.590
 iphone 5 the flash is a circle but in 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.259
 the iphone 5 is like 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.869
 it also changes the camera has the 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.450
 same megapixels as the iphone 5 but 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.219
 has a new lens that makes it between 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.929

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.200
 when you are downloading applications from 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.109
 the app store or buying music too 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.329
 includes 7 processor that 64 bits cp 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.700
 v is twice faster than 6 and 2 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.829

 processor is also includes air 7 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.049
