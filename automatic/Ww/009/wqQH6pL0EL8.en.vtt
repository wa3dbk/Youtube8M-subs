hi thank you your comment I've often

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.070 
hi thank you your comment I've often
wondered<00:00:06.600> how<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.049> perfect<00:00:07.940> complementary

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
wondered how the perfect complementary

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.110 
wondered how the perfect complementary
male-female<00:00:10.080> systems<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:11.120> reproduction

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
male-female systems of reproduction

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.910 
male-female systems of reproduction
could<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.420> evolved<00:00:13.019> from<00:00:13.139> an<00:00:13.380> intelligent

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
could have evolved from an intelligent

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.570 
could have evolved from an intelligent
life<00:00:14.099> forms<00:00:15.529> you<00:00:16.529> know<00:00:16.619> Anton<00:00:16.920> not<00:00:17.220> only<00:00:17.400> is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
life forms you know Anton not only is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.490 
life forms you know Anton not only is
that<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.760> good<00:00:18.000> question<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:18.630> also<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.230> point

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
that a good question but also the point

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.429 
that a good question but also the point
is<00:00:19.650> if<00:00:19.859> if<00:00:20.100> evolution<00:00:20.520> occurred<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.449> had<00:00:22.380> to

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
is if if evolution occurred I had to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.470 
is if if evolution occurred I had to
have<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.830> simultaneous<00:00:23.670> evolution<00:00:24.300> of

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
have to be simultaneous evolution of

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.170 
have to be simultaneous evolution of
both<00:00:24.630> species<00:00:24.960> at<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> same<00:00:25.619> time<00:00:25.859> because<00:00:26.730> if

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
both species at the same time because if

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.019 
both species at the same time because if
it<00:00:27.300> took<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.539> million<00:00:27.869> years<00:00:28.429> for<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.670> female

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
it took a million years for the female

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.200 
it took a million years for the female
to<00:00:30.330> evolve<00:00:31.550> it<00:00:32.550> would<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.759> kind<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.969> messed

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
to evolve it would have kind of messed

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.240 
to evolve it would have kind of messed
up<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.690> whole<00:00:33.960> procreation<00:00:34.620> thing<00:00:35.010> wouldn't

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
up the whole procreation thing wouldn't

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.850 
up the whole procreation thing wouldn't
it<00:00:35.309> right<00:00:35.809> that's<00:00:36.809> my<00:00:36.899> question<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.530> good

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it right that's my question a good

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.560 
it right that's my question a good
question<00:00:38.309> stay<00:00:38.670> right<00:00:38.820> there<00:00:38.879> Michael<00:00:39.420> cream

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
question stay right there Michael cream

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.619 
question stay right there Michael cream
on<00:00:39.719> your<00:00:39.840> response<00:00:40.550> well<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.850> would<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.570> to

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
on your response well I would like to

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.990 
on your response well I would like to
put<00:00:42.989> together<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.739> book<00:00:44.219> called<00:00:44.520> Darwin's

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
put together a book called Darwin's

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.430 
put together a book called Darwin's
fairy<00:00:45.660> tales<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.960> would<00:00:49.230> be

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
fairy tales and I think that would be

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.910 
fairy tales and I think that would be
one<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.860> them<00:00:50.210> you<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.750> look<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.680> many

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
one of them you can just look at so many

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.729 
one of them you can just look at so many
examples<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:54.210> complex<00:00:54.840> structures<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
examples of complex structures and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.970 
examples of complex structures and
behaviors<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:57.260> different<00:00:58.260> creatures<00:00:58.410> whether

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
behaviors in different creatures whether

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.580 
behaviors in different creatures whether
it's<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.399> how<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.059> spider<00:01:00.600> learned<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.289> spin

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
it's the how the spider learned to spin

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.340 
it's the how the spider learned to spin
its<00:01:01.770> web<00:01:01.859> or<00:01:02.430> how<00:01:03.420> our<00:01:04.640> human<00:01:06.350> reproduction

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
its web or how our human reproduction

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.800 
its web or how our human reproduction
system<00:01:08.010> came<00:01:08.460> about<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:09.890> any<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.100> these<00:01:11.280> things

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
system came about or any of these things

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.320 
system came about or any of these things
there<00:01:12.810> are<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> complete<00:01:13.560> mystery<00:01:14.460> they're<00:01:15.030> not

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
there are a complete mystery they're not

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
there are a complete mystery they're not
explained<00:01:15.990> even<00:01:16.710> theoretically<00:01:17.810> by<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
explained even theoretically by the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.300 
explained even theoretically by the
evolutionist<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:21.170> there<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.979> they<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.189> is

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
evolutionist and there what they do is

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.490 
evolutionist and there what they do is
when<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.330> want<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.600> explain<00:01:24.900> anything<00:01:25.170> they

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
when they want to explain anything they

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.219 
when they want to explain anything they
just<00:01:25.530> waved<00:01:25.979> their<00:01:26.400> magic<00:01:26.790> wand<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.210> said<00:01:27.509> it

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
just waved their magic wand and said it

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.460 
just waved their magic wand and said it
happened<00:01:28.770> by<00:01:28.950> evolution<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.259> that's<00:01:31.259> why<00:01:31.439> I

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
happened by evolution and that's why I

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.649 
happened by evolution and that's why I
call<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.829> Darwin's<00:01:32.790> fairy<00:01:33.060> tales<00:01:35.630> well<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
call it Darwin's fairy tales well I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.780 
call it Darwin's fairy tales well I
think<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.079> time<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:38.009> begin<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.430> look<00:01:38.549> at<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
think it's time to begin to look at the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
think it's time to begin to look at the
implications<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.630> all<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.259> idea<00:01:40.650> i<00:01:40.979> can

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
implications of all of this idea i can

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.510 
implications of all of this idea i can
assure<00:01:41.340> our<00:01:42.530> audience<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.310> have
