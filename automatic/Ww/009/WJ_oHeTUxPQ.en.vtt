00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
all right so the first thing to know is

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.930 
all right so the first thing to know is
that<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.360> view<00:00:03.929> ray<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.200> pretty<00:00:04.770> complex<00:00:05.430> system

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
that a view ray is pretty complex system

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.089 
that a view ray is pretty complex system
there's<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.390> lot<00:00:06.690> we<00:00:06.899> can<00:00:07.049> do<00:00:07.230> with<00:00:07.410> it<00:00:07.440> there's

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
there's a lot we can do with it there's

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.730 
there's a lot we can do with it there's
a<00:00:08.160> lot<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.460> presets<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.090> can<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:09.450> made<00:00:09.740> you

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
a lot of presets that can be made you

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.100 
a lot of presets that can be made you
can<00:00:10.889> tweak<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.820> know<00:00:11.910> camera<00:00:12.389> settings<00:00:12.750> and

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
can tweak you know camera settings and

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.720 
can tweak you know camera settings and
lighting<00:00:13.440> levels<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.130> number<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.490> times

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
lighting levels the number of times

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.800 
lighting levels the number of times
light<00:00:15.059> bounces<00:00:15.480> around<00:00:15.890> and<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.460> all

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
light bounces around and to do that all

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.710 
light bounces around and to do that all
it's<00:00:18.810> done<00:00:19.080> under<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.590> v-ray<00:00:19.920> options<00:00:20.720> so

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
it's done under the v-ray options so

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.560 
it's done under the v-ray options so
here<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.369> kind<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.850> panel<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.480> all

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
here we have kind of this panel with all

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.130 
here we have kind of this panel with all
these<00:00:24.689> trays<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.439> go<00:00:25.920> out<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> lot

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
these trays and go out and this is a lot

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.230 
these trays and go out and this is a lot
of<00:00:28.260> stuff<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.920> personally<00:00:29.519> don't<00:00:30.060> even

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
of stuff that I personally don't even

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.970 
of stuff that I personally don't even
mess<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:30.449> there's<00:00:30.869> there's<00:00:31.260> no<00:00:31.410> reason<00:00:31.439> for

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
mess with there's there's no reason for

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.270 
mess with there's there's no reason for
me<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.130> come<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.350> go<00:00:34.350> over<00:00:34.649> each<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.130> every

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
me to come in and go over each and every

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.130 
me to come in and go over each and every
one<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.460> these<00:00:35.640> because<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.090> think<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.840> very

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
one of these because I think it's a very

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410 
one of these because I think it's a very
very<00:00:37.469> small<00:00:37.860> percentage<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.489> people<00:00:38.790> who<00:00:38.940> will

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
very small percentage of people who will

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
very small percentage of people who will
actually<00:00:39.780> utilize<00:00:40.170> kind<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.370> most

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
actually utilize kind of the most

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.490 
actually utilize kind of the most
efficient<00:00:42.390> means<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.809> rendering<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.260> stuff

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
efficient means of rendering this stuff

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.869 
efficient means of rendering this stuff
out<00:00:43.969> that's<00:00:44.969> global<00:00:45.360> switches<00:00:45.690> under<00:00:45.930> system

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
out that's global switches under system

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.970 
out that's global switches under system
again<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.600> incredibly<00:00:49.260> complex<00:00:49.710> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
again it's it's incredibly complex and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.139 
again it's it's incredibly complex and
it<00:00:50.879> talks<00:00:51.329> about<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:51.899> how<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:53.789> software

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it talks about you know how the software

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.229 
it talks about you know how the software
is<00:00:54.270> actually<00:00:54.629> working<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.469> computer

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
is actually working on the computer

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.760 
is actually working on the computer
things<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> work<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:57.809> every<00:00:57.989> day<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
things that I work with every day is the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.430 
things that I work with every day is the
camera<00:00:59.100> settings<00:00:59.399> here<00:01:00.059> we're<00:01:00.690> able<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.050> treat

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
camera settings here we're able to treat

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.189 
camera settings here we're able to treat
the<00:01:02.430> 3d<00:01:02.940> camera<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.690> looking<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the 3d camera we have looking at the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.830 
the 3d camera we have looking at the
scene<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> physical<00:01:05.430> camera<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.600> things

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
scene as a physical camera and do things

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.010 
scene as a physical camera and do things
like<00:01:08.000> specifying<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> shutter

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
like specifying you know the shutter

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.440 
like specifying you know the shutter
speed<00:01:10.200> or<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> f-stop<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.970> anyone's<00:01:12.330> familiar

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
speed or the f-stop if anyone's familiar

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359 
speed or the f-stop if anyone's familiar
with<00:01:12.869> manual<00:01:13.229> photography<00:01:13.770> I'm<00:01:14.010> sure<00:01:14.189> you're

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
with manual photography I'm sure you're

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.649 
with manual photography I'm sure you're
familiar<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.880> these<00:01:14.970> things<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.479> will

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
familiar with these things this will

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.810 
familiar with these things this will
change<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> way<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.430> image<00:01:17.549> is

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
change the way that the image is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.850 
change the way that the image is
rendered<00:01:17.970> will<00:01:18.299> help<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:19.140> too<00:01:19.350> bright<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.799> too

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
rendered will help be too bright or too

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.539 
rendered will help be too bright or too
dark<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.210> adjusted<00:01:21.659> here

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
dark all that can be adjusted here

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.859 
dark all that can be adjusted here
additionally<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.909> effects<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> depth

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
additionally we do effects like a depth

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.600 
additionally we do effects like a depth
of<00:01:24.990> field<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> thing<00:01:25.950> close<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.460> us

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
of field and have the thing close to us

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.160 
of field and have the thing close to us
a<00:01:26.790> little<00:01:27.180> blurry<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.689> thing<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> mid

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
a little blurry the thing in the mid

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.870 
a little blurry the thing in the mid
ground<00:01:28.350> sharp<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> thing<00:01:29.369> far<00:01:29.549> away

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
ground sharp and the thing far away

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.499 
ground sharp and the thing far away
blurry<00:01:30.659> again<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:32.310> rarely<00:01:32.820> use<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.360> at

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
blurry again I I rarely use that at

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.179 
blurry again I I rarely use that at
something<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.290> Photoshop<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:35.040> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
something I can do in Photoshop and I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.679 
something I can do in Photoshop and I
think<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.729> important<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> always<00:01:36.270> keep<00:01:36.420> that

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
think it's important to always keep that

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.170 
think it's important to always keep that
in<00:01:36.750> mind<00:01:37.110> exactly<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.430> know<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.119> need

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
in mind exactly you know what do I need

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
in mind exactly you know what do I need
to<00:01:39.390> render<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.590> Photoshop

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to render and what can I do in Photoshop

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.830 
to render and what can I do in Photoshop
and<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.460> how<00:01:41.759> much<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.210> want<00:01:42.329> my<00:01:42.509> rendering

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and and how much do I want my rendering

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.719 
and and how much do I want my rendering
to<00:01:42.990> take<00:01:43.140> care<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.710> how<00:01:44.130> much<00:01:44.310> will<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.520> take

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
to take care of and how much will I take

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.569 
to take care of and how much will I take
care<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.240> post-processing<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
care of in post-processing so that's the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.440 
care of in post-processing so that's the
the<00:01:47.939> camera<00:01:48.180> setting<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.920> environment<00:01:50.450> right

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the camera setting the environment right

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.910 
the camera setting the environment right
now<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.079> showing<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.740> have

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
now this is just showing that we have

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920 
now this is just showing that we have
kind<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> global<00:01:53.820> eliminated<00:01:54.420> skylight

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
kind of a global eliminated skylight

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.780 
kind of a global eliminated skylight
which<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> blueish<00:01:55.979> color<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
which is a blueish color and we have a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.899 
which is a blueish color and we have a
reflection<00:01:57.509> Maps<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:58.430> later<00:01:59.430> we'll<00:01:59.640> get<00:01:59.759> into

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
reflection Maps on later we'll get into

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.100 
reflection Maps on later we'll get into
kind<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.270> these<00:02:00.450> things<00:02:00.719> here<00:02:00.960> with

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
kind of these things here with

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.679 
kind of these things here with
reflection<00:02:01.950> refraction<00:02:02.280> mapping<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.360> that's

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
reflection refraction mapping and that's

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.890 
reflection refraction mapping and that's
done<00:02:03.869> here

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
done here

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.100 
done here
this<00:02:05.710> is<00:02:05.910> again<00:02:06.910> another<00:02:07.330> setting<00:02:07.660> I<00:02:07.750> really

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
this is again another setting I really

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
this is again another setting I really
don't<00:02:08.290> mess<00:02:08.440> with<00:02:08.640> anti-aliasing<00:02:11.130> settings

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
don't mess with anti-aliasing settings

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.910 
don't mess with anti-aliasing settings
that<00:02:12.850> are<00:02:13.090> controlling<00:02:13.870> noise<00:02:14.290> level<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
that are controlling noise level in the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.290 
that are controlling noise level in the
image<00:02:15.130> color<00:02:16.060> mapping<00:02:16.360> again<00:02:17.200> not<00:02:17.710> needed

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
image color mapping again not needed

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.970 
image color mapping again not needed
sometimes<00:02:19.300> I'll<00:02:19.510> come<00:02:19.690> in<00:02:19.840> here<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.320> use<00:02:20.740> the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
sometimes I'll come in here and use the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.920 
sometimes I'll come in here and use the
VfB<00:02:21.400> channels<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.240> way<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.480> control

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
VfB channels this is a way to control

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.760 
VfB channels this is a way to control
specific<00:02:23.560> instances<00:02:24.550> of<00:02:24.820> data<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:26.440> will<00:02:26.560> add

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
specific instances of data that will add

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.760 
specific instances of data that will add
layers<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.760> well<00:02:28.210> will<00:02:28.450> get<00:02:28.720> like<00:02:28.990> an<00:02:29.230> image

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
layers so well will get like an image

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.650 
layers so well will get like an image
out<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.190> we<00:02:30.340> could<00:02:30.460> also<00:02:30.670> get<00:02:30.970> additional

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
out of it we could also get additional

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.470 
out of it we could also get additional
layers<00:02:31.930> then<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.560> z-depth<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.220> how<00:02:33.820> far<00:02:34.180> back

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
layers then the z-depth is how far back

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.960 
layers then the z-depth is how far back
in<00:02:34.750> space<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.740> material<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.430> rendered

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
in space the the material is rendered

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.060 
in space the the material is rendered
out<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:37.959> with<00:02:38.110> something<00:02:38.380> like<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.530> we<00:02:38.920> can

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
out so with something like that we can

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.970 
out so with something like that we can
use<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:40.180> help<00:02:40.209> go<00:02:40.840> into<00:02:41.050> Photoshop<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.530> blur

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
use to help go into Photoshop and blur

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.650 
use to help go into Photoshop and blur
different<00:02:42.459> aspects<00:02:42.910> based<00:02:43.120> on<00:02:43.270> their<00:02:43.420> depth

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
different aspects based on their depth

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.410 
different aspects based on their depth
but<00:02:44.470> again<00:02:45.220> we'll<00:02:45.370> get<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.610> those<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:46.090> little

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
but again we'll get to those a little

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.560 
but again we'll get to those a little
later<00:02:46.570> in<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.930> tutorial<00:02:47.970> output<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.360> one's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
later in the tutorial output this one's

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.870 
later in the tutorial output this one's
really<00:02:49.810> important<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.680> very<00:02:50.800> easy<00:02:51.130> this<00:02:51.820> is

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
really important and very easy this is

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.640 
really important and very easy this is
the<00:02:52.120> size<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.600> rendering<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.170> know<00:02:53.290> right

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
the size of the rendering you know right

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.560 
the size of the rendering you know right
now<00:02:53.770> if<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.040> did<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.220> rendering<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.270> can<00:02:55.450> do

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
now if I did a rendering and I can do

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.890 
now if I did a rendering and I can do
one<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:59.200> incredibly<00:02:59.550> bright<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.820> dark<00:03:01.570> for

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
one it's incredibly bright and dark for

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.650 
one it's incredibly bright and dark for
the<00:03:01.930> actual<00:03:02.410> image<00:03:02.709> it's<00:03:03.280> not<00:03:03.490> you<00:03:03.820> know<00:03:03.940> doing

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
the actual image it's not you know doing

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.740 
the actual image it's not you know doing
that<00:03:04.900> much<00:03:05.080> for<00:03:05.410> me<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:06.790> it's<00:03:07.030> also<00:03:07.150> very<00:03:07.360> very

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
that much for me but it's also very very

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.750 
that much for me but it's also very very
small<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.320> so<00:03:08.620> while<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.190> great<00:03:09.310> just<00:03:09.670> to

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
small and so while this is great just to

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.880 
small and so while this is great just to
do<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.880> quick<00:03:10.090> test<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.840> would<00:03:11.140> never<00:03:11.440> be<00:03:11.680> what<00:03:11.860> I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
do a quick test it would never be what I

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.240 
do a quick test it would never be what I
want<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.550> know<00:03:12.670> as<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:12.910> move<00:03:13.120> into<00:03:13.330> production

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
want you know as I move into production

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.350 
want you know as I move into production
another<00:03:15.250> important<00:03:15.700> thing<00:03:15.850> that<00:03:15.910> always

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
another important thing that always

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.690 
another important thing that always
trips<00:03:17.019> people<00:03:17.260> up<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.739> myself<00:03:17.920> included<00:03:18.250> is

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
trips people up and myself included is

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.000 
trips people up and myself included is
to<00:03:19.360> make<00:03:19.540> sure<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.900> I'm<00:03:20.019> always<00:03:20.260> rendering

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
to make sure that I'm always rendering

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.270 
to make sure that I'm always rendering
the<00:03:21.580> same<00:03:22.060> aspect<00:03:22.900> ratio<00:03:22.989> of<00:03:23.380> what<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:23.950> see<00:03:24.160> on

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
the same aspect ratio of what I see on

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.150 
the same aspect ratio of what I see on
my<00:03:24.310> screen<00:03:24.790> if<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.780> say<00:03:26.019> get<00:03:26.320> aspect<00:03:26.800> ratio

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
my screen if I say get aspect ratio

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.620 
my screen if I say get aspect ratio
right<00:03:27.640> now<00:03:27.760> we're<00:03:27.940> looking<00:03:28.030> at<00:03:28.239> one<00:03:28.420> point

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
right now we're looking at one point

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.810 
right now we're looking at one point
three<00:03:28.750> three<00:03:29.080> if<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:29.680> get<00:03:29.830> aspect<00:03:30.220> ratio<00:03:30.550> it's

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
three three if I get aspect ratio it's

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.270 
three three if I get aspect ratio it's
one<00:03:31.000> point<00:03:31.300> nine<00:03:31.600> four<00:03:32.050> now<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.769> is<00:03:32.950> my

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
one point nine four now this is my

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.320 
one point nine four now this is my
screen<00:03:33.580> is<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.730> widescreen<00:03:34.060> display<00:03:34.540> so<00:03:34.800> this

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
screen is a widescreen display so this

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.690 
screen is a widescreen display so this
resolution<00:03:37.330> changes<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:38.500> can<00:03:39.130> lock<00:03:39.400> that

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
resolution changes I can lock that

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.660 
resolution changes I can lock that
aspect<00:03:40.150> ratio<00:03:40.570> here<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:41.190> increase<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.430> size

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
aspect ratio here and increase the size

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.020 
aspect ratio here and increase the size
of<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.060> rendering<00:03:44.040> coming<00:03:45.040> down<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.250> can<00:03:45.640> set

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
of the rendering coming down I can set

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.840 
of the rendering coming down I can set
up<00:03:46.060> output<00:03:46.540> files<00:03:47.190> here<00:03:48.190> we<00:03:48.340> actually<00:03:48.700> have

up output files here we actually have
the<00:03:49.150> way<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.870> scene<00:03:50.049> is<00:03:50.200> illuminated<00:03:50.799> so

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
the way the the scene is illuminated so

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.490 
the way the the scene is illuminated so
this<00:03:51.100> is<00:03:51.250> indirect<00:03:51.640> illumination<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:53.260> these

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
this is indirect illumination and these

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.440 
this is indirect illumination and these
are<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.739> types<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.310> illumination<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:55.060> using

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
are the types of illumination it's using

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.900 
are the types of illumination it's using
to<00:03:55.890> figure<00:03:56.890> that<00:03:57.010> out

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
to figure that out

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.449 
to figure that out
we're<00:03:58.299> using<00:03:58.450> irritants<00:03:59.019> map<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.590> brute

second how you can load presets
once<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.320> set<00:04:11.560> those<00:04:11.739> up<00:04:11.920> you<00:04:11.950> can<00:04:12.190> come<00:04:12.340> in

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
once you set those up you can come in

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.620 
once you set those up you can come in
here<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:12.670> this<00:04:12.850> is<00:04:13.000> how<00:04:13.120> many<00:04:13.269> times<00:04:13.329> the

something<00:04:22.840> that<00:04:22.990> I'll<00:04:23.110> get<00:04:23.320> into<00:04:23.500> hopefully<00:04:24.100> a

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
something that I'll get into hopefully a

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
little later it's going to be the way

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.790 
little later it's going to be the way
glass<00:04:26.229> and<00:04:26.710> kind<00:04:27.190> of<00:04:27.250> reflective<00:04:27.940> items

glass and kind of reflective items

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.930 
glass and kind of reflective items
manipulate<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.979> scene<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.370> manipulate<00:04:30.820> the

manipulate the scene and manipulate the

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.080 
manipulate the scene and manipulate the
light<00:04:31.169> if<00:04:32.169> you<00:04:32.320> can<00:04:32.470> imagine<00:04:32.680> having<00:04:32.919> a<00:04:33.310> glass

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
light if you can imagine having a glass

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.870 
light if you can imagine having a glass
of<00:04:34.240> water<00:04:34.479> held<00:04:34.780> up<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.050> light<00:04:35.699> the<00:04:36.699> light

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
of water held up to light the light

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.120 
of water held up to light the light
would<00:04:37.060> Bend<00:04:37.270> through<00:04:37.660> it<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.110> respond<00:04:38.889> in<00:04:39.039> a

would Bend through it and respond in a

would Bend through it and respond in a
different<00:04:39.430> way<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:39.580> this<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.120> one<00:04:40.720> aspect

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
different way so this is a one aspect

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.659 
different way so this is a one aspect
that<00:04:41.259> would<00:04:41.380> help<00:04:41.500> bring<00:04:41.919> some<00:04:41.949> realism<00:04:42.460> to

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
that would help bring some realism to

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.200 
that would help bring some realism to
the<00:04:42.699> scene<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:44.470> then<00:04:44.620> as<00:04:44.740> we<00:04:44.830> move<00:04:44.860> down<00:04:45.220> some

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
the scene and then as we move down some

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.879 
the scene and then as we move down some
displacement<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.350> real-time<00:04:47.530> engine

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
displacement and the real-time engine

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.040 
displacement and the real-time engine
which<00:04:48.160> we're<00:04:48.490> not<00:04:48.580> going<00:04:48.729> to<00:04:48.759> get<00:04:48.910> into<00:04:49.060> but

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
which we're not going to get into but

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.540 
which we're not going to get into but
one<00:04:50.199> of<00:04:50.289> the<00:04:50.350> most<00:04:50.500> simple<00:04:50.710> basic<00:04:50.919> things<00:04:51.430> we

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
one of the most simple basic things we

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.390 
one of the most simple basic things we
can<00:04:51.729> do<00:04:51.880> is<00:04:52.150> just<00:04:52.300> click<00:04:52.509> the<00:04:52.690> open<00:04:53.139> or<00:04:53.949> go<00:04:54.130> file

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
can do is just click the open or go file

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.760 
can do is just click the open or go file
open<00:04:54.610> in<00:04:54.940> Rhino<00:04:55.120> 4<00:04:55.449> and<00:04:56.139> we<00:04:56.229> have<00:04:56.349> a<00:04:56.380> series<00:04:56.620> of

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
open in Rhino 4 and we have a series of

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.659 
open in Rhino 4 and we have a series of
presets<00:04:57.310> here<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:59.740> ones<00:04:59.949> I<00:05:00.160> usually<00:05:00.520> end

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
presets here and the ones I usually end

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.050 
presets here and the ones I usually end
up<00:05:00.729> using<00:05:01.000> is<00:05:01.270> this<00:05:01.419> GI<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:01.900> our<00:05:02.470> map<00:05:02.680> medium<00:05:03.160> so

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
up using is this GI I our map medium so

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.420 
up using is this GI I our map medium so
it's<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.270> global<00:05:04.419> elimination<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.560> irritants

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
it's a global elimination and irritants

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.610 
it's a global elimination and irritants
map<00:05:06.639> and<00:05:07.449> it's<00:05:07.570> just<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:07.810> medium<00:05:08.110> setting<00:05:08.440> so

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
map and it's just the medium setting so

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.120 
map and it's just the medium setting so
if<00:05:08.680> I<00:05:08.770> open<00:05:09.099> that<00:05:10.199> sets<00:05:11.199> up<00:05:11.349> some<00:05:11.560> presets<00:05:11.949> for

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
if I open that sets up some presets for

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.620 
if I open that sets up some presets for
me<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.460> one<00:05:12.580> thing<00:05:12.789> I<00:05:12.880> worry<00:05:13.090> about<00:05:13.270> is

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
me and the one thing I worry about is

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.450 
me and the one thing I worry about is
that<00:05:13.840> you<00:05:14.259> want<00:05:14.410> to<00:05:14.440> override<00:05:14.889> the<00:05:15.070> viewport

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
that you want to override the viewport

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.890 
that you want to override the viewport
again<00:05:15.699> because<00:05:15.910> you<00:05:16.060> can<00:05:16.180> see<00:05:16.360> it's<00:05:16.509> not<00:05:16.720> even

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
again because you can see it's not even

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.960 
again because you can see it's not even
to<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.199> aspect<00:05:17.530> ratio<00:05:17.620> it's<00:05:18.130> set<00:05:18.340> before<00:05:18.699> so<00:05:18.910> I

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
to the aspect ratio it's set before so I

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.469 
to the aspect ratio it's set before so I
set<00:05:19.210> that<00:05:19.240> lock<00:05:19.810> it<00:05:19.990> back<00:05:21.060> sorry<00:05:22.060> there<00:05:22.240> we<00:05:22.389> go

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
set that lock it back sorry there we go

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.210 
set that lock it back sorry there we go
lock<00:05:22.780> it<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.110> then<00:05:23.349> go<00:05:23.530> to<00:05:23.560> something<00:05:24.099> that

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
lock it and then go to something that

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.089 
lock it and then go to something that
matches<00:05:24.669> my<00:05:24.699> screen<00:05:25.090> size<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:25.800> as<00:05:26.800> we<00:05:26.919> come

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
matches my screen size and as we come

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.820 
matches my screen size and as we come
down<00:05:27.310> you<00:05:28.300> can<00:05:28.330> see<00:05:28.690> that<00:05:28.720> it's<00:05:28.990> it's<00:05:29.380> it's

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
down you can see that it's it's it's

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.850 
down you can see that it's it's it's
already<00:05:30.159> set<00:05:30.340> up<00:05:30.990> all<00:05:31.990> these<00:05:32.320> settings<00:05:32.680> have

already set up all these settings have

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.649 
already set up all these settings have
changed<00:05:32.889> once<00:05:33.520> I<00:05:33.639> told<00:05:33.699> it<00:05:33.970> I<00:05:34.060> wanted<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.389> medium

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
changed once I told it I wanted a medium

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:36.450 
changed once I told it I wanted a medium
rendering<00:05:35.050> so<00:05:35.680> if<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:35.860> come<00:05:36.010> up<00:05:36.130> into<00:05:36.280> say

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
rendering so if I come up into say

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.719 
rendering so if I come up into say
render<00:05:37.020> you<00:05:38.020> can<00:05:38.139> see<00:05:38.349> it's<00:05:38.500> a<00:05:38.650> little<00:05:39.580> bit

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
render you can see it's a little bit

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.180 
render you can see it's a little bit
larger<00:05:40.270> it's<00:05:40.630> definitely<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:41.710> little<00:05:41.919> more

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
larger it's definitely a little more

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.860 
larger it's definitely a little more
clear<00:05:42.610> and<00:05:42.760> it's<00:05:42.909> got<00:05:43.060> this<00:05:43.180> beautiful<00:05:43.360> white

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
clear and it's got this beautiful white

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.810 
clear and it's got this beautiful white
and<00:05:44.110> black<00:05:44.349> volumes<00:05:45.039> where<00:05:45.340> we<00:05:45.520> have<00:05:45.639> no

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
and black volumes where we have no

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.610 
and black volumes where we have no
materials<00:05:46.270> in<00:05:46.389> the<00:05:46.479> scene<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:47.080> water<00:05:47.320> is<00:05:47.590> a

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
materials in the scene the water is a

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.920 
materials in the scene the water is a
big<00:05:47.830> white<00:05:48.009> plane<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:48.610> it's<00:05:49.419> kind<00:05:49.630> of<00:05:49.659> washed

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
big white plane and it's kind of washed

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.580 
big white plane and it's kind of washed
out<00:05:50.370> but<00:05:51.370> it<00:05:51.580> is<00:05:51.759> a<00:05:51.789> huge<00:05:52.000> step<00:05:52.360> of<00:05:52.960> improvement

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
out but it is a huge step of improvement

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.670 
out but it is a huge step of improvement
from<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:53.800> last<00:05:54.039> rendering<00:05:54.630> so<00:05:55.630> what<00:05:56.289> more<00:05:56.500> can

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
from the last rendering so what more can

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.939 
from the last rendering so what more can
we<00:05:56.830> do<00:05:57.180> well<00:05:58.180> one<00:05:58.419> it's<00:05:59.349> a<00:05:59.470> little<00:05:59.590> too<00:05:59.830> bright

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
we do well one it's a little too bright

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.879 
we do well one it's a little too bright
so<00:06:00.280> let's<00:06:00.909> come<00:06:01.090> back<00:06:01.120> up<00:06:01.479> and<00:06:02.259> go<00:06:02.440> to<00:06:02.500> camera

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
so let's come back up and go to camera

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.100 
so let's come back up and go to camera
settings<00:06:03.220> turn<00:06:04.090> on<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:04.389> physical<00:06:04.720> camera

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
settings turn on the physical camera

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.930 
settings turn on the physical camera
right<00:06:05.680> now<00:06:05.710> it's<00:06:05.919> a<00:06:05.979> shutter<00:06:06.190> speed<00:06:06.370> of<00:06:06.580> 30<00:06:06.820> I

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
right now it's a shutter speed of 30 I

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.149 
right now it's a shutter speed of 30 I
think<00:06:07.060> that's<00:06:07.419> pretty<00:06:07.990> low<00:06:08.650> so<00:06:08.919> I'm<00:06:09.009> going<00:06:09.130> to

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
think that's pretty low so I'm going to

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.240 
think that's pretty low so I'm going to
go<00:06:09.250> to<00:06:09.310> 60<00:06:10.289> with<00:06:11.289> the<00:06:11.409> shutter<00:06:11.650> speed<00:06:11.830> it's<00:06:12.099> a

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
go to 60 with the shutter speed it's a

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.830 
go to 60 with the shutter speed it's a
it's<00:06:12.550> it's<00:06:12.669> important<00:06:13.419> to<00:06:13.479> remember<00:06:13.690> that

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
it's it's important to remember that

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.409 
it's it's important to remember that
it's<00:06:14.080> 1<00:06:14.500> divided<00:06:15.190> by<00:06:15.220> whatever<00:06:15.789> you<00:06:15.909> put<00:06:16.240> and

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
it's 1 divided by whatever you put and

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.360 
it's 1 divided by whatever you put and
that's<00:06:16.810> the<00:06:17.020> number<00:06:17.259> of<00:06:17.349> seconds<00:06:17.860> the<00:06:18.009> lens<00:06:18.190> is

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
that's the number of seconds the lens is

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.219 
that's the number of seconds the lens is
open<00:06:18.699> so<00:06:18.849> right<00:06:19.000> now<00:06:19.150> if<00:06:19.270> I<00:06:19.360> have<00:06:19.479> 1<00:06:19.750> divided<00:06:20.169> by

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
open so right now if I have 1 divided by

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.350 
open so right now if I have 1 divided by
60<00:06:20.650> it's<00:06:20.770> a<00:06:20.889> sixtieth<00:06:21.400> of<00:06:21.490> a<00:06:21.610> second<00:06:22.000> the<00:06:22.180> lens

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
60 it's a sixtieth of a second the lens

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.899 
60 it's a sixtieth of a second the lens
is<00:06:22.539> open<00:06:22.810> and<00:06:22.960> closed<00:06:23.169> so<00:06:23.919> you<00:06:24.370> know<00:06:24.460> some

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
is open and closed so you know some

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.810 
is open and closed so you know some
light<00:06:25.150> would<00:06:25.330> get<00:06:25.479> in<00:06:25.630> if<00:06:25.840> I<00:06:25.960> said<00:06:26.310> 500<00:06:27.310> it's<00:06:27.490> 1

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
light would get in if I said 500 it's 1

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.110 
light would get in if I said 500 it's 1
over<00:06:28.060> 500<00:06:28.840> so<00:06:29.349> 1<00:06:29.529> 500th<00:06:30.219> of<00:06:30.310> a<00:06:30.400> second<00:06:30.729> less

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
over 500 so 1 500th of a second less

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.290 
over 500 so 1 500th of a second less
light<00:06:31.389> would<00:06:31.539> get<00:06:31.690> in<00:06:31.810> the<00:06:32.020> image

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
light would get in the image

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.680 
light would get in the image
would<00:06:32.389> be<00:06:32.509> darker<00:06:32.870> so<00:06:33.530> let's<00:06:33.710> try<00:06:33.889> 60<00:06:34.479> I'm<00:06:35.479> also

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
would be darker so let's try 60 I'm also

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.510 
would be darker so let's try 60 I'm also
going<00:06:35.870> to<00:06:35.930> come<00:06:36.110> up<00:06:36.259> in<00:06:36.440> here<00:06:36.500> I'm<00:06:37.310> going<00:06:37.460> to

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
going to come up in here I'm going to

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.360 
going to come up in here I'm going to
add<00:06:37.669> a<00:06:37.699> v-ray<00:06:38.270> infinite<00:06:38.900> plane<00:06:39.199> and<00:06:39.500> by<00:06:40.159> doing

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
add a v-ray infinite plane and by doing

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.760 
add a v-ray infinite plane and by doing
that<00:06:40.610> now<00:06:40.940> my<00:06:41.330> model<00:06:41.750> is<00:06:41.900> sitting<00:06:42.349> on<00:06:42.470> a<00:06:42.500> base

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
that now my model is sitting on a base

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.649 
that now my model is sitting on a base
and<00:06:43.099> I'll<00:06:43.370> be<00:06:43.550> able<00:06:43.639> to<00:06:43.729> get<00:06:43.879> shadows<00:06:44.300> off<00:06:44.479> of

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
and I'll be able to get shadows off of

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.189 
and I'll be able to get shadows off of
it<00:06:44.780> so<00:06:45.770> let's<00:06:45.919> set<00:06:46.099> up<00:06:46.129> another<00:06:46.370> view<00:06:47.199> render

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
it so let's set up another view render

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.010 
it so let's set up another view render
again<00:06:49.150> here<00:06:50.150> you<00:06:50.270> can<00:06:50.389> see<00:06:50.539> the<00:06:50.690> image<00:06:50.900> is

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
again here you can see the image is

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.770 
again here you can see the image is
obviously<00:06:51.620> darker<00:06:52.180> we<00:06:53.180> have<00:06:53.330> what's<00:06:53.569> called

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
obviously darker we have what's called

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.189 
obviously darker we have what's called
vignette<00:06:54.970> against<00:06:55.970> darker<00:06:56.539> and<00:06:56.780> then<00:06:56.840> lighter

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 
vignette against darker and then lighter

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.559 
vignette against darker and then lighter
in<00:06:57.379> the<00:06:57.470> middle<00:06:57.740> and<00:06:58.370> I'm<00:06:58.460> not<00:06:58.610> not<00:06:59.090> a<00:06:59.120> huge<00:06:59.389> fan

00:06:59.559 --> 00:06:59.569 
in the middle and I'm not not a huge fan

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:00.969 
in the middle and I'm not not a huge fan
of<00:06:59.599> that<00:06:59.750> if<00:06:59.930> that's<00:07:00.080> something<00:07:00.349> I<00:07:00.409> wanted<00:07:00.770> I'd

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
of that if that's something I wanted I'd

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.300 
of that if that's something I wanted I'd
do<00:07:01.340> it<00:07:01.460> in<00:07:01.550> Photoshop<00:07:01.930> so<00:07:02.930> it's<00:07:03.530> a<00:07:03.680> little<00:07:04.099> too

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
do it in Photoshop so it's a little too

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.040 
do it in Photoshop so it's a little too
dark<00:07:04.460> so<00:07:05.060> we'll<00:07:05.210> close<00:07:05.360> this<00:07:05.659> we're<00:07:05.900> going<00:07:05.990> to

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
dark so we'll close this we're going to

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.100 
dark so we'll close this we're going to
turn<00:07:06.319> off<00:07:06.500> vignette<00:07:07.389> effect<00:07:08.389> onto<00:07:08.810> what<00:07:09.080> a

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
turn off vignette effect onto what a

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.950 
turn off vignette effect onto what a
preset<00:07:09.620> was<00:07:09.830> just<00:07:10.250> 30<00:07:11.030> will<00:07:11.960> render<00:07:12.319> again

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 
preset was just 30 will render again

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.779 
preset was just 30 will render again
we're<00:07:14.960> starting<00:07:15.259> to<00:07:15.319> get<00:07:15.440> there<00:07:15.620> the<00:07:15.919> actual

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:16.789 
we're starting to get there the actual

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.520 
we're starting to get there the actual
quality<00:07:17.419> of<00:07:17.539> the<00:07:17.690> image<00:07:17.900> is<00:07:18.020> starting<00:07:18.319> to<00:07:18.379> come
