00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
I've created this mini aquarium right

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.819 
I've created this mini aquarium right
here<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.180> show<00:00:42.210> off<00:00:42.450> each<00:00:42.899> one<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> corals

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
here to show off each one of the corals

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.520 
here to show off each one of the corals
there's<00:00:44.250> six<00:00:44.520> different<00:00:44.579> types<00:00:45.059> green<00:00:45.719> pink

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
there's six different types green pink

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.729 
there's six different types green pink
purple<00:00:46.800> blue<00:00:47.789> orange<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.450> brown<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.989> some<00:00:49.620> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
purple blue orange and brown and some of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.470 
purple blue orange and brown and some of
which<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.160> interesting<00:00:50.730> aspects<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.360> them

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
which have interesting aspects to them

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.810 
which have interesting aspects to them
for<00:00:51.719> example<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.230> green<00:00:52.469> coral<00:00:52.890> acts<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
for example this green coral acts like a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
for example this green coral acts like a
mini<00:00:54.120> whirlpool<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.289> too<00:00:55.440> close<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
mini whirlpool so if I get too close to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
mini whirlpool so if I get too close to
it<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.010> kind<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.399> drags<00:00:56.699> me<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.210> lays

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
it it kind of just drags me in and lays

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.240 
it it kind of just drags me in and lays
me<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> center<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.770> try<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.010> fight

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
me in the center and if I try and fight

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
me in the center and if I try and fight
it<00:00:59.460> I'll<00:00:59.820> pull<00:01:00.000> me<00:01:00.090> back<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.930> can't

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
it I'll pull me back in but you can't

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.910 
it I'll pull me back in but you can't
fight<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> current<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.129> escape<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.960> also<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
fight the current and escape it also the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.910 
fight the current and escape it also the
brown<00:01:05.400> one<00:01:05.670> has<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.180> cactus<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:06.930> effect<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.710> if

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
brown one has a cactus like effect so if

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.890 
brown one has a cactus like effect so if
I<00:01:08.070> were<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:09.090> back<00:01:09.299> into<00:01:09.510> survival<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
I were to just go back into survival and

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.300 
I were to just go back into survival and
yeah<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.110> kind<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.350> hurts<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> does<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
yeah it kind of hurts you and it does a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.160 
yeah it kind of hurts you and it does a
significant<00:01:15.119> amount<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.390> damage<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:15.780> think<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
significant amount of damage so think of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.010 
significant amount of damage so think of
it<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.380> an<00:01:16.500> underwater<00:01:16.860> cactus<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.810> let's

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it like an underwater cactus but let's

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.700 
it like an underwater cactus but let's
just<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.530> back<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> creative<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.380> this<00:01:22.380> blue

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
just go back to creative and this blue

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.499 
just go back to creative and this blue
one<00:01:22.740> over<00:01:23.189> here<00:01:23.460> actually<00:01:23.909> lights<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
one over here actually lights up the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.450 
one over here actually lights up the
ocean<00:01:24.869> floor<00:01:25.170> which<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.560> why<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.770> see<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.280> so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
ocean floor which is why you see it's so

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.170 
ocean floor which is why you see it's so
