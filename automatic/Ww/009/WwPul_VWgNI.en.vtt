00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 so there is a little update regarding 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.240
 the gold 7 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.560
 There are but we are diligently on the test 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.690
 she knows this level here 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.240
 there come on good 290 the series 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.400
 Turbocharger is her mother really is 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.139
 a horny part results in a technical 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.359
 thing still to explain and that the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.130
 wakeskater usually a part 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.100
 massive under pressure is controlled 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.050
 no star was under pressure 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.490
 then all depends if long clear yet 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.460
 come on it comes pressure on it and then 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.630
 i shoot this rod this way 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.450
 shut down here 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.640
 then it opens and closes at 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.469
 I feel like this is always one 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.690
 electric power engine happens that 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.340
 means we have no problem of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.989
 exhaust has too much power and the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.329
 exhausts on presses because the thing has 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.559
 really a lot of booms the engine was 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.690
 just do not hear a bit like he is 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.190
 that this exhaust gas is here the exhaust 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.739
 housing is very very narrow and you 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.260
 does not really come, I'll say one 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.940
 bums area so pumps with pumps we 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.550
 were working with the box together 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.019
 The limit is very good at 290 ps 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.610
 every case reached with the camp all 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.970
 other cards noveski do that is that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.090
 classic basecape can do just that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.520
 same position is installed exactly the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.320
 the same position as here and 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.060
 come on it through the loud 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.509
 he pushes this on and thus regulates 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 so to speak, if the thing goes 12 bar then 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.020
 regulates this dose that in the modern 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.810
 version an electric motor now we have 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.030
 in front of the problem who do I come in 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.479
 Performance of me and after 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.479
 not satisfied with you 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:49.350
 the color was an idea of ​​mine i have 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.610
 I thought the charge can endure 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.680
 and we also have big differences 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.720
 that's just green now and we are 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.539
 call this the half level we come with 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.630
 this level on good 360 ps in golf 7 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.539
 gti we are still in the test phase 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.600
 At the moment everything is still a bit 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.160
 tiki tiki all because I know that as 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.319
 giant theme of the lada is modified 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.549
 foreground basis it is an audi s3 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.680
 unfortunately this box was very very 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.380
 important because we are using the box for this 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.390
 The configuration was enough 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.980
 got sprit in the engine room 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.660
 but the magna hold up and where and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.220
 have tried this camp because that 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.700
 Air volume is just a lot 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.340
 higher 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.750
 with the box the 3 channel box we can 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.400
 now also increase the space and 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.410
 can thus inject more in the engine 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.480
 get in and we will not go in 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.190
 As dangerous are under control of the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.680
 motor runs nicely fat or runs in 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.060
 right air gasoline mixture and we 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.959
 Develop accordingly has performance 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.609
 certainly I have not yet priced 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.079
 I thought I wanted it now small update 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.400
 Regarding golf, see what 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.660
 bit mute because we did that 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.989
 long since long 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.760
 test a long long time and I want 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:02.120
 test it a long time before it's up to you 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.120
 get out the update will be installed
