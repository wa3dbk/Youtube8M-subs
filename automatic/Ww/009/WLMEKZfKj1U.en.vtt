00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.680
 in a letter from Maria 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.580
 we pick up at the postal service 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.950
 we bring the letters in the office and 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.710
 come but quantity of letters about 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.289
 everything in December then what 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.570
 we do is separate by projects there 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.000
 communities in which are those of 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.690
 the saws are mostly four 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.969
 hours two hours not many of the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.870
 people responsible for links 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.600
 have to take for example my bag 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.999
 because there in that area there are no drawings 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.820
 car that goes through the route and take that 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:52.609
 jar that is route to get to 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.570
 certain of the rainy seasons is 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.930
 terrible because 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.880
 the poor sometimes have to walk 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.180
 they walk suddenly in the heights 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.440
 still and also to one or two hours for 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.440
 reach the communities 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.260
 many times I have to go on a motorcycle 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.050
 and many times you also have to go 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.290
 walking the collection we do it with 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.900
 all the children of the infection us 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.080
 What we want is that each collection 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.560
 be a party a joy for the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.540
 Boys 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.540
 we are living 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.830
 in this part from very small 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.840
 they started having friends and it was a 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.660
 moment to motivate them that we have 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.580
 that learning to write letters does not stop 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.340
 in the letters they express their 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.940
 feelings joys your dreams your 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.330
 illusions and the friends answer these 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.330
 letters 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.500
 or not 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.610
 She says I'm Maria, she likes to play 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:17.940
 volleyball and I would like to do 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.870
 is to take care of cows and open the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.870
 backpack I do not know 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:39.630
 of Spain and the community as that year 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:41.500
 that comes when you receive for example 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.440
 correspondence and there is no correspondence 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.830
 for everyone because that is always missing 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.650
 what they do is also read the letters 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.470
 that a our section of the brief kitu 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.890
 receive correspondence from spain this 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.900
 where strategy work to do 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.300
 all message collection is not 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.580
 only the fact that you go from 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.070
 good kids we are here and I already draw no 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.520
 it's a job and a process that you have to 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.250
 do it with them we have us in 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.370
 peru 20,000 members but those 20,000 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.350
 partners write and 10 percent to the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.300
 kids look we've had cases in the 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.760
 which children when we collect 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.860
 we are going to collect and do not want to draw 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.290
 because it says that we are 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.540
 lying and your friend does not exist that already 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.490
 several times the writing and he does not want 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.040
 write it I know what it is 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.620
 They are very busy but do not stop 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.590
 write to the children because they 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.130
 is very excited to receive a postcard or 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.130
 a card
