00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.610
 nissan frontier with us he is known by 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.830
 named nissan navara serious pickup 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.630
 SUV in what his shoes so 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.790
 get maximum driving pleasure 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.940
 on this car on the road 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.190
 we found seven models of different class tires 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.260
 from terrain that is mud tires 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.600
 intended to move on seriously 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.059
 off road and went to the us state 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.730
 texas in any continental company 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.430
 why here why not with us in the mud we 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.350
 going to flounder and in this 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.030
 arid place where rain is 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 several times a year yes because here 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.650
 there is a unique assessment method 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.309
 traction properties of tires on different surfaces 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.440
 on sand on mud on stones we will 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.070
 make special measurements that 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.019
 will allow 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.570
 objectively assess the traction capabilities 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.700
 these offroad tires are the very first 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.740
 exercise is comfort evaluation 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.990
 we drive on a special track with 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.840
 irregularities and see how tires 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.750
 affect the comfort of the car and most importantly 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.539
 we estimate the noise speed of 50 miles per hour 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 there is it about 80 kilometers per hour not 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.659
 I know how the microphone transmits but very 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.579
 OK 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.219
 my ear I hear that it is undermining 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.109
 aching component of the noise that give 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.770
 tires that is not aerodynamics not 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.780
 engine main tire noise of course 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.149
 tracks humps 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.600
 potholes and special battens allow 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.270
 estimate 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.429
 smooth running car but there say 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.039
 here are these tires set number five from us 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.770
 You are installed without even knowing which tires 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.299
 evaluation goes blind they are a little softer 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.520
 than previous ones ie go by 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.619
 irregularities on them better smoother 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.030
 respectively in the final assessment 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.030
 it will be taken into account 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.390
 regular exercise is the inhibition of 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.420
 speeds of 100 kilometers per hour on dry 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.420
 asphalt 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.680
 I accelerate to a speed of one hundred and ten 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.430
 kilometers per hour speed is controlled 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.430
 on the instrument 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:54.100
 I press the start button of measurements I go out to 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:58.870
 test section braking distance 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.930
 is 41 and fourteen hundredths 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.640
 meter braking on wet pavement 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.040
 speed of 80 kilometers per hour 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.350
 performed on a vehicle equipped 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.750
 special guide bar which 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.480
 ties it to the guide rail 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.910
 this is done to ensure that all races 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.340
 performed on the same track 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:29.380
 shift left-right 20-30 centimeters 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:32.380
 gives a different result and now test 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.840
 in the mud only the rear wheels change 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.910
 toyota tacoma car such 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.420
 old little car but it will help us 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.120
 estimate 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.720
 tire grip on dirt 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.720
 coating 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.150
 measure acceleration time 5 to 17 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.090
 kilometers per hour is enough to 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.519
 evaluate the traction capabilities of various 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.519
 wheels than on this cover 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.400
 another exercise this assessment 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.099
 manageability on a dirt top 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.110
 almost rally ext thing here 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.060
 there is an estimate of time because 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.570
 car on the car set up 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.760
 timer 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.300
 but plus there is still an expert assessment 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.139
 how easy is it to drive a car 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.360
 this mode 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.250
 Well, incidentally, by the way, we still see what 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.760
 there will be tires after such 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.740
 ride 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.740
 whether there will be a destruction of the tread 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.000
 gravel pull measurement 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.760
 coated car moves with 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.760
 speed of 7 kilometers per hour I step 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:48.030
 on the gas pedal gently stepping on the floor 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.880
 and equipment 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:05:00.030
 records pulling force in the range 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:05:01.200
 slip from 15 to 75 percent this 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:09.180
 check in 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:11.070
 about 16 20 times and then after processing 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.090
 results we will see which tires are better 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.910
 rowing on gravel we finish our tires 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.880
 test in a very unusual way on this 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.400
 times a crossbow is prepared in the distance 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.140
 somewhere around 20 meters all tires are exposed 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.270
 and we are trying to shoot them why is it 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.870
 you need very often go through the woods on such 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.030
 cars shod with such tires and complain 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.530
 the fact that sharp bitches pierce 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.260
 so now let's see 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:43.740
 how easy it is to beat one or another 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.230
 tire arrow crossbow my shot this 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.930
 bus was second 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:51.180
 first shot in general then a specialist here 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.570
 but I generally disappeared quite well 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.360
 heap turned out well, and the output arrows on 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.500
 second shot, he is certainly smaller 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.720
 since another was used 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.290
 the tip of our test goes over 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.290
 sharp tip
