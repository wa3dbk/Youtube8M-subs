difference<00:03:39.650> between<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:40.129> train<00:03:40.400> in<00:03:40.609> this

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
difference between the train in this

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.640 
difference between the train in this
experiment<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.599> the<00:03:41.690> motor<00:03:42.139> we<00:03:42.319> made<00:03:42.470> in<00:03:42.590> a

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
experiment and the motor we made in a

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.740 
experiment and the motor we made in a
previous<00:03:42.829> episode<00:03:43.129> the<00:03:43.849> Train<00:03:44.150> uses<00:03:44.569> the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
previous episode the Train uses the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.990 
previous episode the Train uses the
magnetic<00:03:45.169> field<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.709> a<00:03:45.919> current<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.730> push

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
magnetic field of a current to push

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.599 
magnetic field of a current to push
magnets<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.169> motor<00:03:48.410> uses<00:03:49.099> the<00:03:49.190> magnetic

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
magnets and the motor uses the magnetic

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.270 
magnets and the motor uses the magnetic
field<00:03:49.910> of<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.209> magnet<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.810> push<00:03:51.230> electrons<00:03:51.620> or

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
field of a magnet to push electrons or

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.479 
field of a magnet to push electrons or
electrical<00:03:53.000> current<00:03:53.419> moving<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.169> wire<00:03:54.489> well

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
electrical current moving a wire well

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.250 
electrical current moving a wire well
that's<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:55.970> for<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.299> simplest<00:03:56.750> electric

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
that's it for the simplest electric

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.110 
that's it for the simplest electric
