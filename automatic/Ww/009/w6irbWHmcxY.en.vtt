00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
gas was on the coast last time I went

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.060 
gas was on the coast last time I went
it's<00:04:58.370> 544<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.150> gallon<00:04:59.570> and<00:05:00.170> that<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.680> was<00:05:00.830> when

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
it's 544 a gallon and that that was when

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.120 
it's 544 a gallon and that that was when
gas<00:05:01.250> was<00:05:01.280> cheaper<00:05:02.080> so<00:05:03.080> fill<00:05:03.350> up<00:05:03.500> there<00:05:03.770> like

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
gas was cheaper so fill up there like

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.050 
gas was cheaper so fill up there like
probably<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:05.650> like<00:05:06.650> this<00:05:06.860> tank<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.850> tank

up<00:05:08.480> top<00:05:08.750> just<00:05:09.110> to<00:05:09.950> try<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.390> keep<00:05:11.390> from<00:05:11.630> getting

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
up top just to try and keep from getting

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.650 
up top just to try and keep from getting
gas<00:05:12.170> up<00:05:12.500> there<00:05:12.740> because<00:05:12.920> it<00:05:13.220> is<00:05:13.370> super<00:05:13.940> super

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
gas up there because it is super super

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.150 
gas up there because it is super super
expensive<00:05:15.250> but<00:05:16.250> uh

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
expensive but uh

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.590
