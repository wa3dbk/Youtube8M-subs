00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.150 

the<00:00:02.520> reason<00:00:02.939> I'm<00:00:03.030> at<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.330> cockeyed<00:00:03.780> angle<00:00:04.259> is

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
the reason I'm at this cockeyed angle is

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.880 
the reason I'm at this cockeyed angle is
that<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:05.609> are<00:00:05.640> at<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:07.020> spot<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.589> needles

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
that we are at the spot on the needles

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.629 
that we are at the spot on the needles
highway<00:00:08.099> just<00:00:08.550> maybe<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.599> mile<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.550> where<00:00:11.550> it

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
highway just maybe a mile in where it

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.290 
highway just maybe a mile in where it
goes<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.650> one-lane<00:00:15.529> stone<00:00:16.529> tunnel<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
goes to a one-lane stone tunnel and a

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.760 
goes to a one-lane stone tunnel and a
charter<00:00:18.690> bus<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.050> trying<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.410> get<00:00:19.560> through

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
charter bus is trying to get through

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.929 
charter bus is trying to get through
here<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:21.060> just<00:00:21.090> had<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.600> get<00:00:21.869> video<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.260> this

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
here and I just had to get video of this

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.420 
here and I just had to get video of this
because<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:25.050> can't<00:00:25.590> imagine<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.099> thing<00:00:26.310> is

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
because I I can't imagine this thing is

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.710 
because I I can't imagine this thing is
going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.609> make<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.789> through<00:00:27.029> here

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:48.110

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.470 

and<00:00:48.719> even<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.140> he<00:00:49.260> gets<00:00:49.500> through<00:00:50.120> this<00:00:51.120> route

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and even if he gets through this route

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.799 
and even if he gets through this route
is<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.050> wine<00:00:52.410> d<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.790> i<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.540> commenting

on<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.290> way<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:56.910> i<00:00:56.940> can't<00:00:57.300> imagine

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
on the way up here that i can't imagine

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.759 
on the way up here that i can't imagine
a<00:00:57.750> charter<00:00:58.079> bus<00:00:58.170> coming<00:00:58.410> through<00:00:58.649> here

a charter bus coming through here

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.100 
a charter bus coming through here

these<00:01:01.589> hairpin<00:01:02.040> turns<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:03.390> near<00:01:03.719> hairpin

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.090
