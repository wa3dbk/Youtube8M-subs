00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:35.430

 today is a chicken breast or two breasts 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.309
 Preparing chicken we'll have to see there 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.930
 season the first chicken in a chicken 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.650
 let cool 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.560

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.610
 [Music] 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.409
 What we in a little more than saves 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.400
 it 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:30.290
 You let it boil a little to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.390
 then mix the other ingredients 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:40.880
 after you left without seeing a 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:46.820
 little enough to taste 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:53.180
 Now let's add the ingredients 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.180
 Let's add the and via 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:09.960
 the middle kiss the green corn and let's go 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.960
 add milk 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.250
 I'll add the liter of milk because 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.040
 I'm going to do very very very much 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.160
 but if you do not do much you just boot 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:34.440
 half the milk shows all the trash the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.440
 I'm going to do a lot and let's play 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.800
 enough to mix the ingredients 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:55.810
 we will put the wheat flour or the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:00.970
 But how do you have to have a 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.519
 creamy consistency you taste if you have 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.060
 missing something adds can 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.660
 give more goals in this mouth have photo on 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.489
 salt adds a little 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.630
 You mess things up that you do not want to stay. 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:23.140
 with're sweepstake 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.070
 and you'll fiddle with china until you solve 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.070
 whole mass 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.580
 you can also develop first the 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.190
 mass and then put you can hit 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.060
 in the blender with the milk in the dough 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.830
 that will make it easier too, you will not 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.380
 have the job of undoing 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.690
 pasta dough 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.720
 if you pass the blender with the 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.720
 milk 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:04.740
 and you mess up the point is the 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:09.810
 important is that it does not get too thick 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:15.080
 not too thin and does not 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.080
 these dumplings in cake batter 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:27.960
 the cream is great and stirring well 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.570
 to obtain a homogeneous mixture and this 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.380
 ready our chicken cream is well 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:39.330
 simple to do 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:41.610
