00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.340
 like you 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.279
 how are you and well, well, welcome 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.930
 to this new video gameplay 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.880
 3 to talk to you about new ones 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.320
 screenshots that's how people have us 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
 showed new exquisite near 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.740
 revolution you know what good after 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.360
 the output of chiswick so now that 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.680
 have been quite active in the 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.180
 question of skis jones and good 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.160
 Well , they are going to show us some writings 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.680
 precisely from zizou and which good 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.940
 I like it a lot, I really like it 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.860
 who are showing 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.750
 currently we already know the date of 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.300
 exit so good is not like that anymore 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.769
 that we have a question about why 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.600
 they are taking out so much said because 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.430
 It is so far out of the game and 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.530
 you know it's for September then 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.000
 good people are showing us judgments 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.549
 of zizou and now it's very important 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.890
 because they also show us what's coming 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.110
 being animation show us how well 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.809
 saying in the anime how could 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.339
 to be called that way they are using it anime what 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.840
 which tells us that good is also going to 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.320
 see involved and sub and what's coming 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.640
 being this part currently in naruto 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.770
 just passed a part of filling 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.600
 where is the spell and then I do not know 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.340
 How much will I have to see right now? 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.140
 that is being that part with what 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.369
 they will show us is very important 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.530
 good for people who are a bit 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.119
 interested in the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.590
 So, well, now that they are given 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.299
 a tour of the series if it does not 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.830
 they have seen they are not seeing him because 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.049
 Well, apparently it's going to have some 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.210
 ligature what people have to see and 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.220
 that image that sounds like a lot to me 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.229
 what we already saw in the series or at least 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.479
 what I saw in the series sounds a lot to me 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.890
 not then in that case good for 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.869
 the people who do not follow it I think they go 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.430
 to have to give him nothing if not a 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.740
 a review of what has been such 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.810
 sometime some summary of the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.700
 chapters or something like that because if not such 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.380
 time if they are going to confuse ok then 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.090
 well let's go with what we start 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.160
 the elections people are very important 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.960
 also take into consideration the 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.720
 fact that apparently it's going to have 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.159
 some kind of special pretty 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.630
 pig this joke 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.220
 so good to start these are my 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.289
 money judgments you those that in fact 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.420
 I do not know why they were added there 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.190
 it's been and hard but good 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.800
 because apparently we add these there and 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.900
 well that part that part especially I 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.120
 it sounds like you have to see that 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.100
 image of the supposedly I'm going to be 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 that will be your special will be yours 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.519
 carry and well then there maybe an attack 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.290
 in a team with what has been 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.820
 this one and touch and how good it seems 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.620
 It's also going to be the team with the 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.520
 you will be able to form as such and 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.200
 that some specialty 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.210
 and you know how good the last youtube 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.530
 it is quite important in this 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.390
 delivery and well apparently I think that 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.250
 yes I went up and hitachi are going to have a 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.020
 sort of and I think a kind of 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.540
 attack as well as what will have anything things 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.860
 that and sakura well then there will be and so 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.870
 now yes that characters with names 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.580
 specials in teams that will have the 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.230
 put a special attack I do not know that 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.910
 they were few discounts for what they 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.980
 I showed on video but well, that's how it is 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.780
 that showed us little but good 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.040
 quality another important thing that I get 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.560
 forgot to mention is people is that the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.630
 game is already signed to cost 50 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.100
 dollars like this is already signed to cost 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.500
 50 dollars say that new games 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.210
 they cost 60 probably the game arrives 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.790
 at a reduced price here in mexico such 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.380
 once 750 pesos , which is the truth 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.610
 that would be pretty good since good 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.040
 well we know that the economy is not 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.690
 expired and good that already games cost a 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.370
 little bit less because it comes quite 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.050
 well then good people do not forget 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.180
 leave your like if you liked sharing it 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.840
 with your friends and well, me 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.840
 dismissal see you next
