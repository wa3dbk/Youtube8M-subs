00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.520 
ponytail but i'm going to leave the ends
out<00:00:38.510> in<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.050> front<00:00:43.180> ok<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:44.539> now<00:00:44.750> i<00:00:44.809> have<00:00:44.899> this

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
out in the front ok so now i have this

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.860 
out in the front ok so now i have this
fantastic<00:00:45.949> bun<00:00:46.460> hell<00:00:47.030> maybe<00:00:47.269> i'll<00:00:47.480> just<00:00:47.629> go<00:00:47.780> to

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
fantastic bun hell maybe i'll just go to

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.420 
fantastic bun hell maybe i'll just go to
a<00:00:47.899> grocery<00:00:48.079> store<00:00:48.230> like<00:00:48.590> that<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.399> next

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
a grocery store like that so the next

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.319 
a grocery store like that so the next
step<00:00:49.730> then<00:00:50.030> is<00:00:50.090> to<00:00:50.890> separate<00:00:51.890> out<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.730> bun<00:00:52.969> in

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
step then is to separate out the bun in

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.450 
step then is to separate out the bun in
half<00:00:54.850> so<00:00:55.850> these<00:00:56.059> are<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.359> sides<00:00:57.079> of<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:58.280> bow

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
half so these are the sides of the bow

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.150 
half so these are the sides of the bow
and<00:00:58.760> then<00:00:59.269> you<00:00:59.390> take<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.989> ends<00:01:00.980> that<00:01:01.129> are

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
and then you take the ends that are

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.710 
and then you take the ends that are
sticking<00:01:01.460> out<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.230> pull<00:01:03.230> them<00:01:03.320> back<00:01:04.720> like

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
sticking out and pull them back like

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.180 
sticking out and pull them back like
that<00:01:07.270> stick<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.630> there<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.050> then<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:09.710> pin

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
that stick it in there and then you pin

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.660 
that stick it in there and then you pin
this<00:01:10.670> down<00:01:11.440> but<00:01:12.440> I<00:01:12.560> guess<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:12.890> need<00:01:13.070> pins<00:01:13.370> for

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
this down but I guess I need pins for

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.180 
this down but I guess I need pins for
that<00:01:13.820> huh<00:01:14.000> those<00:01:14.840> pins<00:01:15.320> pins<00:01:16.060> pins

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.280
