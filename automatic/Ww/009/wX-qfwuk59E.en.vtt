00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.840
 is something compared to what you feel in each series b 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.370
 she is different because of the free fall 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.469
 the speed is much higher 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.439
 is with much more event pressure on the face 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.759
 But there's something similar at the time you're in the cab. 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.320
 paragliding to be able to do some maneuvering 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.570
 if it began in you also that event in the face you see that the celta gamboa 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.570
 city â€‹â€‹center 50 60 km per hour 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.229
 but it's very different 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.190
 who counted for this act after it was 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.960
 if it was not so I asked to make the landing to notice that summed up 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.660
 to the proof of enem 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.060
 Paulo 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.460
 gopal shows when addressing the opportunity 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.500
 but open the magistrate o csa the others are 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.170
 It's how you preside. 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.670
 I can not more closed the football the paragliding 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.250
 so the beads are thinner the thinner profile that is to 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.910
 have more aerodynamics and more flag action then again did 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.600
 for that you pay with effect leftover 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.890
 the opening of the bag are safe not to have feelings all fights 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.530
 are larger and even a safer and quieter plot 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.630
 all this has to do with performance 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.820
 to that of teams such as paragliding is one reason is the following 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.500
 then this is going influence influence of the well the teacher was paragliding him 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.920
 fall back easier main but I do then 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.659
 it was developed with the people 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.220
 it would affect pro-saw 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.220
 same speed 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.310
 for people's hairstyles squalor claims we know of our rainfall autarchy rui 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.430
 the bend of Brazil very discreet 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 the prize can yield high-level 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.470
 How often do you have access for those who need it 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.480
 bobbio physically until today never needed to use soda is in training 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.570
 the world championship 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.610
 you'll probably have enough aggressiveness to do it 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.339
 several maneuvers and consequently sometimes and in one of them can follow 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:12.639
 I need to play it so extra trips are supernormal so in training 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:16.759
 it is normal to agree that the paragliding equipment is much quieter 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:18.649
 much simpler, right? 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:22.629
 are Luis - titles down here either I think a title said the new 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:23.500
 technician of the year 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.089
 it's not that I do not know 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:29.369
 and are three points and not the riga and and two in the leg and here retired in 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.999
 a little london home situation 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.169
 quiet 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.579
 Are you feeling comfortable? 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.129
 I totally trust the gallery 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.550
 they will have fun 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.550
 in this race now is time 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 Barbarian 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.649
 How was he on duty? 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:11.909
 of reference veiled the battle 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.909
 this news for me 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.749
 we can look at the latter with the people 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.749
 very interesting because for my new experience back-walking 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:38.739
 in the end 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.939
 feather water it can not cure patients 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.339
 even after healing cure 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:47.329
 very different so that the 2 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.329
 it's another sensation 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.879
 mubarak and then roberto s person 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.259
 we have to achieve 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.020
 then suddenly until then 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.450
 a new medical modality suddenly he leaves early for him to dispute 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.059
 5:30 p.m. 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.409
 is after it was opened about seven months to sail 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.100
 he spent the day on the go at supper 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.330
 you way for sure the internal pressure in the parachute it tells that the 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.900
 higher quotas that had the greatest involvement and more than the daily 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.129
 hospitalization 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.099
 the pressure that was paid on the closed fashion tv so that you choose a place that I 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.869
 step and more and requires more active and parachute 

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:29.740
 good exchange of experiences of the two sports I sure hope people 

00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:34.719
 can see and share but these moments of double jump are mothers 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.719
 different super cool country 

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:41.549
 and this is it 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.229
 as
