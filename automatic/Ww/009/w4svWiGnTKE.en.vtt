through<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.440> hot<00:00:41.340> box<00:00:41.760> can't<00:00:42.030> trick<00:00:42.270> me

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980

all right so get that off and this is

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.860 
all right so get that off and this is
tighter<00:00:47.640> than<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.450> not<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.379> more<00:00:50.870> so

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
tighter than a of not going that more so

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.500 
tighter than a of not going that more so
i<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> package<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.300> look<00:00:54.300> at<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
i like the package you know look at it

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.869 
i like the package you know look at it
says<00:00:54.660> droid<00:00:54.870> DNA<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:56.219> actually<00:00:56.670> feels

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
says droid DNA this actually feels

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.510
