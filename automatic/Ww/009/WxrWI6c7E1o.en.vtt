00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.190
 slightly lightened with the concealer 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:59.160

 Apply brother with a pad 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.410
 the eyebrows are with the pen 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:19.180
 flexi reinforced in color and with the 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:21.400
 brushing in shape I show you 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.190
 now a great tip as you yours 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.290
 optimally strengthen eyebrows and 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.900
 You can emphasize that 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.140
 Just put a brush or adjust it 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.320
 straight to hand then found on the outside 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.990
 at the nostrils 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.610
 the pen or brush will go up to the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.490
 inner eye angles 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.780
 and that's where the first point is 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.520
 where the eyes should start grief 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.170
 in the next step I'll show you the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.580
 last point of the eyebrow 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.640
 this remains the outer nostril 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.909
 Turn the pen in the direction of the outside 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.490
 canthus 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.159
 and this is exactly where your last one should be 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.229
 point be of women 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.289
 to the highest point of the also brown too 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.019

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.099
 may combine with each 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.720
 for the optimal course for this 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.269
 make-up I choose a lash line 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.299
 Compaction that gives the eye a lot 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.879
 expression is with the eyeliner 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.569
