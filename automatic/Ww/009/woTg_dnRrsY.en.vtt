00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 clear announcements are important 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.410
 welcome there are so small words the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.670
 we use but little 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.950
 to pay attention to 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.929
 a very important word is here 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.820
 not because as we it on in everyday life 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.590
 use for example and vadt live 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.359
 with children or with the partner at 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.150
 friends if you do not say that then 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.279
 I do not want you to do that 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.470
 do not say and then there is a whole 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.039
 series connected to the man 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.619
 are 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.480
 but we seldom say what we do 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.219
 actually want the same but also 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.469
 In professional life how often is there said 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.020
 not to do that instead of one 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.730
 giving instructions on what to do 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.500
 Here it is interesting what happens 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.879
 actually in our brain that is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 if I say it now, for example 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.329
 Do not think about a pink 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.100
 Elephant with blue ears and one 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.160
 marigold with a red 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.379
 bow to what you see exactly this 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.260
 elephants although I did not say so 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.750
 And that's how it often happens in our everyday lives 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.090
 if we give instructions what not 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.850
 we are focused on doing that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.740
 what does not come after that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.650
 It would be here especially important to 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 Think about what I want instead 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.970
 maybe I would like to say that briefly 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.770
 not on instead please and on it 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.900
 then focus on that then it has 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.920
 Brain also a picture of what he is then 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.320
 can focus 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.509
 and it sounds so banal and so easy 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.790
 but work the same way 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.590
 Therefore, be attentive in everyday life 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.780
 How often do you not use the word? 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.009
 I am very curious what experiences 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.479
 collect it in everyday life 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.310
 the little one is very nice 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.409
 practical with big impact 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.720
 and brought to the point is the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.040
 do not replace that with what's on 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.380
 should happen instead 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.729
