wouldn't be able to cook it all in the
Sun<00:00:37.950> Oven<00:00:38.160> maybe<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.969> warm<00:00:39.270> something<00:00:39.600> but

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
Sun Oven maybe just warm something but

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
they didn't Brown as much as if I would

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.680 
they didn't Brown as much as if I would
have<00:00:44.610> cooked<00:00:44.789> him<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> traditional<00:00:45.570> oven

have cooked him in a traditional oven

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.000 
have cooked him in a traditional oven
but<00:00:45.960> if<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.200> would<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.500> brushed<00:00:46.800> them<00:00:46.980> with

milk<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:47.460> water<00:00:47.700> they<00:00:47.910> would<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.629> just

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.990

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.910 
in so it did brown up a little bit on
the<00:03:08.090> top<00:03:08.299> which<00:03:08.569> looks<00:03:08.780> really<00:03:09.019> good<00:03:09.170> but<00:03:09.409> the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
the top which looks really good but the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.640 
the top which looks really good but the
underneath<00:03:10.370> side<00:03:10.579> is<00:03:10.940> not<00:03:11.299> Brown<00:03:11.569> at<00:03:11.750> all<00:03:11.930> but

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
underneath side is not Brown at all but

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.199 
underneath side is not Brown at all but
that<00:03:12.829> doesn't<00:03:13.159> really<00:03:13.220> matter<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.849> me<00:03:13.879> that's

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
that doesn't really matter to me that's

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.569 
that doesn't really matter to me that's
really<00:03:14.510> just<00:03:15.079> aesthetics<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:16.010> have<00:03:16.280> all<00:03:16.430> the

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
really just aesthetics to have all the

really just aesthetics to have all the
meat<00:03:16.760> browned<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.269> can<00:03:17.359> see<00:03:17.510> where<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.870> top

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
meat browned you can see where the top

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.379 
meat browned you can see where the top
the<00:03:18.620> thin<00:03:18.799> layer<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.130> fat<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.549> brown<00:03:19.880> Andy<00:03:20.209> and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
the underneath side is just cooked but

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.740 
the underneath side is just cooked but
not<00:03:22.069> brown<00:03:22.400> you<00:03:22.880> get<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.030> better<00:03:23.269> shot<00:03:23.599> of<00:03:23.720> that

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
not brown you get a better shot of that

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.470 
not brown you get a better shot of that
bone<00:03:24.169> poking<00:03:25.040> out<00:03:25.220> there<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.579> you<00:03:25.669> know<00:03:25.849> when

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
bone poking out there and you know when

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.210 
bone poking out there and you know when
the<00:03:26.569> meat<00:03:26.780> pulls<00:03:27.139> away<00:03:27.349> from<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.739> bone<00:03:27.980> like

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
the meat pulls away from the bone like

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.360 
the meat pulls away from the bone like
that<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.669> is<00:03:28.819> done<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.419> it's<00:03:29.599> usually<00:03:29.840> very

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
that it is done and it's usually very

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.250 
that it is done and it's usually very
tender<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.730> can<00:03:31.760> also<00:03:32.060> see<00:03:32.510> in<00:03:32.629> the<00:03:32.720> bottom<00:03:33.079> of

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
tender you can also see in the bottom of

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.470 
tender you can also see in the bottom of
this<00:03:33.410> pot<00:03:33.709> all<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.489> juice<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:35.269> meat

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
this pot all of the juice that the meat

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.080 
this pot all of the juice that the meat
rendered<00:03:36.470> up<00:03:36.620> of<00:03:36.859> course<00:03:37.099> meat<00:03:37.669> didn't<00:03:37.910> always

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
rendered up of course meat didn't always

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.879 
rendered up of course meat didn't always
render<00:03:38.540> up<00:03:38.720> like<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.109> but<00:03:39.319> they<00:03:39.440> inject

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
render up like that but they inject

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.280 
render up like that but they inject
water<00:03:40.549> into<00:03:41.000> our<00:03:41.120> meat<00:03:41.359> so<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:41.989> they<00:03:42.109> can

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
water into our meat so that they can

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.339 
water into our meat so that they can
have<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:42.859> higher<00:03:43.129> profit<00:03:43.430> margin<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:44.900> anyway

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
have a higher profit margin so anyway

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.780 
have a higher profit margin so anyway
there's<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.769> juice<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:46.340> could<00:03:46.609> have

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
there's the juice and I could have

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.610 
there's the juice and I could have
strained<00:03:47.480> off<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.900> little<00:03:48.049> bit<00:03:48.199> of<00:03:48.290> fat<00:03:48.440> that

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
strained off the little bit of fat that

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.319 
strained off the little bit of fat that
was<00:03:48.709> there<00:03:48.949> and<00:03:49.099> made<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.310> thick<00:03:49.639> gravy<00:03:49.849> I<00:03:50.000> just

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
was there and made a thick gravy I just

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.819 
was there and made a thick gravy I just
didn't<00:03:50.599> this<00:03:50.690> time<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.959> saved<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.410> juice<00:03:51.650> and

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
didn't this time I saved the juice and

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.890 
didn't this time I saved the juice and
used<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.129> for<00:03:52.310> something<00:03:52.489> else<00:03:52.790> but<00:03:53.389> here<00:03:53.629> I<00:03:53.660> am

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
used it for something else but here I am

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.539 
used it for something else but here I am
just<00:03:53.930> pulling<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.949> can<00:03:55.040> see<00:03:55.190> it's<00:03:55.340> just

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
just pulling you can see it's just

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.039 
just pulling you can see it's just
fork-tender<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.329> meat<00:03:56.480> just<00:03:56.660> pulled<00:03:56.959> right

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
fork-tender the meat just pulled right

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.129 
fork-tender the meat just pulled right
away<00:03:57.440> like<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:58.510> with<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.599> Sun<00:03:59.810> Oven<00:03:59.989> you

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
away like that with the Sun Oven you

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.050 
away like that with the Sun Oven you
really<00:04:00.440> have<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.680> be<00:04:00.799> kind<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.400> savvy<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.000> you

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
really have to be kind of savvy and you

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.150 
really have to be kind of savvy and you
have<00:04:02.239> to<00:04:02.389> time<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:02.750> so<00:04:03.139> that<00:04:03.829> you're<00:04:03.980> going<00:04:04.099> to

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.030 
have to time it so that you're going to
have<00:04:04.400> enough<00:04:04.699> Sun<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.379> be<00:04:06.379> able<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.650> cook<00:04:06.919> as

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
have enough Sun to be able to cook as

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.710 
have enough Sun to be able to cook as
long<00:04:07.069> as<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.370> need<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.549> cook<00:04:07.790> I<00:04:08.030> knew<00:04:08.480> I<00:04:08.510> wanted

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
long as you need to cook I knew I wanted

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.960

four hours in the Sun Oven

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.180 
four hours in the Sun Oven
so<00:04:13.639> I've<00:04:13.910> back<00:04:14.359> timed<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.930> from<00:04:15.169> when<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.680> knew

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
so I've back timed it from when I knew

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.099 
so I've back timed it from when I knew
the<00:04:16.340> Sun<00:04:16.579> was<00:04:16.729> going<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:16.940> go<00:04:17.090> down<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.870> Sun

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
time of year about 6:30 so I'm not going

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.090 
time of year about 6:30 so I'm not going
to<00:04:22.460> get<00:04:22.610> any<00:04:22.789> real<00:04:23.510> heat<00:04:23.840> after<00:04:24.289> that

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
to get any real heat after that

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.310 
to get any real heat after that
if<00:04:25.250> I've<00:04:25.460> got<00:04:25.670> it<00:04:25.820> up<00:04:25.910> to<00:04:25.940> 350<00:04:26.720> degrees<00:04:26.990> by<00:04:27.140> that

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
if I've got it up to 350 degrees by that

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.810 
if I've got it up to 350 degrees by that
point<00:04:27.560> then<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:27.830> can<00:04:28.040> leave<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.340> there<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.700> it

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
point then I can leave it there and it

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.250 
point then I can leave it there and it
will<00:04:28.970> still<00:04:29.240> continue<00:04:29.390> to<00:04:29.720> cook<00:04:29.870> for<00:04:30.170> about

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
will still continue to cook for about

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260 
will still continue to cook for about
another<00:04:30.590> hour<00:04:30.830> but<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.760> temperature<00:04:32.180> is

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
another hour but the temperature is

another hour but the temperature is
going<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:32.420> be<00:04:32.570> falling<00:04:32.810> all<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.200> time<00:04:33.410> I

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
going to be falling all the time I

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.100 
going to be falling all the time I
didn't<00:04:34.970> have<00:04:35.060> room<00:04:35.240> for<00:04:35.450> another<00:04:35.600> container

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
didn't have room for another container

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.750 
didn't have room for another container

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.660 
in my Sun oven to bake these three
potatoes<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.810> just<00:04:39.050> laid<00:04:39.350> them<00:04:39.530> down<00:04:39.670> you

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
potatoes so I just laid them down you

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
know on the inside of the Sun Oven they

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.020 
know on the inside of the Sun Oven they
weren't<00:04:42.680> in<00:04:42.800> any<00:04:42.950> container<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:43.460> just<00:04:43.790> washed

weren't in any container I just washed

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.820 
weren't in any container I just washed
them<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.360> laid<00:04:44.480> them<00:04:44.600> down<00:04:44.630> in<00:04:44.960> there<00:04:45.170> which

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.380 
is perfectly fine and they cooked along
with<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:47.930> roast<00:04:48.170> so<00:04:48.320> we<00:04:48.440> had<00:04:48.590> these<00:04:48.710> beautiful

homegrown potatoes with the roast that
night<00:04:52.190> here's<00:04:53.030> something<00:04:53.330> else<00:04:53.450> I<00:04:53.660> found<00:04:53.870> to

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
night here's something else I found to

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.570 
night here's something else I found to
be<00:04:54.170> invaluable<00:04:54.500> because<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:55.070> know<00:04:55.220> I<00:04:55.250> don't

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
be invaluable because you know I don't

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.610 
be invaluable because you know I don't
know<00:04:55.730> from<00:04:55.940> one<00:04:56.120> day<00:04:56.300> to<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.600> next<00:04:56.690> you<00:04:57.530> know

to give me the weather forecast I
wouldn't<00:05:08.330> know<00:05:08.540> so<00:05:09.350> I<00:05:09.380> looked<00:05:09.980> and<00:05:10.190> looked<00:05:10.430> for

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
wouldn't know so I looked and looked for

wouldn't know so I looked and looked for
one<00:05:10.790> of<00:05:10.910> these<00:05:11.000> luckily<00:05:11.540> I<00:05:11.570> found<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:12.020> at<00:05:12.200> a

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
one of these luckily I found it at a

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.920 
one of these luckily I found it at a
flea<00:05:13.490> market<00:05:13.580> locally<00:05:14.210> I<00:05:14.240> think<00:05:14.510> I<00:05:14.570> paid<00:05:14.750> two

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
flea market locally I think I paid two

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.390 
flea market locally I think I paid two
or<00:05:15.050> three<00:05:15.230> dollars<00:05:15.350> for<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.890> I<00:05:15.980> call<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.220> my

or three dollars for it I call it my
home<00:05:16.430> weather<00:05:16.850> station<00:05:16.940> it<00:05:17.630> actually<00:05:18.350> has

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
home weather station it actually has

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.260 
home weather station it actually has
three<00:05:18.590> things<00:05:19.040> on<00:05:19.280> it<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.430> thermometer<00:05:19.850> a

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
three things on it a thermometer a

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.910 
three things on it a thermometer a
hygrometer<00:05:20.870> which<00:05:21.320> is<00:05:21.440> what<00:05:21.590> you're<00:05:21.740> seeing

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
hygrometer which is what you're seeing

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.940 
hygrometer which is what you're seeing
right<00:05:22.130> now<00:05:22.190> and<00:05:22.520> also<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.510> barometer<00:05:23.870> this<00:05:24.770> is

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
right now and also a barometer this is

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.500 
right now and also a barometer this is
the<00:05:25.070> one<00:05:25.310> I<00:05:25.340> find<00:05:25.760> most<00:05:26.060> useful<00:05:26.150> the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
the one I find most useful the

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.150 
the one I find most useful the
hydrometer<00:05:27.230> which<00:05:27.380> lets<00:05:27.650> me<00:05:27.710> know<00:05:27.830> whether

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
hydrometer which lets me know whether

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.770 
hydrometer which lets me know whether
it's<00:05:28.310> going<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.490> rain<00:05:28.730> or<00:05:28.880> not<00:05:28.970> it<00:05:29.240> has<00:05:29.750> a

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
it's going to rain or not it has a

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.740 
it's going to rain or not it has a
little<00:05:30.140> a<00:05:31.100> little<00:05:31.850> hand<00:05:32.120> you<00:05:32.300> can<00:05:32.420> see<00:05:32.600> it's

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
little a little hand you can see it's

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.050 
little a little hand you can see it's
pointing<00:05:33.080> at<00:05:33.140> the<00:05:33.260> 12<00:05:33.530> o'clock<00:05:33.740> position<00:05:34.060> that

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
pointing at the 12 o'clock position that

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.890 
pointing at the 12 o'clock position that
I<00:05:35.090> can<00:05:35.570> put<00:05:35.810> like<00:05:36.080> on<00:05:36.320> today<00:05:36.740> so<00:05:37.520> today<00:05:37.910> if<00:05:38.450> if

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
I can put like on today so today if if

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.440 
I can put like on today so today if if
it's<00:05:39.500> if<00:05:40.400> I<00:05:40.580> think<00:05:40.640> the<00:05:41.060> weather<00:05:41.270> is<00:05:41.390> changing

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
it's if I think the weather is changing

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.510 
it's if I think the weather is changing
a<00:05:41.870> little<00:05:41.990> bit<00:05:42.230> I<00:05:42.260> can<00:05:42.440> mark<00:05:42.770> that<00:05:42.950> today<00:05:43.280> and

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
a little bit I can mark that today and

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.550 
a little bit I can mark that today and
then<00:05:44.060> tomorrow<00:05:44.300> I<00:05:44.690> can<00:05:45.020> look<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.260> see<00:05:45.440> where

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
then tomorrow I can look and see where

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.560 
then tomorrow I can look and see where
the<00:05:45.680> needle<00:05:45.980> needle<00:05:46.520> is<00:05:46.850> seeing<00:05:47.240> that<00:05:47.390> it's

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
the needle needle is seeing that it's

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.990 
the needle needle is seeing that it's
fair<00:05:47.960> and<00:05:48.200> knowing<00:05:48.920> that<00:05:48.950> it's<00:05:49.400> probably<00:05:49.790> when

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
fair and knowing that it's probably when

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.280 
fair and knowing that it's probably when
I<00:05:50.030> wake<00:05:50.240> up<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.450> morning<00:05:50.690> and<00:05:50.810> it<00:05:50.900> looks<00:05:51.110> like

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
I wake up the morning and it looks like

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.870 
I wake up the morning and it looks like
that<00:05:51.470> I<00:05:51.680> know<00:05:51.770> it's<00:05:52.100> probably<00:05:52.280> not<00:05:52.580> going<00:05:52.820> to

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
that I know it's probably not going to

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.310 
that I know it's probably not going to
rain<00:05:53.090> that<00:05:53.120> day<00:05:53.420> and<00:05:53.570> it's<00:05:53.660> probably<00:05:53.870> a<00:05:54.020> safe

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
rain that day and it's probably a safe

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.070 
rain that day and it's probably a safe
bet<00:05:54.380> to<00:05:55.280> go<00:05:55.400> ahead<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:55.790> plan<00:05:56.390> to<00:05:56.510> use<00:05:56.660> my<00:05:56.870> Sun

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
bet to go ahead and plan to use my Sun

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.190 
bet to go ahead and plan to use my Sun
Oven<00:05:57.350> if<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:58.010> needle<00:05:58.220> were<00:05:58.460> to<00:05:58.820> the<00:05:59.120> left<00:05:59.930> of

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
Oven if the needle were to the left of

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.230 
Oven if the needle were to the left of
that<00:06:00.890> needle<00:06:01.250> that<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:01.490> positioned<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:02.120> day

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
that needle that I positioned the day

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.030 
that needle that I positioned the day
before<00:06:02.420> I<00:06:02.600> would<00:06:02.990> know<00:06:03.230> that<00:06:03.260> it's<00:06:03.710> going<00:06:03.950> to

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
before I would know that it's going to

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.430 
before I would know that it's going to
get<00:06:04.160> cloudy<00:06:04.490> and<00:06:04.730> it<00:06:04.850> might<00:06:05.150> even<00:06:05.960> rain<00:06:06.230> and

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
get cloudy and it might even rain and

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.570 
get cloudy and it might even rain and
that<00:06:06.500> it<00:06:06.620> probably<00:06:06.800> wouldn't<00:06:07.160> be<00:06:07.250> a<00:06:07.280> good<00:06:07.340> day

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580
