00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.950
 I'm back, open the exams 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.950
 I still have someone from sara September but 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.759
 I don't have the problem 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.429
 and I have to make a video 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.590
 probably mark mothers 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.440
 only for you portal text are only 3 days at the home of a friend of mine e 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.119
 120 euros. 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.449
 it's time there to put a video on me now that I'm back 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.119
 the jesus worker 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.930
 but then 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.540
 and I wanted to do a little review 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.960
 because I have finished a little more finished and I am on my way to some 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.330
 so let's know enough to be able to return months 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.190
 then first of all I want to do 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.700
 the one under the clinique 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.390
 which it is the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.390
 cliquez max command access 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.020
 I took it because they gave me a sample when I went 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.520
 one day in milan in renaissance nanda to convince all three of stefano 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.610
 started this then I liked tweets 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.680
 I bought myself 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.570
 it lasted me 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.100
 3 4 month a 100 ml pack equal to torino 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700
 the 5 euros from sephora 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.240
 evaluate it I went to sephora today I tried maintenon ex amaranto when 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.530
 I went to sephora - given this 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.950
 chemical vincinella transparent I do a lot of esteem that I felt the skin 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.580
 very clean, 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.580
 after using how they gave me this 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.630
 but with prickly pears and white hours 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.110
 bastos or liquid but 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.800
 but because the consistency of a real soap and absolutely does not foam 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.090
 so when I tried it twice I said the wrong webcam 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.640
 amounts to call it 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.030
 and they gave me crème instead of soap 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.310
 instead no l tears very dry hair at 7 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.680
 I too don't have very dry skin I have it from dry to normal I have one 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.560
 skin on the whole of the streap relationship problems 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.000
 and this soap does not 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.660
 while the normal one ie yahoo mail beta abnormal dry skin I liked it 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.299
 a lot because I really felt clean skin 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.539
 also that it pulls a little and then then with the cream 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:17.909
 everything will be all right 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.399
 for this reason it did not give me the feeling of cleanliness 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:24.149
 probably because it's too delicate for me 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:25.659
 horses are not olly 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.629
 I didn't pass the facade 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.820
 and with the fact that it does not foam 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.029
 I could not understand the quantities 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:37.039
 I think I put din cap on his face and when new he does not 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:39.369
 I felt brilliant 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.699
 I did not feel this police feeling that it is when I wash it 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.639
 normally 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.859
 15 I finished because I'm living clinical soap wants everything random 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.900
 pain against this this the world I would like to buy after all 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.799
 i think when i finish what i used that i am using now buy 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:02:59.819
 mail -d 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.769
 and from that hour I really enjoyed the extra ramadan mail 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.799
 it is beautiful if I wear very dry skin 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.129
 in my opinion 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.119
 it is ideal for you 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:14.549
 and that in any case is not really very very very delicate does not make foam 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.819
 I roll a few times a day and used evening mail machines 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.889
 evening I did not have cars in the evening I gave it in the morning 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:22.789
 siempre 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.359
 and in the evening if the day had not shocked me 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.369
 and casillas touched me the day I passed with cleansing milk cleanser 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.369
 and panasonic tonic I don't know anymore to clean myself watery 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.519
 so this 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.810
 rejected because it is too delicate for my skin 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.319
 the perfume itself 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.499
 ie fwmail 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.609
 detergent sf 91 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.169
 hola finished 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.939

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.839

 I think he touches me iron pack 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:01.499
 two sides of face 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:05.349
 I went to the proceeds with one of the twelve thousand discounts I didn't even know 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.699
 what to take i took this 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.289
 then this is 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:13.450
 it is his face soap of the lines if it were specific 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.760
 which is not fine still 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.760
 because I don't have a problem, some problems I follow you 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.049
 and I pointed it out to her, but she advised me by telling me this 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.759
 which is the only one 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.159
 of the line 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:30.059
 suitable to be used every day with microspheres black to make one 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:32.240
 light layer 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.680
 where soap very very very dense 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.099
 there is a positive thing 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.199
 and to these 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.900

 the foam has not been avoided contact ceres and constipation and contour 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.599

 I am therefore doing massage in front of the nose the chin 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.569
 individually 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.860
 when it comes to how fast it is to leave milano soap residues 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.490
 the whole face and then I rinse myself 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.940
