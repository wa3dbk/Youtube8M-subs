00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
so we got the BCD on I got the strength

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.640 
so we got the BCD on I got the strength

its it's a good practice to check that
screen<00:04:57.940> in<00:04:58.120> there<00:04:58.270> make<00:04:59.139> sure<00:04:59.289> it's<00:04:59.470> not<00:04:59.819> her

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
screen in there make sure it's not her

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
the depth gauge and the compass on this

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.230 
the depth gauge and the compass on this
one

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
one

ok<00:07:20.720> let's<00:07:20.990> check<00:07:21.050> our<00:07:21.350> pressure<00:07:21.560> gauge

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
ok let's check our pressure gauge

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:29.290 
ok let's check our pressure gauge
we<00:07:24.500> have<00:07:24.650> 1,000<00:07:25.280> psi

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:29.300 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.210
