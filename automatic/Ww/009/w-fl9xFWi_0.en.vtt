00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.480
 and just a fairly complicated recipe 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.759
 because he dreams of finding many things in 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.779
 advance and then even dirty one 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.779
 event to the other 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.250
 regarding the origin of the tailor 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.690
 on Youtube 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.430
 I spare you the explanation that 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.010
 you will find on the internet a little everywhere 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.110
 but you will find it below the video first 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.780
 of the ingredients with regard to 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.730
 you will find them written below the video 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.980
 main ingredient and rice that 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.250
 must be cooked for half I made a 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.370
 simple risotto I find the can 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.520
 also replace it with mozzarella then 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.220
 I made a meat sauce 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.080
 I made some meatballs 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.350
 small sausages that in Naples yes 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.869
 they call cervellati or elsewhere luganega 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.330
 peas with a bit of onion a 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.060
 container with very high edges or 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.270
 orici customer donut though 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.000
 always high enough and buttered 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.300
 and then I passed some breadcrumbs on the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.300
 walls 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.990
 we mix the rice again must be 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.990
 cold otherwise the eggs run 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.810
 now we line the pan with firmness too 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.030
 the walls shown of the rice must be 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.310
 about 2 centimeters 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.659
 obviously to do this 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.570
 he must send the hands that they don't do 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.500
 stick your hand on the ice 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.500
 nice noir from time to time 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.990
 Hello 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.650
 it will be a temperature of 240 that the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.160
 maximum that we find in the ovens that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.870
 we have at home for about 40 minutes 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.150
 if you see that then over tends to 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:24.250
 roll up too much we cover with some 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:28.510
 the last one is protected by baking paper 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.940
 ten minutes of cooking with this card 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:39.970
 now we must not flip we put a 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:43.750
 flat over court cooks and not 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.959
 keeps lit that they were like that from which he wants 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.750
 the word mons because Naples would be 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.480
 the dark of the Neapolitan noble family 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.910
 it was mass and as they did 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.030
 these particular uncontrolled sauces 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.519
 on the 9th jump and French 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.950
 then the Neapolitans are that every 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.720
 so pleasant became a partner 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.139
 what society does not like is 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:25.740
 so euro is the pink and gianello that 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:28.930
 they put the French were at the table 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.780

 I went very well dinner is 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:41.759

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.759

 Neapolitans of the Bourbons knew how to do it 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.440
 French hearts in the Bourbon court 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.900
