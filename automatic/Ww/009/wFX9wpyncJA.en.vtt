gaining<00:00:54.899> control<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.039> students<00:00:56.520> rather

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
gaining control of the students rather

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.500 
gaining control of the students rather
you're<00:00:57.809> asserting<00:00:58.530> self-control<00:00:59.399> which<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you're asserting self-control which the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.950 
you're asserting self-control which the
outcome<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.559> will<00:01:01.800> fall<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.280> line<00:01:02.520> and

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
outcome is they will fall in line and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.270 
outcome is they will fall in line and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110

you want to do i if it's this kind of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.109 
you want to do i if it's this kind of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
behavior where they're just kind of

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
behavior where they're just kind of
chattering<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:13.110> hurting<00:01:13.560> each<00:01:13.680> other
