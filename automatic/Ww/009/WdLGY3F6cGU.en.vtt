grey<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> kind<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.920> put<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.250> details<00:01:14.729> so

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
grey to kind of put on the details so

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.719 
grey to kind of put on the details so
it's<00:01:15.570> actually<00:01:15.750> very<00:01:15.930> simplistic<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.430> I

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it's actually very simplistic and I

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.390 
it's actually very simplistic and I
would<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.119> mind<00:01:18.450> making<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.470> tutorial<00:01:19.860> for

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
would not mind making a tutorial for

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.030 
would not mind making a tutorial for
this<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> charm<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:22.950> it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
this as a charm and this is what it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.469 
this as a charm and this is what it
pretty<00:01:23.189> much<00:01:23.280> looks<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
pretty much looks like I really like the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.620 
pretty much looks like I really like the
translucent<00:01:25.080> green<00:01:25.170> effect<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.920> pen<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
translucent green effect on this pen and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.420 
translucent green effect on this pen and
it's<00:01:27.630> again<00:01:28.170> very<00:01:28.409> very<00:01:28.500> light<00:01:28.860> weight<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.220> it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
it's again very very light weight and it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.429 
it's again very very light weight and it
works<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> pen<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.110> when<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> can

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
works like a pen and then when you can

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.410 
works like a pen and then when you can
flip<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> around<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.220> pretend<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.790> have<00:01:33.030> your
