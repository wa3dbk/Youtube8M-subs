at this candle you're you'll see that

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.860 
at this candle you're you'll see that
the<00:00:35.260> surface<00:00:35.829> has<00:00:36.040> been<00:00:36.250> finely<00:00:36.850> sanded<00:00:37.600> I

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
the surface has been finely sanded I

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.350 
the surface has been finely sanded I
wish<00:00:38.620> it<00:00:38.739> was<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:38.890> better<00:00:39.100> picture<00:00:39.370> but<00:00:39.940> I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
wish it was a better picture but I

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.680

you<00:00:44.010> here<00:00:45.010> is<00:00:45.309> a<00:00:45.550> different<00:00:46.239> version<00:00:46.390> of<00:00:46.660> the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
you here is a different version of the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.830 
you here is a different version of the
candle<00:00:47.289> but<00:00:47.620> it<00:00:47.980> has<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.360> roughness

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
candle but it has the the roughness

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.569 
candle but it has the the roughness
still<00:00:50.170> there<00:00:50.500> it<00:00:50.649> really<00:00:50.920> depends<00:00:51.309> on<00:00:51.430> what

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
still there it really depends on what

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.790 
still there it really depends on what
you're<00:00:51.699> going<00:00:52.059> for<00:00:52.090> and<00:00:52.840> if<00:00:53.230> you'll<00:00:53.379> note<00:00:53.620> the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
you're going for and if you'll note the

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.090 
you're going for and if you'll note the
jaggedness<00:00:54.280> this<00:00:54.640> was<00:00:54.820> probably<00:00:55.120> hand<00:00:56.100> cut

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
jaggedness this was probably hand cut

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.259 
jaggedness this was probably hand cut
with<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.280> handsaw<00:00:57.879> instead<00:00:58.539> of<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.719> bandsaw

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
with a handsaw instead of a bandsaw

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.389 
with a handsaw instead of a bandsaw
coconuts<00:01:01.269> make<00:01:01.570> excellent<00:01:02.109> containers<00:01:03.100> or

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
coconuts make excellent containers or

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.750 
coconuts make excellent containers or
vessels<00:01:04.030> for<00:01:04.989> liquid<00:01:05.560> I<00:01:05.800> mean<00:01:06.070> after<00:01:06.280> all<00:01:06.460> they

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
vessels for liquid I mean after all they

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.750 
vessels for liquid I mean after all they
did<00:01:07.000> hold<00:01:07.240> coconut<00:01:07.900> milk<00:01:08.170> for<00:01:08.500> most<00:01:09.430> of<00:01:09.610> their

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
did hold coconut milk for most of their

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.030 
did hold coconut milk for most of their
life<00:01:10.000> so<00:01:10.600> here's<00:01:10.900> some<00:01:11.140> different<00:01:11.530> versions

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040
