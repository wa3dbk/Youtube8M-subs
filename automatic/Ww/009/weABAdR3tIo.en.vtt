00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.600
 people today I bring you a house a lot the 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.519
 that Mr. David loose that here 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.079
 puts alone vini and has made this house 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.789
 for two weeks worth do not remember with 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.679
 the facebook that I have it and go to 18 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.329
 We will see over time 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.980
 you are seeing is the house is worth the 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.869
 see how I say over we're going to 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.220
 delve into it I've seen a little bit 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.800
 of her because you already know that I always 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.150
 I really like to see it before analyzing it 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.470
 little but it's fine I like the surprise 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.810
 where is I like I like to save 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.460
 a few of the secrets of the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.839
 houses to see them in the good video 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.720
 said I'm seeing a little bit above 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.160
 we can see that a quartz has been made 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.210
 risky block for decoration yo 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.610
 I always think because it's very easy 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.630
 do it wrong with quartz because a lot 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.790
 quartz is wrong but good has 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.440
 combined with different objects like 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.270
 you can see and blocks as they are by 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 example the leaves some wool a little bit 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 of stone and you will see it does not look bad 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
 well we started and things that call 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.200
 a lot of good attention is raining 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.490
 guys excuse me I take this away when 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.800
 with the commands that you are going to invent that 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.170
 put and removed and is that I was born I think 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.490
 that right here yes indeed and in 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.050
 do you put you appeared here is the 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.940
 button and to give it then it comes to us 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.089
 Here we have crops as you can see 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.460
 all kinds here we have then 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.409
 carrot and wheat potatoes there is not now 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.090
 that I fixed but good here we have as 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.740
 a part of the crop here we have a 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.719
 little bit more we do not have watermelons we have 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.520
 cabals have as cactus and here 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.469
 to leave things kubica attitude and that if 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.409
 there were these david cactus these cactus 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.729
 they are good cocoa the case is that one thing 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.459
 that have arisen to me nothing else to think is 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.689
 how he came in here I do not know maybe it 's okay 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.069
 this gives us an account but well this 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.420
 it should be changed for my point of view 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.640
 because if it is a crop of them to be able 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.469
 enter easily no good said that 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.990
 it has pretty thing command blocks 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.179
 strange on a map because many people do not 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.979
 usually use them is not whether out of fear or 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.020
 ignorance I am one of those who 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.459
 ignorance and fear for both and 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.780
 good as we would say also that is 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.810
 cool is the truth that is pretty 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.950
 cool, we're going to give it and good as you are 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.360
 seeing then there we had one that 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.920
 command that was not called until the mine 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.329
 and we are going to go up through the house 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.129
 you have some super nice wool here 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.719
 puts in heat and the truth is that you have left 

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:59.149
 pretty cool nothing is that it shows 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.829
 spent time working on it I would 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.729
 I do not notice it's not a coat made in a day 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.920
 because neither of coÃ±a 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.349
 well here you see you see there is a box 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.239
 that I see and stopped seeing depending on 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:09.709
 moment with the kids but not for 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.390
 that is better the house I will keep them 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.100
 You know about boys I always do 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.660
 good and how is this area a bit 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.340
 like to watch TV on exteriors that 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.020
 You do not have anything bad to notice that I have 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.180
 some flags that he has done because 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.860
 this you already know what can be done which 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.780
 are the standards that you have left 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.370
 pretty cool the truth and following 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.110
 around here we have a little boost 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.270
 water that we're going to see there is but there's 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.160
 nothing a cataract without decoration 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.810
 that does not fit too bad and good 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.580
 We have different parts not in arrivals 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.690
 to this part as you see here there is water that 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.950
 it takes us towards a kind of aquarium 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.800
 where we can perfectly leave 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.780
 little fish in a hypothetical world of main 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.400
 substitute canon were alive and here 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.350
 we have another television as you see 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.850
 very good the pictures because we have a 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.459
 television here we have the blocks of 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.230
 music as you see that they are activated and nothing 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.700
 so two beautiful sofas here we have a 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.739
 down and here we have some crystals 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.330
 buy crystals that teach us the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.760
 bottom part that we will go next 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.019
 and here therefore a beautiful terrace from 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.850
 where we see our view only as 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.709
 you see the f5 it gives me like something weird is it 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.780
 I do not know what it is but it's good 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.250
 going down here as I said we are going 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.380
 to the part that we are seeing that if you 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.870
 you see, they are nothing more than nothing 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.130
 the different media is winning the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.440
 little ones you know already because they are 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.510
 touching nose as it is a team in the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:24.379
 zeal or zeal hello 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.790
 you enjoy the map of the city and here 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.290
 is roberto the golem nothing more and nothing 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.269
 except here we have it and we have a 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.819
 door to enter into a room 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.530
 chests that are also accompanied by 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.450
 kilns of coffee theo and also some 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.829
 no remaining anvils not part 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.269
 those that are pretty cool and 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.739
 going up then we go back to where 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.019
 we were as you see this part communicates 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.180
 tail behind however if we decide 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.440
 so to go up we find a part 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.329
 where we see a receiver as you see a 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.310
 this hall are bigger hall 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.480
 for me and for my point of view that 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.859
 As you can see we have a table with 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.870
 different sofas of leaves that you have left 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.760
 enough water and notice that everything decorated 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.959
 these crystals or panels 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.730
 crystals painted black that 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.709
 are pretty cool hey I said that 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.650
 here we have a sort of dining room 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.959
 or bone I would say not here because we would be 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.660
 the food to our guests as a 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.930
 kind of bar 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.160
 of these glasses and there we would continue and here 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.690
 we have a place then also for 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.750
 relax and here we have an umbrella 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.190
 I see these as part of this part of 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.140
 here was not very clear or is it not me 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.790
 just like it a lot I would put it 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.590
 other things like for example slabs or 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.000
 putting slabs all this way I think 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.430
 that the berries stay a touch 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.320
 somewhat ugly but good is equally 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.580
 well for this part you already know that 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.530
 I am always the lawyer of the devil of the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.330
 always salt houses with the bad and what 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.250
 that maybe it's not cool so much, but for 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.450
 that you also learn but 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.800
 transformed is maybe there is another 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.930
 person who says great walker with the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.450
 berries you know that opinions are 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.700
 like the asses there are many and good and 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.810
 As you can see here there is a double bed 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.430
 bedroom that I'm seeing if there's 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.290
 some room because sometimes you 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.760
 like that and here, well, nothing 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.160
 chest and a sberbank chest that also 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.210
 I'm going to have them and well then nothing more 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.670
 here I will close the doors chairs 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.170
 as you see and we will continue where 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.510
 we were seeing here we have another 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.700
 room in this case decorated another 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.460
 way like them with bricks of these 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.800
 infra bricks here we have more leaves 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.720
 we have more chests as photo casket 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.120
 mender and going around here we have a 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.550
 kind of I do not know what to call this a 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.700
 site other options 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.800
 combined with good with another oven one 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.720
 area to make more things and here then 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.400
 we have the table in weddings for this 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.590
 part of here we have a fireplace like 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.120
 You see beautiful and radiant and we go up 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.980
 these races as we go up to the part 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.210
 superior where we find the best 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.040
 of the house that the bread not by the way 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.930
 we do not but the duck is cool 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.490
 to go to the neder as you are projectors 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.320
 out there and the pact that the truth is that 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.330
 look how beautiful it is, it's amazing 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.530
 you can give the duck I think I 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.150
 I imagine that I have nothing inside me 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.330
 always inside the flies is not 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.330
 single 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.500
 but there was as you see the stuffed comes 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.390
 well pretty cool and for this part of 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.550
 here, guys, if we go up, we have a 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.920
 kind of super cool place in plan for 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.300
 sleep watching the stars of my 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.190
 favorite parts of the house as the 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.570
 better because I'm really cool about this 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.220
 imagine having a house of this type 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.230
 with crystals of a devastating foundation 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.420
 mine up and institute mass living 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.770
 dead seems amazing to me and here then 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.720
 as you can see we have a fireplace and here is 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.790
 area to relax the house the truth that I 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.860
 It seems very nice modern house person or 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.020
 that pretends to be modern and that the truth 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.880
 it's pretty good that touch that 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.909
 has given quartz for my opinion is a 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.830
 very well elaborated house that stops 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.719
 very well, however , some 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.610
 challenges as I said maybe in the 

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:29.409
 crops or for example there is no kitchen to 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.789
 through chan missing a little or a 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.830
 dining room since it pretends it is a 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:36.230
 modern house that is faithful to what is the 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.510
 modernity and maybe 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.580
 it would lack a refrigerator or some other 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.870
 thing that would give that touch however 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.370
 which is a house that is pretty cool 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.990
 that I recommend that in that direction your 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.940
