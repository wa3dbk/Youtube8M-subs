it's<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> good<00:01:00.600> idea<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.109> buy<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> same<00:01:01.590> size<00:01:01.920> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it's a good idea to buy a same size and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.359 
it's a good idea to buy a same size and
at<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> denominator<00:01:03.510> number<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
at the denominator number so this is the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.670 
at the denominator number so this is the
number<00:01:05.610> six<00:01:05.909> bead<00:01:06.150> cord<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.990> would<00:01:07.170> correspond

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
number six bead cord it would correspond

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.160 
number six bead cord it would correspond
with<00:01:07.830> six<00:01:08.100> millimeter<00:01:08.580> beads<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.780> isn't<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
with six millimeter beads this isn't a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.960 
with six millimeter beads this isn't a
hard<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.470> fast<00:01:10.560> rule<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.549> you're<00:01:11.790> just

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970

starting<00:01:12.180> out<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.780> might<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.080> well<00:01:13.200> buy<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.979> six

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
starting out you might as well buy a six

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.240 
starting out you might as well buy a six
a<00:01:15.150> five<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.810> seven<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:16.979> six

a five and seven if you have six
millimeter<00:01:17.700> beads<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.420> you're<00:01:18.600> covered

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
millimeter beads just so you're covered

or<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:21.690> just<00:02:21.870> leave<00:02:22.050> them<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.350> they<00:02:22.380> are

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
or you can just leave them as they are

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.410 
or you can just leave them as they are
they<00:02:22.950> should<00:02:23.130> be<00:02:23.160> pretty<00:02:23.430> strong<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:24.180> that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
they should be pretty strong but that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.790 
they should be pretty strong but that
just<00:02:24.630> adds<00:02:24.810> an<00:02:24.959> extra<00:02:25.140> level<00:02:25.590> of

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
just adds an extra level of

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.070 
just adds an extra level of
reinforcement<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.540> we're<00:02:27.660> ready<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.990> get

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
reinforcement so we're ready to get

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.010 
reinforcement so we're ready to get
started<00:02:28.640> if<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.820> aren't<00:02:30.090> sure<00:02:30.150> if<00:02:30.630> you're

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
started if you aren't sure if you're

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.490 
started if you aren't sure if you're
using<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.380> right<00:02:31.560> size<00:02:31.920> deep<00:02:32.910> chord<00:02:33.320> just<00:02:34.320> do

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
using the right size deep chord just do

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.100 
using the right size deep chord just do
a<00:02:34.530> little<00:02:34.709> test<00:02:34.860> take<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.700> needle<00:02:35.880> off<00:02:36.120> slide

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
a little test take the needle off slide

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.680 
a little test take the needle off slide
beat<00:02:37.470> over<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.010> needle<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.520> see<00:02:39.180> how<00:02:39.390> easily

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
beat over the needle and see how easily

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.960 
beat over the needle and see how easily
it<00:02:39.930> slides<00:02:40.350> down<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.680> cord<00:02:41.100> there<00:02:41.670> should<00:02:41.850> be

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
it slides down the cord there should be

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.880 
it slides down the cord there should be
a<00:02:42.150> slight<00:02:42.360> resistance<00:02:42.750> as<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.320> slide<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.739> it

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
a slight resistance as you slide it it

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.580 
a slight resistance as you slide it it
shouldn't<00:02:44.130> be<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.790> major<00:02:45.090> resistance<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:46.530> it

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
shouldn't be a major resistance but it

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.229 
shouldn't be a major resistance but it
shouldn't<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.040> slide<00:02:47.489> back<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.150> forth

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
shouldn't just slide back and forth

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.090 
shouldn't just slide back and forth
freely<00:02:48.660> over<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.140> court<00:02:49.380> or<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.680> know<00:02:49.860> that

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
freely over the court or you know that

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.670 
freely over the court or you know that
the<00:02:50.310> beat<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:50.640> too<00:02:51.120> big<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.780> particular

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
the beat is too big for that particular

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.400 
the beat is too big for that particular
chord<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:54.390> first<00:02:54.540> thing<00:02:54.810> you'll<00:02:54.959> need<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.230> do

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
chord the first thing you'll need to do

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.520 
chord the first thing you'll need to do
is<00:02:55.680> remove<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.400> pearls<00:02:56.790> from<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.959> string<00:02:58.290> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
is remove the pearls from the string the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:10.510 
is remove the pearls from the string the
temporary<00:02:59.010> string<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.640> bought<00:02:59.850> them<00:03:00.030> on

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.990 

then<00:03:11.090> you're<00:03:11.270> ready<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.540> start<00:03:11.690> stringing

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
then you're ready to start stringing

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.180 
then you're ready to start stringing
start<00:03:14.000> with<00:03:14.150> one<00:03:14.330> of<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.510> bead<00:03:14.690> tips<00:03:14.980> face<00:03:15.980> it

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
start with one of the bead tips face it

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.600 
start with one of the bead tips face it
downward<00:03:17.680> it's<00:03:18.680> going<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:18.920> be<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.130> outside

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
downward it's going to be the outside

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.550 
downward it's going to be the outside
edge<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:20.390> needs<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.690> be<00:03:20.870> able<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:21.110> clamp

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
edge so it needs to be able to clamp

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.330 
edge so it needs to be able to clamp
that<00:03:21.890> way<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.900> necklace<00:03:24.140> will<00:03:24.410> be<00:03:24.530> here<00:03:24.830> the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
that way the necklace will be here the

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.950 
that way the necklace will be here the
other<00:03:25.490> one's<00:03:25.730> going<00:03:25.850> to<00:03:25.910> clamp<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.270> way<00:03:26.770> and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
other one's going to clamp that way and

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.240 
other one's going to clamp that way and
then<00:03:29.960> you<00:03:29.990> just<00:03:30.260> start<00:03:30.530> stringing<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.220> beads

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
then you just start stringing the beads

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.970 
then you just start stringing the beads
on<00:03:31.640> one<00:03:31.970> at<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.180> time<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:35.530> then<00:03:36.530> go<00:03:36.710> ahead<00:03:36.830> and
