00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.049
 and it has already happened to us but a judas 74 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.630
 special boy and we have no idea that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.090
 put us the first thing I said to consider 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.440
 it's like the date is at least but not 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.840
 day appointment there I love to use 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.970
 cool dresses or you can also 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.860
 use a skirt and a cup top as is 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.100
 this one that I have here that looks super 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.480
 feminine and super cute this skirt 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.039
 opacity for the material that is not going to 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.560
 make me feel warm or if I'm under 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.449
 Sun during the appointment and apart the color is 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.570
 super cute I like the idea of using 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.489
 striking colors but not if it had but 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.070
 you have to be yourself during the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.570
 appointment so if you're a girls like me 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.640
 I'm not most of the time 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.010
 love to use black use you but 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.380
 use what makes you feel comfortable 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.270
 Wears this ideal outfit but needs 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.520
 that you go to lunch or just go out 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.680
 to walk and that's why I do not think it's good 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.780
 idea to load a gigantic bag because 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.399
 is simply to make an obstacle like this 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.860
 that this fascinated because not only 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.260
 it's super cute female but it's 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.910
 small but it fits all the essentials if 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.709
 you are going to use accessories I suggest you 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.080
 use one piece that is 

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.940
 striking but no more at least 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.620
 use this necklace or you can also 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.990
 use something like this bracelet that is 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.170
 striking but do not use both pieces 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.760
 together and a super important thing 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.130
 when arranged for an appointment is for 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.740
 course the makeup and I'm a fan of 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.780
 always go natural you want to be yourself 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.700
 so I explain my base as 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.110
 I would always do it and on my eyelids 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.960
 I'm just applying a color of 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.580
 skin similar to mine now what I follow 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.620
 you must add a little bit of brightness with 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.630
 this color that is almost white and what 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.850
 apply on my nose and lacrimal 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.590
 to give brightness what follows it seems that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.479
 can not miss is mask for eyelashes 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.180
 and that's always going to give you the touch 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.370
 special and if you want you can add 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.290
 artificial eyelashes but I suggest you 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.850
 that you use the individual ones because 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.590
 these look a lot more natural if you 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.020
 they put super giant eyelashes going to 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.119
 be like too much especially second 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.590
 day appointment of course if you go out to 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.300
 dancing goes something like this you can experience 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.920
 a little more with your look 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.170
 have things you can do to 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.150
 Experimenting with your look is also 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.160
 paint your lips and at least here I 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.080
 I wear this red dress I see it 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.970
 also when you need a day but more 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.680
 as for an appointment that is towards the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.900
 end of the afternoon that may pass the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.520
 day towards night because it has details 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.130
 in the back the dress that is made to me 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.900
 super sexy but how can you see my 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.460
 lips without any color do not look so 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.830
 well and with some red can 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.080
 complement the dress very well but 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.520
 honestly I do not suggest you paint the 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.890
 red lips for a first date 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.270
 because it can be uncomfortable and maybe not 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.670
 you feel good if you want to kiss 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.170
 someone so I would do it later 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.840
 as you already have a little more confidence 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.640
 with the person you're going out and 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.150
 we distant problems with if such is the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.950
 person who marches to red paint now 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.620
 the most classic quote probably 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.440
 all is to go to the movies and I if it was in this 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.150
 chance to go super comfortable no matter with you 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.460
 invent to continue with a dress of 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.770
 new squeals heels seriously about 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.380
 jeans and a top at least this white 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.760
 it's something that works super well and I 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.550
 What I recommend is that you add 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.800
 accessories that are very you and allow you 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.290
 look a little better a jacket is 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.330
 ideal because in the cinema tends to be 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.260
 very cold, although I know that sometimes 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.360
 the strategy of making your boy 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.580
 have a little heat do not you want either 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.620
 freeze apart from the jacket you can 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.940
 use accessories but small I by 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.640
 at least here I am using a necklace 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.050
 He quoted that it is very simple they look cute 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.060
 but it will not call too much 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.580
 attention and you can also play so 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.660
 less with other pieces like shoes 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.970
 I love these things, but let's be 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.160
 honest no man is going to tell you 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.900
 you loved for your shoes and equipment 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.700
 see another look that leads to the movies I 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.290
 use a very eye-catching accessory that 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.300
 it's a hat if they are daring and 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.010
 they want to use it do it but the most 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.440
 important is that they have a great time 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.440
 that maybe his night ends like this 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.310
 but if your boy invited you to leave 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.380
 night do not be afraid to show all those 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.600
 curves and a little black dress is the way 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.520
 ideal to do it and this I love 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.920
 because it shows only a little skin 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.590
 around the waist and chest but 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.090
 it does not show too much and here I am 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.430
 combining with the collected hair and 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.650
 I decide to use a super striking earring 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.900
 and quite weird but it 's very much my style 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.000
 so I made again pieces that go 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.620
 with you and this I love him 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.109
 use it so that's every day 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.790
 but one thing that happens to me is that of 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.530
 Sometimes I do not like to carry a bag 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.390
 because it's going to be super annoying like that 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.190
 What I do is take my cell phone and 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.830
 I put a case like this is super 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.630
 cute and inside the case I place my 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.710
 money and anything that can 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.800
 need as my identification 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.080
 staff and then about that I put the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.640
 phone and it is right there assured my 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.740
 money or anything else you can 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.540
 go but that's me that we like to load 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.680
 makeup on top of none of that so 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.360
 I do not need a bag 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.830
 and if those are some ideas that you 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.500
 can put and how can you make up 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.150
 for an appointment remember the most important 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.330
 is to have a good time so do not worry 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.370
 too much for his pint is very important 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.350
 that they feel good of course that they 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.270
 look cute but seriously the most 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.090
 important is that they have a good time with their 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.430
 boy and have chemistry and registration 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.430
 it does not matter the next ones a kiss
