this<00:01:22.469> from<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.829> Thomas<00:01:23.280> released<00:01:23.789> this<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
this from the Thomas released this was a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.450 
this from the Thomas released this was a
Kickstarter<00:01:25.310> product<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.950> waited<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.280> get

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
Kickstarter product so I waited to get

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.760 
Kickstarter product so I waited to get
it<00:01:29.609> until<00:01:29.819> it<00:01:30.119> was<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.329> hands<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.810> prime<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.740> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
it until it was on hands on prime so I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.230 
it until it was on hands on prime so I
probably<00:01:32.069> would<00:01:32.249> have<00:01:32.310> gotten<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:32.789> better

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
probably would have gotten a lot better

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.419 
probably would have gotten a lot better
but<00:01:33.569> I<00:01:34.049> really<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.159> prime<00:01:35.880> shipping

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429
