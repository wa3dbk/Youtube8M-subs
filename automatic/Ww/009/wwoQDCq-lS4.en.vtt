00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.420
 very good to all youtube walkers 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.490
 so he has back to the channel my 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.500
 sincere apologies for during almost a 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.260
 week do not go up practically anything good 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.000
 nothing directly to my channel now what 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.740
 I'm going to explain I'm going to design a little bit 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.160
 the reasons as you are seeing this is 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.140
 modern warfare2 yes but it is my premiere in 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.760
 xbox those who follow me on twitter os 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.400
 I encourage you to do it because I explain enough 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.010
 normally interesting things I was 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.629
 explaining how this weekend that 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.609
 I'm in Barcelona in fnac I could not 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.409
 resist the temptation to catch the 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.640
 armored edition of modern warfare2 that 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.280
 for me it's a very special game now 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.729
 I will explain why it is really quite 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.530
 good price without remembering that there was 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.350
 little things like the one we 're seeing here 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.729
 with tremendous care mandate 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.039
 amazing electric kilo that I finish 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.719
 of pasting this was my welcome to 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.729
 modern warfare2 but you are going to see that the 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.859
 game will be cheering little by little 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.159
 to be a real madness this is my 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.600
 first death on xbox good first 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.850
 death that I provoked had already 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.380
 killed once and the truth is that the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.180
 game will be spectacular especially 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.690
 for the time that it did not make me play 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.540
 this 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.370
 and for more inri in a console the one 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.920
 I had never played it but how 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.010
 good memories brings this game to me 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.920
 playstation 3 that was a bit my game 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.410
 fetish by which everything started and is 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.180
 true really my channel on youtube 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.560
 start thanks to this game that we have 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.500
 here in front in its version for 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.200
 playstation 3 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.650
 many youtubers your game your game 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.710
 a little fetish so to speak would be 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.330
 black ops black ops 1 and now for 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.130
 many is black ops 2 not the ones that 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.750
 they are pulling now start on youtube 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.270
 I encourage you forward 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.370
 because black ops 2 is a bit the game 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.510
 which they have found now 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.300
 shelter 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.250
 It is curious if you allow me speaking a 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.550
 little of the command from before with this I just 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.860
 the difference between the black knife 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.170
 ops 2 that does not kill or the three seems 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.000
 as to spread butter and in 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.369
 change here we saw that this knife 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.560
 it was more powerful more if possible 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.900
 you put the advantage command that good the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.990
 cameral food he is so famous already with 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.850
 mandate of up to three meters of 70 pit 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.550
 of the channel from top to bottom at the end of a 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.800
 absolute difference I think it's not 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.560
 so hard to catch a middle ground ni 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.140
 These summonses led to the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.239
 four meters nor be in front of you the 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.700
 president and drop the knife 80 times 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.230
 to finally impact the edge of the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.330
 knife with your body and kill you 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.940
 sweetly in that vile and cruel way 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.660
 that we all know etc well let's go to 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.150
 grain motifs 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.290
 and they have taken me a little bit to this one 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.660
 stopped if we can call a break 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.010
 on my channel is that I'm certainly 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.570
 quite unmotivated, but not quite 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.340
 disoriented I am that is the word 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.770
 disoriented I do not know what really 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.110
 wait for me I do not know what videos you want 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.430
 see why it really is that that is one 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.250
 of the big problems do not 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.900
 from my old channel to this new one that 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.579
 has a month and a half the truth is that it 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.540
 has happened a lot of people are over 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:18.510
 3,500 people 3500 subscribers but 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.430
 really the number of inactive or the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.359
 proportion of people who see and do not see 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.310
 the videos is really very high and I 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.579
 makes you doubt what you really want 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.590
 see from me what you want what it is that I 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.049
 You see that you like it because it really is 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.129
 what am I doing so far I do not think 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.470
 that is too much and then of some 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.409
 way he has done a pretty exercise 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.280
 Insane healthy depends on how it looks like 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:49.980
 is to see which videos are the most viewed in 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.870
 my channel beyond that there is a youtube 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.750
 it more or less large or a collaboration 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.190
 or more or less normal videos 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.560
 let's say no and 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.110
 Beyond the dirty Farsi Warriors 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.860
 How good can you continue to 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.320
 doing doing and giving it time I see that 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.150
 about everything what you like about me are videos 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.020
 in which for ho for b has reigned 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.880
 controversial polemic that I repeat does not come no 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.130
 is instructed by me in no time 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.720
 and it is always interpretable 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.870
 example the fact of making videos in 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.820
 Catalan, good people, who know me 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.710
 you know I have absolutely no 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.950
 cryptic critical vindication mood is 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.040
 simply and simply as simple as 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.730
 share a language of which then 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.230
 well I use quite frequent 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.060
 to share it with all of you to 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.750
 approach you a little so you can see that 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.460
 that there is a lot I do not know much much much 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:54.360
 fraudulent information traffic 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.910
 fÃ©lix tico critical and that has nothing 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.500
 what to do with reality do not fuck with me 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.550
 the package that is thousand packages for that 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:05.490
 package I kill you 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:08.290
 I see that there is something I do not know what 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.300
 misinterprets a lot I am a 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.110
 misunderstood in this sense I do not look for 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:18.100
 or provoke or disturb belive 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.380
 far that intention is left in my videos 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.830
 but it is attributed equally as 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.350
 the youtubers generation is to those life 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.450
 what I did with my face generally and 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.570
 explaining some topic some opinion that 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.820
 I had become instead of a forum 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.060
 of exchange of opinions more or less 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.490
 in an orderly manner in a way 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.170
 educated while I'm getting bloated 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.490
 which is that here you are the third one I'm going to 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.500
 turn around I'm going to load two or 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:49.360
 three more you will see then they became 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.070
 an authentic or insulting henhouse 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.920
 against each other 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.740
 the others against the ones against 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.670
 myself what is less but good 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.860
 no no 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:04.560
 I do not like at all to see all that 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:07.720
 critical picture and you are that is that 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.210
 You think it's worth it, it's not worth it 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.220
 it's not worth just insulting them is that if I 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.200
 I do not make their videos for that or for 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.490
 nothing is simply and plainly give my 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.500
 opinion and try not to see the things of 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.620
 another way or the videos against the 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.110
 violence not that I did frankly good 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.150
 the video against violence I love 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.910
 that it looked so much that it looked so much 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.730
 that many youtubers gave him 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.520
 with your like your purchase 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.230
 the fact of sharing it, not because maybe 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.850
 many did not dare to say it to 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.910
 doing it to me gives me frankly the same was 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:45.970
 I already told you at the time they were more 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.920
 a selfish motive for staying 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.390
 Quiet, give my opinion, disapprove everything 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.860
 what was being done in the 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.569
 Spanish YouTube community of certain 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.749
 videos you know the subject perfectly 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:59.449
 without and without wanting to provoke even 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:02.179
 a name to nobody the fact is that good 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:04.039
 Well, there is a desire to see me 

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:06.379
 provocation or that in my videos look 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:08.419
 but provocation and if there is no provocation 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.860
 Well, that is the punishment, not to see the 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.409
 video I see that there is a video that is 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.779
 clearly messing up he sees it in 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:16.610
 one in six subscribers is hurt 

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:18.499
 that hurts because if it is if you have 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.270
 subscribed you are there is for something and it is for 

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:22.459
 something that we give for that I already say the 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:26.300
 message that I am going to give you is not looking for 

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:27.740
 videos in my critics or anything by the 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.559
 you will not find them is not a 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.949
 intention I'm sorry I feel 

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:35.869
 disappointed but there's no more that 's what 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:37.430
 that I'm going to continue making videos in 

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:39.110
 the ones that I tried to have fun and 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.669
 I hope to have the support I would love 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.189
 have support from all my subscribers 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.509
 I wish I could get it now you see that 

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:47.330
 it's a pity about to 

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:49.189
 get a good in 23 11 is brutal 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.649
 for a first game and still I 

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:52.909
 I would have loved to win it if I had not 

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:54.979
 that's why it's nike but it would have 

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:56.749
 done safely but well everything is not 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:58.759
 you can do already you see that I have unlocked 

00:07:56.749 --> 00:08:00.350
 a lot of things is my modern premiere 

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:02.210
 warfare 2 but have a great time 

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.420
 a hug a greeting we see each other and 

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.420
 soon
