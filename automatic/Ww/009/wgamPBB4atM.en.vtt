different<00:01:35.899> than<00:01:36.319> what<00:01:36.499> I<00:01:36.529> had<00:01:36.859> when<00:01:37.069> I<00:01:37.130> was

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
different than what I had when I was

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.219 
different than what I had when I was
young<00:01:37.549> I<00:01:37.850> didn't<00:01:38.600> know<00:01:38.719> there<00:01:38.899> was<00:01:38.990> such<00:01:39.200> a

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
young I didn't know there was such a

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.769 
young I didn't know there was such a
thing<00:01:39.350> as<00:01:39.859> these<00:01:40.069> giant<00:01:40.399> knives<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:41.179> so<00:01:41.479> I

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:41.779 
thing as these giant knives and so I

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:44.639 
thing as these giant knives and so I
naturally<00:01:42.469> kind<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.039> gravitated<00:01:43.700> towards<00:01:43.999> him

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
naturally kind of gravitated towards him

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.050 
naturally kind of gravitated towards him
it<00:01:45.649> doesn't<00:01:45.859> mean<00:01:46.099> that<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:46.310> needed<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:46.880> and

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
it doesn't mean that I needed it and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.669 
it doesn't mean that I needed it and
that<00:01:47.329> sort<00:01:47.569> that<00:01:47.840> kind<00:01:48.079> of<00:01:48.139> brings<00:01:48.349> me<00:01:48.439> back<00:01:48.499> to

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
that sort that kind of brings me back to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.359 
that sort that kind of brings me back to
my<00:01:48.889> original<00:01:49.340> point<00:01:49.789> how<00:01:51.039> you<00:01:52.039> know<00:01:52.130> some

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490

owning knives like this like they take
it<00:02:00.590> almost<00:02:00.829> like<00:02:01.039> it's<00:02:01.479> personally<00:02:02.479> offensive

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
it almost like it's personally offensive
