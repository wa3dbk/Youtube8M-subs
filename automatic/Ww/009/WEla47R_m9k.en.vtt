nailing strips of half-inch MDF to a

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.600 
nailing strips of half-inch MDF to a
baseboard<00:02:29.570> I<00:02:29.810> start<00:02:30.800> with<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.070> top<00:02:31.280> strip

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
baseboard I start with the top strip

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.850 
baseboard I start with the top strip
then<00:02:31.850> add<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.150> side<00:02:32.390> strips<00:02:32.810> taking<00:02:33.620> care<00:02:33.830> to

then add the side strips taking care to

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.560 
then add the side strips taking care to
make<00:02:33.980> sure<00:02:34.340> they'll<00:02:34.550> be<00:02:34.700> square<00:02:35.030> with<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.360> top

up when I get to the end I put in one

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.890 
up when I get to the end I put in one
more<00:03:21.769> slot<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.850> I've<00:03:23.000> covered<00:03:23.269> with<00:03:23.570> tape<00:03:23.840> so

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
more slot that I've covered with tape so

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.640 
more slot that I've covered with tape so
glue<00:03:24.350> won't<00:03:24.500> stick<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:26.049> then<00:03:27.049> use<00:03:27.290> three

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
glue won't stick to it I then use three

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.160 
glue won't stick to it I then use three
small<00:03:28.010> pairs<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.519> wedges<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.330> press<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.750> slats

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
small pairs of wedges to press the slats

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.190 
small pairs of wedges to press the slats
tightly<00:03:30.530> together<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:32.570> create<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.049> necessary

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
tightly together to create the necessary

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.250 
tightly together to create the necessary
pressure<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:34.220> drive<00:03:34.850> each<00:03:35.060> wedge<00:03:35.359> pair<00:03:35.720> tightly

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
pressure I drive each wedge pair tightly

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.949 
pressure I drive each wedge pair tightly
together<00:03:36.410> using<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.400> small<00:03:37.700> mallet

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
together using a small mallet

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.949 
together using a small mallet
then<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.069> use<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.489> mallet<00:03:40.879> and<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.150> scrap<00:03:41.450> block<00:03:41.719> to

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
then I use a mallet and a scrap block to

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.059 
then I use a mallet and a scrap block to
gently<00:03:42.230> pound<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.680> slots<00:03:42.950> flat<00:03:43.340> in<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.609> frame

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
gently pound the slots flat in the frame

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.619 
gently pound the slots flat in the frame
now<00:03:46.069> I<00:03:46.099> apply<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.489> liberal<00:03:46.790> amount<00:03:47.060> of<00:03:47.329> glue<00:03:47.599> to

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
now I apply a liberal amount of glue to

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.050 
now I apply a liberal amount of glue to
the<00:03:47.870> back<00:03:48.049> of<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.319> slats<00:03:48.590> then<00:03:49.579> spread<00:03:49.939> it

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
the back of the slats then spread it

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.399 
the back of the slats then spread it
evenly<00:03:50.209> with<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:50.719> rubber<00:03:50.959> roller<00:03:51.260> I<00:03:56.260> set<00:03:57.260> the
