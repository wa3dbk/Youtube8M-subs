00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.300
 for the assembly of a pergola we must 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.940
 Follow the next steps for your 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.400
 correct installation first 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.500
 we must check the received of the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.110
 materials as well as provide us with 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.869
 gloves and glasses for our protection 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.090
 and basic tools screwdriver 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.580
 electric or drill with tips for 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.310
 screw and everything necessary for a 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.440
 good execution the location according to 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.690
 measure of the pergola and cleaning the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.519
 plot are basic actions for 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.280
 begin the installation of the structure 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.379
 we must also have help for 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.920
 facilitate assembly with greater comfort 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.780
 security and speed the previous study of 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.640
 The drawings included in the kit is 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.920
 primordial for the beginning of the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.019
 construction of the pergola once 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.570
 we have bounded and cleared the plot 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.339
 we will move to take measures and to square 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.559
 the anchor points to the ground 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.110
 taking into account the level and 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.210
 squad we will place the supports of the 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.670
 pillars in the field according to the measurements 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.590
 previously taken and we will help to 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.600
 the loading beams to place the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.149
 level between the supports of the pillars 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.950
 and secure the squad with the help of 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.320
 a lathe 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.719
 the placement of the pillars in vertical 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.700
 in the fittings already positioned and their 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.770
 later screwed will give us the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.469
 enough fixity for the placement of 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.119
 the perimeter loading posts finished 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.710
 the screwing of the pillars to the 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.810
 supports installed in the field 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.819
 We will proceed with the placement of 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.280
 loaders in the position of the grimaces 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.619
 and supports of the pillars and we will go 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.500
 fixing them to the loading bays to give 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.810
 greater subjection to the structure once 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.090
 insured the perimeter we will proceed to the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.459
 placement of the winches to points fixing 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.069
 well the pillars to the loading bays for 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.869
 greater consistency and solidity screwing 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.200
 we have the tips turned to the loading docks 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.659
 and pillars giving even more consistency to 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.640
 the perimeter structure when we have 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.979
 the perimeter structure fixed and 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.200
 insured we will place the pedeol where 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.539
 truss fundamental piece for the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.970
 inclination of waters and support 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.739
 the ridge beam the flag of trusses 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.989
 fixed just as the 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.150
 central loaders and fixed with the 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.760
 screws in both the anterior tendon 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.920
 as later once we have the 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.790
 fence banner fixed to the loading docks 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.760
 is 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.500
 summit beam for the central beam 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.079
 placement of changes in the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.329
 inclination marked by the kit this beam 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.099
 ridge marks the distance between one and 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.299
 another change to facilitate your 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.180
 installation 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.319
 this operation is very simple and fast 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.989
 depending on the dimensions and the 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.849
 Pergola design culminates this 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.040
 last phase with fixing the 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.290
 changes to the loading platforms and the beam 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.810
 ridge resulting in a 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.659
 extraordinary pergola with materials 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.760
 first quality and in a record time the 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.579
 Assembly of a pergola is simple and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.040
 fast being its useful results and 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.519
 satisfactory in any environment that 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.519
 want
