so let me show you how this works let's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.240 
so let me show you how this works let's
go<00:01:50.939> ahead<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.270> flip<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.509> over<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:53.220> first

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
go ahead and flip it over and the first

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.249 
go ahead and flip it over and the first
thing<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.850> find<00:01:54.149> easiest<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.049> just

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
thing that I find easiest to do is just

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.130 
thing that I find easiest to do is just
to<00:01:55.380> open<00:01:55.530> up<00:01:55.860> my<00:01:56.520> iPad<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> Smart<00:01:57.750> Cover<00:01:57.899> is

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
to open up my iPad so the Smart Cover is

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.289 
to open up my iPad so the Smart Cover is
open<00:01:58.469> I'm<00:01:58.560> gonna<00:01:58.649> lay<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:59.100> end<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.520> lay<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
open I'm gonna lay one end in lay the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.719 
open I'm gonna lay one end in lay the
other<00:02:00.329> end<00:02:00.780> actually<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.399> kind<00:02:02.640> of

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
other end actually I like to kind of

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.539 
other end actually I like to kind of
lift<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.329> up<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:04.020> put<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.799> those

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
lift it up so I can put this in those

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.160 
lift it up so I can put this in those
corners<00:02:05.969> first<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.509> see<00:02:06.689> how<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.840> kind

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
corners first and you see how that kind

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.900 
corners first and you see how that kind
of<00:02:07.259> went<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.710> then<00:02:08.099> I'll<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.340> snap<00:02:08.610> these

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
of went in and then I'll just snap these

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.360 
of went in and then I'll just snap these
corners<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.360> then<00:02:09.810> kind<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.800> good<00:02:10.950> practice

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
corners and then kind of a good practice

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.740 
corners and then kind of a good practice
I<00:02:11.489> always<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.060> just<00:02:12.239> go<00:02:12.390> all<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.720> way

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
I always do is I just go all the way

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.730 
I always do is I just go all the way
around

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
around

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.440 
around
my<00:02:13.920> finger<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> make<00:02:14.520> sure<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.850> everything

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
my finger to make sure that everything

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.140 
my finger to make sure that everything
is<00:02:15.600> cinched<00:02:15.990> in<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.100> again<00:02:17.850> take<00:02:18.120> a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
is cinched in and it is again take a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.550 
is cinched in and it is again take a
look<00:02:18.360> right<00:02:18.600> up<00:02:18.720> there<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.320> I'm<00:02:19.380> talking

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
look right up there this one I'm talking

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.250 
look right up there this one I'm talking
about<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.580> goes<00:02:20.850> over<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.570> area<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.110> your

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
about so it goes over that area of your

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.620 
about so it goes over that area of your
smart<00:02:22.710> cover<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.550> keep<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.000> place<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
smart cover to keep it in place and the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.410 
smart cover to keep it in place and the
benefit<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:26.100> can<00:02:26.280> do<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
benefit of that is I can do this and a
