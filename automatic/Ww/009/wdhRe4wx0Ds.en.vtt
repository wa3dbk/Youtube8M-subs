hypotenuse and one of the other sides
this<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.230> need<00:00:10.410> compasses<00:00:10.950> attractor<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
this you need compasses attractor the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.129 
this you need compasses attractor the
left<00:00:12.210> pencil<00:00:13.790> first<00:00:14.790> thing<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.389> need<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.570> do<00:00:15.809> is

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
left pencil first thing we need to do is

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.410 
left pencil first thing we need to do is
visualize<00:00:16.529> over<00:00:17.100> looking<00:00:17.340> at<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.000> we've<00:00:18.180> got<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
visualize over looking at so we've got a

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.230 
visualize over looking at so we've got a
triangle<00:00:18.720> called<00:00:19.140> ABC<00:00:19.820> where<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.060> one

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
triangle called ABC where we have one

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.920 
triangle called ABC where we have one
side<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:22.250> just<00:00:23.250> six<00:00:23.460> centimeters<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.300> then

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
side a be just six centimeters and then

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.330 
side a be just six centimeters and then
assigned<00:00:25.369> BC<00:00:26.369> which<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.760> 11<00:00:27.210> centimeters<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
assigned BC which is 11 centimeters and

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.359 
assigned BC which is 11 centimeters and
the<00:00:29.340> angle<00:00:29.670> opposite<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.300> side<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.130> will<00:00:32.130> be

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the angle opposite that side and will be

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.930 
the angle opposite that side and will be
AC<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:33.360> 90<00:00:33.780> degrees<00:00:34.280> okay<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.790> our

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
AC is 90 degrees okay this is our

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.500 
AC is 90 degrees okay this is our
hypotenuse<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> longest<00:00:37.050> side<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:39.090> but

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
hypotenuse is the longest side so but

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.020 
hypotenuse is the longest side so but
just<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.840> confirm<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:41.370> create<00:00:41.850> ourselves

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
just to confirm that we create ourselves

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.110 
just to confirm that we create ourselves
a<00:00:42.450> right<00:00:42.660> hand<00:00:42.930> our<00:00:43.469> triangle<00:00:44.010> let's<00:00:44.640> call<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
a right hand our triangle let's call it

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:55.900 
a right hand our triangle let's call it
a<00:00:47.899> b<00:00:48.899> c<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:51.510> side<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.110> B<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.739> six<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:54.059> side<00:00:54.329> BC<00:00:54.809> is

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
a b c the side a B is six the side BC is

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.420 
a b c the side a B is six the side BC is
11<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.750> angle<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.410> BAC

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
11 and the angle at BAC

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.319 
11 and the angle at BAC
b<00:00:59.789> NC<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> right<00:01:01.230> angle<00:01:01.850> now<00:01:02.850> my<00:01:02.969> sketch

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
b NC is a right angle now my sketch

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
b NC is a right angle now my sketch
doesn't<00:01:03.690> look<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> writing<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> triangle

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
doesn't look like a writing a triangle

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.070 
doesn't look like a writing a triangle
that<00:01:05.040> doesn't<00:01:05.460> matter<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.270> key<00:01:06.510> pointing

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that doesn't matter the key pointing

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.530 
that doesn't matter the key pointing
you're<00:01:07.590> putting<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> key<00:01:08.729> information<00:01:09.360> if

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you're putting on the key information if

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.660 
you're putting on the key information if
you<00:01:09.659> want<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.900> redraw<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.500> again<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.490> can

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
you want to redraw it again so you can

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.730 
you want to redraw it again so you can
see<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> right<00:01:12.270> angle<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
see the right angle and so be it and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.780 
see the right angle and so be it and
have<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.000> scale<00:01:15.650> okay<00:01:16.650> that'd<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
have it more to scale okay that'd be a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.789 
have it more to scale okay that'd be a
more<00:01:18.000> perfect<00:01:18.390> diagram<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.680> not

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
more perfect diagram but it's not

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.580 
more perfect diagram but it's not
necessarily<00:01:20.369> okay<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.689> key<00:01:21.900> thing<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.170> you're

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
necessarily okay the key thing is you're

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.590 
necessarily okay the key thing is you're
giving<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> representation<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
giving a representation that the you to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.060 
giving a representation that the you to
then<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.930> follow<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:27.650> first<00:01:28.650> thing<00:01:28.770> we'll<00:01:28.890> do

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
then to follow so first thing we'll do

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.460 
then to follow so first thing we'll do
is<00:01:29.100> we'll<00:01:29.280> draw<00:01:29.520> our<00:01:29.820> first<00:01:30.390> side<00:01:30.930> which<00:01:31.320> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
is we'll draw our first side which is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.260 
is we'll draw our first side which is
the<00:01:31.590> shorter<00:01:31.950> side<00:01:32.159> which<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.970> six

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the shorter side which is six

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.090 
the shorter side which is six
centimeters<00:01:33.930> long

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.410 

and<00:01:40.610> that's<00:01:40.760> they<00:01:41.350> be<00:01:43.180> next<00:01:44.180> thing<00:01:44.300> we're

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
and that's they be next thing we're

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.540 
and that's they be next thing we're
going<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:44.570> do<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:45.050> construct<00:01:45.770> our<00:01:46.100> right<00:01:46.340> angle

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
going to do is construct our right angle

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:55.680 
going to do is construct our right angle
back<00:01:46.940> point<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:49.870> line<00:01:50.870> on<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.140> attractor

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.290 

starting<00:01:56.690> from<00:01:56.900> north<00:01:57.200> inside<00:01:58.130> scale<00:01:58.550> moon<00:01:59.000> at

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
starting from north inside scale moon at

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.969 
starting from north inside scale moon at
90<00:01:59.840> degrees<00:02:00.200> that's<00:02:00.530> where<00:02:00.830> my<00:02:01.460> angle<00:02:01.850> is

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
90 degrees that's where my angle is

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.010 
90 degrees that's where my angle is
placing<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.040> marker<00:02:04.250> there<00:02:04.660> right<00:02:05.660> now<00:02:05.960> to

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
placing a marker there right now to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.060 
placing a marker there right now to
connect<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.890> log<00:02:07.100> go<00:02:07.340> with<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:09.070> construction

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
connect that log go with a construction

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.310 
connect that log go with a construction
line<00:02:10.840> downtown<00:02:13.360> lastly<00:02:14.360> we<00:02:14.600> want<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.900> draw<00:02:15.110> my

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
line downtown lastly we want to draw my

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.440 
line downtown lastly we want to draw my
body<00:02:15.530> as<00:02:15.709> we<00:02:15.860> know<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.190> 11<00:02:16.550> centimeters<00:02:17.209> so

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
body as we know it's 11 centimeters so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.510 
body as we know it's 11 centimeters so
we'll<00:02:17.630> set<00:02:17.840> our<00:02:18.020> compasses<00:02:18.590> for<00:02:18.830> 11

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
we'll set our compasses for 11

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:28.290 
we'll set our compasses for 11
centimeters

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.970 

and<00:02:28.600> we<00:02:29.470> will<00:02:29.650> position<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:32.260> fact<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.680> haven't

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
and we will position in fact I haven't

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.160 
and we will position in fact I haven't
actually<00:02:33.130> made<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.670> line<00:02:34.890> long<00:02:35.890> enough<00:02:35.920> I

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
actually made that line long enough I

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.650 
actually made that line long enough I
don't<00:02:38.170> want<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.410> have<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.650> do<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:38.920> again<00:02:39.660> to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
don't want to have to do that again to

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:49.100 
don't want to have to do that again to
extend<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.110> line<00:02:41.380> out

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.560 

so<00:02:49.680> now<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.760> about<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.060> there

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
so now you can just about see there

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.520 
so now you can just about see there
we've<00:02:52.080> got<00:02:52.260> my<00:02:52.410> intersecting<00:02:53.010> point<00:02:55.460> would<00:02:56.460> be

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
we've got my intersecting point would be

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.790 
we've got my intersecting point would be
connect<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:58.710> that<00:02:59.000> now<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.630> right<00:03:01.590> angle

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
connect for that now have a right angle

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.170 
connect for that now have a right angle
