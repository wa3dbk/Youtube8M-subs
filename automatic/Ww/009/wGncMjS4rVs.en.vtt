 Your Lord As From The Same Thing 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.090

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.759
 respect what your father and mother say 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.939

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.470
 I can go 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.600
 Today I invited friends to my party. 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.620
 and must be present when you arrive 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.110

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.190
 workers need to be 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.020
 controlled 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.800
 I'm sorry, but this time, Dad. 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.560
 I'll be able to obey my friend, but the son. 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.660
 when he left repented and when 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.710
 his friends arrived apologized for 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.990
 they went to the end 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:53.660
 however, the father had sent for the 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.660
 another child to whom he made the same request 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.689
 5 your will and read my plans for today 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.739
 they were others but I will come back to them and I will do 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.739
 everything you ask me 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.150
 you are a wise and obedient son 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.140
 second son 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.730
 but after his promise was called by 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.160
 some friends 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.940
 these soon convinced them not to go to the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.880
 came that sirmal he did not fulfill the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.370
 promise to solve from his father 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.920
 by your words and by the reaction 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.290
 who have understood that they agree with 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.670
 the one who obeyed the father's request 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.650
 even though he had said no doubt Jesus and 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.850
 another brought losses and left 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.060
 beat your father 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.430

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.190

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:59.989

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.200
 children should always trust chairs 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.290

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.720
 The most beautiful things children have 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.670
 open heart for truth 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.070
 while adults can not 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.990
 many things because they have the 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.990
 hard and insensitive heart
