00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.280 
essentially taught us that a child that
faces<00:03:59.340> severe<00:03:59.610> violence<00:04:00.060> or<00:04:00.300> severe<00:04:00.810> poverty

faces severe violence or severe poverty

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.710 
faces severe violence or severe poverty
is<00:04:01.530> not<00:04:02.160> unlike<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:02.580> child<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.150> faces<00:04:03.570> what

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
is not unlike a child that faces what

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.930 
is not unlike a child that faces what
Lindsay<00:04:04.080> faced<00:04:04.350> with<00:04:04.560> cancer<00:04:05.040> it's<00:04:05.760> going<00:04:05.880> to

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
Lindsay faced with cancer it's going to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.430 
Lindsay faced with cancer it's going to
threaten<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.360> young<00:04:06.480> child's<00:04:06.900> life<00:04:07.080> what's<00:04:07.320> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
threaten a young child's life what's the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.350 
threaten a young child's life what's the
difference<00:04:07.830> so<00:04:08.370> we<00:04:08.489> started<00:04:08.850> working<00:04:09.239> with

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
difference so we started working with

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.300 
difference so we started working with
Steve's<00:04:09.959> organization<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:10.950> getting<00:04:11.190> in<00:04:11.280> the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
Steve's organization and getting in the

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
we started getting outside America today

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.860 
we started getting outside America today
we<00:04:16.320> have<00:04:16.440> programs<00:04:16.650> in<00:04:17.010> Haiti<00:04:17.280> etc<00:04:18.090> we<00:04:18.540> trained

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
was exactly what we try to do every day

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.140 
was exactly what we try to do every day
spread<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.500> power<00:04:37.740> of<00:04:37.860> optimism<00:04:38.310> he<00:04:38.850> was<00:04:38.970> just

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
spread the power of optimism he was just

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
focused on children that extremely

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.440 
focused on children that extremely
vulnerable<00:04:41.190> so<00:04:41.850> we<00:04:41.970> didn't<00:04:42.210> know<00:04:42.270> if<00:04:42.360> the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
vulnerable so we didn't know if the

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.690 
vulnerable so we didn't know if the
pumpkin<00:04:42.840> festival<00:04:43.230> or<00:04:43.710> other<00:04:44.100> festivals

pumpkin festival or other festivals

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.910 
pumpkin festival or other festivals
we've<00:04:44.910> had<00:04:45.260> we're<00:04:46.260> really<00:04:46.410> going<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.680> do<00:04:46.800> the

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
we've had we're really going to do the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.530 
we've had we're really going to do the
right<00:04:47.070> thing<00:04:47.340> for<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.670> organization<00:04:48.330> but

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
right thing for the organization but

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.960 
right thing for the organization but
they<00:04:49.170> felt<00:04:49.530> good<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.040> we<00:04:50.280> were<00:04:50.370> acting<00:04:50.820> with<00:04:50.940> a

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
they felt good and we were acting with a

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.330 
they felt good and we were acting with a
heart<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:52.050> we<00:04:52.170> have<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:52.560> make<00:04:52.770> decisions<00:04:52.890> based

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
heart so we have to make decisions based

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.610 
heart so we have to make decisions based
on<00:04:53.670> data<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.300> there's<00:04:54.900> nothing<00:04:55.020> wrong<00:04:55.230> with

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
on data and there's nothing wrong with

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.620 
on data and there's nothing wrong with
that<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:55.920> we<00:04:55.980> have<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.250> have<00:04:56.400> science<00:04:56.880> as<00:04:57.090> an

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
that and we have to have science as an

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.780 
that and we have to have science as an
element<00:04:58.020> to<00:04:58.230> our<00:04:58.260> approach<00:04:58.710> but<00:04:59.580> if<00:04:59.670> you've

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
element to our approach but if you've

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.270 
element to our approach but if you've
ever<00:04:59.910> been<00:05:00.030> running<00:05:00.330> with<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.870> dog<00:05:01.200> dogs<00:05:01.980> run

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
better than us they run better than us

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.930 
better than us they run better than us
because<00:05:04.800> they're<00:05:05.040> not<00:05:05.130> thinking<00:05:05.520> about<00:05:05.640> their

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
because they're not thinking about their

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.610 
because they're not thinking about their
blackberry<00:05:06.420> of<00:05:06.540> their<00:05:06.660> iphone<00:05:07.050> they're<00:05:07.590> just
