games you had your LMG or assault rifle
and<00:00:27.269> say<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> switch<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.930> your<00:00:28.080> handgun<00:00:28.500> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
run faster it didn't work the sprinting

speed<00:00:31.949> was<00:00:32.340> set<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.969> class<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.540> had

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
speed was set on the class so if you had

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.780 
speed was set on the class so if you had
a<00:00:33.690> LMG<00:00:34.140> class<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.530> ran<00:00:34.710> an<00:00:34.860> LMG<00:00:35.280> speed<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:35.760> you

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
a LMG class you ran an LMG speed if you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.580 
a LMG class you ran an LMG speed if you
had<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> shotgun<00:00:36.420> class<00:00:36.750> or<00:00:36.930> an<00:00:37.050> at<00:00:37.170> shotgun

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
speed and all the speeds were set now on

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.780 
speed and all the speeds were set now on
the<00:00:40.110> previous<00:00:40.290> black<00:00:40.649> ops<00:00:40.860> 2<00:00:41.070> game<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.520> black

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the previous black ops 2 game and black

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.420 
the previous black ops 2 game and black
ops<00:00:42.000> 1<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.840> was<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.350> opposite<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.190> had<00:00:44.399> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
ops 1 that was the opposite if you had a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.190 
ops 1 that was the opposite if you had a
say<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> sniper<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.840> switch<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
say a sniper out and then you switch to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.840 
say a sniper out and then you switch to
your<00:00:46.260> pistol<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> would<00:00:46.860> run<00:00:47.010> faster<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.610> if

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
your pistol you would run faster then if

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.279 
your pistol you would run faster then if
you<00:00:48.030> would<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.600> run<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:48.930> your<00:00:49.020> sniper

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
you would just to run with your sniper

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.220 
you would just to run with your sniper
out<00:00:49.500> or<00:00:49.710> your<00:00:49.950> LMG<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.660> case<00:00:51.989> for

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
out or your LMG now that is the case for

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.160 
out or your LMG now that is the case for
this<00:00:53.039> game<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.899> that's<00:00:55.050> new

the guns in that category sprint so to
do<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.759> test<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.439> got<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.560> bunch<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.280> data<00:01:23.490> I

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
do this test I got a bunch of data I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.560 
do this test I got a bunch of data I
have<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> bunch<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.970> charts<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> show<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.479> guys

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
have a bunch of charts to show you guys

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.880 
have a bunch of charts to show you guys
in<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> future<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.200> basically<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.590> went<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
in the future but basically I went to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.890 
in the future but basically I went to
overlord<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:27.390> don't<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.720> how<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
overlord and I don't know how to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.420 
overlord and I don't know how to
calculate<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.439> feet<00:01:28.710> per<00:01:28.890> second<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.310> this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
calculate the feet per second in this

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.819 
calculate the feet per second in this
game<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> basically<00:01:30.509> stood<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.259> one<00:01:31.290> spot<00:01:31.680> in

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
game so I basically stood in one spot in

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.590 
game so I basically stood in one spot in
this<00:01:31.920> corner<00:01:32.250> sprinted<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.210> then<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.360> started

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
this corner sprinted and then I started

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.020 
this corner sprinted and then I started
the<00:01:33.659> timer<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.590> editing<00:01:34.950> software<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:35.939> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the timer in the editing software when I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.399 
the timer in the editing software when I
started<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> sprinting<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:37.020> ended<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
started to sprinting and then ended it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.080 
started to sprinting and then ended it
right<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> couldn't<00:01:38.430> see<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.790> corner

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
right when I couldn't see this corner

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.399 
right when I couldn't see this corner
that<00:01:39.270> you'll<00:01:39.420> see<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.659> slow-mo<00:01:40.049> right<00:01:40.229> here

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that you'll see in slow-mo right here

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.539 
that you'll see in slow-mo right here
when<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> couldn't<00:01:41.070> see<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> screen

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
when I couldn't see that on the screen

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.219 
when I couldn't see that on the screen
anymore<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.329> struck<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.810> timer<00:01:43.020> down

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
anymore and then I struck the timer down

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.889 
anymore and then I struck the timer down
and<00:01:43.500> that's<00:01:44.310> how<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> did<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.509> difference

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
and that's how I did the difference

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.179 
and that's how I did the difference
print<00:01:46.140> speeds<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.470> then<00:01:46.590> later<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.860> did<00:01:46.979> that

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
print speeds and then later I did that

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.100 
print speeds and then later I did that
for<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> agility<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.210> marathon<00:01:48.630> perks<00:01:48.930> as

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
for the agility and marathon perks as

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.469 
for the agility and marathon perks as
well<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.340> first<00:01:50.549> thing<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:51.000> here<00:01:51.180> before

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
well so first thing to know here before

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
well so first thing to know here before
we<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.659> into<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> weapons<00:01:52.409> speed<00:01:52.590> charts<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
we get into the weapons speed charts the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.789 
we get into the weapons speed charts the
sprint<00:01:53.790> duration<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.689> each<00:01:54.899> weapon<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.530> going

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
sprint duration for each weapon is going

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.440 
sprint duration for each weapon is going
to<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.040> 4<00:01:56.250> seconds<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.880> run<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.210> 4

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to be 4 seconds so you can run for 4

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.539 
to be 4 seconds so you can run for 4
seconds<00:01:57.930> straight<00:01:58.140> until<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.340> start

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
seconds straight until you have to start

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.200 
seconds straight until you have to start
walking<00:01:59.700> again

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
walking again

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.020 
walking again
but<00:02:00.630> also<00:02:00.869> for<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.710> combat<00:02:02.189> knife<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.909> like

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
but also for the combat knife just like

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.789 
but also for the combat knife just like
in<00:02:03.149> black<00:02:03.329> ops<00:02:03.509> 2<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.990> run<00:02:04.200> longer<00:02:04.619> with

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
in black ops 2 you can run longer with

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.119 
in black ops 2 you can run longer with
that<00:02:05.009> out<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:07.110> sprint<00:02:07.500> duration<00:02:07.890> time

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that out and the sprint duration time

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.309 
that out and the sprint duration time
for<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> combat<00:02:08.700> knife<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.030> 7<00:02:09.330> seconds<00:02:09.690> which

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
for the combat knife is 7 seconds which

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.589 
for the combat knife is 7 seconds which
is<00:02:10.349> 3<00:02:10.679> seconds<00:02:11.009> longer<00:02:11.220> than<00:02:11.580> all<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.390> other

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
is 3 seconds longer than all the other

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.850 
is 3 seconds longer than all the other
weapons<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.020> let's<00:02:13.170> get<00:02:13.290> into<00:02:13.650> these

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
weapons so let's get into these

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.560 
weapons so let's get into these
weapon<00:02:14.070> trucks<00:02:14.280> I'm<00:02:14.400> not<00:02:14.610> going<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.180> be<00:02:15.420> going

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
weapon trucks I'm not going to be going

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.750 
weapon trucks I'm not going to be going
over<00:02:15.810> each<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.410> every<00:02:16.710> detail<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.310> data<00:02:17.520> for

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
over each and every detail and data for

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.800 
over each and every detail and data for
each<00:02:17.910> weapon<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.480> look<00:02:18.600> at<00:02:18.690> that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
each weapon you can look at that

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.570 
each weapon you can look at that
yourself<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:19.560> things<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.980> note<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.550> that

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
yourself but things to note here is that

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.070 
yourself but things to note here is that
the<00:02:20.760> combat<00:02:21.150> knife<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.510> handguns<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
the combat knife the handguns and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.500 
the combat knife the handguns and
actually<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.590> shotguns<00:02:23.130> not<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.430> SMGs<00:02:23.970> or

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
actually the shotguns not the SMGs or

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.850 
actually the shotguns not the SMGs or
not<00:02:24.720> like<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.960> smg's<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.500> shotguns

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
not like the smg's and the shotguns

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.050 
not like the smg's and the shotguns
don't<00:02:26.010> run<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.250> same<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.610> shotguns<00:02:26.940> are

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
don't run the same the shotguns are

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.640 
don't run the same the shotguns are
actually<00:02:27.300> faster<00:02:27.600> than<00:02:27.630> smg's<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
actually faster than smg's so the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.140 
actually faster than smg's so the
comment<00:02:28.950> knife<00:02:29.040> handgun<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.520> shotguns<00:02:29.940> are

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
comment knife handgun and shotguns are

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.390 
comment knife handgun and shotguns are
your<00:02:30.330> fastest<00:02:30.780> weapons<00:02:31.200> with<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> sprint<00:02:32.160> time

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
your fastest weapons with a sprint time

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.070 
your fastest weapons with a sprint time
in<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.700> testing<00:02:33.180> which<00:02:33.300> was<00:02:33.510> two<00:02:33.660> point<00:02:33.900> nine

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
in this testing which was two point nine

in this testing which was two point nine
three<00:02:34.110> three<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.680> then<00:02:35.190> your<00:02:35.550> longest

you LM G's in your riot shield which had

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.470 
you LM G's in your riot shield which had
a<00:02:40.650> sprint<00:02:41.100> time<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.459> three<00:02:41.670> point<00:02:41.940> six<00:02:42.240> six

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
a sprint time of three point six six

a sprint time of three point six six
seven<00:02:42.810> seconds<00:02:43.410> now<00:02:44.100> after<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.610> tested<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
seven seconds now after I tested the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.770 
seven seconds now after I tested the
just<00:02:46.170> raw<00:02:46.740> gun<00:02:47.430> sprint<00:02:48.000> testing<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.510> went<00:02:48.720> ahead

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
just raw gun sprint testing I went ahead

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.780 
just raw gun sprint testing I went ahead
and<00:02:48.959> added<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.650> perk<00:02:49.950> agility<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.520> one<00:02:50.640> class

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
and added the perk agility to one class

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.100 
and added the perk agility to one class
and<00:02:50.940> then<00:02:51.060> marathon<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.540> one<00:02:51.660> class<00:02:51.840> and

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
and then marathon to one class and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.500 
and then marathon to one class and
tested<00:02:52.560> those<00:02:52.739> speeds<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.250> agility<00:02:54.060> it

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
tested those speeds and agility it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.500 
tested those speeds and agility it
seemed<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:55.020> increase<00:02:55.910> every<00:02:56.910> weapon<00:02:57.120> speed

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
seemed to increase every weapon speed

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.720 
seemed to increase every weapon speed
proportionately<00:02:58.170> except<00:02:58.830> for<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.040> SMGs<00:02:59.580> the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.760 
proportionately except for the SMGs the
SMG<00:03:00.209> seemed<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.600> get<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.930> little<00:03:01.230> speed<00:03:01.500> boost

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
SMG seemed to get a little speed boost

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.530 
SMG seemed to get a little speed boost
that<00:03:01.950> actually<00:03:02.250> made<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> sprint<00:03:02.850> faster<00:03:03.330> than

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
that actually made a sprint faster than

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.750 
that actually made a sprint faster than
the<00:03:03.780> combat<00:03:04.110> knife<00:03:04.260> handguns<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.370> these

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the combat knife handguns and these

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.699 
the combat knife handguns and these
shotguns<00:03:06.330> which<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> little<00:03:07.200> weird<00:03:07.470> but

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
shotguns which is a little weird but

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.320 
shotguns which is a little weird but
that's<00:03:08.010> how<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.459> turned<00:03:08.489> out<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.970> be<00:03:09.060> after

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
that's how it turned out to be after

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.210 
that's how it turned out to be after
multiple<00:03:09.660> tests<00:03:09.989> after<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.560> saw<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.770> she<00:03:11.040> went

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
multiple tests after I saw a she went

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.560 
multiple tests after I saw a she went
back<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.489> tested<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.880> more<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:12.180> that's<00:03:12.330> what

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
back and tested it more but that's what

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.570 
back and tested it more but that's what
it<00:03:12.660> turned<00:03:12.930> out<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.500> be<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.980> then<00:03:14.130> marathon

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
it turned out to be and then marathon

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.340 
it turned out to be and then marathon
didn't<00:03:14.940> do<00:03:15.090> anything<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.690> increase<00:03:16.170> your

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
didn't do anything to increase your

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.130 
didn't do anything to increase your
speed<00:03:16.650> but<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.190> does<00:03:17.430> run<00:03:17.730> faster<00:03:18.239> then<00:03:18.720> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
speed but it does run faster then the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.289 
speed but it does run faster then the
perk<00:03:19.410> agility<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.070> will<00:03:20.220> cover<00:03:20.519> momentarily

perk agility that will cover momentarily

so<00:03:22.080> things<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.500> take<00:03:22.769> away<00:03:23.130> from<00:03:23.190> this

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
so things to take away from this

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.120 
so things to take away from this
complete<00:03:24.239> data<00:03:24.480> chart<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.650> fastest

vks will run at the same speed so like I

said<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.470> actually<00:03:49.650> didn't<00:03:49.980> emphasize<00:03:50.400> on<00:03:50.549> this

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
said I actually didn't emphasize on this

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.430

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
like the assault rifles that's gonna be

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.570

your fastest sniper rifles and the V or
the<00:03:59.610> Lynx<00:03:59.970> is<00:04:00.060> actually<00:04:00.420> slower<00:04:00.780> than<00:04:01.110> the

speed<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.660> chainsaw<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.140> kind<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.500> like

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
speed and the chainsaw is kind of like

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
it like it has a lot around so you spray

shotguns<00:04:30.630> at<00:04:30.780> 100%<00:04:31.560> or<00:04:32.070> one<00:04:32.490> speed<00:04:32.850> then<00:04:33.330> I

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
shotguns at 100% or one speed then I

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.510 
shotguns at 100% or one speed then I
calculated<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.050> speed<00:04:34.200> percentages<00:04:35.010> which

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
calculated the speed percentages which

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.980 
calculated the speed percentages which
are<00:04:35.670> actually<00:04:35.910> supported<00:04:36.330> by<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.480> in-game

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.990 
are actually supported by the in-game
stat<00:04:37.410> bar<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.190> percentages<00:04:38.639> turned<00:04:38.910> out

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
stat bar and the percentages turned out

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.550 
stat bar and the percentages turned out
to<00:04:39.120> be<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.330> knife<00:04:39.510> in<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.110> handguns<00:04:40.470> and

now that we got over all those different
data<00:05:08.310> points<00:05:08.760> now<00:05:09.120> is<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.600> big<00:05:09.870> question<00:05:10.169> that

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
data points now is the big question that

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.170 
data points now is the big question that
which<00:05:10.770> should<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.100> use<00:05:11.310> agility<00:05:11.669> or<00:05:11.940> marathon

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
which should you use agility or marathon

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.170 
which should you use agility or marathon
and<00:05:12.450> which<00:05:12.660> in<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.110> long<00:05:13.410> run<00:05:13.740> will<00:05:14.490> benefit

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
and which in the long run will benefit

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.159 
and which in the long run will benefit
you<00:05:15.330> better<00:05:15.540> because<00:05:15.720> if<00:05:15.780> you<00:05:15.840> guys<00:05:15.960> don't

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
you better because if you guys don't

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.840 
you better because if you guys don't
know<00:05:16.290> these<00:05:16.620> maps<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.130> ghosts<00:05:17.430> as<00:05:17.550> of<00:05:17.730> right

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
know these maps and ghosts as of right

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.700 
know these maps and ghosts as of right
now<00:05:17.910> a<00:05:18.240> good<00:05:18.660> seventy-five<00:05:19.140> percent<00:05:19.350> of<00:05:19.560> them

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
now a good seventy-five percent of them

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.080 
now a good seventy-five percent of them
are<00:05:19.830> huge<00:05:20.040> and<00:05:20.280> you're<00:05:20.370> going<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.610> be<00:05:20.820> running

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
are huge and you're going to be running

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.630 
are huge and you're going to be running
a<00:05:21.330> lot<00:05:21.570> of<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.840> time<00:05:22.229> so<00:05:22.500> marathon<00:05:23.130> allows<00:05:23.490> you

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
a lot of the time so marathon allows you

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.390 
a lot of the time so marathon allows you
to<00:05:23.729> run<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.180> sprint<00:05:24.630> unlimitedly<00:05:25.290> and<00:05:25.620> agility

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
to run a sprint unlimitedly and agility

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.010 
to run a sprint unlimitedly and agility
just<00:05:26.700> gives<00:05:26.880> you<00:05:27.030> an<00:05:27.150> extra<00:05:27.389> speed<00:05:27.690> boost<00:05:27.870> as

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
just gives you an extra speed boost as

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.870 
just gives you an extra speed boost as
you<00:05:28.139> can<00:05:28.260> see<00:05:28.410> in<00:05:28.590> these<00:05:28.740> data<00:05:28.979> points<00:05:29.310> so<00:05:29.669> for

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
you can see in these data points so for

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.790 
you can see in these data points so for
this<00:05:30.030> test<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:30.450> just<00:05:30.660> extended<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.380> sprint

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
this test I just extended the sprint

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.860 
this test I just extended the sprint
time<00:05:32.160> all<00:05:32.460> the<00:05:32.729> way<00:05:32.850> out<00:05:33.030> to<00:05:33.240> this<00:05:33.360> rock<00:05:33.630> all

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.170 
time all the way out to this rock all
the<00:05:34.229> way<00:05:34.380> in<00:05:34.590> the<00:05:34.710> back<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.100> I<00:05:35.460> sprinted<00:05:36.000> with

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
the way in the back and I sprinted with

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.270 
the way in the back and I sprinted with
the<00:05:36.300> agility<00:05:36.690> I<00:05:36.810> sprinted<00:05:37.530> for<00:05:37.710> four<00:05:37.890> seconds

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
the agility I sprinted for four seconds

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.830 
the agility I sprinted for four seconds
and<00:05:38.430> then<00:05:38.610> stopped<00:05:39.060> for<00:05:39.300> four<00:05:39.450> seconds<00:05:39.780> to

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
and then stopped for four seconds to

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.540 
and then stopped for four seconds to
regenerate<00:05:40.320> my<00:05:40.410> health<00:05:40.590> completely<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.250> then

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
regenerate my health completely and then

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.130 
regenerate my health completely and then
sprinted<00:05:42.030> again<00:05:42.270> that<00:05:42.450> was<00:05:42.540> he<00:05:42.630> fastest<00:05:42.990> way

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
sprinted again that was he fastest way

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.630 
sprinted again that was he fastest way
actually<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:43.500> get<00:05:43.680> from<00:05:43.830> point<00:05:43.979> A<00:05:44.190> to<00:05:44.220> point<00:05:44.400> B

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
actually to get from point A to point B

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.190 
actually to get from point A to point B
instead<00:05:45.240> of<00:05:45.330> waiting<00:05:45.539> three<00:05:45.630> seconds<00:05:46.140> and

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
instead of waiting three seconds and

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.270 
instead of waiting three seconds and
then<00:05:46.320> sprinting<00:05:46.620> for<00:05:46.710> three<00:05:46.830> more<00:05:46.979> seconds

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
then sprinting for three more seconds

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.710 
then sprinting for three more seconds
and<00:05:47.370> waiting<00:05:47.669> three<00:05:47.789> seconds<00:05:48.090> that<00:05:48.450> was<00:05:48.600> the

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
and waiting three seconds that was the

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.210 
and waiting three seconds that was the
most<00:05:48.870> efficient<00:05:49.320> way<00:05:49.410> and<00:05:49.680> as<00:05:49.890> you<00:05:49.950> can<00:05:50.100> see

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
most efficient way and as you can see

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.650 
most efficient way and as you can see
these<00:05:50.370> times<00:05:50.729> that<00:05:50.940> I<00:05:51.000> calculated<00:05:51.419> out

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
these times that I calculated out

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.210 
these times that I calculated out
overall<00:05:52.500> when<00:05:52.620> you're<00:05:52.740> running<00:05:52.860> long

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
overall when you're running long

overall when you're running long
distances<00:05:53.300> marathon<00:05:54.300> will<00:05:54.510> actually<00:05:54.870> come

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
distances marathon will actually come

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.020 
distances marathon will actually come
out<00:05:55.140> to<00:05:55.350> save<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:55.680> one<00:05:55.919> to<00:05:56.130> two<00:05:56.340> seconds<00:05:56.880> on

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
out to save you one to two seconds on

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.260 
out to save you one to two seconds on

each class so marathon if you guys I

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.670 
each class so marathon if you guys I
would<00:06:00.570> definitely<00:06:01.020> run<00:06:01.169> that<00:06:01.350> instead<00:06:01.620> of

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
would definitely run that instead of

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.380 
would definitely run that instead of
agility<00:06:02.070> unless<00:06:02.460> you<00:06:02.580> want<00:06:02.760> to<00:06:02.850> run<00:06:03.000> fast<00:06:03.240> on

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
agility unless you want to run fast on

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.200 
agility unless you want to run fast on
like<00:06:03.539> a<00:06:03.570> freefall<00:06:04.110> map<00:06:04.320> freefall<00:06:05.220> or<00:06:05.580> strikes

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
like a freefall map freefall or strikes

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.400 
like a freefall map freefall or strikes
on<00:06:06.360> those<00:06:06.570> are<00:06:06.690> smaller<00:06:06.900> mats<00:06:07.080> but<00:06:07.200> you're

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
on those are smaller mats but you're

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.810 
on those are smaller mats but you're
playing<00:06:07.530> on<00:06:07.800> these<00:06:07.950> other<00:06:08.130> bigger<00:06:08.430> maps<00:06:08.640> which

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
playing on these other bigger maps which

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.090 
playing on these other bigger maps which
about<00:06:09.060> 75%<00:06:09.750> of<00:06:09.780> these<00:06:09.900> maps<00:06:10.080> are<00:06:10.229> I<00:06:10.440> recommend

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
about 75% of these maps are I recommend

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.590 
about 75% of these maps are I recommend
you<00:06:11.190> use<00:06:11.220> marathon<00:06:11.789> because<00:06:12.030> it<00:06:12.240> will<00:06:12.419> give

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
you use marathon because it will give

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.180 
you use marathon because it will give
you<00:06:12.810> it<00:06:13.110> will<00:06:13.350> get<00:06:13.500> you<00:06:13.620> from<00:06:13.740> point<00:06:13.830> A<00:06:14.160> to

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
you it will get you from point A to

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.430 
you it will get you from point A to
point<00:06:14.340> B<00:06:14.580> faster<00:06:15.570> overall<00:06:15.990> if<00:06:16.200> you're<00:06:16.320> running

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
point B faster overall if you're running

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.960 
point B faster overall if you're running
long<00:06:16.680> distances<00:06:16.710> but<00:06:17.550> if<00:06:17.669> you're<00:06:17.820> running

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
long distances but if you're running

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.430 
long distances but if you're running
shorter<00:06:18.330> distances<00:06:18.750> definitely<00:06:19.140> go<00:06:19.200> ahead

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
shorter distances definitely go ahead

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.770 
shorter distances definitely go ahead
and<00:06:19.620> use<00:06:19.770> agility<00:06:20.400> that<00:06:20.610> will<00:06:21.180> get<00:06:21.390> you<00:06:21.539> from

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
and use agility that will get you from

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.610 
and use agility that will get you from
point<00:06:21.810> A<00:06:22.080> to<00:06:22.110> point<00:06:22.260> B

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
point A to point B

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.279 
point A to point B
faster<00:06:23.370> than<00:06:23.580> marathon<00:06:24.030> at<00:06:24.300> short<00:06:24.810> distances

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
faster than marathon at short distances

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.560 
faster than marathon at short distances
but<00:06:25.350> again<00:06:25.800> Call<00:06:26.520> of<00:06:26.550> Duty<00:06:26.850> ghosts<00:06:27.030> has<00:06:27.240> a<00:06:27.270> lot

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
but again Call of Duty ghosts has a lot

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.240 
but again Call of Duty ghosts has a lot
of<00:06:27.600> map<00:06:27.870> or<00:06:28.080> a<00:06:28.140> lot<00:06:28.320> of<00:06:28.440> giant<00:06:28.830> maps<00:06:28.979> and<00:06:29.130> that's

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
of map or a lot of giant maps and that's

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.770 
of map or a lot of giant maps and that's
why<00:06:29.340> I<00:06:29.400> decided<00:06:29.550> to<00:06:29.850> do<00:06:30.030> this<00:06:30.210> kind<00:06:30.419> of<00:06:30.539> test

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
why I decided to do this kind of test

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.450 
why I decided to do this kind of test
because<00:06:31.110> you're<00:06:31.710> gonna<00:06:31.830> be<00:06:31.950> sprinting<00:06:32.280> for<00:06:32.430> a

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
because you're gonna be sprinting for a

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.060 
because you're gonna be sprinting for a
lot<00:06:32.760> of<00:06:32.940> long<00:06:33.150> distances<00:06:33.690> in<00:06:33.900> this<00:06:34.200> game<00:06:34.500> so

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
lot of long distances in this game so

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.159 
lot of long distances in this game so
that<00:06:35.340> wraps<00:06:35.640> up<00:06:35.820> this<00:06:36.330> video<00:06:36.599> we<00:06:36.900> took<00:06:37.050> a<00:06:37.110> look

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
that wraps up this video we took a look

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.839 
that wraps up this video we took a look
at<00:06:37.470> all<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.710> different<00:06:37.979> weapon<00:06:38.400> speeds<00:06:38.669> they

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
at all the different weapon speeds they

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.900 
at all the different weapon speeds they
did<00:06:39.060> change<00:06:39.300> from<00:06:39.450> black<00:06:39.630> ops<00:06:39.810> 2<00:06:40.050> and<00:06:40.260> you<00:06:40.740> can

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
did change from black ops 2 and you can

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.180 
did change from black ops 2 and you can
see<00:06:41.300> which<00:06:41.810> weapons<00:06:42.260> which<00:06:42.530> faster<00:06:42.860> so<00:06:43.040> if

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
see which weapons which faster so if

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.800 
see which weapons which faster so if
you're<00:06:43.370> using<00:06:43.700> overkill<00:06:44.360> you<00:06:44.450> can<00:06:44.600> switch

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
you're using overkill you can switch

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.350 
you're using overkill you can switch
from<00:06:44.840> your<00:06:45.620> LMG<00:06:46.310> to<00:06:46.430> your<00:06:46.520> combat<00:06:46.880> knife<00:06:47.060> or<00:06:47.270> to

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
from your LMG to your combat knife or to

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.000 
from your LMG to your combat knife or to
your<00:06:47.450> SMG<00:06:47.840> to<00:06:47.960> run<00:06:48.110> faster<00:06:48.500> or<00:06:48.530> you<00:06:48.740> can<00:06:48.890> just

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
your SMG to run faster or you can just

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.740 
your SMG to run faster or you can just
switch<00:06:49.190> from<00:06:49.400> your<00:06:49.880> regular<00:06:50.120> weapon<00:06:50.600> to<00:06:50.720> a

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
switch from your regular weapon to a

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.050 
switch from your regular weapon to a
combat<00:06:51.110> knife<00:06:51.290> handgun<00:06:51.680> or<00:06:51.860> shotgun<00:06:52.340> to<00:06:52.850> run

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
combat knife handgun or shotgun to run

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.330 
combat knife handgun or shotgun to run
faster<00:06:53.450> shotguns<00:06:53.930> are<00:06:54.200> one<00:06:54.740> of<00:06:54.860> the<00:06:54.980> fastest

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
faster shotguns are one of the fastest

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.220 
faster shotguns are one of the fastest
guns<00:06:55.520> faster<00:06:55.910> than<00:06:56.030> smg's<00:06:56.660> in<00:06:56.900> this<00:06:57.050> game

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.230 
guns faster than smg's in this game

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.810 
guns faster than smg's in this game
which<00:06:57.380> was<00:06:57.530> a<00:06:57.590> little<00:06:57.680> shocking<00:06:57.830> to<00:06:58.160> me<00:06:58.370> but

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
which was a little shocking to me but

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.610 
which was a little shocking to me but
yeah<00:06:59.000> that's<00:06:59.060> pretty<00:06:59.450> much<00:06:59.570> it<00:06:59.990> you<00:07:00.320> know<00:07:00.440> if

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
yeah that's pretty much it you know if

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.690 
yeah that's pretty much it you know if
you<00:07:00.680> guys<00:07:00.770> could<00:07:00.980> drop<00:07:01.190> it<00:07:01.340> like<00:07:01.460> on<00:07:01.610> this

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
you guys could drop it like on this

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.280 
you guys could drop it like on this
video<00:07:01.910> that<00:07:02.270> should<00:07:02.360> be<00:07:02.480> a<00:07:02.510> lot<00:07:02.990> because<00:07:03.170> this

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290 
video that should be a lot because this

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.570 
video that should be a lot because this
video<00:07:03.440> was<00:07:03.620> actually<00:07:03.680> posed<00:07:03.950> to<00:07:04.010> be<00:07:04.100> up<00:07:04.220> Monday

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
video was actually posed to be up Monday

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.980 
video was actually posed to be up Monday
I<00:07:04.610> started<00:07:04.910> working<00:07:05.180> on<00:07:05.270> a<00:07:05.330> Saturday<00:07:05.810> night

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
I started working on a Saturday night

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.290 
I started working on a Saturday night
but<00:07:06.530> it<00:07:06.650> just<00:07:06.770> took<00:07:06.950> a<00:07:07.100> lot<00:07:07.310> more<00:07:07.370> time<00:07:08.000> than<00:07:08.030> I

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
but it just took a lot more time than I

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.460 
but it just took a lot more time than I
thought<00:07:08.510> it<00:07:08.660> would<00:07:08.780> especially<00:07:09.140> from<00:07:09.440> like

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
thought it would especially from like

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.050 
thought it would especially from like
last<00:07:09.800> year<00:07:09.980> because<00:07:10.130> it<00:07:10.280> took<00:07:10.550> me<00:07:10.640> like<00:07:10.790> a<00:07:10.880> day

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 
last year because it took me like a day

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.370 
last year because it took me like a day
or<00:07:11.210> two<00:07:11.300> to<00:07:11.330> make<00:07:11.480> it<00:07:11.690> but<00:07:12.080> now<00:07:12.200> it's<00:07:12.320> coming

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
or two to make it but now it's coming

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.020 
or two to make it but now it's coming
out<00:07:12.590> one<00:07:12.770> day<00:07:12.920> or<00:07:13.160> Wednesday<00:07:13.520> two<00:07:13.580> days<00:07:13.700> later

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
out one day or Wednesday two days later

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.550 
out one day or Wednesday two days later
than<00:07:14.180> expected<00:07:14.300> so<00:07:14.720> it<00:07:14.810> did<00:07:14.990> take<00:07:15.170> a<00:07:15.200> lot<00:07:15.410> of

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 
than expected so it did take a lot of

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.810 
than expected so it did take a lot of
time<00:07:15.710> to<00:07:15.860> make<00:07:15.980> so<00:07:16.370> if<00:07:16.430> you<00:07:16.490> guys<00:07:16.550> could<00:07:16.700> like

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820 
time to make so if you guys could like

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.860 
time to make so if you guys could like
if<00:07:16.970> you<00:07:17.030> do<00:07:17.090> you<00:07:17.150> know<00:07:17.240> I<00:07:17.270> don't<00:07:17.480> ask<00:07:17.600> that<00:07:17.750> a

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:17.870
