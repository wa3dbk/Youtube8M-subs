00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
it probably not gonna do a lot because

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.199 
it probably not gonna do a lot because
these<00:03:05.799> things<00:03:05.980> are<00:03:06.189> really<00:03:06.370> defensive<00:03:06.879> even

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
these things are really defensive even

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.270 
these things are really defensive even
though<00:03:07.329> i<00:03:07.359> think<00:03:07.659> i<00:03:07.750> am<00:03:07.930> max<00:03:08.680> attacked<00:03:09.069> with

though i think i am max attacked with
life<00:03:09.519> or<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:11.049> hand<00:03:11.200> with<00:03:11.290> earthquake<00:03:11.739> it

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
life or so I hand with earthquake it

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.190 
life or so I hand with earthquake it
does<00:03:12.010> alright<00:03:12.909> damage<00:03:13.299> I<00:03:13.419> guess<00:03:13.599> considering
