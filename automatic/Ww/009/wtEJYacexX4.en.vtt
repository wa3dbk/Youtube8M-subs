00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.470 
hi everybody today I want to do a video

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.240 
hi everybody today I want to do a video
on<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:07.569> perfumes<00:00:08.110> that<00:00:08.230> I'm<00:00:08.470> really<00:00:08.920> loving

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
on the perfumes that I'm really loving

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.900 
on the perfumes that I'm really loving
right<00:00:09.610> now

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
right now

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.850 
right now
it's<00:00:10.450> not<00:00:10.690> my<00:00:10.870> whole<00:00:11.170> perfume<00:00:11.650> collection

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
it's not my whole perfume collection

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.610 
it's not my whole perfume collection
it's<00:00:12.610> just<00:00:12.970> the<00:00:13.360> ones<00:00:13.570> that<00:00:13.750> I<00:00:13.990> seem<00:00:14.440> to<00:00:14.470> be

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
it's just the ones that I seem to be

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.380 
it's just the ones that I seem to be
reaching<00:00:14.920> for<00:00:16.350> time<00:00:17.350> and<00:00:17.530> time<00:00:17.680> again

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
reaching for time and time again

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.500 
reaching for time and time again
especially<00:00:19.390> since<00:00:19.840> its<00:00:19.990> cooling<00:00:20.440> off<00:00:20.620> and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
especially since its cooling off and

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.400 
especially since its cooling off and
maybe<00:00:22.510> be<00:00:22.660> more<00:00:22.780> cool

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
maybe be more cool

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.720 
maybe be more cool
so<00:00:23.650> I<00:00:23.680> guess<00:00:23.920> it'd<00:00:24.100> be<00:00:24.900> my<00:00:25.900> fall<00:00:26.730> favorite

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730
