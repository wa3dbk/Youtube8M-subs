00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
that my skills come where a ball on a

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.840 
that my skills come where a ball on a
good<00:01:37.650> day<00:01:37.800> potentially<00:01:38.310> not<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.580> mile<00:01:38.700> now

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
good day potentially not your mile now

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.460

why<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.120> try<00:01:39.300> and<00:01:39.360> use<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.660> skills<00:01:39.870> of<00:01:40.110> trying

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
why not try and use the skills of trying

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.340 
why not try and use the skills of trying
to<00:01:40.500> swing<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> ball<00:01:41.160> and<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.230> that's

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
to swing the ball and and I think that's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.030 
to swing the ball and and I think that's
the<00:01:43.440> bottom<00:01:43.560> line

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
