00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.690
 hello today we will tell you 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.770
 Pro attack first number to start 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.870
 attack we need to chain an opponent 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.760
 rival and fettered by different 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.170
 technical actions such as 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.540
 find or false step 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.120
 besides that we still have to go with 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.970
 attack lines the very first and easiest 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.460
 find i'm picturing any bump in any 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.950
 rival level to chain 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.340
 him or trick him 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.610
 i can pull it to the belly area in 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.040
 head area and after that hit 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.810
 to the same or in the head or in the live 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.050
 there is showing in the head can attack 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:54.190
 belly with either hand verder my head 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:58.600
 I beat live or jerk in the head and beat in 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.060
 head or jerk in the belly hit in the head 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.540
 or do if find a move 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.780
 show showed and beat advance here 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.509
 the simplest thing you can do sometimes 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.880
 it is convenient to trick people who 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.829
 put in an open rack that is 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.170
 eg 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:21.429
 tall people people with game fighting style 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.609
 prefer to stand many with hand 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:27.009
 right hand near the chin and left 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.109
 lowered hand on what advantage 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.990
 such a stand again a man who 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.850
 it is convenient to work from it all the strikes from here 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.829
 start the same way and it's not clear what 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:42.939
 This is a blow that from the bottom that side 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:45.520
 that a direct blow of these bottom up and flies 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.709
 clearly in a straight line and so man 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.840
 constantly running this hand jerks 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:51.909
 trick and incomprehensible where and how we 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.079
 start attacking they all fight 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.050
 almost equally what else 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.450
 open stand advantage 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.310
 for a tall person if a rival 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.770
 will start not attacking I always 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.600
 I can also with the help finta manage 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.490
 his hold the front arm extended and 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.310
 longer arm front if 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.010
 the opponent is taller and for example faster 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.850
 or at all we are afraid to attack in 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.720
 open rack 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.270
 then a false step comes to replace fin tu 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.280
 closed rack i start doing false 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.380
 step and as soon as i'm sure that 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.530
 rival clamped and blocked I can 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.360
 attack ie order gu 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.640
 solid as soon as it closed i 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.380
 I can start my own as well, except that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.080
 we are Finnish and make a false move 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.670
 not bad and go off the line of attack that is 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.590
 after we made a movie or 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.810
 a false step is desirable for us to shift to 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.670
 side left or right you can immediately with 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.010
 attack and without attack so you can 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.380
 attack and now i will go away in 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.380
 punch 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.220
 first i pull or finch 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.230
 or make a false step certifies that 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.760
 that he will not attack and after 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.100
 of this 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.739
 running aside and stab it 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.520
 there can be any blow 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:14.010
 side uppercut 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.730
 or the same straight line and after that i 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.770
 I develop attack because I want my right hand 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.770
 hard finch 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.740
 also effective way to start an attack 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.510
 after find a lei false step is 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.270
 such technical action in as angle 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.730
 precisely or a set of measures to and bias and 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.000
 and I pull a false step 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.720
 waiting for the opponent to start chipping 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.970
 prepare and technical action 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.460
 as soon as i am sure that man will not 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.280
 beat me for an appointment or just not ready 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.150
 fully attack I shift to the left 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.380
 or right with a clone or dive or 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.870
 immediately two acted lesson lesson and 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.620
 I pull on 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:09.110
 he shackles dodging attack defend 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.110
 jerking finch diving attack and defend 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.420
 also effective means to start 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.300
 attack is stance change after 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.220
 Finch slopes right I do falsehood 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.160
 I'm waiting for a chance when the opponent starts 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:33.530
 shackled shying away and changing stance with 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.090
 blow and continue finchu jerk 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.950
 make stay shy i leave pi 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.950
 neo such continue through running 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.030
 in my case I was always comfortable 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.280
 melee and for that I tried 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.140
 quickly shorten one of 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.480
 ways to start an attack is quick 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.320
 shortening the distance i do the false 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.110
 body movement 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.600
 finch and quickly reduce the distance with 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.950
 help for burden and closed rack 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.380
 I yank up the opponent's impact 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.890
 and to start packing myself I do 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:22.410
 step and tightly closed from here 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:23.150
 develop so I pull forcing you 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.280
 forged 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.610
 I go up a closed rack and develop here 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.610
 attack 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.240
 quite a few important nuance if here 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.180
 is the fact that you have to sit down 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.250
 it is necessary to close your legs tightly 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.720
 very tight and let's go we open a little 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.400
 corpus and for gave to it not 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:53.250
 miss we have to sit tight on 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:59.600
 legs i mean this is all the work i do 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:01.920
 in the quagmire I jerk and walk up crouching 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.350
 here already starting so i mean 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.920
 secure a squat for him 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:11.490
 georgu didnâ€™t hit the hull waiting for him 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.020
 sku suited and here attack more 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.490
 challenging attack development 1 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.800
 is a blow with care in the direction of jerking 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:24.879
 waiting for the opponent to be prepared forged 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.419
 and hit as if you were going to meet 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:33.909
 either the far side or the front arm 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:38.650
 jerking and going away with a punch it 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:41.409
 can be any up side lateral or uppercut 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.860
 direct and after that I develop attack 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.860
 as I want 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:59.849
 and so we can summarize 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:02.529
 attack using find a false step 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:04.569
 closed rack open rack with 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:07.020
 using the slope of the narkov steps toward 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:09.300
 or strikes aside 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:13.659
 subscribe to the channel will be suede 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:18.039
 train good luck if i hit left 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:20.710
 I avoid right if I hit it right 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:24.669
 dodging to the left and so what is needed for 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:29.080
 bias inside I provoke an opponent 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:32.279
 any blow from the far hand provokes 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.279
 and wait for his answer
