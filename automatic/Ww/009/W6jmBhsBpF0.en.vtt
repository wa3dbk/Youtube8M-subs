00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
near the end of sep tember I believe see

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.490 
near the end of sep tember I believe see
it's<00:05:10.620> that<00:05:11.460> big<00:05:11.669> in<00:05:11.700> my<00:05:11.910> hand<00:05:12.260> it's<00:05:13.260> a<00:05:13.380> lot

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
it's that big in my hand it's a lot

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.490 
it's that big in my hand it's a lot
nicer<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:14.250> have<00:05:14.400> on<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.789> side<00:05:15.000> of<00:05:15.030> your<00:05:15.270> head

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
nicer to have on the side of your head

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.570 
nicer to have on the side of your head
rather<00:05:16.500> than<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:17.120> big<00:05:18.120> square<00:05:19.190> you<00:05:20.190> know<00:05:20.220> or

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
rather than a big square you know or

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.360 
rather than a big square you know or
even<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.630> bigger<00:05:21.840> drift<00:05:22.260> which<00:05:22.470> was<00:05:22.680> about

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
even the bigger drift which was about

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.620 
even the bigger drift which was about
that<00:05:26.370> much<00:05:26.610> bigger<00:05:27.320> so<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.590> mean<00:05:29.419> you<00:05:30.419> can't

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.320 
that much bigger so I mean you can't
beat<00:05:30.780> it<00:05:30.810> really<00:05:31.200> and<00:05:31.410> you've<00:05:31.590> got<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:32.330> LED
