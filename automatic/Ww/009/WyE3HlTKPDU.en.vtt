00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:09.090
 hello today with camerawoman i have here 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.130
 a few fruits and that the first one 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.259
 I eat this season 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.070
 cherry meyers for those you 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.170
 not knowing 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.240
 that's just an apple, so to speak 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.310
 and they are in different ways 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.439
 sizes i have a big fruit here 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.000
 for example, it is still quite small 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.670
 but also smaller ones come 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.719
 now from spain and I have paid 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.890
 five euros per kilo in organic quality 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.469
 You can also do it at high, for example 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.210
 provide cost health food stores or simply times 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.200
 ask if they can order with 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.750
 and you can tell by the fact that they are ripe 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.390
 are where you simply here this 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.399
 einbuchtung look here and see if 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.579
 it is still very firm as here 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.579
 example 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.410
 or very soft as here you see that 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.410
 is a bit dented 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.240
 and now I will be one 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.360
 best I take mine 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.010
 little ones here 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.600
 and you can of course also 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.720
 break up I am actually on 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.090
 I love to do it now 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 it must go so easily the fruit 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.000
 nevertheless feels like a well I 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.490
 sometimes a choice cooked if you can 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.920
 update exactly and from the inside it looks 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:41.580
 then look like this 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:43.350
 and tastes like a kind of pear will 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.820
 I may say with a slight 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.470
 strawberry and a lot of vanilla very much 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.450
 happy the first time she did 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.950
 she had eaten there at all 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.570
 not and then waited a year 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.820
 I bought it again and then 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.030
 softly in love and now it's kind of like 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.740
 my favorite red and she has too 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.580
 some kernels i try here now 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.340
 integrate 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.979
 This is how the people know how they can look like 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.280
 one is not with , maybe that's it 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.280
