when<00:00:35.739> looking<00:00:35.950> at<00:00:36.070> china<00:00:36.400> i<00:00:36.520> was<00:00:36.790> looking<00:00:37.120> at

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
when looking at china i was looking at

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.910 
when looking at china i was looking at
that<00:00:37.270> place<00:00:37.870> where<00:00:38.020> all<00:00:38.080> these<00:00:38.170> materials<00:00:38.710> are

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
that place where all these materials are

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.799 
that place where all these materials are
coming<00:00:39.220> in<00:00:39.370> from<00:00:39.400> all<00:00:39.730> around<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.330> world<00:00:40.390> and

then these factories are this place
where<00:00:42.850> all<00:00:42.970> these<00:00:43.120> materials<00:00:43.510> get<00:00:43.720> formed

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
where all these materials get formed

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.960 
where all these materials get formed
into<00:00:44.440> products<00:00:44.830> and<00:00:44.949> sent<00:00:45.190> back<00:00:45.220> out<00:00:45.550> around

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
into products and sent back out around

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.580 
into products and sent back out around
the<00:00:46.120> world<00:00:46.300> a<00:00:48.480> lot<00:00:49.480> of<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.750> recycled

doing to the planet then people will
either<00:01:31.810> agree<00:01:32.170> or<00:01:32.229> disagree<00:01:32.530> by<00:01:33.250> not<00:01:33.700> saying

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.109 

it<00:01:41.440> looks<00:01:41.680> like<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:41.860> bombed-out<00:01:42.159> landscape<00:01:42.909> but

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.660 
it looks like a bombed-out landscape but
it<00:01:43.240> isn't<00:01:43.659> it<00:01:43.840> what<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.409> is<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:44.950> landscape

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
it isn't it what it is it's a landscape

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it isn't it what it is it's a landscape
that<00:01:45.939> is<00:01:46.750> an<00:01:46.930> intentional<00:01:47.439> one<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:52.240> not<00:01:52.630> a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
that is an intentional one it's not a

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.320 
that is an intentional one it's not a
simple<00:01:53.229> right<00:01:53.860> or<00:01:53.979> wrong<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.789> needs<00:01:55.119> a<00:01:55.300> whole

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
simple right or wrong it needs a whole

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.990
