left which is so two strands between

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.890 
left which is so two strands between
makes<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.950> harder<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.209> when<00:03:19.420> here<00:03:19.750> is

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
makes it harder so that when here is

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.920 
makes it harder so that when here is
