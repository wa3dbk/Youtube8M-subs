FD<00:00:11.120> 2102<00:00:12.120> EU<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.530> I'll<00:00:13.590> open<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> box<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.280> take

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
FD 2102 EU so I'll open the box and take

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.640 
FD 2102 EU so I'll open the box and take
it<00:00:14.549> outside<00:00:14.759> okay<00:00:17.449> so<00:00:18.449> first<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.199> all<00:00:19.350> we've

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
it outside okay so first of all we've

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.750 
it outside okay so first of all we've
got<00:00:19.920> battery<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> lithium<00:00:22.080> battery<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
got battery this is a lithium battery a

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.300 
got battery this is a lithium battery a
cr123a<00:00:24.289> hopefully<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.439> would<00:00:25.560> generate<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
cr123a hopefully this would generate a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.310 
cr123a hopefully this would generate a
fair<00:00:26.580> bit<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.760> battery<00:00:27.599> life<00:00:27.750> before<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.170> have

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
fair bit of battery life before you have

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.109 
fair bit of battery life before you have
to<00:00:28.439> change<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.699> instructions

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
to change it I think the instructions

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.959 
to change it I think the instructions
say<00:00:30.330> about<00:00:30.929> two<00:00:31.199> years<00:00:31.500> which<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.130> which<00:00:32.880> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
say about two years which is which is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
say about two years which is which is
about<00:00:33.120> double<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.930> standard<00:00:34.710> battery

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
about double what the standard battery

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.380 
about double what the standard battery
life<00:00:35.160> would<00:00:35.370> show<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> door<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.149> window

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
life would show on a door and window

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.290 
life would show on a door and window

battery<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:53.940> obviously<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.690> presumably

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
battery on obviously and presumably

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.099 
battery on obviously and presumably
that's<00:00:55.710> where<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> button<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.820> inclusion<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that's where the button for inclusion it

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.750 
that's where the button for inclusion it
also<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.370> are<00:00:59.460> no<00:00:59.609> other

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
also is because there are no other

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.029 
also is because there are no other
buttons<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.390> switches<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.199> outside<00:01:01.920> of

buttons or switches on the outside of
the<00:01:02.129> device<00:01:03.379> there's<00:01:04.379> some<00:01:04.530> instructions<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the device there's some instructions to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.600 
the device there's some instructions to
help<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.700> how<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:07.610> we've

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
also got a screw kit and sticky pad to

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.890 
also got a screw kit and sticky pad to
an<00:01:13.530> able<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.979> attach<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.729> device<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> your

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
an able you to attach the device to your

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.800 
an able you to attach the device to your
door<00:01:16.140> or<00:01:16.290> window<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.210> finally<00:01:18.210> we've<00:01:18.390> got<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
door or window and finally we've got the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.950 
door or window and finally we've got the
looks<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.770> magnet<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.720> open

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
looks like the magnet and it's just open

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:33.649 
looks like the magnet and it's just open
this<00:01:22.290> up<00:01:31.310> yep<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.549> here's<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> here's<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
this up yep so here's the here's the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.510 
this up yep so here's the here's the
magnet<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.229> again<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:34.979> another<00:01:35.220> sticky

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
magnet and again you get another sticky

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.700 
magnet and again you get another sticky
pad<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.360> attach<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.049> door

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
pad with that to attach it to the door

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.990 
pad with that to attach it to the door
or<00:01:37.860> window<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.960> some<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.229> screws<00:01:41.189> inside<00:01:41.729> as

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
or window and some more screws inside as

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.200 
or window and some more screws inside as
well<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:43.229> depend<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.250> your<00:01:44.490> preference<00:01:45.119> of

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
well and depend on your preference of

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.810 
well and depend on your preference of
attachment<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:47.070> guessing<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.490> this

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
attachment and so I'm guessing that this

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.560 
attachment and so I'm guessing that this
attaches<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.689> actual<00:01:48.780> frame<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:50.780> then

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
attaches to the actual frame and then

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.170 
attaches to the actual frame and then
some<00:01:54.570> quick<00:01:54.869> look<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:58.710> looks<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.460> this

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
some quick look it looks like this this

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.990 
some quick look it looks like this this
comes<00:02:00.509> out<00:02:00.780> no<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.320> doesn't<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.759> don't<00:02:02.759> think

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
comes out no it doesn't I don't think

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060 
comes out no it doesn't I don't think
you<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.200> an<00:02:04.439> extender

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
you know I think this is an extender

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.930 
you know I think this is an extender
block<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.540> show<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.530> raise

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
block if I can show you that to raise

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.150 
block if I can show you that to raise
your<00:02:08.940> device<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.539> slightly<00:02:10.289> off<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.709> wall<00:02:10.890> or

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
your device and slightly off the wall or

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.650 
your device and slightly off the wall or
frame

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
frame

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.760 
frame
to<00:02:12.780> get<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.020> closer<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.620> match<00:02:14.340> up<00:02:14.520> with<00:02:14.670> this

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
to get it closer to match up with this

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.190 
to get it closer to match up with this
unit<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:17.370> looks<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:17.850> an<00:02:18.120> extender<00:02:19.050> block

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
unit it looks like an extender block

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.220 
unit it looks like an extender block
there<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.820> thinking<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.180> with<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> bit

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
there so thinking that this with a bit

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.620 
there so thinking that this with a bit
of<00:02:22.350> pushing<00:02:22.950> tugging<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:24.120> would<00:02:24.300> come<00:02:24.480> off

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630

and unable to get the screws on there as

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.890 
and unable to get the screws on there as
one<00:02:28.760> particular<00:02:29.760> size<00:02:29.970> than<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.570> wanted

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900
