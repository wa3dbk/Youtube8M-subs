00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.680
 i 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.619
 very good to everyone here the catv mv les 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.390
 I bring lego movie the step by step guide 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.270
 to unlock in this video the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.029
 brick number 6 quick construction 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.240
 to get it we will need the three 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.680
 instruction sheets that we see above 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.480
 zero of three good for the first and 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.460
 easy to get at the start of the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.520
 game is to be here with a hammer 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.320
 tire once it passes in the first 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.040
 phase of the story mode you get in the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.500
 pneumatic hammer and you can access it 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.380
 now let's go for the second the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.890
 second sheet for this we would need already 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.410
 vitruvius and his rod we include here and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.310
 now with super cool we go up the house for 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.530
 here for this door itself 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.730
 well that door opens with the lever 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.900
 that we just passed we jump now to 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.530
 other bars 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.290
 we are throwing the boat and here we have the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.540
 second instruction sheet we go to the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.970
 third 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.040
 for this we would need to spend the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.440
 story mode first and unlock the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.530
 super boss 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.290
 the villain to bad megan ever done 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.390
 this we burst an assumption a supposed 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.030
 machine that is around here we assemble the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.630
 platform to be able to take the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.310
 huge legs that are and now we 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.900
 we go there we go there 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.960
 where we have to go to get 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.490
 the third instruction that is this 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.439
 part gets to repeat one of the videos 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.509
 but good now it's based on the 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.610
 instructions not on the fifth cat 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.580
 although basically you find two 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.619
 things in the same place and it opens what 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.689
 is the train station and now yes 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.520
 yes we go through here we go with 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.920
 the same that can enter us the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.479
 legs and here we have the third sheep 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.140
 discussions and now we're going to 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.360
 ride we come here where we have 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.160
 here the platform with m of course is 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.260
 the only one who can press this and now 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.700
 yes yes let's try your luck now 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.400
 you know what the minigame is like so what 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.459
 I'm going to go to the fire 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.480
 I'm going to be here we have the chiringuito 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.819
 of hot dogs designs let's think 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.459
 that the hot dog or sumo the side 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.079
 Whatever we do, basically we do not know 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.870
 can take anything because these legos and 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:35.019
 the toys do not drink and eat worth there 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.879
 we have fast decoration that what 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.099
 which serves is fast construction to the 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.200
 time to assemble the puzzles they do it more 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.819
 quick than usual I hope that this will 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.310
 Say, it has been Alex's help and it has 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.900
 liked subscribe if you are not and if 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.120
 do you have any questions or something that does not 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.310
 you know ask me when I read it 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.409
 I will answer you I hope to see you in the next 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.409
 video up guys and girls
