00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
training and then if I need to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.460 
training and then if I need to
supplement<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.180> after<00:00:51.420> training<00:00:51.810> then<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.410> do

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
supplement that after training then I do

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.280 
supplement that after training then I do
so<00:00:55.460> my<00:00:56.460> pregame<00:00:56.850> routine<00:00:56.970> is<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.140> it's

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
so my pregame routine is just that it's

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.290 
so my pregame routine is just that it's
it's<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.920> ritual<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> same

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
things all the time and that that helps

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.069 
things all the time and that that helps
me<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.550> prepare<00:01:02.910> going<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.660> physically

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it's very specific you know number wise

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.690 
it's very specific you know number wise
very<00:01:09.750> specific<00:01:10.170> because<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.740> allows<00:01:10.920> me<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
very specific because it allows me to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
very specific because it allows me to
get<00:01:11.820> into<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.210> groove<00:01:12.420> mentally<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> need

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
get into the groove mentally that I need

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.230 
get into the groove mentally that I need
to<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> little<00:01:14.310> bit<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.549> long<00:01:14.880> strides

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
to be in do a little bit of long strides

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.300 
to be in do a little bit of long strides
across<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> box<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.440> high<00:01:16.620> knees<00:01:16.890> then

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
across the box you know high knees then

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.070 
across the box you know high knees then
I'll<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> short<00:01:17.850> segment<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.450> static

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
I'll do a short segment of static

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.950 
I'll do a short segment of static
stretching<00:01:19.440> hamstrings<00:01:20.450> quads<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.870> then

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
stretching hamstrings quads and then

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.840 
stretching hamstrings quads and then
I'll<00:01:22.049> go<00:01:22.170> into<00:01:22.350> my<00:01:23.130> ball<00:01:23.370> handling<00:01:23.520> routine

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
I'll go into my ball handling routine

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.880 
I'll go into my ball handling routine
exercise<00:01:24.690> with<00:01:24.960> my<00:01:25.080> goalkeeper<00:01:25.440> coach<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
exercise with my goalkeeper coach and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.100 
exercise with my goalkeeper coach and
that<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.520> basically<00:01:26.640> consists<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.510> some

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that just basically consists of some

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.930 
that just basically consists of some
straightforward<00:01:28.380> volleys<00:01:29.040> him<00:01:29.610> following

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
straightforward volleys him following

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.910 
straightforward volleys him following
the<00:01:30.030> ball<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.390> myself<00:01:30.900> catching<00:01:31.080> that<00:01:31.770> will

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the ball and myself catching that will

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.039 
the ball and myself catching that will
lead<00:01:32.040> into<00:01:32.190> half<00:01:32.520> volleys<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:33.960> hit

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
lead into half volleys and then we hit

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.210 
lead into half volleys and then we hit
the<00:01:34.200> ground<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.440> little<00:01:34.530> bit<00:01:34.680> first<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.070> low

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
the ground a little bit first in low

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
the ground a little bit first in low
ball<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.940> turn<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> little<00:01:36.510> bit<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:36.840> we

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
ball we turn it up a little bit and we

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
ball we turn it up a little bit and we
take<00:01:37.680> some<00:01:37.860> shots<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.430> take<00:01:38.580> some<00:01:38.700> crosses

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
take some shots and we take some crosses

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.060 
take some shots and we take some crosses
and<00:01:39.360> some<00:01:39.479> more<00:01:39.630> half<00:01:39.810> volleys<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.920> might

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and some more half volleys and we might

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.230 
and some more half volleys and we might
do<00:01:41.189> some<00:01:41.369> shooting<00:01:41.700> which<00:01:41.820> would<00:01:41.939> be<00:01:42.030> less

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
do some shooting which would be less

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.429 
do some shooting which would be less
predictable<00:01:42.360> which<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.900> what<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.080> see<00:01:43.260> in<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
predictable which is what you see in the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.780 
predictable which is what you see in the
game<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.250> don't<00:01:44.400> know<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.520> they're<00:01:44.670> going

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
game so you don't know if they're going

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.550
