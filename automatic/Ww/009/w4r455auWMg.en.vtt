00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.720 

okay<00:00:00.930> let's<00:00:01.140> check<00:00:01.199> out<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.860> echo<00:00:02.159> head<00:00:02.370> this

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
okay let's check out the echo head this

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.550 
okay let's check out the echo head this
gives<00:00:02.909> you<00:00:03.030> six<00:00:03.360> different<00:00:03.659> types<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.319> delays

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
gives you six different types of delays

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.210 
gives you six different types of delays
from<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.009> hi-fi<00:00:05.879> digital<00:00:06.660> delay<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.680> tape

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
from a hi-fi digital delay to a tape

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.540 
from a hi-fi digital delay to a tape
echo<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.940> analog<00:00:09.420> delay<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:10.110> multi-tap<00:00:10.980> and

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
echo and analog delay a multi-tap and

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.669 
echo and analog delay a multi-tap and
right<00:00:11.910> now<00:00:12.030> we're<00:00:12.150> going<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.330> listen<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
right now we're going to listen to the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.589 
right now we're going to listen to the
high<00:00:14.190> five<00:00:14.490> where<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> repeats<00:00:15.269> are<00:00:15.420> going<00:00:15.540> to

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
high five where the repeats are going to

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.769 
high five where the repeats are going to
be<00:00:15.690> really<00:00:15.960> exactly<00:00:16.590> exactly<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.789> same<00:00:18.029> as<00:00:18.480> my

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
be really exactly exactly the same as my

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.130 
be really exactly exactly the same as my
input<00:00:19.170> signal<00:00:20.570> let's<00:00:21.570> go<00:00:21.689> ahead<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.020> listen

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
input signal let's go ahead and listen

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:45.660 
input signal let's go ahead and listen
to<00:00:22.350> that

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.959 

so<00:00:47.079> create<00:00:48.079> some<00:00:48.289> great<00:00:48.409> effects<00:00:48.949> let's<00:00:49.850> go

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
so create some great effects let's go

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.910 
so create some great effects let's go
ahead<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:50.300> check<00:00:50.420> out<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.780> tape<00:00:50.989> echo<00:00:51.199> I<00:00:51.589> just

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
ahead and check out the tape echo I just

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.770 
ahead and check out the tape echo I just
want<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:52.129> crank<00:00:52.760> up<00:00:52.909> the<00:00:53.059> feedback<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:53.659> let

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
want to crank up the feedback and let

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.430 
want to crank up the feedback and let
just<00:00:54.140> let<00:00:54.199> you<00:00:54.530> hear<00:00:55.089> the<00:00:56.089> repeats<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:57.110> notice

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
just let you hear the repeats and notice

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.200 
just let you hear the repeats and notice
how<00:00:57.589> they<00:00:57.769> kind<00:00:57.949> of<00:00:58.070> deteriorate<00:00:58.699> as<00:00:59.059> they

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
how they kind of deteriorate as they

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.600 
how they kind of deteriorate as they
trail<00:00:59.449> off<00:00:59.659> just<00:00:59.869> like<00:01:00.019> an<00:01:00.799> older<00:01:01.190> tape<00:01:01.399> echo

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
trail off just like an older tape echo

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.579 
trail off just like an older tape echo
unit<00:01:02.030> like<00:01:02.149> an<00:01:02.269> Echoplex<00:01:02.570> I'm<00:01:03.229> gonna<00:01:03.350> go<00:01:03.500> ahead

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
unit like an Echoplex I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.669 
unit like an Echoplex I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:03.739> dial<00:01:04.009> in<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.369> sky<00:01:04.640> at<00:01:04.820> idle<00:01:06.399> okay<00:01:07.399> and

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679 
and dial in the sky at idle okay and

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:35.500 
and dial in the sky at idle okay and
let's<00:01:09.679> listen<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.100> a<00:01:10.130> nice<00:01:10.369> slap<00:01:10.759> echo<00:01:11.030> on<00:01:11.630> the

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.140 

pretty<00:01:36.510> cool<00:01:36.720> stuff<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:38.730> has<00:01:39.120> a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
pretty cool stuff it also has a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.320 
pretty cool stuff it also has a
multi-tap<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:41.280> light<00:01:41.460> setting<00:01:41.910> which

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
multi-tap the light setting which

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.780 
multi-tap the light setting which
creates<00:01:43.050> a<00:01:43.170> rhythmic<00:01:43.620> delay<00:01:43.980> is<00:01:44.250> great<00:01:44.550> for

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
creates a rhythmic delay is great for

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
creates a rhythmic delay is great for
playing<00:01:44.970> rhythms<00:01:45.390> with<00:01:45.600> style<00:01:45.870> and<00:01:46.050> like<00:01:46.260> u2

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
playing rhythms with style and like u2

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.590 
playing rhythms with style and like u2
or<00:01:46.980> the<00:01:47.280> edge<00:01:47.430> I'm<00:01:48.120> just<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> go<00:01:48.510> ahead

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
or the edge I'm just going to go ahead

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.250 
or the edge I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:01:48.780> dial<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.230> setting<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.250> here<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
and dial up that setting in here and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:02:07.630 
and dial up that setting in here and
play<00:01:52.260> some<00:01:52.290> ideas<00:01:52.800> for<00:01:52.979> you

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:19.880 

speed<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.789> up<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.330> little<00:02:09.360> bit<00:02:18.680> okay

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
speed that up just a little bit okay

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.190 
speed that up just a little bit okay
very<00:02:20.280> cool<00:02:20.489> we<00:02:20.640> have<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> tap<00:02:21.120> tempo<00:02:21.420> input<00:02:22.050> as

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
very cool we have a tap tempo input as

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.839 
very cool we have a tap tempo input as
well<00:02:22.319> we<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.920> spillover<00:02:23.220> circuit

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
well we have the spillover circuit

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.680 
well we have the spillover circuit
allows<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.810> delay<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.410> naturally<00:02:26.310> dictate<00:02:26.760> if

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
allows the delay to naturally dictate if

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.509 
allows the delay to naturally dictate if
we<00:02:27.840> choose<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.290> plug<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.160> second

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
we choose to plug in to the second

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.670 
we choose to plug in to the second
