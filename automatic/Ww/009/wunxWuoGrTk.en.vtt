whether it's true or not but I've heard

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.400 
whether it's true or not but I've heard
that<00:00:16.650> during<00:00:17.100> World<00:00:17.279> War<00:00:17.460> two<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.330> OSS<00:00:18.960> used

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
that during World War two the OSS used

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.310 
that during World War two the OSS used
to<00:00:19.529> use<00:00:19.680> cow<00:00:19.920> suits<00:00:20.869> supposedly<00:00:21.869> they<00:00:22.020> sent

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
to use cow suits supposedly they sent

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.290
