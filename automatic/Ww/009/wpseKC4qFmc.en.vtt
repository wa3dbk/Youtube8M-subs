00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.860
 Smells the direction you need to escape properly 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.880

 Costa Rica Police said 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.580
 times 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:38.820
 Here we have bought basil

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.160
 good fruits do not make him big and 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.120
 seem are but the good fruits 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.220

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.350
 these apples also have several more 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.850

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.580
