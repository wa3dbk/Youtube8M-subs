negative status screen we've got them
likely<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> liked<00:01:24.030> about<00:01:24.180> him<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:24.869> I

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
likely what I liked about him and what I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.050 
likely what I liked about him and what I
didn't<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.409> basically<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> fact

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
didn't like basically I like the fact

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
didn't like basically I like the fact
that<00:01:27.180> he<00:01:27.299> made<00:01:27.600> loads<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.930> runs<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
that he made loads of runs and is a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.200 
that he made loads of runs and is a
great<00:01:29.070> finisher<00:01:29.430> from<00:01:29.670> inside<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.119> outside

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
great finisher from inside and outside

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.999 
great finisher from inside and outside
the<00:01:30.570> box<00:01:30.750> he's<00:01:31.200> actually<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.619> good<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the box he's actually really good in the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.499 
the box he's actually really good in the
air<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.220> well<00:01:32.400> he<00:01:32.549> went<00:01:32.700> quite<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> lot<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
air as well he went quite a lot which I

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.420 
air as well he went quite a lot which I
put<00:01:33.750> into<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> box<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.409> him<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> didn't

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
put into the box on him but I didn't

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.580 
put into the box on him but I didn't
like<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> fact<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.939> he<00:01:36.180> had<00:01:36.270> 56<00:01:36.720> strength<00:01:37.110> he

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
like the fact that he had 56 strength he

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.990 
like the fact that he had 56 strength he
did<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.860> pushed<00:01:38.130> off<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> bull<00:01:38.549> quite<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> lot

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
did get pushed off the bull quite a lot

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.700 
did get pushed off the bull quite a lot
of<00:01:39.150> time<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.659> I'll<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.110> he<00:01:40.259> doesn't<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
of time and I'll see he doesn't have the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.350 
of time and I'll see he doesn't have the
force<00:01:41.070> Oscar<00:01:41.460> move<00:01:41.640> now<00:01:41.790> into<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> fourth

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
force Oscar move now into the fourth

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.690 
force Oscar move now into the fourth
place<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.049> top<00:01:43.259> five<00:01:43.500> strikers<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.549> have

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
place of this top five strikers we have

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.399 
place of this top five strikers we have
got<00:01:44.880> Daniel<00:01:45.180> Sturridge<00:01:45.479> everyone<00:01:46.229> should

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
got Daniel Sturridge everyone should

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.050 
got Daniel Sturridge everyone should
know<00:01:46.619> him<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:46.979> being<00:01:47.070> an<00:01:47.220> overpass<00:01:47.670> striker

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
know him for being an overpass striker

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.760 
know him for being an overpass striker
he<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.630> probably<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> best<00:01:49.320> strikers

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
he is probably one of the best strikers

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.429 
he is probably one of the best strikers
for<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> price<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.579> fee<00:01:51.000> 14<00:01:51.540> he's<00:01:51.990> got<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> great

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
for the price on fee 14 he's got a great

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.990 
for the price on fee 14 he's got a great
left<00:01:52.710> foot<00:01:52.890> from<00:01:53.040> inside<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.549> outside<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
left foot from inside and outside the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.450 
left foot from inside and outside the
box<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.420> he's<00:01:54.840> also<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.409> got<00:01:55.649> bad<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.189> foot

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
box and he's also not got bad right foot
but<00:01:56.640> that's<00:01:57.180> probably<00:01:57.360> maybe<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.780> bad<00:01:58.020> thing

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
but that's probably maybe a bad thing

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.780 
but that's probably maybe a bad thing
about<00:01:58.380> him<00:01:58.770> his<00:01:58.890> wife<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.340> not<00:01:59.460> great<00:01:59.759> but

still he's got great finish from inside
the<00:02:02.250> box<00:02:02.460> he's<00:02:02.670> got<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> such<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> powerful<00:02:03.509> shot

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990

it's not upgraded player as I thought
that'd<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> lot<00:02:10.530> better<00:02:10.739> card<00:02:11.129> than<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that'd be a lot better card than the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.729 
that'd be a lot better card than the
other<00:02:11.520> one<00:02:11.760> he's<00:02:12.180> got<00:02:12.360> 90<00:02:12.629> pays<00:02:12.810> 83<00:02:13.349> dribbling

other one he's got 90 pays 83 dribbling
and<00:02:13.860> since

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and since

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.460

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
shooting a great card he's very quick

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.050 
shooting a great card he's very quick
the<00:02:16.770> defender<00:02:17.100> will<00:02:17.220> never<00:02:17.430> catch<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.910> with

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
the defender will never catch up with

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.610 
the defender will never catch up with
him<00:02:18.180> his<00:02:18.600> left<00:02:18.840> foots<00:02:18.990> obviously<00:02:19.350> very<00:02:19.560> good

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
him his left foots obviously very good

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.890 
him his left foots obviously very good
he's<00:02:20.160> actually<00:02:20.310> quite<00:02:20.550> totally<00:02:20.940> 6<00:02:21.210> 30<00:02:21.480> wins<00:02:21.810> a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
he's actually quite totally 6 30 wins a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.510 
he's actually quite totally 6 30 wins a
bit<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.200> air<00:02:22.350> but<00:02:22.800> his<00:02:22.920> right<00:02:23.130> foot<00:02:23.340> is

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
bit in the air but his right foot is

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.770 
bit in the air but his right foot is
probably<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.970> thing<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.330> couldn't<00:02:24.660> like

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
probably the thing I couldn't like

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.300 
probably the thing I couldn't like
didn't<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.230> about<00:02:25.380> him<00:02:25.650> but<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.890> didn't<00:02:26.220> find

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
didn't like about him but I didn't find

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.740 
didn't like about him but I didn't find
a<00:02:26.460> lot<00:02:26.640> which<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.880> didn't<00:02:27.120> like<00:02:27.210> about<00:02:27.240> him<00:02:27.690> he

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
a lot which I didn't like about him he

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.510 
a lot which I didn't like about him he
was<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:27.990> very<00:02:28.260> good<00:02:28.290> player<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.190> four

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
was a very good player with the four

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.920 
was a very good player with the four
star<00:02:29.730> skimmers<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.180> freestyle<00:02:30.570> weak<00:02:30.720> foot

star skimmers and a freestyle weak foot

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.330 
star skimmers and a freestyle weak foot
so<00:02:31.050> he<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.320> beat<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.530> player<00:02:31.860> for<00:02:32.040> strength

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
so he can beat the player for strength

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.010 
so he can beat the player for strength
and<00:02:32.460> skill<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.330> he's<00:02:33.450> got<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.690> medium

now<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.900> did<00:04:16.260> have<00:04:16.380> some<00:04:16.530> negatives<00:04:16.950> but<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.190> also

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
now I did have some negatives but I also

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.130 
now I did have some negatives but I also
had<00:04:17.549> some<00:04:17.700> good<00:04:17.880> positives<00:04:18.299> as<00:04:18.450> well<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.870> he

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
had some good positives as well and he

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.949 
had some good positives as well and he
cost<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.500> thousand<00:04:19.919> coins<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.459> basically<00:04:21.269> he's

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
cost a thousand coins and basically he's

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.480 
cost a thousand coins and basically he's
got<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.140> great<00:04:22.349> finish<00:04:22.710> in<00:04:22.830> him<00:04:23.010> he<00:04:23.160> sent<00:04:23.370> he's

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
got a great finish in him he sent he's

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.550 
got a great finish in him he sent he's
got<00:04:23.640> 71<00:04:23.940> pace<00:04:24.300> which<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.660> did<00:04:24.840> think<00:04:25.080> he<00:04:25.530> was

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
got 71 pace which I did think he was

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.290 
got 71 pace which I did think he was
quite<00:04:25.830> bad<00:04:26.010> at<00:04:26.160> accelerating<00:04:26.640> but<00:04:27.000> other<00:04:27.150> than

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
quite bad at accelerating but other than

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.830 
quite bad at accelerating but other than
that

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
that

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.360 
that
he<00:04:27.960> isn't<00:04:28.260> really<00:04:28.470> good<00:04:28.650> at<00:04:28.740> winning<00:04:29.010> headed

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
he isn't really good at winning headed

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.159 
he isn't really good at winning headed
but<00:04:29.520> his<00:04:29.790> positives<00:04:30.210> are<00:04:30.389> he's<00:04:30.660> got<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.870> great

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
but his positives are he's got a great

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.510 
but his positives are he's got a great
finish<00:04:31.530> shot<00:04:31.710> if<00:04:31.830> haven't<00:04:32.100> tried<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:32.460> out
