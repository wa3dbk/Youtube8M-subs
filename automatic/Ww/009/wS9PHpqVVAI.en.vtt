already know this weekend is going to be
double<00:00:07.440> dungeoneering<00:00:08.040> experience<00:00:08.610> and

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
double dungeoneering experience and

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.220 
double dungeoneering experience and
tokens<00:00:09.389> so<00:00:09.570> i<00:00:09.630> thought<00:00:09.780> i'd<00:00:09.929> make<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.110> little

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
tokens so i thought i'd make a little

dungeoneering mini guide to help out
some<00:00:12.480> people<00:00:12.780> who<00:00:13.259> might<00:00:13.290> not<00:00:13.679> have<00:00:13.740> done<00:00:13.980> as

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
some people who might not have done as

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.099 
some people who might not have done as
much<00:00:14.130> since<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.880> USA<00:00:15.240> was<00:00:15.420> released<00:00:15.719> or<00:00:15.929> just

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
much since the USA was released or just

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.439 
much since the USA was released or just
might<00:00:16.770> want<00:00:16.980> some<00:00:17.160> tips<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.490> general<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
might want some tips in general so the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.700 
might want some tips in general so the
first<00:00:18.660> thing<00:00:18.750> I'm<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.109> talk<00:00:19.289> about<00:00:19.439> is

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
first thing I'm going to talk about is

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.090 
first thing I'm going to talk about is
binds<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.150> with<00:00:21.660> mines<00:00:21.930> at<00:00:22.289> they<00:00:22.800> actually

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
binds and so with mines at they actually

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.230 
binds and so with mines at they actually
increase<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.550> amount<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.090> have

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
increase the amount that you can have

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.109 
increase the amount that you can have
and<00:00:24.480> they<00:00:25.019> made<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.320> whole<00:00:25.650> bound<00:00:26.519> item

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and they made this whole bound item

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.929 
and they made this whole bound item
thing<00:00:27.420> up<00:00:27.570> here<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:28.500> not<00:00:29.279> that's<00:00:29.580> not<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
thing up here but I'm not that's not the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:30.980 
thing up here but I'm not that's not the
point<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.240> video<00:00:30.480> I'm<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.599> going<00:00:30.779> to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
point of this video I'm just going to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.900 
point of this video I'm just going to
say<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.529> binds<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.890> should<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
say what binds you should have it the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.370 
say what binds you should have it the
different<00:00:33.180> levels<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:33.690> level<00:00:33.899> 50<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.230> can

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
different levels so at level 50 you can

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.740 
different levels so at level 50 you can
have<00:00:34.469> three<00:00:34.800> items<00:00:34.980> found<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.570> want

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
have three items found so what you want

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.709 
have three items found so what you want
is<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> leap<00:00:37.320> play<00:00:37.530> body<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.040> range<00:00:38.879> weapon

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
is in a leap play body a range weapon

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.290 
is in a leap play body a range weapon
and<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:39.989> melee<00:00:40.290> weapon<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.790> melee

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
and the melee weapon and the melee

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.060 
and the melee weapon and the melee
weapon<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:43.200> best<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.860> highest

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
weapon it's best to have the highest

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.580 
weapon it's best to have the highest
level<00:00:44.489> 2h<00:00:44.789> sword<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.500> if

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
level 2h sword that you can have but if

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.590 
level 2h sword that you can have but if
you<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.250> primal<00:00:47.850> mall<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.300> only<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
you can have a primal mall but only a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.690 
you can have a primal mall but only a
promethium<00:00:49.410> two-hander<00:00:49.860> then<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.550> better

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
promethium two-hander then it's better

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.900 
promethium two-hander then it's better
to<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.149> primal<00:00:51.719> mall<00:00:52.129> for<00:00:53.129> bows<00:00:53.489> if

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
to have the primal mall for bows if

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.720 
to have the primal mall for bows if
you're<00:00:54.739> well<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.890> course<00:00:56.129> hex<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.610> best

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you're well of course hex is the best

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.340 
you're well of course hex is the best
option<00:00:57.090> but<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> hex<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
option but if you don't have a hex and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.549 
option but if you don't have a hex and
you<00:00:59.280> really<00:00:59.609> want<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.120> pro<00:01:00.780> about<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
you really want to be pro about it you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.830 
you really want to be pro about it you
should<00:01:01.739> use<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> short<00:01:02.190> bow<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.809> thing

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
should use a short bow because the thing

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.380 
should use a short bow because the thing
with<00:01:04.110> short<00:01:04.350> bows<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.939> stacked

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
with short bows is that if you stacked

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
with short bows is that if you stacked
range<00:01:06.780> attacks<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.890> an<00:01:08.010> attack<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
range attacks so if you do an attack and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.880 
range attacks so if you do an attack and
then<00:01:09.060> use<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.810> ability<00:01:10.229> right<00:01:10.380> after<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
then use the ability right after the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.609 
then use the ability right after the
damage<00:01:11.159> stacks<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.900> that's<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.049> really<00:01:13.409> good

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
damage stacks and that's a really good

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.469 
damage stacks and that's a really good
way<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> range<00:01:14.070> because<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.240> just

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
way to range because it on just

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
way to range because it on just
maximizes<00:01:16.170> your<00:01:16.200> damage<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.189> use<00:01:17.340> an<00:01:17.460> auto

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
maximizes your damage so use an auto

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.539 
maximizes your damage so use an auto
attack<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.180> use<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.630> ability<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.549> with

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
attack and then use the ability and with

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.039 
attack and then use the ability and with
short<00:01:20.790> bows<00:01:20.970> since<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> auto<00:01:21.509> attacks<00:01:21.840> are<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
short bows since the auto attacks are a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.200 
short bows since the auto attacks are a
little<00:01:22.200> bit<00:01:22.380> faster<00:01:22.560> they're<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.729> little<00:01:24.030> bit

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
little bit faster they're a little bit

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.510 
little bit faster they're a little bit
better<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.200> longbows<00:01:25.770> also<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.340> have

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
better but longbows also do have

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.179 
better but longbows also do have
advantages<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:27.780> example<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.380> goes<00:01:28.590> allow

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
advantages so for example one goes allow

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.590 
advantages so for example one goes allow
you<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.490> use<00:01:29.520> defensive<00:01:30.180> abilities<00:01:30.570> like

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you to use defensive abilities like

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.770 
you to use defensive abilities like
resonance<00:01:31.290> preparation<00:01:32.479> rejuvenate<00:01:33.479> which

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
resonance preparation rejuvenate which

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
resonance preparation rejuvenate which
is<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.200> good<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.799> they<00:01:35.490> also<00:01:35.610> give

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
is a really good one and they also give

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.340 
is a really good one and they also give
a<00:01:35.939> bunch<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.390> defense<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> life<00:01:37.110> point

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
a bunch of defense and life point

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.770 
a bunch of defense and life point
bonuses<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.939> really<00:01:39.150> up<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.509> if

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
bonuses so it's really up to you if

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.080 
bonuses so it's really up to you if
you're<00:01:39.990> looking<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.100> efficient<00:01:42.000> as

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
you're looking to be as efficient as

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.260 
you're looking to be as efficient as
possible<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:44.130> should<00:01:44.310> use<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> short<00:01:45.090> bow

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
possible then you should use a short bow

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.539 
possible then you should use a short bow
over<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.509> long<00:01:45.750> bow<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.530> hex<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.280> still<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
over a long bow but hex is still the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.980 
over a long bow but hex is still the
best<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.329> get<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> hex<00:01:48.630> then<00:01:48.840> use

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
best so if you can get a hex then use

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.210 
best so if you can get a hex then use
that<00:01:50.090> also<00:01:51.090> along<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.990> bows<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.680> you're

okay so next those are the binds of you
only<00:02:36.540> 50<00:02:36.870> dungeon<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.319> only<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.620> three

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860

only 50 dungeon you only have three
lines<00:02:38.040> but<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:38.940> get<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.299> 90<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.019> get

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
lines but if you get to 90 you can get

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.170

seen<00:02:46.739> major<00:02:47.160> isn't<00:02:47.640> anywhere<00:02:48.359> near<00:02:48.420> as<00:02:48.629> useful

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
seen major isn't anywhere near as useful

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.690

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
as Ranger maylene dungeoneering so I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.059 
as Ranger maylene dungeoneering so I
don't<00:02:50.940> use<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.079> is<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.620> an<00:02:52.829> option

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
don't use it but it is it's an option

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.839 
don't use it but it is it's an option
it's<00:02:53.430> not<00:02:53.910> too<00:02:54.060> bad<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.560> then<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> 120<00:02:56.129> tons<00:02:56.310> I

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
it's not too bad and then it 120 tons I

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.119 
it's not too bad and then it 120 tons I
mean<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.930> probably<00:02:57.959> have<00:02:58.409> experience<00:02:58.950> if

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
mean you probably have experience if

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.369 
mean you probably have experience if
you've<00:02:59.280> gotten<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.670> there<00:02:59.819> but<00:03:00.109> I'd<00:03:01.109> probably

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
you've gotten to there but I'd probably

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.349 
you've gotten to there but I'd probably
well<00:03:02.099> I<00:03:02.129> use<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> blood<00:03:02.730> necklace<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.239> could

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
well I use a blood necklace you could

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.960 
well I use a blood necklace you could
also<00:03:03.480> switch<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.290> with<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.680> staff<00:03:05.040> yeah

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
also switch that out with a staff yeah

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.559 
also switch that out with a staff yeah
either<00:03:06.450> way<00:03:07.489> okay<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:08.549> that's<00:03:09.000> about<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.390> for

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
either way okay so that's about it for

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.539 
either way okay so that's about it for
binds<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.319> next<00:03:10.470> thing<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.799> action<00:03:11.340> bars

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
binds so the next thing is action bars

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.949 
binds so the next thing is action bars
and<00:03:11.879> you<00:03:12.060> will<00:03:12.269> need<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.569> switching

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
and you will need to be switching

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.630 
and you will need to be switching
between<00:03:13.049> multiple<00:03:13.560> action<00:03:13.859> bars<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.340> sylvie

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
between multiple action bars and sylvie

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.979 
between multiple action bars and sylvie

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
what works for you and so yeah that's

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.879 
what works for you and so yeah that's
pretty<00:03:45.150> much<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:45.959> there<00:03:46.410> isn't<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.709> whole<00:03:46.739> lot

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
pretty much it there isn't a whole lot

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.740 
pretty much it there isn't a whole lot
more<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.340> only<00:03:47.549> other<00:03:47.669> thing<00:03:47.760> I'd<00:03:48.150> recommend

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
more the only other thing I'd recommend

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.809 
more the only other thing I'd recommend
keeping<00:03:49.109> in<00:03:49.379> mind<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.859> that<00:03:49.919> monster<00:03:50.400> weakness

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
keeping in mind is that monster weakness

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.150 
keeping in mind is that monster weakness
matters<00:03:51.180> significantly<00:03:51.419> more<00:03:51.989> in<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.169> UC<00:03:52.560> so

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
matters significantly more in the UC so

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.229 
matters significantly more in the UC so
when<00:03:53.250> you're<00:03:53.370> fighting<00:03:53.549> things<00:03:53.879> make<00:03:54.090> sure

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
when you're fighting things make sure

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.309 
when you're fighting things make sure
that<00:03:54.389> you<00:03:54.449> take<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.750> look<00:03:54.959> at<00:03:55.079> what<00:03:55.109> their

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
that you take a look at what their

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.129 
that you take a look at what their
weaknesses<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.639> target<00:03:57.540> screen<00:03:57.959> there

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
weaknesses on the target screen there

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.650 
weaknesses on the target screen there
otherwise<00:03:58.949> it<00:03:59.519> could<00:03:59.790> take<00:03:59.940> a<00:04:00.000> lot<00:04:00.239> longer<00:04:00.449> to

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
otherwise it could take a lot longer to

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.860 
otherwise it could take a lot longer to
kill<00:04:00.930> things<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.940> yeah<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.120> sorry<00:04:03.449> it<00:04:03.540> wasn't

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
kill things and yeah so sorry it wasn't

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.689 
kill things and yeah so sorry it wasn't
