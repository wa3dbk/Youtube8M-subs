the<00:02:37.710> morning<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.250> sometimes<00:02:38.730> i've<00:02:39.090> been

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
the morning and sometimes i've been

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.120 
the morning and sometimes i've been
putting<00:02:39.450> oil<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.870> morning<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:40.290> well<00:02:40.500> but

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
putting oil in the morning as well but

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.250 
putting oil in the morning as well but
it's<00:02:41.400> very<00:02:41.790> very<00:02:42.120> rich<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.930> have<00:02:43.080> quite

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
it's very very rich so if you have quite

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.720 
it's very very rich so if you have quite
greasy<00:02:43.500> skin<00:02:43.890> it's<00:02:44.100> probably<00:02:44.340> not<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.550> great

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
greasy skin it's probably not a great

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.120 
greasy skin it's probably not a great
one<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.570> if<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.810> have<00:02:45.990> got<00:02:46.200> dry<00:02:46.410> patches<00:02:46.680> or

one but if you have got dry patches or

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.620 
one but if you have got dry patches or
you<00:02:47.250> have<00:02:47.400> got<00:02:47.580> quite<00:02:47.730> dry<00:02:48.030> skin<00:02:48.300> i<00:02:48.330> would

you have got quite dry skin i would

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.210

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
really good and its really really cheap

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.400
