and<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> trough<00:01:19.470> container<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.190> set<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.880> its

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and the trough container I set up on its

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450 
and the trough container I set up on its
end<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> did<00:01:22.590> first<00:01:22.860> was<00:01:23.010> I<00:01:23.190> coated

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
end and what I did first was I coated

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.950 
end and what I did first was I coated
the<00:01:23.549> inside<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:24.270> these<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.479> actually

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the inside because these are actually

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.660 
the inside because these are actually
for<00:01:25.170> permanent<00:01:25.530> botanicals<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.430> fresh

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
for permanent botanicals not for fresh

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.310 
for permanent botanicals not for fresh
but<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> wanted<00:01:27.690> to<00:01:27.750> use<00:01:27.840> them<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.110> fresh

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
but I wanted to use them for fresh

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.260 
but I wanted to use them for fresh
flowers<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.340> turned<00:01:29.579> one<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.030> its<00:01:30.210> side

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
flowers so I turned one up on its side

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
flowers so I turned one up on its side
and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.229> put<00:01:31.590> water<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and then then just put water in the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.459 
and then then just put water in the
bottom<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:33.509> different<00:01:33.990> tape

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
bottom which is a really different tape

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.740

on<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.860> container<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:36.030> armature<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> just

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
on this container the armature I just

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.410 
on this container the armature I just
took<00:01:36.960> some<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.009> red<00:01:38.189> dogwood<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.060> twist

novelty tulips are so much fun I love

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.320 
novelty tulips are so much fun I love
the<00:03:00.950> color<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.459> they<00:03:01.580> create

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
the color that they create

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.140 
the color that they create
sometimes<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.049> foliage<00:03:03.500> can<00:03:04.040> overpower<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
sometimes the foliage can overpower the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.940 
sometimes the foliage can overpower the
tulip<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.780> if<00:03:05.930> it's<00:03:06.049> not<00:03:06.170> perfect<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:06.739> course

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
tulip and if it's not perfect of course

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.370 
tulip and if it's not perfect of course
we<00:03:07.160> don't<00:03:07.340> want<00:03:07.519> it<00:03:07.580> for<00:03:07.790> our<00:03:07.850> customers<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:09.350> I

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
we don't want it for our customers so I

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.759 
we don't want it for our customers so I
just<00:03:09.620> strip<00:03:09.920> those<00:03:10.100> foliages<00:03:10.660> right<00:03:11.660> off<00:03:11.959> and

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
just strip those foliages right off and

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.690 
just strip those foliages right off and
of<00:03:13.250> course<00:03:13.459> cut<00:03:13.760> them

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
of course cut them

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.760 
of course cut them
and<00:03:14.880> an<00:03:15.000> angle<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:16.319> I've<00:03:16.410> already<00:03:16.650> got

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
and an angle and I've already got

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.830 
and an angle and I've already got
freshwater<00:03:17.370> right<00:03:17.700> now<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:18.150> here<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.630> can

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
freshwater right now in here so I can

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.360 
freshwater right now in here so I can
just<00:03:19.340> set<00:03:20.340> those<00:03:20.490> right<00:03:20.819> in<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:22.830> actually<00:03:23.220> use

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
just set those right in and actually use

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:37.550 
just set those right in and actually use
the<00:03:23.520> armature<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.120> support<00:03:24.569> those<00:03:36.500> it's<00:03:37.500> a

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
the armature to support those it's a

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.830 
the armature to support those it's a
very<00:03:37.770> organic<00:03:38.190> design<00:03:38.880> it's<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.420> very<00:03:39.630> natural

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
very organic design it's a very natural

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.830 
very organic design it's a very natural
design<00:03:40.820> and<00:03:41.820> of<00:03:41.850> course<00:03:42.150> since<00:03:42.420> they're<00:03:42.630> right

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
design and of course since they're right

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.559 
design and of course since they're right
in<00:03:43.080> water<00:03:43.640> we're<00:03:44.640> going<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.819> drink<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.390> be

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
in water we're going to drink and be

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.680 
in water we're going to drink and be
quite<00:03:45.930> happy<00:03:46.940> yeah<00:03:47.940> I'll<00:03:48.060> leave<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.450> length

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
quite happy yeah I'll leave the length

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.900 
quite happy yeah I'll leave the length
on<00:03:48.900> stone<00:03:49.230> just<00:03:49.650> tuck<00:03:49.830> it<00:03:49.950> into<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.250> edge<00:03:50.400> and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
on stone just tuck it into the edge and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:17.590 
on stone just tuck it into the edge and
then<00:03:51.840> work<00:03:52.020> it<00:03:52.140> around<00:03:52.290> into<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.920> structure

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.909 

up

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.740 

create<00:04:23.919> some<00:04:24.280> depth<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:25.210> some<00:04:25.419> really

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
create some depth and some really

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.250 
create some depth and some really
fantastic<00:04:26.160> movement<00:04:27.810> we're<00:04:28.810> gonna<00:04:28.930> soften

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
fantastic movement we're gonna soften

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.500 
fantastic movement we're gonna soften
the<00:04:29.800> edges<00:04:30.010> in<00:04:30.520> here<00:04:30.550> but<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.150> can<00:04:31.330> see

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
the edges in here but you can see

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.860 
the edges in here but you can see
placement<00:04:32.639> of<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.820> symmetry

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.920 

there<00:04:37.380> are<00:04:37.560> brighter<00:04:37.919> luscious<00:04:38.910> days<00:04:39.180> ahead

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.689 

and<00:04:42.930> we<00:04:43.230> can<00:04:43.260> certainly<00:04:43.770> make<00:04:43.919> them<00:04:44.160> brighter

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
and we can certainly make them brighter

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:51.770 
and we can certainly make them brighter
