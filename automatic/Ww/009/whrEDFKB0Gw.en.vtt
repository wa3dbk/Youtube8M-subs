marketplace we're struggling getting
through<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.489> trash<00:01:02.730> I'm<00:01:03.329> very<00:01:03.989> happy<00:01:04.350> with

through the trash I'm very happy with

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.679 
through the trash I'm very happy with
our<00:01:04.619> contour<00:01:05.100> one<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.939> worked<00:01:06.210> well<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
our contour one it's worked well if a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.750 
our contour one it's worked well if a
guy's<00:01:06.840> our<00:01:07.020> manager<00:01:07.380> resonate<00:01:07.830> residue<00:01:08.250> they

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
guy's our manager resonate residue they

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.850 
guy's our manager resonate residue they
don't<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.090> an<00:01:09.210> issue<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:10.380> started

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
don't have an issue but we started

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.070 
don't have an issue but we started
prototyping<00:01:11.159> three<00:01:11.850> years<00:01:12.090> ago<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.780> come<00:01:12.930> up

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
prototyping three years ago to come up

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
prototyping three years ago to come up
with<00:01:13.200> something<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.680> was<00:01:13.799> better<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.340> trash

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
with something that was better in trash

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
with something that was better in trash
clearance<00:01:15.060> than<00:01:15.630> even<00:01:15.900> our<00:01:15.990> contour<00:01:16.439> one<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
clearance than even our contour one and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.609 
clearance than even our contour one and
the<00:01:17.340> result<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.820> our<00:01:18.090> contour<00:01:18.659> tune<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.470> what

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the result is our contour tune so what

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
the result is our contour tune so what
makes<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.009> different<00:01:20.479> what's<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> main

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
makes it different what's the main

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.289 
makes it different what's the main
difference<00:01:22.110> between<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.770> contour<00:01:23.280> -<00:01:23.939> yeah

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
difference between the contour - yeah

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.149 
difference between the contour - yeah
there's<00:01:24.750> there's<00:01:25.049> two<00:01:25.110> main<00:01:25.500> differences<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
there's there's two main differences and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.800 
there's there's two main differences and
probably<00:01:26.759> Shawn<00:01:26.970> we'll<00:01:27.150> need<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> shoot<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
probably Shawn we'll need to shoot the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.749 
probably Shawn we'll need to shoot the
contour<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:29.009> we're

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
contour one and just so you know we're

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.340 
contour one and just so you know we're
going<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> continue<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> produce<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.930> contour

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
going to continue to produce the contour

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.929 
going to continue to produce the contour
one<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.710> well<00:01:31.860> because<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.369> been<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.610> great

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
one as well because it's been a great

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.330 
one as well because it's been a great
product<00:01:33.329> we've<00:01:34.170> got<00:01:34.380> orders<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> go<00:01:35.100> it's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
product we've got orders on the go it's

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.490 
product we've got orders on the go it's
been<00:01:35.490> very<00:01:35.729> good<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> next

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
been very good but this is just the next

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.800 
been very good but this is just the next
generation<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.280> another<00:01:38.549> improvement<00:01:39.090> so

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
generation it's another improvement so

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.760 
generation it's another improvement so
as<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:41.759> shank<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.780> recessed<00:01:43.439> at

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
as you can see the shank is recessed at

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.270 
as you can see the shank is recessed at
a<00:01:43.799> 12<00:01:44.340> degree<00:01:44.850> angle<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.560> all<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
a 12 degree angle so the all the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.980 
a 12 degree angle so the all the
independent<00:01:47.610> openers<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> market<00:01:48.899> right

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
independent openers on the market right

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.109 
independent openers on the market right
now<00:01:49.049> have<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> vertical<00:01:49.799> shank<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
now have a vertical shank and one of the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.770 
now have a vertical shank and one of the
issues<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> vertical<00:01:52.590> shank<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
issues with a vertical shank is that you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.719 
issues with a vertical shank is that you
get<00:01:55.020> straw<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.770> residue<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.490> wrap

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
get straw and residue that will wrap

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.750 
get straw and residue that will wrap
around<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.390> vertical<00:01:57.780> shank<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
around that vertical shank and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.150 
around that vertical shank and
release<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.930> that's<00:02:00.080> one<00:02:00.290> of<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.440> main<00:02:00.710> issues

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
release so that's one of the main issues

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.320 
release so that's one of the main issues
with<00:02:01.280> an<00:02:01.430> independent<00:02:01.640> opener<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.150> doesn't

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
with an independent opener it doesn't

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.270 
with an independent opener it doesn't
matter<00:02:02.450> whose<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.690> is<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.620> this<00:02:03.770> one<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.100> back

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
matter whose it is so this one is back

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.940 
matter whose it is so this one is back
it's<00:02:04.880> angled<00:02:05.270> at<00:02:05.360> 12<00:02:05.630> degrees<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.650> it'll<00:02:06.800> give

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
it's angled at 12 degrees so it'll give

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.800 
it's angled at 12 degrees so it'll give
you<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.070> similar<00:02:07.370> effect<00:02:08.119> of<00:02:08.390> your

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
you a similar effect of your

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.600 
you a similar effect of your
conventional<00:02:09.350> drill<00:02:09.649> with<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.860> c-shape<00:02:10.340> where

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
conventional drill with a c-shape where

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.090 
conventional drill with a c-shape where
the<00:02:10.700> product<00:02:11.090> will<00:02:11.240> ride<00:02:11.540> up<00:02:11.570> on<00:02:12.050> this<00:02:12.830> and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
the product will ride up on this and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.070 
the product will ride up on this and
then<00:02:13.490> it<00:02:13.670> will<00:02:13.820> discharge<00:02:14.090> off<00:02:14.600> or<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:14.990> the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
then it will discharge off or on the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.870 
then it will discharge off or on the
vertical<00:02:15.350> shake<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.890> would<00:02:16.040> still<00:02:16.310> tend<00:02:16.700> to

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
vertical shake it would still tend to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.530 
vertical shake it would still tend to
wrap<00:02:17.090> on<00:02:17.330> there<00:02:17.540> all<00:02:18.170> right<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:19.070> if<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.090> go

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
wrap on there all right so if you go

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.940 
wrap on there all right so if you go
back<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.900> we'll<00:02:21.020> look<00:02:21.050> at<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.350> contour<00:02:21.740> one

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
back and we'll look at the contour one

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.590 
back and we'll look at the contour one
as<00:02:22.070> well<00:02:22.280> but<00:02:22.850> on<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.090> depth<00:02:23.330> control

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
as well but on the depth control

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.360 
as well but on the depth control
mechanism<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.470> contour<00:02:24.860> one<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.250> have

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
mechanism on the contour one you have

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.370 
mechanism on the contour one you have
mechanism<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.030> comes<00:02:26.210> down<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.780> runs

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
mechanism that comes down and runs

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.950 
mechanism that comes down and runs
horizontally<00:02:27.850> so<00:02:28.850> your<00:02:29.030> first<00:02:29.270> catch<00:02:29.600> point

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
horizontally so your first catch point

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.470 
horizontally so your first catch point
on<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.260> contour<00:02:30.680> one<00:02:31.010> was<00:02:31.640> only<00:02:31.910> thirteen<00:02:32.360> and

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
on the contour one was only thirteen and

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.440 
on the contour one was only thirteen and
a<00:02:32.570> half<00:02:32.600> inches<00:02:33.110> high<00:02:33.310> now<00:02:34.340> with<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.030> contour

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
a half inches high now with the contour

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.780 
a half inches high now with the contour
to<00:02:35.570> that<00:02:36.470> first<00:02:36.770> catch<00:02:37.040> point<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:37.670> this

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
to that first catch point is in this

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.250 
to that first catch point is in this
area<00:02:38.090> that's<00:02:38.330> twenty-one<00:02:38.810> inches<00:02:39.080> high<00:02:39.230> so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
area that's twenty-one inches high so

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.620 
area that's twenty-one inches high so
we've<00:02:39.620> actually<00:02:40.120> increased<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.390> catch

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
we've actually increased that catch

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.230 
we've actually increased that catch
point<00:02:41.930> by<00:02:42.050> sixty<00:02:42.530> percent<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.550> I've<00:02:43.910> been<00:02:44.120> in

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
point by sixty percent so I've been in

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.330 
point by sixty percent so I've been in
the<00:02:44.330> field<00:02:44.480> with<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.900> in<00:02:45.140> Australia<00:02:45.340> where

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
the field with this in Australia where

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.250 
the field with this in Australia where
they<00:02:46.490> do<00:02:46.550> have<00:02:46.640> big<00:02:47.060> crops<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.570> wheat<00:02:47.600> back<00:02:48.020> to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
they do have big crops of wheat back to

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.810 
they do have big crops of wheat back to
back<00:02:48.440> they<00:02:48.710> don't<00:02:48.890> rotate<00:02:49.040> their<00:02:49.430> crops<00:02:49.640> I

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
back they don't rotate their crops I

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.790 
back they don't rotate their crops I
don't<00:02:49.970> think<00:02:50.180> as<00:02:50.270> well<00:02:50.450> as<00:02:50.570> we<00:02:50.690> do<00:02:50.810> here<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.680> so

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
don't think as well as we do here and so

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.350 
don't think as well as we do here and so
they've<00:02:51.980> got<00:02:52.220> big<00:02:52.550> crops<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:53.000> wheat<00:02:53.030> so

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
they've got big crops of wheat so

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.760 
they've got big crops of wheat so
there's<00:02:53.540> lots<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.870> residue<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.440> bottom

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
there's lots of residue in the bottom

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.770 
there's lots of residue in the bottom
with<00:02:55.340> their<00:02:55.580> climate<00:02:56.120> they<00:02:56.270> don't<00:02:56.450> break<00:02:56.720> down

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
with their climate they don't break down

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.660 
with their climate they don't break down
the<00:02:57.110> straw<00:02:57.350> like<00:02:57.470> we<00:02:57.709> do<00:02:57.890> with<00:02:58.070> our<00:02:58.220> freezing

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
the straw like we do with our freezing

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.730 
the straw like we do with our freezing
and<00:02:58.820> thawing<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.300> our<00:02:59.390> snow<00:02:59.660> so<00:03:00.350> they've<00:03:00.590> got

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
and thawing and our snow so they've got

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.260 
and thawing and our snow so they've got
all<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:00.950> residue<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.580> bottom<00:03:01.910> we<00:03:02.060> are

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
all this residue in the bottom we are

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.420 
all this residue in the bottom we are
having<00:03:02.480> issues<00:03:02.750> with<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:03.500> product<00:03:03.890> riding

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
having issues with that product riding

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.979 
having issues with that product riding
up<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.730> catching<00:03:05.090> under<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.420> opener

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
up and catching under the opener

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.080 
up and catching under the opener
now<00:03:06.380> with<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:06.739> system<00:03:07.220> with<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.459> contour<00:03:07.850> -

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
now with this system with the contour -

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.390 
now with this system with the contour -
I<00:03:08.360> won't<00:03:09.050> say<00:03:09.230> we've<00:03:09.410> eliminated<00:03:09.650> but<00:03:10.220> we

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
I won't say we've eliminated but we

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.750 
I won't say we've eliminated but we
significantly<00:03:10.690> improved<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:12.050> trashman's

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
significantly improved the trashman's

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.370 
significantly improved the trashman's
also<00:03:13.760> on<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:13.940> contour<00:03:14.330> one<00:03:14.510> as<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:15.019> mentioned

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
also on the contour one as I mentioned

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.020 
also on the contour one as I mentioned
the<00:03:15.500> depth<00:03:15.709> mechanism<00:03:16.310> runs<00:03:16.519> back<00:03:16.760> through

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
the depth mechanism runs back through

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.210 
the depth mechanism runs back through
here<00:03:17.269> so<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.840> have<00:03:18.110> some<00:03:18.320> congestion<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.070> this

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
here so you have some congestion in this

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.400 
here so you have some congestion in this
area<00:03:19.550> between<00:03:20.120> your<00:03:20.360> opener<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.140> Packer

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
it did release off that vertical shank

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.580 
it did release off that vertical shank
who<00:03:26.180> would<00:03:26.330> have<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.660> opportunity<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.350> catch

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
who would have that opportunity to catch

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.920 
who would have that opportunity to catch

was<00:03:30.080> so<00:03:30.230> that's<00:03:30.440> all<00:03:30.620> been<00:03:30.709> cleaned<00:03:31.040> up<00:03:31.190> and

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
was so that's all been cleaned up and

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.699 
was so that's all been cleaned up and
the<00:03:31.880> depth<00:03:32.090> mechanism<00:03:32.690> is<00:03:32.780> now<00:03:32.959> at<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.260> top<00:03:33.500> of

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
the depth mechanism is now at the top of

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.080 
the depth mechanism is now at the top of
the<00:03:33.830> open<00:03:34.100> there's<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.550> lot<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.670> lot<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.910> place

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
the open there's a lot a lot of place

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.610 
the open there's a lot a lot of place
for<00:03:35.330> a<00:03:35.360> trash<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.810> get<00:03:35.930> caught<00:03:36.110> up<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.440> seems

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
for a trash to get caught up it seems

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.979 
for a trash to get caught up it seems
very<00:03:36.800> sleek<00:03:37.190> yeah<00:03:37.730> absolutely<00:03:38.000> compared<00:03:38.780> to

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
very sleek yeah absolutely compared to

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.350 
very sleek yeah absolutely compared to
and<00:03:39.230> again

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
and again

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.820 
and again
and<00:03:41.600> it's<00:03:41.780> been<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.960> great<00:03:42.200> product<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.710> I'd

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
and it's been a great product and I'd

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.080 
and it's been a great product and I'd
put<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.100> against<00:03:43.400> anything<00:03:43.610> out<00:03:43.880> in<00:03:43.910> the

opener<00:03:51.280> as<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.490> said<00:03:52.670> it's<00:03:52.850> been<00:03:53.030> proven<00:03:53.480> it's

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
opener as I said it's been proven it's

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.350 
opener as I said it's been proven it's
been<00:03:53.810> out<00:03:53.930> since<00:03:54.170> 2008<00:03:54.950> it's<00:03:55.580> a<00:03:55.730> great<00:03:56.030> product

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
been out since 2008 it's a great product

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.090 
been out since 2008 it's a great product
we've<00:03:56.660> had<00:03:56.840> great<00:03:57.110> success<00:03:57.410> with<00:03:57.650> it

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
we've had great success with it

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.830 
we've had great success with it
we're<00:03:58.460> still<00:03:58.760> going<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:58.940> manufacture<00:03:59.210> we're

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
we're still going to manufacture we're

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.470 
we're still going to manufacture we're
still<00:04:00.140> going<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.320> sell<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.970> but<00:04:01.970> as<00:04:02.120> we<00:04:02.270> said

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
still going to sell it but as we said

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.170 
still going to sell it but as we said
the<00:04:02.780> contour<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.530> is<00:04:04.070> just<00:04:04.280> an<00:04:04.490> improvement<00:04:04.880> in

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
the contour to is just an improvement in

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.240 
the contour to is just an improvement in
the<00:04:05.420> trash<00:04:05.630> plants<00:04:05.990> we<00:04:06.110> talked<00:04:06.350> about<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.800> the

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
the trash plants we talked about the the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.980 
the trash plants we talked about the the
angle<00:04:07.460> of<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.820> shank<00:04:08.060> being<00:04:08.330> 12<00:04:08.630> degrees

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
angle of the shank being 12 degrees

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.100 
angle of the shank being 12 degrees
cleaned<00:04:09.860> up<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.130> area<00:04:10.430> underneath<00:04:11.110> so

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
cleaned up the area underneath so

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.800 
cleaned up the area underneath so
there's<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.890> lot<00:04:13.250> less<00:04:13.610> places<00:04:14.180> for<00:04:14.360> a<00:04:14.420> material

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
there's a lot less places for a material

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.050 
there's a lot less places for a material
to<00:04:14.840> hang<00:04:15.110> up<00:04:15.290> from<00:04:15.830> a<00:04:15.920> trash<00:04:16.160> standpoint<00:04:16.640> the

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
to hang up from a trash standpoint the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.630 
to hang up from a trash standpoint the
same<00:04:17.450> precise<00:04:18.109> depth<00:04:18.470> control<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:19.340> same

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
same precise depth control the same

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.610 
same precise depth control the same
method<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.209> setting<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.750> depth<00:04:20.989> the

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
method of setting the depth the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.520 
method of setting the depth the
difference<00:04:22.010> is<00:04:22.220> as<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:23.060> can<00:04:23.240> see<00:04:23.480> we've<00:04:24.290> got<00:04:24.470> a

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
difference is as you can see we've got a

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.760 
difference is as you can see we've got a
much<00:04:25.490> lower<00:04:25.730> catch<00:04:26.330> point<00:04:26.690> for<00:04:26.900> residue<00:04:27.320> if

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
much lower catch point for residue if

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.070 
much lower catch point for residue if
it's<00:04:28.010> riding<00:04:28.400> up<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:29.030> shank<00:04:29.360> is<00:04:29.570> vertical

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
it's riding up the shank is vertical

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.180 
it's riding up the shank is vertical
which<00:04:30.260> is<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.500> same<00:04:30.680> as<00:04:30.830> any<00:04:30.980> other

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
which is the same as any other

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.890 
which is the same as any other
independent<00:04:31.460> opener<00:04:32.180> on<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.330> marketplace

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
independent opener on the marketplace

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.440 
independent opener on the marketplace
and<00:04:33.110> there<00:04:34.070> can<00:04:34.310> be<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.640> possibility<00:04:35.090> of

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
and there can be the possibility of

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.960 
and there can be the possibility of
residue<00:04:36.200> wrapping<00:04:36.620> around<00:04:36.740> that<00:04:37.070> shank<00:04:37.370> you

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
residue wrapping around that shank you

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.960 
residue wrapping around that shank you
can<00:04:38.120> also<00:04:38.270> see<00:04:38.600> here<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:40.310> depth<00:04:40.760> control

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
can also see here that the depth control

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.850 
can also see here that the depth control
mechanism<00:04:41.660> on<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.840> contour<00:04:42.230> one<00:04:42.440> is<00:04:42.620> much

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
mechanism on the contour one is much

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.250 
mechanism on the contour one is much
lower<00:04:43.190> so<00:04:43.910> if<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:44.180> have<00:04:44.390> residue<00:04:44.870> that<00:04:45.020> comes

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
lower so if you have residue that comes

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.080 
lower so if you have residue that comes
around<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.740> shank<00:04:45.950> it<00:04:46.430> may<00:04:46.640> have<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:46.880> tendency

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
around the shank it may have a tendency

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.360 
around the shank it may have a tendency
to<00:04:47.390> catch<00:04:47.690> inside<00:04:48.140> here<00:04:48.500> whereas<00:04:49.100> on<00:04:49.250> the

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
to catch inside here whereas on the

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.840 
to catch inside here whereas on the
contour<00:04:49.730> -<00:04:50.030> it's<00:04:50.630> cleaned<00:04:50.990> right<00:04:51.230> out<00:04:51.850> there's

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
contour - it's cleaned right out there's

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.360 
contour - it's cleaned right out there's
a<00:04:52.940> bit<00:04:53.480> of<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.660> higher<00:04:53.960> arch<00:04:54.530> right<00:04:54.890> here<00:04:54.919> yeah

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
a bit of a higher arch right here yeah

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.670 
a bit of a higher arch right here yeah
absolutely<00:04:55.610> yeah<00:04:56.419> so<00:04:56.690> this<00:04:57.110> one<00:04:57.320> that<00:04:57.530> the

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
absolutely yeah so this one that the

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.280 
absolutely yeah so this one that the
first<00:04:57.710> catch<00:04:58.130> point<00:04:58.490> is<00:04:59.000> is<00:04:59.450> about<00:04:59.630> thirteen

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
first catch point is is about thirteen

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.080 
first catch point is is about thirteen
and<00:05:00.320> a<00:05:00.500> half<00:05:00.530> inches<00:05:01.010> whereas<00:05:01.430> on<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.700> contour

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
and a half inches whereas on the contour

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.480 
and a half inches whereas on the contour
-<00:05:02.390> it's<00:05:02.900> up<00:05:03.110> to<00:05:03.140> 21<00:05:03.710> inches<00:05:03.890> so<00:05:04.160> it's<00:05:04.310> really

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
- it's up to 21 inches so it's really

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.100 
- it's up to 21 inches so it's really
you<00:05:05.150> know<00:05:05.270> if<00:05:05.419> you're<00:05:05.570> if<00:05:05.780> you're<00:05:05.810> crunching

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
you know if you're if you're crunching

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.220 
you know if you're if you're crunching
numbers<00:05:06.470> it's<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.919> 60%<00:05:07.460> improvement<00:05:08.330> on<00:05:08.840> that

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
numbers it's a 60% improvement on that

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.030 
numbers it's a 60% improvement on that
that<00:05:09.919> lowest<00:05:10.850> catch<00:05:11.090> point<00:05:11.450> so<00:05:11.750> we've<00:05:12.380> had<00:05:12.830> it

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
that lowest catch point so we've had it

improving the trash flow is that now

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.950 
improving the trash flow is that now
your<00:05:30.919> depth<00:05:31.160> control<00:05:31.370> is<00:05:31.700> much<00:05:31.910> higher<00:05:32.210> so

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
your depth control is much higher so

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.990 
your depth control is much higher so
you're<00:05:33.110> it's<00:05:33.380> a<00:05:33.530> lot<00:05:33.740> easier<00:05:33.950> to<00:05:34.160> access<00:05:34.490> I

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
you're it's a lot easier to access I

independent opener

independent opener
openers<00:05:38.450> is<00:05:38.660> that<00:05:38.930> you<00:05:39.050> have<00:05:39.230> to<00:05:39.380> set<00:05:39.590> every

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
openers is that you have to set every

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.850 
openers is that you have to set every
shank<00:05:40.250> independently<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:41.419> so<00:05:41.870> with<00:05:42.080> this<00:05:42.350> in

the contour drill as soon as you lift
those<00:06:03.710> openers<00:06:04.130> off<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.430> ground<00:06:04.640> there's<00:06:04.910> no

those openers off the ground there's no
pressure<00:06:05.270> on<00:06:05.420> that<00:06:05.630> Packer<00:06:05.930> then<00:06:06.830> it's<00:06:07.010> a

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
pressure on that Packer then it's a

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.850 
pressure on that Packer then it's a
matter<00:06:07.280> of<00:06:07.580> pulling<00:06:08.330> this<00:06:08.660> pin<00:06:08.930> and<00:06:09.170> moving

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
matter of pulling this pin and moving

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.620 
matter of pulling this pin and moving
this<00:06:10.010> depth<00:06:10.280> cam<00:06:10.550> with<00:06:11.180> quarter<00:06:11.600> inch

this depth cam with quarter inch

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.470 
this depth cam with quarter inch
increments<00:06:12.170> at<00:06:12.380> every<00:06:12.650> every<00:06:13.220> letter<00:06:13.430> so<00:06:13.850> it's

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
increments at every every letter so it's

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.900 
increments at every every letter so it's
a<00:06:14.870> very<00:06:15.050> simple<00:06:15.320> system<00:06:15.590> the<00:06:16.310> contour<00:06:16.700> too

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
a very simple system the contour too

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.340 
a very simple system the contour too
just<00:06:17.150> makes<00:06:17.330> it<00:06:17.480> a<00:06:17.540> little<00:06:17.750> bit<00:06:17.900> nicer<00:06:18.050> because

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
just makes it a little bit nicer because

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.700 
just makes it a little bit nicer because
it's<00:06:18.620> that<00:06:18.770> much<00:06:18.950> higher<00:06:19.130> to<00:06:19.310> deal<00:06:19.490> with
