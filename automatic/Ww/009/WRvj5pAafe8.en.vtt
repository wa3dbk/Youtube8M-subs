there<00:01:04.140> which<00:01:04.379> feels<00:01:04.619> very<00:01:05.100> nice<00:01:05.400> when<00:01:05.790> you're

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
there which feels very nice when you're

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.280 
there which feels very nice when you're
holding<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.729> clip<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.750> fully

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
holding it the clip here is fully

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.520 
holding it the clip here is fully
reversible<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> deep<00:01:12.240> riding<00:01:12.750> clip

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
faint line right around there that's

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.170 
faint line right around there that's
where<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.840> 420<00:04:26.440> J<00:04:26.680> comes<00:04:27.039> into<00:04:27.430> contact<00:04:27.699> with

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
where the 420 J comes into contact with

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.279 
where the 420 J comes into contact with
the<00:04:29.050> vg10<00:04:29.910> so<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:31.030> has<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.360> real<00:04:31.630> nice<00:04:31.900> hard

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
the vg10 so it has that real nice hard

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.640 
the vg10 so it has that real nice hard
cutting<00:04:32.620> edge<00:04:32.919> but<00:04:33.729> it<00:04:33.850> also<00:04:34.030> has<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
cutting edge but it also has the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.830 
cutting edge but it also has the
flexibility<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.870> that<00:04:37.870> for<00:04:38.169> 20<00:04:38.560> Jay<00:04:38.889> and<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:40.450> I

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
flexibility of that for 20 Jay and I I

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.920 
flexibility of that for 20 Jay and I I
thought<00:04:41.440> that<00:04:41.680> was<00:04:41.860> really<00:04:42.220> cool<00:04:42.690> over<00:04:43.690> the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
thought that was really cool over the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.860 
thought that was really cool over the
last<00:04:44.110> couple<00:04:44.320> years<00:04:44.500> sock<00:04:45.039> has<00:04:45.250> really<00:04:45.610> been

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
last couple years sock has really been

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.350 
last couple years sock has really been
upping<00:04:46.870> their<00:04:47.050> steel<00:04:47.349> qualities<00:04:47.979> and<00:04:48.310> this<00:04:49.120> I

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
upping their steel qualities and this I

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.120 
upping their steel qualities and this I
think<00:04:49.389> is<00:04:49.810> their<00:04:50.080> second<00:04:50.590> or<00:04:50.650> third<00:04:50.889> knife

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
think is their second or third knife

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.550 
think is their second or third knife
that<00:04:51.280> they<00:04:51.430> have<00:04:51.550> offered<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:52.210> san<00:04:52.840> mai<00:04:53.050> 3n

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
that they have offered that san mai 3n

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.159 
that they have offered that san mai 3n
but<00:04:54.310> it<00:04:54.430> is<00:04:54.580> also<00:04:54.810> significantly<00:04:55.810> less

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
but it is also significantly less

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.110 
but it is also significantly less
expensive<00:04:56.860> than<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:57.039> other<00:04:57.280> models<00:04:57.789> that

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
expensive than the other models that

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.370 
expensive than the other models that
they<00:04:58.240> offer<00:04:58.419> it<00:04:58.630> in<00:04:59.460> by<00:05:00.460> like<00:05:01.020> over<00:05:02.020> a<00:05:02.050> hundred

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
they offer it in by like over a hundred

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.450 
they offer it in by like over a hundred
dollars<00:05:02.770> less<00:05:04.830> speaking<00:05:05.830> of<00:05:05.889> hundred<00:05:06.190> dollars

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460
