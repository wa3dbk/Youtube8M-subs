00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
also removable so if you wanted to hook

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.069

it up to something else for example if

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.569 
it up to something else for example if
you<00:01:49.170> had<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> ground<00:01:49.649> station<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.250> your<00:01:50.369> bench

and you wanted to plug right in you can

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.440 
and you wanted to plug right in you can
do<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.189> otherwise<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:54.119> use<00:01:54.149> the
