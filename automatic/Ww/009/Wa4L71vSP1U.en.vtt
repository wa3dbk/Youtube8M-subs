00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
damaged to be damaged in a way that we

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.060 
damaged to be damaged in a way that we

anticipate that we can repair quickly so
there<00:01:11.220> are<00:01:11.280> two<00:01:11.430> ways<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.090> which<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.479> explore

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
there are two ways in which we explore

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.960 
there are two ways in which we explore
how<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.040> they<00:01:14.189> sort<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.729> work

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
how to do that and they sort of work

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.149 
how to do that and they sort of work
together<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.600> combine<00:01:15.840> each<00:01:16.200> other<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
together they combine each other on the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.310 
together they combine each other on the
first<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.700> we're<00:01:17.909> trying<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.420> increase<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
first one we're trying to increase the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.499 
first one we're trying to increase the
strength<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> stiffness<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> house<00:01:20.939> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
strength and stiffness of the house so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.570 
strength and stiffness of the house so
to<00:01:21.570> get<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> walls<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.040> ceilings

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
to get all the walls and ceilings

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.660 
to get all the walls and ceilings
engaged<00:01:24.770> through<00:01:25.770> adhesives<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.580> other

engaged through adhesives and other
strong<00:01:27.000> connectors<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.200> make<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> house

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
strong connectors to make the house

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.499 
strong connectors to make the house
stiffer<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.280> stronger<00:01:29.549> than<00:01:29.909> conventional

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
stiffer and stronger than conventional

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.260 
stiffer and stronger than conventional
houses<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.560> there<00:01:31.710> was<00:01:31.829> another

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
houses and then there was another

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.160 
houses and then there was another
philosophy<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:33.509> use<00:01:33.720> which<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.110> called

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
philosophy that we use which is called

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.710 
philosophy that we use which is called
base<00:01:34.650> isolation<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:36.119> idea<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.509> base

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
base isolation the idea of base

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.319 
base isolation the idea of base
isolation<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.890> rather<00:01:38.520> than<00:01:38.670> fixing

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
isolation is that rather than fixing

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.050 
isolation is that rather than fixing
your<00:01:39.479> house<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> foundation<00:01:40.950> what<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:41.850> do

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
your house to the foundation what we do

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.770 
your house to the foundation what we do
is<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:43.159> don't<00:01:44.159> fix<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:44.970> rather<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.509> built

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
is we don't fix it but rather we built

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.630 
is we don't fix it but rather we built
it<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.049> special<00:01:46.439> kind<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.979> supports<00:01:47.399> they
