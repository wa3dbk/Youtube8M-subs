00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello today we'll see how 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.599
 weave by accord 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.009
 piranhas also called the cat joe borg 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.690
 so that's nice it can be 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.439
 reversible good there is not the case 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.310
 since I have clips that are curved 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.119
 so the first things to do 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.609
 come install to start a very 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.619
 wise then we'll take the son of 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.429
 left have always passed between 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.510
 the two middle 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.059
 here the right thread between 2 to 6 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.520
 may over the one who just been 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.190
 so it's above it in the middle 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.410
 between the two and if it is still necessary 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.370
 leave a hollow because the string of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.590
 right will go back into the hole next 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.010
 I come to shoot so at the beginning do more 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.000
 Warning 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.800
 porquet the right size and then that's 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.879
 always on the side we just did the 2 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.129
 when we are going to leave 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.770
 so very simply me I would like that 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.550
 instead of orange here there is green 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.619
 so the top 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.450
 so I will always do the green in 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.130
 second 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.150
 so I take the Belgian I go back to 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.740
 the green inside I want it 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.930
 either from above I pass it in the middle 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.540
 over the Belgian as I go 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.659
 to pass and I will come out in the hole 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.540
 here and it will be like this all the time 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.590
 I'm going well tight so I'm coming 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.229
 to have my name I leave with the beige 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.890
 I spend two in the second pass 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.420
 one also over Belgian 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.299
 I leave my hole here to go back to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.360
 inside and I pull 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.649
 and there we see the very wise who appears 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.479
 so it's simple we continue 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.299
 exactly the same way until the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.329
 end of the bracelet I go back inside 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.079
 and I shoot so do not hesitate to ceret to 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.079
 every time inside from above 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:01.259
 in the hole and I pull again 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.000
 again a little slowed down so the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:09.360
 beige between the middle two the green 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.710
 in the middle over the Belgian and I 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.050
 come out in my hole here 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.360
 what game serves is a braiding really 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.250
 nice so a benefit and a 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.390
 disadvantage so the advantage is that 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.100
 if we want to make several bracelets 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.500
 with his bundle of strings bah it's eating 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.900
 not too much body since it takes two 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.490
 pieces of 1 m 10 so that's for 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.020
 my wrist that pretty much I'm leaving 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.800
 about twenty centimeters between 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.330
 20 and 21 to put 10 that's enough 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.640
 and the section disadvantage really wants 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.020
 use it in the head need if we 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.320
 of ephebes will not have a lot of 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.360
 ropes 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.460
 unlike for example a cobra 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.240
 cobra king points where one enters 4 and 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.090
 rope sole 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.580
 so it can be more useful after six 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.650
 elected for aesthetic purposes but let's be 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.520
 honest we do not often have to 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.820
 serve one meter ten of each is enough 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.920
 largely for the faig burned more 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.330
 tense we can come and take 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.960
 swiss knife fish where 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.720
 anything a bit of the pointed at 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.260
 knit to come past the last 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.910
 will be tight when it was 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.650
 just finished with a cut 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:21.800
 the excess of strings and its small margin 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.030
 but not too much when we come 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:31.130
 then burned to finish it I come 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:35.450
 burned my ex and in all the side I 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.630
 stamps with the lighter board created 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.070
 a dish but that could iron 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.670
 in the stitches of that it's going 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.950
 hold on well here we try to do the 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.600
 cleaner finishes possible if 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.000
 possible also under it like that 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.400
 not see and Walloon braiding 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.270
 piranha that could possibly be 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.370
 reversible on this side here is a braiding 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.040
 not very difficult a little more original 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.530
 that cobra I hope this video 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.560
 you will have pleased or help thank you and to 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.560
 soon
