you<00:00:00.719> have<00:00:00.810> clicked<00:00:01.050> on<00:00:01.170> centers<00:00:01.650> part<00:00:02.010> 1<00:00:02.250> this

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
you have clicked on centers part 1 this

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.940 
you have clicked on centers part 1 this
is<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.300> first<00:00:03.510> step<00:00:03.689> in<00:00:03.870> solving<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.500> 4<00:00:04.770> by<00:00:04.920> 4

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
is the first step in solving the 4 by 4

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.309 
is the first step in solving the 4 by 4
by<00:00:05.220> 6<00:00:05.520> cube<00:00:05.850> now<00:00:06.390> let's<00:00:06.540> take<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.750> look<00:00:07.049> at<00:00:07.170> what

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
by 6 cube now let's take a look at what

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.740 
by 6 cube now let's take a look at what
happened<00:00:07.740> after<00:00:07.830> we<00:00:08.250> scrambled<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.849> we<00:00:09.599> can

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
happened after we scrambled it we can

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.570 
happened after we scrambled it we can
see<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.080> these<00:00:10.230> two<00:00:10.290> layers<00:00:10.769> move<00:00:11.160> together

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
see that these two layers move together

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.879 
see that these two layers move together
now<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.420> do<00:00:12.480> these<00:00:12.719> 2<00:00:12.960> layers<00:00:13.139> over<00:00:13.440> here

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
now and so do these 2 layers over here

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.799 
now and so do these 2 layers over here
and<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.429> reason<00:00:14.730> for<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.150> because<00:00:15.179> after

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
and the reason for that is because after

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.660 
and the reason for that is because after
we've<00:00:15.929> gone<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> shape-shifted<00:00:16.980> form<00:00:17.310> all

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
we've gone to the shape-shifted form all

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.550 
we've gone to the shape-shifted form all
of<00:00:17.820> these<00:00:18.150> extended<00:00:18.840> pieces<00:00:19.109> are<00:00:19.439> now

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
of these extended pieces are now

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.429 
of these extended pieces are now
bandaged<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.730> layer<00:00:21.000> here<00:00:21.570> all<00:00:22.020> around

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
bandaged to this layer here all around

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.170 
bandaged to this layer here all around
the<00:00:22.740> cube<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:23.760> basically

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
the cube it's like that so basically

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.779 
the cube it's like that so basically
essentially<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.080> turned<00:00:25.410> into<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.830> 4<00:00:26.609> by<00:00:26.760> 4

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
essentially it's turned into a 4 by 4

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.630 
essentially it's turned into a 4 by 4
cube<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.930> we're<00:00:28.199> gonna<00:00:28.320> solve<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.859> exactly

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
cube and we're gonna solve it exactly

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.030 
cube and we're gonna solve it exactly
like<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.029> 4<00:00:30.240> by<00:00:30.390> 4<00:00:30.420> cube<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.619> change<00:00:31.859> our

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
like a 4 by 4 cube we have to change our

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.280 
like a 4 by 4 cube we have to change our
perspective<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> little<00:00:33.239> bit<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:34.140> reason

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
perspective just a little bit the reason

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.319 
perspective just a little bit the reason
for<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.030> we're<00:00:36.030> gonna<00:00:36.090> be

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
for that is because we're gonna be

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.900 
for that is because we're gonna be
defining<00:00:36.899> some<00:00:37.469> things<00:00:37.739> by<00:00:38.040> these<00:00:38.219> extended

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
defining some things by these extended

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.310 
defining some things by these extended
pieces<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.480> we'll<00:00:39.629> go<00:00:39.750> into<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
pieces and we'll go into that in a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.069 
pieces and we'll go into that in a
second<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.829> as<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.760> there's<00:00:42.059> 4<00:00:42.570> by<00:00:42.719> 4<00:00:42.960> by

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
second so as you know there's 4 by 4 by

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.920 
second so as you know there's 4 by 4 by
6<00:00:43.469> layers<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.450> these<00:00:45.600> cubes

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
6 layers and I know that these cubes

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.959 
6 layers and I know that these cubes
come<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.260> different<00:00:46.620> color<00:00:46.829> schemes<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.910> you

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
come in different color schemes so you

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.369 
come in different color schemes so you
might<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.300> different<00:00:48.510> color<00:00:48.899> scheme<00:00:49.230> in

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
might have a different color scheme in

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.410 
might have a different color scheme in
mind<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.920> happen<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> cube

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
mind I just happen to have if the cube

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.470 
mind I just happen to have if the cube
was<00:00:51.539> standing<00:00:51.960> tall<00:00:52.399> white<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.640> yellow<00:00:54.149> on

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
was standing tall white and yellow on

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.720 
was standing tall white and yellow on
the<00:00:54.660> bottom<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.140> top<00:00:55.289> faces<00:00:55.890> which<00:00:56.430> means

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the bottom and top faces which means

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.250 
the bottom and top faces which means
that<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> other<00:00:57.149> four<00:00:57.539> colors<00:00:57.870> were<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that the other four colors were on the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.810 
that the other four colors were on the
larger<00:00:58.739> faces<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> know<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:01.590> these<00:01:02.430> four

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
larger faces so I know that these four

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.670 
larger faces so I know that these four
pieces<00:01:03.059> right<00:01:03.359> here<00:01:03.420> are<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:04.140> centerpieces

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
pieces right here are my centerpieces

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.490 
pieces right here are my centerpieces
this<00:01:05.010> white<00:01:05.280> red<00:01:05.610> orange<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.240> blue<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.350> can

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
this white red orange and blue and I can

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.010 
this white red orange and blue and I can
see<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.189> white<00:01:08.400> one<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.670> extended<00:01:09.540> which

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
see that the white one is extended which

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.600 
see that the white one is extended which
is<00:01:10.200> why<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.409> said<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.100> white<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
is why I said that the white and the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.370 
is why I said that the white and the
yellow<00:01:11.729> were<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> bottom<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.140> we're<00:01:13.260> gonna

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
yellow were on the bottom so we're gonna

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.740 
yellow were on the bottom so we're gonna
solve<00:01:13.740> these<00:01:13.920> centers<00:01:14.369> exactly<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> 4x4

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
solve these centers exactly like a 4x4

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.880 
solve these centers exactly like a 4x4
and<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:15.990> already<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.290> how<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.710> that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and if you already know how to do that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.219 
and if you already know how to do that
then<00:01:17.400> it'll<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.700> pretty<00:01:17.909> easy<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.600> except

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
then it'll be pretty easy for you except

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.810 
then it'll be pretty easy for you except
we<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> skew<00:01:20.070> our<00:01:20.100> perspective<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
we just have to skew our perspective a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
we just have to skew our perspective a
little<00:01:21.060> bit<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.960> let's<00:01:22.140> start<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:22.530> white<00:01:22.830> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
little bit so let's start with white I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.570 
little bit so let's start with white I
can<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.979> this<00:01:25.979> white<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
can see here that this white is in the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.640 
can see here that this white is in the
bottom-left<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:27.689> pieces<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.470> one

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
bottom-left of these pieces and this one

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.109 
bottom-left of these pieces and this one
it's<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> top<00:01:29.159> right<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.909> match

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
it's in the top right so we can match

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.630 
it's in the top right so we can match
these<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.540> pretty<00:01:30.780> easily<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:31.590> let's<00:01:32.520> look

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
these up pretty easily now let's look

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.890 
these up pretty easily now let's look
around<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.000> cube<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.450> see<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.780> match

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
around the cube and see if we can match

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.539 
around the cube and see if we can match
up<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.110> other<00:01:34.290> two<00:01:34.500> white<00:01:34.680> pieces<00:01:34.950> well

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
up the other two white pieces well

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.359 
up the other two white pieces well
here's<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.939> here<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.450> here's<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.470> here<00:01:37.799> so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
here's one here and here's one here so

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.850 
here's one here and here's one here so
we<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:38.700> match<00:01:38.880> them<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.590> put

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
we can match them up and now we can put

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.530 
we can match them up and now we can put
them<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.220> line<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.939> by<00:01:42.180> turning<00:01:42.509> that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
them in line with this by turning that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.230 
them in line with this by turning that
over<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.399> putting<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.640> line<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:45.119> we've

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
over and putting in a line so now we've

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.660 
over and putting in a line so now we've
got<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.689> our<00:01:45.780> centers<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.220> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
got one of our centers so I know that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.450 
got one of our centers so I know that
the<00:01:47.880> other<00:01:48.750> side<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.950> yellow<00:01:50.159> so

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the other side is going to be yellow so

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.429 
the other side is going to be yellow so
it's<00:01:51.030> fun<00:01:51.240> yellow<00:01:51.570> here's<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.930> yellow<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it's fun yellow here's a yellow and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.010 
it's fun yellow here's a yellow and
here's<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.130> yellow<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.240> match<00:01:54.420> those<00:01:54.720> up

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
here's a yellow we can match those up

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.249 
here's a yellow we can match those up
very<00:01:55.439> easily<00:01:56.450> put<00:01:57.450> them<00:01:57.659> there<00:01:57.869> turn<00:01:58.229> it

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
very easily put them there turn it

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.069 
very easily put them there turn it
around<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.920> bring<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.549> back<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.390> expect<00:02:00.810> you

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
around and bring it back I do expect you

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.889 
around and bring it back I do expect you
know<00:02:01.229> how<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> solve<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.189> 4x4<00:02:02.880> already<00:02:03.450> at<00:02:03.750> least

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
know how to solve a 4x4 already at least

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.370 
know how to solve a 4x4 already at least
I'm<00:02:04.079> hoping<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:05.600> otherwise<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.899> tutorial

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
I'm hoping so otherwise this tutorial

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.900 
I'm hoping so otherwise this tutorial
would<00:02:07.530> take<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> very<00:02:08.129> very<00:02:08.250> long<00:02:08.580> time

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
would take a very very long time

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.449 
would take a very very long time
so<00:02:09.420> here<00:02:10.259> are<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> other<00:02:10.739> two<00:02:11.009> already

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
so here are the other two already

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.700 
so here are the other two already
matched<00:02:11.760> up<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.780> let's<00:02:12.930> put<00:02:13.170> them<00:02:13.319> with

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
matched up so let's put them with

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.590 
matched up so let's put them with
these<00:02:13.830> two<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.520> we<00:02:14.790> put<00:02:15.030> them<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.390> same

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
these two so we put them in the same

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.680 
these two so we put them in the same
layer<00:02:15.960> we<00:02:16.800> kick<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.310> top<00:02:17.610> one<00:02:17.850> out<00:02:18.000> bringing

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
layer we kick this top one out bringing

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.920 
layer we kick this top one out bringing
this<00:02:18.900> white<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.460> turn<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.580> around<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.450> now<00:02:21.510> we

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
this white up turn it around and now we

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.160 
this white up turn it around and now we
can<00:02:22.140> bring<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> white<00:02:22.530> back<00:02:22.770> down<00:02:24.170> which

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
can bring the white back down which

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.160 
can bring the white back down which
aligns<00:02:25.740> our<00:02:26.010> yellow<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.060> let's<00:02:27.480> go<00:02:27.630> for<00:02:27.870> blue

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
aligns our yellow so let's go for blue

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.900 
aligns our yellow so let's go for blue
this<00:02:28.410> time<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.830> keep<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.130> mind<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.700> know<00:02:29.850> you

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
this time and keep in mind you know you

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.640 
this time and keep in mind you know you
might<00:02:30.510> have<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.720> different<00:02:30.930> color<00:02:31.290> scheme<00:02:31.500> so

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
might have a different color scheme so

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.790 
might have a different color scheme so
you<00:02:31.860> might<00:02:31.980> be<00:02:32.010> doing<00:02:32.220> different<00:02:32.640> colors<00:02:33.800> so

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
you might be doing different colors so

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800 
you might be doing different colors so
here's<00:02:35.280> two<00:02:35.550> blues<00:02:35.850> already<00:02:36.360> matched<00:02:36.540> up

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
here's two blues already matched up

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.320 
here's two blues already matched up
let's<00:02:37.020> find<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.320> other<00:02:37.470> two<00:02:37.880> here's<00:02:38.880> one<00:02:39.090> here

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
let's find the other two here's one here

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.910 
let's find the other two here's one here
in<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> top<00:02:39.780> right<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.650> four

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
in the top right of the four

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.410 
in the top right of the four
centerpieces<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:41.910> here's<00:02:42.120> one<00:02:42.270> in<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
centerpieces and here's one in the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.610 
centerpieces and here's one in the
bottom<00:02:42.600> right<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:42.930> let's<00:02:43.080> turn<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.320> one<00:02:43.500> to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
bottom right so let's turn this one to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.920 
bottom right so let's turn this one to
the<00:02:43.740> top<00:02:43.950> left<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.000> we<00:02:45.090> can<00:02:45.240> now<00:02:45.360> match<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.810> up

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
the top left so we can now match it up

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.440 
the top left so we can now match it up
and<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:47.010> know<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.400> one<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.790> this

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
layer the left side of the center and

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.550 
layer the left side of the center and
this<00:02:50.730> one<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.150> gonna<00:02:51.630> be<00:02:51.810> on<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.020> right<00:02:52.170> now<00:02:52.500> we

this one is gonna be on the right now we

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.610 
this one is gonna be on the right now we
can<00:02:52.830> match<00:02:52.980> them<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.280> again<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.020> I<00:02:55.020> know<00:02:55.080> that

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
can match them up again and I know that

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.230 
can match them up again and I know that
if<00:02:55.920> white<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.610> bottom<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.030> blues<00:02:57.210> in

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240

front of me that red is on the right so

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.490 
front of me that red is on the right so
let's<00:02:59.340> put<00:02:59.400> red<00:02:59.760> on<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.060> right<00:03:00.290> here's<00:03:01.290> one

let's put red on the right here's one
piece<00:03:01.770> already<00:03:02.040> here<00:03:02.580> we<00:03:03.240> can<00:03:03.510> match<00:03:04.500> this

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
piece already here we can match this

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.730 
piece already here we can match this
piece<00:03:05.220> up<00:03:05.430> with<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.940> turn<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> sideways<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:07.620> we

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
piece up with it turn a sideways so we

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.850 
piece up with it turn a sideways so we
can<00:03:07.920> get<00:03:08.070> our<00:03:08.250> blues<00:03:08.580> back<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.570> now<00:03:10.410> let's<00:03:10.650> get

can get our blues back and now let's get

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.500 
can get our blues back and now let's get
the<00:03:11.010> other<00:03:11.220> red<00:03:11.490> here<00:03:11.850> they<00:03:12.000> are<00:03:12.150> already

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
the other red here they are already

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.260 
the other red here they are already
matched<00:03:12.750> up<00:03:13.050> for<00:03:13.290> us<00:03:13.410> that's<00:03:13.620> good<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:15.000> let's

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
matched up for us that's good so let's

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.940 
matched up for us that's good so let's
bring<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.660> location<00:03:16.200> where<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.410> needs<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.800> be

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
bring the location where it needs to be

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.080 
bring the location where it needs to be
up<00:03:17.310> next<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.270> it<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:19.080> here<00:03:19.680> let's<00:03:20.430> put<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.880> in

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
up next to it so here let's put this in

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.070 
up next to it so here let's put this in
that<00:03:21.480> location<00:03:21.960> and<00:03:23.510> now<00:03:24.510> let's<00:03:24.750> put<00:03:24.960> that

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
that location and now let's put that

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.590 
that location and now let's put that
back<00:03:25.470> now<00:03:26.460> we<00:03:26.520> can<00:03:26.760> see<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.030> our<00:03:27.120> blue<00:03:27.360> and

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
back now we can see that our blue and

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.420 
back now we can see that our blue and
our<00:03:27.840> red<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.650> know<00:03:28.710> that<00:03:28.920> green<00:03:29.190> is

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
our red and I know that green is

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.220 
our red and I know that green is
opposite<00:03:29.880> blue<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.390> we'll<00:03:30.540> put<00:03:30.690> green<00:03:30.930> here

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
opposite blue so we'll put green here

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.290 
opposite blue so we'll put green here
and<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.890> just<00:03:32.070> happens<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.430> be<00:03:32.640> matched<00:03:32.850> up<00:03:33.120> and

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
and it just happens to be matched up and

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.360 
and it just happens to be matched up and
so<00:03:33.570> are<00:03:33.690> these<00:03:33.810> ones<00:03:34.110> that's<00:03:34.290> pretty<00:03:34.530> easy<00:03:34.590> so

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
so are these ones that's pretty easy so

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.580 
so are these ones that's pretty easy so
let's<00:03:35.520> turn<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:36.000> sideways<00:03:36.510> into<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.350> same

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
let's turn the sideways into the same

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.680 
let's turn the sideways into the same
layer<00:03:37.890> put<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> location<00:03:39.210> where<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.480> green

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
layer put the location where the green

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.850 
layer put the location where the green
needs<00:03:39.990> to<00:03:40.290> be<00:03:40.490> beside<00:03:41.490> the<00:03:42.000> green<00:03:42.740> put<00:03:43.740> the

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
needs to be beside the green put the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.590 
needs to be beside the green put the
green<00:03:44.070> in<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.610> location<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.950> bring<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.100> back

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
green in that location and bring it back

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.000 
green in that location and bring it back
now<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.930> see<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.290> we've<00:03:49.440> got<00:03:49.590> all<00:03:49.860> of

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
now you can see that we've got all of

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.950 
now you can see that we've got all of
our<00:03:50.100> centers<00:03:50.520> and<00:03:50.550> two<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.030> them<00:03:51.150> are<00:03:51.300> extended

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
our centers and two of them are extended

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.510 
our centers and two of them are extended
because<00:03:52.110> this<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.710> going<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:52.950> be<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.190> tall

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
because this is going to be the tall

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.520 
because this is going to be the tall
side<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.240> cube<00:03:54.570> let's<00:03:55.170> go<00:03:55.320> through<00:03:55.500> that

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
side of the cube let's go through that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.290 
side of the cube let's go through that
one<00:03:55.650> more<00:03:56.010> time<00:03:56.040> real<00:03:56.490> quick<00:03:56.520> just<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.090> make

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
one more time real quick just to make

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.720 
one more time real quick just to make
sure<00:03:57.330> that<00:03:57.690> you've<00:03:57.810> got<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.250> okay<00:03:59.250> so<00:03:59.310> here<00:03:59.640> we

sure that you've got it okay so here we

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.550 
sure that you've got it okay so here we
have<00:03:59.880> another<00:04:00.060> scramble<00:04:00.630> now<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:01.200> just<00:04:01.290> really

want to keep in mind that your extended
pieces<00:04:03.930> might<00:04:04.320> not<00:04:04.530> be<00:04:04.740> yellow<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.430> white

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
pieces might not be yellow and white

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.880 
pieces might not be yellow and white

orange either way you can still follow

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.200 
orange either way you can still follow
along<00:04:10.710> by<00:04:10.980> finishing<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.430> white<00:04:11.670> side<00:04:11.910> first

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
along by finishing the white side first

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.610 
along by finishing the white side first
and<00:04:12.450> then<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.690> yellow<00:04:12.840> if<00:04:13.140> that's<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.530> way

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
and then the yellow if that's the way

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.970 
and then the yellow if that's the way

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
can see here that this white piece is in

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.539 
can see here that this white piece is in
the<00:04:18.900> top<00:04:19.230> left<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.739> this<00:04:19.920> one's<00:04:20.130> in<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.280> top

left so let's put one of them in the top

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.890 
left so let's put one of them in the top
right<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.800> now<00:04:23.280> we<00:04:23.340> can<00:04:23.610> match<00:04:23.790> them<00:04:24.060> up<00:04:24.150> now

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
right and now we can match them up now

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.630 
right and now we can match them up now
let's<00:04:25.020> match<00:04:25.200> up<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.710> other<00:04:25.740> two<00:04:26.190> white<00:04:26.400> pieces

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
let's match up to other two white pieces

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.400 
let's match up to other two white pieces
here's<00:04:27.120> one

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
here's one

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.910 
here's one

in<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.130> bottom<00:04:31.400> left<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:31.670> let's<00:04:31.820> put<00:04:32.000> one<00:04:32.180> in

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
in the bottom left so let's put one in

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.970 
in the bottom left so let's put one in
the<00:04:32.360> bottom<00:04:32.660> right<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.290> now<00:04:33.470> we<00:04:33.530> can<00:04:33.800> match

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
the bottom right and now we can match

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.340 
the bottom right and now we can match
them<00:04:34.250> up<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:35.000> we<00:04:35.660> can<00:04:35.810> match<00:04:35.960> them<00:04:36.200> up<00:04:36.290> with

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
them up and we can match them up with

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.250 
them up and we can match them up with
their<00:04:36.710> other<00:04:36.980> pair<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.690> know<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:38.960> yellow

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
their other pair and I know that yellow

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.320 
their other pair and I know that yellow
goes<00:04:39.500> opposite<00:04:40.010> of<00:04:40.160> white<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.880> here's<00:04:41.120> two

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
goes opposite of white and here's two

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.600 
goes opposite of white and here's two
pieces<00:04:41.750> here<00:04:41.900> already<00:04:42.260> this<00:04:43.130> is<00:04:43.340> pretty<00:04:43.520> easy

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
pieces here already this is pretty easy

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.220 
pieces here already this is pretty easy
because<00:04:43.940> once<00:04:44.240> in<00:04:44.390> the<00:04:44.480> bottom<00:04:44.750> left<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.050> ones

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
because once in the bottom left the ones

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.050 
because once in the bottom left the ones
on<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.440> bottom<00:04:45.590> right<00:04:45.890> so<00:04:46.640> the<00:04:46.760> one<00:04:46.910> on<00:04:46.940> the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
on the bottom right so the one on the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.140 
on the bottom right so the one on the
left<00:04:47.270> side<00:04:47.540> let's<00:04:48.380> bring<00:04:48.680> it<00:04:48.830> up<00:04:49.010> put<00:04:49.970> it<00:04:50.000> at

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
left side let's bring it up put it at

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.090 
left side let's bring it up put it at
the<00:04:50.240> bottom<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:50.930> bring<00:04:51.260> it<00:04:51.380> down<00:04:51.560> now<00:04:51.950> they're

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
the bottom and bring it down now they're

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.340

it just happens that three of him three
of<00:06:31.340> them<00:06:31.460> are<00:06:31.610> here<00:06:31.880> and<00:06:32.030> this<00:06:32.540> one<00:06:32.720> is<00:06:32.840> in<00:06:32.870> the

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
of them are here and this one is in the

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.810 
of them are here and this one is in the
bottom<00:06:33.500> right<00:06:33.530> so<00:06:34.040> we<00:06:34.130> need<00:06:34.250> this<00:06:34.400> one<00:06:34.550> to<00:06:34.700> be

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
bottom right so we need this one to be

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.940 
bottom right so we need this one to be
in<00:06:34.850> the<00:06:35.030> bottom<00:06:35.210> left<00:06:35.630> so<00:06:36.410> we<00:06:36.500> can<00:06:36.650> just<00:06:36.800> bring

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950 
in the bottom left so we can just bring

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.640 
in the bottom left so we can just bring
it<00:06:37.100> up<00:06:37.190> and<00:06:37.310> match<00:06:37.520> it<00:06:37.789> and<00:06:37.910> then<00:06:38.690> we<00:06:38.840> can<00:06:39.050> align

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
it up and match it and then we can align

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.250 
it up and match it and then we can align
it<00:06:39.860> just<00:06:40.070> like

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
it just like

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.950 
it just like
that<00:06:40.520> okay<00:06:41.550> so<00:06:41.850> now<00:06:42.030> let's<00:06:42.300> go<00:06:42.420> on<00:06:42.480> with<00:06:42.780> edge

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
that okay so now let's go on with edge

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.450 
that okay so now let's go on with edge
pairing<00:06:43.680> and<00:06:43.830> that's<00:06:43.950> a<00:06:44.040> little<00:06:44.160> bit<00:06:44.370> more

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
pairing and that's a little bit more

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.460 
pairing and that's a little bit more
trickier<00:06:44.970> on<00:06:45.120> this<00:06:45.360> one<00:06:45.570> so<00:06:46.020> go<00:06:46.230> ahead<00:06:46.320> and

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
trickier on this one so go ahead and

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.460 
trickier on this one so go ahead and
click<00:06:46.890> edges<00:06:47.310> part<00:06:47.670> one

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.159 

you

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:55.850 

you

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860
