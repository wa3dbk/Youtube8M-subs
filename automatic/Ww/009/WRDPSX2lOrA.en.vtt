22<00:01:13.420> on<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.690> extra<00:01:14.110> NURBS<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.710> we're<00:01:15.399> just

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
22 on the extra NURBS and we're just

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.990 
22 on the extra NURBS and we're just
going<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.700> put<00:01:16.090> up<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.390> nice<00:01:17.189> blue<00:01:18.189> lava<00:01:18.490> effect

going to put up a nice blue lava effect

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.190 
going to put up a nice blue lava effect
and<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:20.380> here's<00:01:21.250> like<00:01:21.549> where<00:01:21.759> you<00:01:22.000> are<00:01:22.210> do

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
and then here's like where you are do

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.060 
and then here's like where you are do
the<00:01:24.090> depending<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.420> he<00:01:25.539> looks<00:01:25.719> things<00:01:25.930> just<00:01:26.920> go

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
the depending so he looks things just go

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.330 
the depending so he looks things just go
into<00:01:27.310> this<00:01:27.490> thing<00:01:27.759> next<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.210> cube<00:01:28.479> go<00:01:28.869> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
into this thing next to the cube go to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.109 
into this thing next to the cube go to
helix<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:31.750> again<00:01:32.320> go<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.590> circle<00:01:33.009> ok<00:01:33.520> so

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
helix and then again go to circle ok so

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.639 
helix and then again go to circle ok so
now<00:01:34.210> select<00:01:34.630> both<00:01:34.810> of<00:01:34.990> them<00:01:35.170> go<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.009> your<00:01:36.430> a

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
now select both of them go to your a

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.249 
now select both of them go to your a
scale<00:01:38.649> tool<00:01:38.920> scale<00:01:39.789> that<00:01:40.000> down<00:01:40.060> oops<00:01:40.810> don't

back<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.000> kind<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.770> plot<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:33.070> right<00:02:33.310> in

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
back and kind of plot that right in

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.870 
back and kind of plot that right in
there<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.790> like<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.770> it's<00:02:35.770> not<00:02:35.920> like<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.190> now

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
there I like that it's not like that now

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.290 
there I like that it's not like that now
you<00:02:36.940> wanna<00:02:37.120> go<00:02:37.240> your<00:02:37.390> circle<00:02:37.980> scale<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.300> move

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
you wanna go your circle scale to move

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.350 
you wanna go your circle scale to move
the<00:02:40.920> circle<00:02:41.920> down<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:43.180> zero<00:02:43.740> microscopic<00:02:44.740> and

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
the circle down to zero microscopic and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.330 
the circle down to zero microscopic and
put<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.660> middle<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.320> helix<00:02:47.650> ok<00:02:48.280> so

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
put it in the middle of the helix ok so

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.520 
put it in the middle of the helix ok so
now<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.640> have<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:49.000> log<00:02:49.900> over<00:02:50.020> here<00:02:50.290> go<00:02:50.470> to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
now you have that log over here go to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.900 
now you have that log over here go to
your<00:02:50.880> sweep<00:02:51.880> NURBS<00:02:52.590> select<00:02:53.590> both<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.250> helix

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
your sweep NURBS select both this helix

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.580 
your sweep NURBS select both this helix
and<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.240> circle<00:02:55.570> pump<00:02:55.780> under<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.200> sweetener

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
and the circle pump under the sweetener

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.840 
and the circle pump under the sweetener
and<00:02:56.920> now<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.850> got<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.150> fine<00:02:58.600> little<00:02:59.260> line<00:02:59.850> so

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
and now you got this fine little line so

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.060 
and now you got this fine little line so
you're<00:03:01.000> going<00:03:01.180> on<00:03:01.360> circle<00:03:01.810> go<00:03:02.740> back<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.010> the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
you're going on circle go back to the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.580 
you're going on circle go back to the
scale<00:03:03.310> tool<00:03:03.490> and<00:03:03.810> pump<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:04.990> line<00:03:05.170> up<00:03:05.350> while

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
scale tool and pump that line up while

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.340 
scale tool and pump that line up while
holding<00:03:05.770> shift<00:03:05.890> may<00:03:06.340> go<00:03:06.490> faster<00:03:07.060> if<00:03:07.300> you<00:03:08.080> guys

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
holding shift may go faster if you guys

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.430 
holding shift may go faster if you guys
might<00:03:08.560> be<00:03:08.709> able<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.890> hear<00:03:09.070> my<00:03:09.280> mouse<00:03:09.910> cuz

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
might be able to hear my mouse cuz

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.170 
might be able to hear my mouse cuz
sometimes<00:03:11.440> they're<00:03:11.800> stupid<00:03:12.130> it's<00:03:12.790> probably<00:03:12.940> a

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
sometimes they're stupid it's probably a

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.790 
sometimes they're stupid it's probably a
better<00:03:13.510> way<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.840> do<00:03:14.050> this<00:03:14.080> but<00:03:14.410> this<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.680> just

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
better way to do this but this is just

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.990 
better way to do this but this is just
the<00:03:15.130> way<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.250> do<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:17.320> know<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.470> got<00:03:18.000> kind

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
the way I do it and you know I got kind

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.350 
the way I do it and you know I got kind
of<00:03:19.090> got<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.390> line<00:03:19.720> um<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:21.400> wonder<00:03:21.850> up<00:03:22.150> there

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
of got that line um I wonder up there

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.350 
of got that line um I wonder up there
you<00:03:22.540> go<00:03:22.720> okay<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:24.610> click<00:03:24.910> on<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.180> circle

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
you go okay so you click on the circle

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.320 
you go okay so you click on the circle
and<00:03:25.720> go<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.930> object<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:27.550> radius<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.180> guess

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
and go to object and the radius I guess

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.670 
and go to object and the radius I guess
you<00:03:28.480> can<00:03:28.570> play<00:03:28.720> around<00:03:28.840> we're<00:03:29.290> going<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.500> put

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
you can play around we're going to put

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.660 
you can play around we're going to put
my<00:03:29.769> 2.5<00:03:30.390> so<00:03:31.390> it's<00:03:31.540> not<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:31.840> big<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:33.400> can<00:03:33.550> also

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
my 2.5 so it's not that big you can also

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.530 
my 2.5 so it's not that big you can also
put<00:03:34.450> their<00:03:34.780> caps<00:03:35.019> on<00:03:35.200> this<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:36.420> stuff<00:03:37.420> like

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
put their caps on this and stuff like

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.229 
put their caps on this and stuff like
that<00:03:37.600> uh<00:03:38.050> all<00:03:38.800> these<00:03:39.130> settings<00:03:39.580> you<00:03:39.970> can<00:03:40.000> play

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
that uh all these settings you can play

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.880 
that uh all these settings you can play
around<00:03:40.360> with<00:03:40.600> haven't<00:03:40.840> really<00:03:41.050> played<00:03:41.680> around

around with haven't really played around

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.840 
around with haven't really played around
with<00:03:42.010> this<00:03:42.160> too<00:03:42.730> much<00:03:42.940> but<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.230> see<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.950> you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
with this too much but I see that you

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.370 
with this too much but I see that you
can<00:03:46.000> kind<00:03:46.360> of<00:03:46.420> get<00:03:46.570> lost<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.200> all<00:03:47.260> these

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
can kind of get lost in all these

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.040 
can kind of get lost in all these
settings<00:03:47.709> um<00:03:48.070> start<00:03:48.970> growth<00:03:49.209> is<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.840> course

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
settings um start growth is of course

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.710 
settings um start growth is of course
just<00:03:50.650> missed<00:03:51.610> are<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:51.850> cap<00:03:52.209> which<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.450> over
