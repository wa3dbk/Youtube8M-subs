00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
onto the bobbin winder so you just put

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
onto the bobbin winder so you just put
it<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.439> until<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.949> find<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.339> little

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
this so that's the thread so it doesn't

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.039 
this so that's the thread so it doesn't
so<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.549> stays<00:01:32.759> nice<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.000> tight<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.810> I'm<00:01:33.900> just

so it stays nice and tight so I'm just
going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.229> wind<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.590> around

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.899 

I<00:01:45.869> wandered<00:01:46.869> around<00:01:46.960> six<00:01:47.470> times<00:01:47.799> and<00:01:48.340> then

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
I wandered around six times and then

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.789 
I wandered around six times and then
there's<00:01:49.119> a<00:01:49.210> little<00:01:49.450> spot<00:01:49.900> right<00:01:49.930> here<00:01:50.470> in<00:01:50.650> the

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
there's a little spot right here in the

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.039 
there's a little spot right here in the
gray<00:01:51.009> part<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.640> you're<00:01:51.850> threading<00:01:52.659> your

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
gray part of you're threading your

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.210 
gray part of you're threading your
bobbin<00:01:53.799> threader

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
bobbin threader

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.539 
bobbin threader
and<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:56.409> put<00:01:56.680> your<00:01:56.799> string<00:01:57.280> through

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
and you just put your string through

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.170 
and you just put your string through
there<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:58.000> pull<00:01:59.130> in<00:02:00.130> order<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.790> cut<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
there and pull in order to cut the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.990 
there and pull in order to cut the
string<00:02:04.619> sometimes<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.979> gets<00:02:06.190> a<00:02:06.310> little<00:02:06.460> tough

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
string sometimes it gets a little tough

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.630 
string sometimes it gets a little tough
too

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.440 

there<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.730> go<00:02:17.319> okay<00:02:18.319> now<00:02:18.939> the<00:02:19.939> next<00:02:20.090> thing

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
there you go okay now the next thing

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.259 
there you go okay now the next thing
because<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.900> have<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.170> fast<00:02:21.739> winder<00:02:22.489> already

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
because you have a fast winder already

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.589 
because you have a fast winder already
and<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.799> machine<00:02:24.879> I'm<00:02:25.879> gonna<00:02:26.239> go<00:02:26.390> ahead<00:02:26.480> and

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
and the machine I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.809 
and the machine I'm gonna go ahead and
do<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.019> with<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.500> button<00:02:27.920> rather<00:02:28.310> than<00:02:28.609> with

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
do it with the button rather than with

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.629 
do it with the button rather than with
the<00:02:29.239> foot<00:02:30.140> pedal<00:02:30.500> if<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.099> wanted<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.549> it

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:31.639 
the foot pedal if you wanted to do it

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:32.860 
the foot pedal if you wanted to do it
with<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.879> foot<00:02:32.060> pedal<00:02:32.359> you<00:02:32.480> would<00:02:32.599> need<00:02:32.689> to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
with the foot pedal you would need to

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.550 

I'm<00:03:43.240> gonna<00:03:43.420> go<00:03:43.600> ahead<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:43.960> pull<00:03:44.140> this<00:03:44.320> off

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
you have your wound bobbin um you kind

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.720 
you have your wound bobbin um you kind
of<00:04:02.410> need<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.590> check<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.070> make<00:04:03.190> sure<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.580> it's

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
of need to check to make sure that it's

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.050

mostly<00:04:04.090> even<00:04:04.360> you<00:04:05.050> don't<00:04:05.230> see<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.680> money<00:04:06.060> it's

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
mostly even you don't see to money it's

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.910 
mostly even you don't see to money it's
not<00:04:07.210> to<00:04:07.690> uneven<00:04:08.050> which<00:04:08.380> mine<00:04:08.620> looks<00:04:08.830> pretty

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
not to uneven which mine looks pretty

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.850 
not to uneven which mine looks pretty
decent<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.780> next<00:04:11.020> step<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.620> go<00:04:11.770> ahead

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
decent and the next step is to go ahead

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.600 
decent and the next step is to go ahead
and<00:04:12.130> load<00:04:12.370> your<00:04:12.700> bobbin<00:04:13.120> down<00:04:13.360> here<00:04:14.350> into<00:04:14.610> the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
and load your bobbin down here into the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.810 
and load your bobbin down here into the
machine<00:04:16.500> in<00:04:17.500> order<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.830> do<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.790> just

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
machine in order to do that you just

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.270 
machine in order to do that you just
have<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.120> slide<00:04:19.870> this<00:04:20.200> in<00:04:20.560> order<00:04:20.890> to<00:04:20.980> take<00:04:21.100> the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
have to slide this in order to take the

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.850 
have to slide this in order to take the
cover<00:04:21.489> off<00:04:21.610> of<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.260> spot<00:04:23.260> where<00:04:23.380> your<00:04:23.530> band

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
cover off of the spot where your band

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:32.900 
cover off of the spot where your band
goes<00:04:25.740> just<00:04:26.740> have<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:27.090> pull<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.120> right<00:04:29.400> off<00:04:31.860> and

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
goes just have to pull it right off and

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.970 
goes just have to pull it right off and
then<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.030> just<00:04:34.240> drop<00:04:34.420> your<00:04:34.660> bobbin<00:04:35.050> into<00:04:35.620> here

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
then you just drop your bobbin into here

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:42.780 
then you just drop your bobbin into here
while<00:04:36.190> holding<00:04:36.430> onto<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.940> thread<00:04:41.790> pretty

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
while holding onto the thread pretty

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.650 
while holding onto the thread pretty
easy<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:43.930> then<00:04:44.410> you're<00:04:44.560> gonna<00:04:44.680> follow<00:04:45.010> this

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
easy and then you're gonna follow this

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.430 
easy and then you're gonna follow this
path<00:04:46.660> like<00:04:47.110> so<00:04:47.700> you<00:04:48.700> just<00:04:48.730> want<00:04:49.030> to<00:04:49.060> make<00:04:49.210> sure

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
path like so you just want to make sure

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.730 
path like so you just want to make sure
that<00:04:50.440> when<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:50.950> have<00:04:51.640> it<00:04:51.760> in<00:04:51.880> there<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.270> the

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
that when you have it in there that the

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.220 
that when you have it in there that the
bobbin<00:04:53.740> goes<00:04:53.950> underneath<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:55.600> silver<00:04:55.990> part

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
bobbin goes underneath the silver part

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.500 
bobbin goes underneath the silver part
that's<00:04:56.410> inside<00:04:56.890> and<00:04:57.280> doesn't<00:04:57.730> come<00:04:57.940> on<00:04:58.090> top<00:04:58.330> of

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
that's inside and doesn't come on top of

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.480 
that's inside and doesn't come on top of
it<00:04:58.630> which<00:04:58.870> it's<00:04:59.500> hard<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.770> tell<00:04:59.920> from<00:05:00.040> here<00:05:00.310> but

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
it which it's hard to tell from here but

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.250 
it which it's hard to tell from here but
you<00:05:00.730> can<00:05:00.880> see<00:05:01.060> you<00:05:01.210> can't<00:05:01.450> see<00:05:01.690> my<00:05:01.810> string<00:05:02.170> on

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
you can see you can't see my string on

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.090 
you can see you can't see my string on
the<00:05:02.350> top<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:02.890> you<00:05:02.950> know<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.370> it's<00:05:03.490> in<00:05:03.640> there

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
the top so you know that it's in there

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.810 
the top so you know that it's in there
then<00:05:06.100> you<00:05:06.190> just<00:05:06.400> follow<00:05:06.580> it<00:05:06.850> like<00:05:07.000> so<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:08.820> pull

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
then you just follow it like so and pull

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.230 
then you just follow it like so and pull
it<00:05:09.940> around<00:05:10.150> like<00:05:10.330> this<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:11.380> then<00:05:11.770> you<00:05:11.890> just

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
it around like this and then you just

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.390 
it around like this and then you just
give<00:05:13.240> it<00:05:13.330> a<00:05:13.390> pull<00:05:13.600> and<00:05:13.740> your<00:05:14.740> bobbin<00:05:15.160> is<00:05:15.280> in

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
give it a pull and your bobbin is in

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.510 
give it a pull and your bobbin is in
there<00:05:16.860> quite<00:05:17.860> simple<00:05:20.100> although<00:05:21.100> I<00:05:21.130> admit<00:05:21.400> it

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
there quite simple although I admit it

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.250 
there quite simple although I admit it
took<00:05:21.670> me<00:05:21.850> a<00:05:21.880> long<00:05:22.030> time<00:05:22.090> to<00:05:22.300> figure<00:05:22.570> this<00:05:22.690> out

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.170 

and<00:05:26.260> you<00:05:26.350> just<00:05:26.410> snap<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:27.370> top<00:05:27.520> back<00:05:27.760> on<00:05:27.910> and

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
and you just snap the top back on and

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.950 
and you just snap the top back on and
you're<00:05:28.600> done

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
you're done

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.890 
you're done
your<00:05:29.140> bobbin<00:05:29.440> is<00:05:29.560> in<00:05:29.650> your<00:05:29.770> machine
