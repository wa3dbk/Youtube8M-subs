to a fall in Bayonne they obviously with

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.420 
to a fall in Bayonne they obviously with
the<00:01:34.960> particles<00:01:35.530> that<00:01:35.590> are<00:01:35.680> being<00:01:35.860> wafted<00:01:36.130> up

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
the particles that are being wafted up

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.609 
the particles that are being wafted up
off<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.729> bottom<00:01:36.880> by<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.270> fields<00:01:37.750> so<00:01:38.350> as<00:01:38.500> the

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
off the bottom by the fields so as the

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.249 
off the bottom by the fields so as the
rig<00:01:38.830> comes<00:01:39.100> in<00:01:39.340> we've<00:01:40.300> got<00:01:40.509> it<00:01:40.630> set<00:01:40.900> so<00:01:41.110> it's

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
rig comes in we've got it set so it's

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.200 
rig comes in we've got it set so it's
just<00:01:41.530> on<00:01:41.860> bottom<00:01:42.190> you<00:01:42.250> can<00:01:42.400> see<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.670> corn<00:01:42.880> set

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
just on bottom you can see the corn set

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.719 
just on bottom you can see the corn set
way<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.720> then<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:45.009> floats<00:01:45.280> in<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.490> water

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
way and then the floats in the water

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.550 
way and then the floats in the water
there<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:46.659> essentially<00:01:47.080> this<00:01:47.140> is<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.320> real

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
there so essentially this is a real

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.010 
there so essentially this is a real
fishing<00:01:48.330> scenario<00:01:49.330> now<00:01:49.479> isn't<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.780> you've<00:01:49.899> got

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
fishing scenario now isn't it you've got

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.660 
fishing scenario now isn't it you've got
your<00:01:50.140> bowl<00:01:50.290> of<00:01:50.409> groundbait<00:01:50.770> there<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.430> just

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
your bowl of groundbait there you just

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.609 
your bowl of groundbait there you just
lower<00:01:52.000> Chipola<00:01:52.450> River<00:01:52.540> on<00:01:52.720> top<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.200> we've

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
lower Chipola River on top of it we've

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.200 
lower Chipola River on top of it we've
got<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.860> bait<00:01:54.040> sitting<00:01:54.460> exactly<00:01:54.610> where<00:01:54.970> are

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
got the bait sitting exactly where are

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.969 
got the bait sitting exactly where are
these<00:01:55.360> feet<00:01:55.600> we'll<00:01:55.750> be<00:01:55.930> fishing<00:01:56.350> really

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
these feet we'll be fishing really

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.889 
these feet we'll be fishing really
active<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.399> starting<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.210> switch<00:01:58.450> on<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.810> this

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
particles what's interesting is as the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.270 
particles what's interesting is as the
beta<00:02:04.810> settle<00:02:05.259> now<00:02:05.410> on<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.649> bottom<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.130> hook

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
sure if we lift and lowered the bait in

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.930 
sure if we lift and lowered the bait in
again<00:02:11.709> as<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:11.920> would<00:02:12.070> what<00:02:12.220> we<00:02:12.310> call<00:02:12.459> work<00:02:12.700> in

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
there you can see that by moving and

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.199 
there you can see that by moving and
just<00:02:26.950> twitching<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.640> lifting<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.180> dropping

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
just twitching and lifting and dropping

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.900 
just twitching and lifting and dropping
the<00:02:28.720> bait<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.380> really<00:02:29.830> do<00:02:29.980> sparkle<00:02:30.580> reefs

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
the bait you really do sparkle reefs

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.720 
the bait you really do sparkle reefs
average<00:02:31.450> reaction<00:02:31.900> yes<00:02:32.860> it's<00:02:33.190> just<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.459> tiny

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
average reaction yes it's just a tiny

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.640 
average reaction yes it's just a tiny
little<00:02:33.940> trick<00:02:34.209> isn't<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.600> Bitzer<00:02:35.049> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
little trick isn't it Bitzer the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.560 
little trick isn't it Bitzer the
movement<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.400> bait<00:02:36.610> brings<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.390> fish

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
movement of the bait brings the fish

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.090 
movement of the bait brings the fish
down<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.440> pool<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.739> groundbait

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
down to the the pool of groundbait

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.160 
down to the the pool of groundbait
hopefully<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.880> hook<00:02:40.060> bait<00:02:40.269> as<00:02:40.390> well<00:02:40.570> goes

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
hopefully to the hook bait as well goes

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.569 
hopefully to the hook bait as well goes
to<00:02:41.320> show<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.500> what<00:02:41.650> bait<00:02:41.799> such<00:02:42.010> as<00:02:42.160> worms<00:02:42.370> and

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
to show you what bait such as worms and

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.490 
to show you what bait such as worms and
maggots<00:02:42.610> can<00:02:42.970> be<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.239> effective<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:44.230> they're

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
maggots can be so effective if they're

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.319 
maggots can be so effective if they're
moving<00:02:44.829> on<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.010> Thompson<00:02:45.340> moving<00:02:45.610> believable

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
moving on the Thompson moving believable

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.720 
moving on the Thompson moving believable
they<00:02:46.480> do<00:02:46.540> like<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:46.989> special<00:02:47.440> G<00:02:47.620> gold<00:02:47.860> it's

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
they do like that special G gold it's

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.380 
they do like that special G gold it's
really<00:02:49.299> is<00:02:49.390> intriguing<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:50.019> watch<00:02:50.880> look<00:02:51.880> look

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
really is intriguing to watch look look

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.729 
really is intriguing to watch look look
how<00:02:52.510> they<00:02:52.660> puff<00:02:52.870> with<00:02:53.049> it<00:02:53.140> with<00:02:53.410> their<00:02:53.530> fins

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
how they puff with it with their fins

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.319 
how they puff with it with their fins
and<00:02:53.950> just<00:02:54.130> dispersed<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:54.670> ground<00:02:54.970> but<00:02:55.090> and

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
and just dispersed that ground but and

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.729 
and just dispersed that ground but and
you'll<00:02:55.450> notice<00:02:55.660> said<00:02:55.900> it's<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.079> can't<00:02:56.350> come<00:02:56.590> in

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
you'll notice said it's a can't come in

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.350 
you'll notice said it's a can't come in
and<00:02:56.890> they<00:02:57.070> found<00:02:57.310> with<00:02:57.459> their<00:02:57.640> pectoral<00:02:58.000> fins

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
and they found with their pectoral fins

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.270 
and they found with their pectoral fins
and<00:02:58.570> all<00:02:59.019> debate<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.470> in<00:02:59.590> dispersing<00:02:59.950> the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
and all debate is in dispersing the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.340 
and all debate is in dispersing the
water<00:03:00.459> into<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> cloud<00:03:01.090> all<00:03:01.690> those<00:03:01.900> particles

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
water into a cloud all those particles

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.770 
water into a cloud all those particles
that<00:03:02.590> are<00:03:02.680> obviously<00:03:03.010> sucking<00:03:03.640> in<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:03.940> tasted
