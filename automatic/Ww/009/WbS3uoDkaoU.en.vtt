00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
cute Alma video this was filmed just

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.310 
cute Alma video this was filmed just
before<00:00:10.120> the<00:00:10.240> indycar<00:00:10.660> one<00:00:10.840> the<00:00:10.960> other<00:00:11.080> day<00:00:11.170> but

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
before the indycar one the other day but

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.950 
before the indycar one the other day but
I<00:00:11.500> wanted<00:00:11.800> to<00:00:12.090> share<00:00:13.090> with<00:00:13.150> you<00:00:13.420> in<00:00:13.570> a<00:00:13.690> way<00:00:13.780> this

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
I wanted to share with you in a way this

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.930 
I wanted to share with you in a way this
was<00:00:14.110> a<00:00:14.139> practice<00:00:14.740> before<00:00:15.190> I<00:00:15.219> did<00:00:15.370> the<00:00:15.490> indycar

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
was a practice before I did the indycar

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.700 
was a practice before I did the indycar
run<00:00:16.150> I<00:00:16.330> thought<00:00:16.779> I've<00:00:16.869> learned<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.230> circuit

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
run I thought I've learned the circuit

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.800 
run I thought I've learned the circuit
why<00:00:18.099> not<00:00:18.279> do<00:00:18.400> it<00:00:18.430> in<00:00:18.610> a<00:00:18.670> faster<00:00:19.090> car<00:00:19.270> afterwards

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
why not do it in a faster car afterwards

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.450 
why not do it in a faster car afterwards
very<00:00:20.380> different<00:00:20.560> driving<00:00:20.920> though<00:00:21.279> when

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
very different driving though when

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.560 
very different driving though when
you're<00:00:21.550> driving<00:00:21.730> a<00:00:21.880> car<00:00:22.029> like<00:00:22.150> this<00:00:22.210> it's

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
you're driving a car like this it's

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.480 
you're driving a car like this it's
bigger<00:00:22.810> it's<00:00:23.109> heavier<00:00:23.619> it's<00:00:24.070> about<00:00:24.279> power

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
bigger it's heavier it's about power

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.279 
bigger it's heavier it's about power
sliding<00:00:24.910> you<00:00:25.270> get<00:00:25.420> into<00:00:25.630> the<00:00:25.720> Indy<00:00:25.930> car<00:00:26.140> and

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
sliding you get into the Indy car and

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.929 
sliding you get into the Indy car and
realize<00:00:26.529> actually<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:27.100> Indy<00:00:27.250> cars<00:00:27.460> terrible

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
realize actually the Indy cars terrible

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.759 
realize actually the Indy cars terrible
power<00:00:28.150> sliding<00:00:28.480> that's<00:00:29.050> more<00:00:29.260> of<00:00:29.320> a<00:00:29.380> smoother

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
power sliding that's more of a smoother

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.100 
power sliding that's more of a smoother
driving<00:00:29.890> style<00:00:30.430> different<00:00:31.119> challenges<00:00:31.599> to

driving style different challenges to
driving<00:00:32.349> every<00:00:32.680> car<00:00:32.920> i<00:00:33.160> like<00:00:33.519> this<00:00:33.640> course<00:00:33.910> so

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
driving every car i like this course so

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.460 
driving every car i like this course so
this<00:00:34.269> is<00:00:34.360> of<00:00:34.479> course<00:00:34.510> where<00:00:34.930> I'm<00:00:35.050> not<00:00:35.199> nearly

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
this is of course where I'm not nearly

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.340 
this is of course where I'm not nearly
at<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:35.920> maximum<00:00:36.430> I'm<00:00:36.580> not<00:00:36.760> nearly<00:00:36.940> pushing<00:00:37.479> to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
at the maximum I'm not nearly pushing to

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.660 
at the maximum I'm not nearly pushing to
what<00:00:38.500> I<00:00:38.530> can<00:00:38.739> do<00:00:38.860> on<00:00:39.010> this<00:00:39.129> I'm<00:00:39.339> going<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.550> wait

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
what I can do on this I'm going to wait

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.259 
what I can do on this I'm going to wait
until<00:00:40.000> I've<00:00:40.239> got<00:00:40.269> the<00:00:40.479> pc<00:00:40.809> build<00:00:41.019> to<00:00:41.729> on<00:00:42.729> my<00:00:42.879> pc

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
until I've got the pc build to on my pc

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.479 
until I've got the pc build to on my pc
to<00:00:43.930> actually<00:00:44.350> test<00:00:44.830> this<00:00:45.040> because<00:00:45.280> i'd<00:00:45.370> like

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
to actually test this because i'd like

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.850 
to actually test this because i'd like
to<00:00:45.610> drive<00:00:45.760> it<00:00:45.940> with<00:00:46.000> a<00:00:46.059> wheel<00:00:46.239> as<00:00:46.449> well<00:00:46.799> get<00:00:47.799> the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
to drive it with a wheel as well get the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.200 
to drive it with a wheel as well get the
wheel<00:00:48.010> settings<00:00:48.519> right<00:00:48.729> and<00:00:48.970> then<00:00:49.059> i<00:00:49.089> think

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
wheel settings right and then i think

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.020 
wheel settings right and then i think
are<00:00:49.540> my<00:00:50.140> skills<00:00:50.710> will<00:00:50.920> improve<00:00:50.949> immensely<00:00:51.879> in

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
are my skills will improve immensely in

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.780 
are my skills will improve immensely in
terms<00:00:52.299> of<00:00:52.479> precision<00:00:53.379> on<00:00:54.309> some<00:00:54.519> of<00:00:54.670> these

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
terms of precision on some of these

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.369 
terms of precision on some of these
corners<00:00:55.239> you<00:00:55.330> just<00:00:55.540> get<00:00:55.659> so<00:00:55.869> much<00:00:56.110> with<00:00:56.290> the

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
corners you just get so much with the

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.869 
corners you just get so much with the
wheel<00:00:56.559> you<00:00:56.769> can<00:00:56.799> just<00:00:57.040> get<00:00:57.159> the<00:00:57.250> angle<00:00:57.489> just

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
wheel you can just get the angle just

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.630 
wheel you can just get the angle just
right<00:00:58.059> in<00:00:58.629> line<00:00:58.869> with<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:59.140> corner<00:00:59.559> and<00:00:59.710> i<00:01:00.460> just

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
right in line with the corner and i just

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.160 
right in line with the corner and i just
give<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.850> much<00:01:01.059> greater<00:01:01.360> fear<00:01:01.780> or<00:01:01.930> feedback

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
give a much greater fear or feedback

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.560 
give a much greater fear or feedback
from<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.739> car<00:01:02.979> so<00:01:03.549> learning<00:01:03.970> with<00:01:04.210> this<00:01:04.330> car

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
from the car so learning with this car

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.700 
from the car so learning with this car
at<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.780> moment<00:01:04.900> this<00:01:05.140> is<00:01:05.290> just<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.560> learning

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
at the moment this is just a learning

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.889 
at the moment this is just a learning
run<00:01:06.100> so<00:01:06.310> unlike<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.729> other<00:01:07.299> one<00:01:07.600> i<00:01:07.630> just

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
run so unlike the other one i just

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:09.840 
run so unlike the other one i just
wanted<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.170> show<00:01:08.409> how<00:01:08.979> I<00:01:09.009> was<00:01:09.219> discovering<00:01:09.700> my

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
wanted to show how I was discovering my

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.319 
wanted to show how I was discovering my
way<00:01:10.030> around<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.450> circuit<00:01:11.520> again<00:01:12.520> lightly

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
way around the circuit again lightly

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.580 
way around the circuit again lightly
into<00:01:13.420> cars<00:01:13.659> full<00:01:13.810> speed<00:01:14.079> through<00:01:14.259> here<00:01:14.500> you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
into cars full speed through here you

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.690 
into cars full speed through here you
can<00:01:14.710> take<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.829> look<00:01:14.920> bit<00:01:15.070> of<00:01:15.130> grass<00:01:15.340> in<00:01:15.640> this

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
can take a look bit of grass in this

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.219 
can take a look bit of grass in this
next<00:01:15.939> section<00:01:16.149> it<00:01:16.420> can<00:01:16.509> actually<00:01:16.750> slide<00:01:16.990> you

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
next section it can actually slide you

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.690 
next section it can actually slide you
through<00:01:17.439> like<00:01:17.619> I<00:01:17.649> did<00:01:17.920> there<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.159> it<00:01:18.429> just

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
through like I did there and it just

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.399 
through like I did there and it just
loses<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.149> bit<00:01:19.359> of<00:01:19.450> grip<00:01:19.689> which<00:01:19.869> is<00:01:20.020> good<00:01:20.259> for

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
loses a bit of grip which is good for

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.590 
loses a bit of grip which is good for
you<00:01:20.500> in<00:01:20.619> that<00:01:20.649> section<00:01:21.009> car<00:01:21.880> understeers<00:01:22.210> up

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
you in that section car understeers up

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.120 
you in that section car understeers up
the<00:01:22.719> hill<00:01:22.869> here<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:23.229> then<00:01:23.320> really<00:01:23.740> unbalanced

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
the hill here and then really unbalanced

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.649 
the hill here and then really unbalanced
is<00:01:24.250> here<00:01:24.429> but<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:24.609> get<00:01:24.729> full<00:01:25.000> speed<00:01:25.359> there<00:01:25.630> i

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
is here but you get full speed there i

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.959 
is here but you get full speed there i
was<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.869> bit<00:01:26.049> wide<00:01:26.289> so<00:01:26.890> i<00:01:26.920> got<00:01:27.159> that<00:01:27.310> wrong<00:01:27.609> for

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.520 
was a bit wide so i got that wrong for
the<00:01:28.030> next<00:01:28.299> section<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:29.140> you're<00:01:29.229> supposed<00:01:29.439> to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
the next section that you're supposed to

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.139 
the next section that you're supposed to
be<00:01:29.590> full<00:01:29.770> speed<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.340> carry<00:01:30.609> flat<00:01:30.909> out

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
be full speed and you carry flat out

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.029 
be full speed and you carry flat out
through<00:01:31.450> there<00:01:31.659> here<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.320> need<00:01:32.499> a<00:01:32.530> lift<00:01:32.799> get

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
through there here you need a lift get

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.069 
through there here you need a lift get
on<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.219> inside<00:01:33.579> then<00:01:34.149> flat-out<00:01:34.450> up<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.899> hill

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
on the inside then flat-out up the hill

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.169 
on the inside then flat-out up the hill
and<00:01:35.289> then<00:01:35.619> you're<00:01:35.740> breaking<00:01:36.219> blind<00:01:36.609> into<00:01:36.969> this

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
and then you're breaking blind into this

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.499 
and then you're breaking blind into this

the on the exit the corner again here
blind<00:01:45.369> up<00:01:45.609> here<00:01:45.850> but<00:01:46.030> once<00:01:46.149> you<00:01:46.210> get<00:01:46.359> up<00:01:46.479> this

similar to the IndyCar their house
hiding<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.539> little<00:01:52.780> bit<00:01:52.929> here<00:01:53.200> that's<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.249> got

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
hiding a little bit here that's it got

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.370 
hiding a little bit here that's it got
too<00:01:54.789> much<00:01:54.999> get<00:01:55.299> some<00:01:55.450> good<00:01:55.630> speed<00:01:55.869> flat<00:01:56.200> out

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
too much get some good speed flat out

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.719 
too much get some good speed flat out
through<00:01:56.590> here<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:56.920> then<00:01:57.009> you<00:01:57.069> got<00:01:57.159> some<00:01:57.340> bumps

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
through here and then you got some bumps

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.520 
through here and then you got some bumps
you<00:01:57.850> just<00:01:58.060> want<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.240> get

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
you just want to get

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.590 
you just want to get
those<00:01:58.680> bumps<00:01:59.070> they<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.030> unbalanced

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
those bumps they can really unbalanced

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.480 
those bumps they can really unbalanced
you<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:01.049> again<00:02:01.680> like<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.010> Indy<00:02:02.190> cars<00:02:02.400> it

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
you and again like the Indy cars it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.859 
you and again like the Indy cars it
slightly<00:02:02.700> different<00:02:03.060> style<00:02:03.330> this<00:02:03.540> car<00:02:03.780> is

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
slightly different style this car is

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.330 
slightly different style this car is
actually<00:02:04.110> more<00:02:04.170> difficult<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.710> drive<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.220> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
actually more difficult to drive up the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.730 
actually more difficult to drive up the
hill<00:02:05.369> because<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.479> power<00:02:06.810> sliding<00:02:07.259> every

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
hill because your power sliding every

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.130 
hill because your power sliding every
corner<00:02:08.160> again<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.030> break<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.690> turning

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
corner again is that break and turning

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.160 
corner again is that break and turning
approach<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.679> they<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:12.170> again

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
approach that they have to it again

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.900 
approach that they have to it again
breaking<00:02:13.709> at<00:02:14.010> similar<00:02:14.250> time<00:02:14.520> even<00:02:14.850> though

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
breaking at similar time even though

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.670 
breaking at similar time even though
you're<00:02:15.030> going<00:02:15.239> slower<00:02:15.540> get<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.260> car<00:02:16.470> in

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
you're going slower get in the car in

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.440 
you're going slower get in the car in
nice<00:02:16.920> little<00:02:16.950> power<00:02:17.310> slide<00:02:17.640> there<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.090> little

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
nice little power slide there a little

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.990 
nice little power slide there a little
bit<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.720> grass<00:02:18.930> again<00:02:19.260> that's<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.910> that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
bit of grass again that's it and that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000 
bit of grass again that's it and that
just<00:02:21.180> helps<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.480> get<00:02:21.600> round<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> corner<00:02:22.319> flat

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
just helps you get round the corner flat

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.280 
just helps you get round the corner flat
out<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.700> ever<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.209> you've<00:02:24.660> got<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.840> look<00:02:25.110> what

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
out if ever you you've got to look what

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.890 
out if ever you you've got to look what
you<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.440> use<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.310> alter<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.209> grip<00:02:27.390> sometimes

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you can use to alter the grip sometimes

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.229 
you can use to alter the grip sometimes
downhill<00:02:28.319> sections<00:02:28.739> quite<00:02:28.950> difficult<00:02:29.239> this

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
downhill sections quite difficult this

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.640 
downhill sections quite difficult this
is<00:02:30.330> why<00:02:30.450> was<00:02:30.570> learning<00:02:30.930> my<00:02:31.019> way<00:02:31.050> down<00:02:31.380> here

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
is why was learning my way down here

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.199 
is why was learning my way down here
before<00:02:32.040> doing<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.340> Indy<00:02:32.519> car<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.940> was<00:02:33.060> quite

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
before doing the Indy car so I was quite

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.540 
before doing the Indy car so I was quite
slow<00:02:33.510> through<00:02:33.840> here<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.620> then<00:02:35.100> learnt<00:02:35.370> that

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
slow through here and then learnt that

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.280 
slow through here and then learnt that
when<00:02:35.790> I'll<00:02:36.300> doing<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.570> IndyCar<00:02:36.900> section

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
when I'll doing the IndyCar section

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.900 
when I'll doing the IndyCar section
something<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.650> will<00:02:37.769> have<00:02:37.800> already<00:02:38.100> seen<00:02:40.910> if

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
something you will have already seen if

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.970 
something you will have already seen if
you<00:02:42.060> haven't<00:02:42.330> seen<00:02:42.510> me<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.900> car<00:02:43.110> do<00:02:43.560> check

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
you haven't seen me in the car do check

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.490 
you haven't seen me in the car do check
it<00:02:44.160> out<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.940> IndyCar<00:02:45.330> video<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:46.140> see<00:02:46.290> that's

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
it out the IndyCar video you see that's

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.110 
it out the IndyCar video you see that's
where<00:02:46.709> I've<00:02:46.890> taken<00:02:47.310> what<00:02:47.580> I've<00:02:47.700> learned<00:02:47.970> here

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
where I've taken what I've learned here

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.210 
where I've taken what I've learned here
and<00:02:48.510> applied<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:50.100> it's

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and applied it to that but it's

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.160 
and applied it to that but it's
different<00:02:50.250> with<00:02:50.519> every<00:02:50.670> car<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.720> I'll<00:02:51.840> be<00:02:51.989> as

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
different with every car and I'll be as

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.780 
different with every car and I'll be as
I<00:02:52.260> say<00:02:52.410> going<00:02:52.680> through<00:02:52.890> these<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:53.430> once<00:02:53.640> I've

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
I say going through these and once I've

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.360 
I say going through these and once I've
honed<00:02:53.970> my<00:02:54.209> skills<00:02:54.709> coming<00:02:55.709> back<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.130> all<00:02:56.220> this

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
honed my skills coming back to all this

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.670 
honed my skills coming back to all this
later<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.060> year<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.690> say<00:02:58.260> later<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
later in the year and I say later in the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.850 
later in the year and I say later in the
year<00:02:58.769> in<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:58.980> summer<00:02:59.330> doing<00:03:00.330> yielded<00:03:00.690> game<00:03:00.870> on
