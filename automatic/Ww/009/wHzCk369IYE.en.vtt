00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.050 

so<00:00:01.530> pretty<00:00:01.800> well<00:00:01.979> as<00:00:02.129> long<00:00:02.340> as<00:00:02.370> I've<00:00:02.669> had<00:00:02.850> this

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
so pretty well as long as I've had this

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.849 
so pretty well as long as I've had this
pitched<00:00:03.389> ER<00:00:03.570> Pro<00:00:03.840> it's<00:00:04.110> been<00:00:04.319> kind<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.770> a

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
pitched ER Pro it's been kind of a

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.249 
pitched ER Pro it's been kind of a
hassle<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.400> get<00:00:06.150> it<00:00:06.270> started<00:00:06.540> when<00:00:06.839> it's<00:00:06.960> cold

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
hassle to get it started when it's cold

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.950 
hassle to get it started when it's cold
and<00:00:07.820> so<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.849> while<00:00:09.090> back<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.570> took<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
and so a while back I took the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.020 
and so a while back I took the
carburetor<00:00:10.380> apart<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.490> clean<00:00:11.700> out<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
carburetor apart and to clean out the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.089 
carburetor apart and to clean out the
Jets<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.509> particularly<00:00:13.110> paying<00:00:13.590> attention

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
Jets and particularly paying attention

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.460 
Jets and particularly paying attention
to<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.400> idle<00:00:14.700> circuit<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:16.109> blew<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.410> out

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
to the idle circuit and I blew that out

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.900 
to the idle circuit and I blew that out
but<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> carburetor<00:00:17.369> actually<00:00:17.730> looked

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
but the carburetor actually looked

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.660 
but the carburetor actually looked
pretty<00:00:17.970> good<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:19.410> doesn't<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.830> an<00:00:20.279> air

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
pretty good and it doesn't have an air

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.420 
pretty good and it doesn't have an air
screw<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.660> carburetor<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.369> it

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
screw on it the carburetor so but it

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.890 
screw on it the carburetor so but it
does<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> fuel<00:00:24.090> screw<00:00:24.269> that's<00:00:24.539> kind<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
does have a fuel screw that's kind of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.290 
does have a fuel screw that's kind of
hard<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> get<00:00:25.350> at<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> did<00:00:26.670> some<00:00:26.820> tuning<00:00:27.180> on

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
hard to get at so I did some tuning on

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.599 
hard to get at so I did some tuning on
it<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.630> now<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.500> got<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> thing<00:00:29.099> it'll<00:00:29.369> start

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
it and now I got the thing it'll start

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.400 
it and now I got the thing it'll start
first<00:00:29.910> kick<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.720> I'm<00:00:30.810> gonna<00:00:30.929> start<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.349> you

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
first kick so I'm gonna start it for you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.020 
first kick so I'm gonna start it for you
guys<00:00:31.590> today<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.070> hopefully<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.669> doesn't<00:00:32.820> make

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
guys today and hopefully it doesn't make

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.060 
guys today and hopefully it doesn't make
a<00:00:33.059> liar<00:00:33.300> out<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.510> me

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
a liar out of me

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.639 
a liar out of me
so<00:00:35.070> if<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.430> too<00:00:35.610> Pro<00:00:35.790> 90<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.450> really<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.469> this

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
so if it's too Pro 90 I really like this

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.150 
so if it's too Pro 90 I really like this
bike

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
bike

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.680 
bike
so<00:00:39.000> typically<00:00:40.040> motorcycle<00:00:41.040> carb<00:00:41.510> will<00:00:42.510> have

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
so typically motorcycle carb will have

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.450 
so typically motorcycle carb will have
either<00:00:42.989> an<00:00:43.350> air<00:00:44.100> screw<00:00:44.520> or<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.820> fuel<00:00:45.390> screw<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
either an air screw or a fuel screw and

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.580 
either an air screw or a fuel screw and
if<00:00:47.460> there's<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.940> screw<00:00:48.390> towards<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.230> back<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
if there's a screw towards the back of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.430 
if there's a screw towards the back of
the<00:00:49.829> carb<00:00:50.070> near<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> air

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the carb near the like on the air

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.529 
the carb near the like on the air
cleaner<00:00:52.590> side<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.670> that's<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
cleaner side and that's going to be the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.709 
cleaner side and that's going to be the
air<00:00:54.690> screw<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.500> there's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:56.239> screw<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
air screw and if there's a screw on the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.439 
air screw and if there's a screw on the
front<00:00:58.020> part<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> intake<00:00:59.550> side<00:00:59.760> then

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
front part like to the intake side then

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.680 
front part like to the intake side then
that's<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.440> fuel<00:01:01.949> screw<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.789> one

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that's going to be a fuel screw so one

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.630 
that's going to be a fuel screw so one
way<00:01:03.840> you're<00:01:04.019> playing<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.500> fuel<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.460> other

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
way you're playing with fuel the other

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.820 
way you're playing with fuel the other
one<00:01:05.760> you're<00:01:05.939> playing<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.360> air<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.619> one

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
one you're playing with air and this one

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.100 
one you're playing with air and this one
does<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.340> an<00:01:08.880> air<00:01:09.119> screw<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
does not have an air screw you see the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.630 
does not have an air screw you see the
little<00:01:10.260> brass<00:01:10.560> plug<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.159> got<00:01:11.310> put<00:01:11.520> in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
little brass plug that you got put in

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.469 
little brass plug that you got put in
there<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> front<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> carburetor

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
there so on the front of the carburetor

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.440 
there so on the front of the carburetor
hanging<00:01:15.479> upside<00:01:15.900> down<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:17.790> see<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.030> brass

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
hanging upside down you see the brass

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.590 
hanging upside down you see the brass
screw<00:01:18.689> hanging<00:01:19.200> down<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:21.030> that's<00:01:21.479> what

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
screw hanging down there so that's what

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.450 
screw hanging down there so that's what
I<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:21.900> playing<00:01:22.200> with<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.130> was<00:01:23.250> pretty

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
I was playing with and it was pretty

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.280 
I was playing with and it was pretty
hard<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.750> adjust<00:01:24.869> it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
hard to get out to it to adjust it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.080 
hard to get out to it to adjust it
because<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.159> kind<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.580> upside-down

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
because it's kind of like upside-down

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.999 
because it's kind of like upside-down
and<00:01:27.509> how<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.750> get<00:01:27.900> out<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.259> light<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.680> made

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and how do you get out it's light I made

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.530 
and how do you get out it's light I made
a<00:01:29.070> little<00:01:29.280> tool<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.060> got<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> screwdriver

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
a little tool I just got a screwdriver

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.929 
a little tool I just got a screwdriver
down<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.200> welded<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.590> nut<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
down and welded a nut on it and then I

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.359 
down and welded a nut on it and then I
could<00:01:33.119> tune<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.189> actually

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
could tune on it and it was actually

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.670 
could tune on it and it was actually
turned<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.970> quite<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> bit<00:01:36.659> too<00:01:36.810> far<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.530> I've

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
turned in quite a bit too far so I've

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.899 
turned in quite a bit too far so I've
been<00:01:37.799> turning<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.220> out<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.490> turning<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.820> out

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
been turning it out and turning it out

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.600 
been turning it out and turning it out
and<00:01:39.710> checking<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.630> then<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> 465<00:01:44.100> here

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
and checking it so then on the 465 here

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.480 
and checking it so then on the 465 here
it<00:01:45.479> doesn't<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.380> fuel<00:01:46.979> screw<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
it doesn't have the fuel screw in the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.690 
it doesn't have the fuel screw in the
front<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.880> carb<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.170> got<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.700> air

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
front of the carb but it's got the air

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.910 
front of the carb but it's got the air
screw<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.540> because<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.530> at<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
screw at the back because it's at the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.560 
screw at the back because it's at the
intake<00:01:53.790> side<00:01:54.030> or<00:01:54.390> pilot<00:01:54.899> error<00:01:55.049> screw<00:01:55.350> so

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
intake side or pilot error screw so

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.260 
intake side or pilot error screw so
typically<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.840> way<00:01:57.869> these<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.409> set<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:59.270> you

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
typically the way these are set is you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.749 
typically the way these are set is you
you<00:02:00.540> turn<00:02:00.810> them<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.140> till<00:02:02.009> their<00:02:02.189> bottom<00:02:02.579> doubt

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you turn them in till their bottom doubt

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.819 
you turn them in till their bottom doubt
lightly<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.540> then<00:02:03.869> back<00:02:04.110> them<00:02:04.350> out<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.710> then

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
lightly and then back them out and then

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.170 
lightly and then back them out and then
depending<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.399> bike<00:02:05.670> you're<00:02:05.909> going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.090> be

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
depending on the bike you're going to be

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.660 
depending on the bike you're going to be
anywhere<00:02:06.509> from<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.009> half<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.489> two

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
anywhere from like one and a half to two

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.880 
anywhere from like one and a half to two
turns<00:02:08.940> somewhere<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.509> there<00:02:09.690> back<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.530> out

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
turns somewhere in there back it out

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.910 
turns somewhere in there back it out
two<00:02:11.069> turns<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.670> then<00:02:12.599> when<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> engine<00:02:13.530> is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
two turns and then when the engine is

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.610 
two turns and then when the engine is
it<00:02:14.190> shouldn't<00:02:14.459> have<00:02:14.670> any<00:02:15.599> hesitation<00:02:16.440> when

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
it shouldn't have any hesitation when

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.380 
it shouldn't have any hesitation when
it's<00:02:16.830> like<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.430> snapped<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> throttle<00:02:18.300> right

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
it's like you snapped the throttle right

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.050 
it's like you snapped the throttle right
off<00:02:18.569> idle<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.770> does<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.400> like

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
off idle and if it does have like

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.290 
off idle and if it does have like
significant<00:02:21.750> hesitation<00:02:22.380> there<00:02:22.560> then<00:02:23.300> this

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
significant hesitation there then this

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.720 
significant hesitation there then this
is<00:02:24.480> likely<00:02:24.750> where<00:02:25.500> you're<00:02:25.680> gonna<00:02:25.770> find<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.310> cure

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
is likely where you're gonna find a cure

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.850 
is likely where you're gonna find a cure
just<00:02:27.209> by<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.930> know<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.050> quarter<00:02:28.440> turn<00:02:28.590> at<00:02:28.830> a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
just by you know a quarter turn at a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.880 
just by you know a quarter turn at a
time<00:02:28.920> find<00:02:29.730> out<00:02:29.880> what<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.180> likes<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.680> whether

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
time find out what it likes so whether

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.090 
time find out what it likes so whether
it's<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.250> air<00:02:32.430> screw<00:02:32.819> or<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> fuel<00:02:33.390> screw

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
it's the air screw or the fuel screw

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.380 
it's the air screw or the fuel screw
really<00:02:35.100> they're<00:02:35.250> doing<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.580> same<00:02:35.610> job<00:02:36.090> and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
really they're doing the same job and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.570 
really they're doing the same job and
that's<00:02:36.569> it's<00:02:36.900> all<00:02:37.140> about<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.860> starting<00:02:38.400> and

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
that's it's all about the starting and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.120 
that's it's all about the starting and
the<00:02:38.880> idle<00:02:39.209> quality<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.560> throttle

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
the idle quality and the throttle

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.030 
the idle quality and the throttle
response<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.850> if<00:02:42.360> after<00:02:42.600> tuning<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.769> still

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
response and if after tuning you still

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.530 
response and if after tuning you still
can't<00:02:44.280> get<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.610> results<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.150> you're<00:02:45.300> after

can't get the results that you're after

can't get the results that you're after
then<00:02:46.319> from<00:02:46.680> there<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.069> going<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.370> be<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
then from there it's going to be the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.240 
then from there it's going to be the
fuel<00:02:48.840> delivery<00:02:49.050> inside<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.040> carburetor

the carburetor is set fine and it still

doesn't start then from there it's
