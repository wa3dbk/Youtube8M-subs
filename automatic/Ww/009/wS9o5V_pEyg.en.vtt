00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.460
 Hello, good afternoon, I'm from Viking 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.830
 point we are going to teach you different 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.580
 types of tires for riding and 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.620
 new enduro 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.080
 we start with a tire first 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.390
 star of Suarez that is the magic sea ​​and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.310
 with a trail star compound that is the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.009
 intermediate to and the green to be that is for 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.540
 descent the trailer start that is for 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.220
 all mountain and enduro and the country the 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.710
 stars that would be for rear wheel 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.379
 also with super gravity housing that is 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.440
 reinforced this allows us to go up with 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.300
 a kilo of pressure if you see the profile of 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.640
 this tire you see that has the studs 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.489
 very separated and the lateral ones 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.230
 well quite high this 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:52.780
 allows a great grip on both stones 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.550
 roots or even on determined land and in 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.040
 mud 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:03.070
 auto type of tires we have the hand 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:05.199
 down an order or the new nick these 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.350
 three types of tires would be more 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.670
 polyvalent would be for so much for the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.250
 front wheel as for the wheel 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.880
 back you see that the taco unlike 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.170
 of magic mari is much closer and 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.210
 It is not so high 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.800
 the same burn and the new nick 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.530
 it's also the tire is they have 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:29.340
 excellence to mount a 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.799
 taquito more smaller and more together 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.570
 and finally we have the tires 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.609
 new this year about all the rock 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.189
 fatty which are exclusive tires 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.740
 for enduro the mountain for the wheel 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.649
 As you can see, it has a very thin taco 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 very small in the central part and a 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.229
 much higher touch on the side 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.409
 for grip in curves or when we're 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.840
 a little aside the michelin the razer 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.899
 we also do the same to him a taquito 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.270
 very thin in the central part and the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.640
 lateral much higher these tires 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.340
 they allow the dry land to go much more 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.729
 Quick 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.810
 and get the advantages of speed 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.280
 instead of the mixed tires that 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.290
 spend a little more 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.120
 here you have the differences any 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.280
 you can doubt consult our website 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.050
