00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.779
 within the nickelodeon studies before 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.449
 that the first episodes of the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.789
 OddParents leave the air 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.519
 I had done a test episode 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.100
 titled decides desire in Spanish a 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:38.129
 title poor in content since it only 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.710
 it was about a test episode one day 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.470
 we met all the collaborators in 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.019
 the main room to see the episode 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.860
 bouchard man creator of godparents 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.199
 magic was also present we noticed 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.629
 that the chapter had had certain 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.109
 modifications of which no one 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.609
 I had noticed before that meeting 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.550
 now the episode was titled 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.000
 team in which is dead team and want the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.509
 death we were all confused nobody 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.670
 he knew what was happening they did not even put together the 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.830
 episode began just as 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.770
 we had done at the beginning team and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.470
 playing a game on your console the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.940
 magical godfathers in the fishbowl as was 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.490
 to be expected 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.220
 the animation was of very poor quality and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.580
 that as I said before was just an episode 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.740
 of testing and would never go on the air 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.900
 everything was fine in the episode when 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.300
 suddenly team and got bored of playing and 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.390
 He called cosmo and wanda to ask them for a 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.370
 I wish as I expected, I remember that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.100
 the voices of the characters were 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.710
 different to the original voices more 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.890
 well it seemed as if only one person 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.830
 I made the voices of the characters and I 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.220
 screamed cosmo wanda in an exalted way 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.800
 and violent later said wish death 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.650
 then the godparents raised their 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.260
 wands turned them into knives and 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.990
 they started stabbing tim and one and another 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.929
 time until quartered cosmo and wanda 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.420
 they laughed in a very diabolical way the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.320
 screen began to fill with a canvas 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.360
 red that apparently was blood of tim and 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.790
 Armand was furious and left the room 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.000
 thinking that they had played a joke 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.489
 but the episode was not over yet 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.180
 after that, cosmo and wanda stayed 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.549
 seeing 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.340
 I fixed the screen as if I saw the 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.489
 viewer like by about 3 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.560
 minutes for every second that passed the 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.069
 characters became a little more 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.049
 Realistic parents come soon 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.700
 tim and to the room and begin to 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.010
 mourn realistically and that 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.400
 It gave the viewer a strong 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.349
 feeling of loneliness and sadness 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.049
 after that a faint voice is heard 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.469
 saying I have arisen from the blood of 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.540
 demon and no I will not go the weird thing was 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.970
 that the voice was heard inside the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.389
 study but we could not identify 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.180
 exactly where did it come from then 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:11.639
 cosmo and wanda explode yes I know that 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.370
 It sounds weird but their bodies explode 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.680
 as if they were blood bombs and pieces 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.169
 of organs jump around the room and in 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.409
 that moment the shot changes and the 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.519
 photograph of the corpse of a child 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.219
 quartered and pieces of organs 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.379
 bathed in blood the shot returns to 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:30.719
 change and they pass the photograph of the 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.609
 head of a dead girl but with the 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.520
 eyes open and as if seeing the 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.400
 viewer 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.920
 then the shot changed again and now 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.440
 only the credits of 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.200
 the magic godfathers but as a creator 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.540
 it did not appear to look for man but it appeared 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.170
 the initials of all we were 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.850
 confused and obviously terrified 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.770
 but harman commanded to make a 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.660
 inquiry of the facts but not 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.820
 they found nothing 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.340
 Armand asked that we never go back to 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.940
 mention that episode all the material 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.090
 of the episode was destroyed after 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.280
 that every time I close my eyes I see the 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.890
 faces of cosmo and wanda watching me 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.620
 fixedly in the eyes as if they wanted 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.130
 murder took me time to erase 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.230
 all those images of my mind some 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.760
 of those of us who were in that room 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.230
 we had to resort to help 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.100
 psychological to recover from trauma 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.100
 well that was all
