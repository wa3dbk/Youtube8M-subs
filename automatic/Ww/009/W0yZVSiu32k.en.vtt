fish<00:01:25.860> joined<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.549> us<00:01:26.790> shores<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.689> that

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
fish joined up on us shores and that

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.350 
fish joined up on us shores and that
seemed<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.130> opened<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.610> floodgates<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
seemed to have opened the floodgates I

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.230 
seemed to have opened the floodgates I
think<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> media<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.860> by<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.700> large<00:01:32.790> not

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
think the media is by and large not

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.789 
think the media is by and large not
blowing<00:01:33.540> out<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.810> proportion<00:01:33.869> are<00:01:34.470> actually

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
blowing out of proportion are actually

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.710 
blowing out of proportion are actually
under<00:01:35.009> estimating<00:01:35.460> how<00:01:35.520> serious<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.689> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
under estimating how serious it is so I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.210 
under estimating how serious it is so I
believe<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.140> multiple<00:01:37.590> causes<00:01:37.770> but

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
believe we have multiple causes but

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.490 
believe we have multiple causes but
basically<00:01:38.640> they<00:01:38.939> all<00:01:39.060> mean<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> entire

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
basically they all mean that the entire

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.789 
basically they all mean that the entire
