00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
so when you're trying to shape it to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.720 
so when you're trying to shape it to
your<00:02:52.170> head<00:02:52.380> you'll<00:02:52.650> be<00:02:52.710> it'll<00:02:53.190> be<00:02:53.280> fine<00:02:53.550> and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
it's really really like lightweight but

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.580 
it's really really like lightweight but
I<00:02:56.580> actually<00:02:56.790> took<00:02:57.030> another<00:02:57.360> piece<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.930> tulle

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
I actually took another piece of tulle

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.580 
I actually took another piece of tulle
and<00:02:59.600> because<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.690> found<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.050> really<00:03:01.170> hard<00:03:01.320> to

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
and because I found it really hard to

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.900 
and because I found it really hard to
get<00:03:01.770> pins<00:03:02.190> in<00:03:02.580> like<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:05.100> hold<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.610> hold

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910
