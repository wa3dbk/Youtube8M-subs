00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.980
 the loop class number 7 and today we go 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.170
 talk about which operating system 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.640
 used in the rules actions 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.660
 well that's the question and the answer is 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.939
 linux 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.940
 we what linux has the best b 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.320
 the linux kernel was developed by 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.600
 Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.219
 Your source code is available for 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.160
 that anyone can use 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.620
 study modify and distribute 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.120
 freely in accordance with the terms of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 license is linux was a system 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.180
 made by hackers for hackers 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.350
 so much so that the linus torvald itself is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.689
 considered fast then from the beginning 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.600
 linux was made to work on 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.799
 networks and has greater potential for 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.290
 connectivity 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.900
 in addition to the greater number of 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.840
 hardware tools is in 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.330
 and when one and the same 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.470
 hacker tool exists to 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.900
 linux distribution and windows 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.259
 certainly the linux platform will be 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.920
 better and will have more resources to 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.159
 exploited so linux is a system 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.890
 that you will have to finish 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.820
 using the operating system for a 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.439
 hacker 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.439
 it's certainly a linux 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.759
 the current operating systems of the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.200
 microsoft are not indicated for the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.930
 practice because its use in networks was 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.259
 adapted and developed for the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.930
 to be safe for lay users who do not have 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.550
 the purpose of exploring the computer as 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.800
 You will explore how hacker exploits 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.500
 windows as well as having lower 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.010
 connective 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.300
 age and poor hacking tools being 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.970
 that the few that exist do not have great 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.660
 resource quantity 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.880
 still if we are going to use it and attacks 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:33.150
 we can opt for older versions 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.350
 like 98 or 2000 brain 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.740
 mac systems 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.040
 hence they were also made for insurance 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.980
 and besides there are very few 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.150
 users the rule number tool 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.980
 is also very limited then the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.959
 ordinary users can use any 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.120
 operational system 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:01.500
 but you will have to learn how to use linux 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.500
 This is the end of 7
