00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
because i already have a series but good

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.040 
because i already have a series but good
thing<00:02:13.500> i<00:02:13.590> didn't<00:02:13.770> get<00:02:13.860> any<00:02:14.070> because<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.700> mean<00:02:15.050> me

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
thing i didn't get any because I mean me

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.240 
thing i didn't get any because I mean me
do<00:02:16.200> cancel<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.890> kind<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.130> sucks<00:02:18.920> but<00:02:19.920> I

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
do cancel it that kind of sucks but I

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.160 
do cancel it that kind of sucks but I
really<00:02:20.730> liked<00:02:20.850> how<00:02:20.970> they<00:02:21.120> were<00:02:21.180> going<00:02:21.600> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
really liked how they were going you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.780 
really liked how they were going you
know<00:02:22.320> with<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.070> know<00:02:23.100> with<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.370> blu-ray

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
know with it you know with the blu-ray

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.060 
know with it you know with the blu-ray
but<00:02:24.660> apparently<00:02:25.170> they<00:02:25.320> had<00:02:25.560> some<00:02:25.740> problem

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
but apparently they had some problem

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.680 
but apparently they had some problem
with<00:02:26.280> demonstration<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.090> don't<00:02:27.240> know<00:02:27.330> such<00:02:27.540> as

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
with demonstration I don't know such as

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.330 
with demonstration I don't know such as
suspended<00:02:28.020> not<00:02:28.230> cancelled<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:28.950> we'll<00:02:29.130> see

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
suspended not cancelled so we'll see

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.900 
suspended not cancelled so we'll see
what<00:02:29.580> goes<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:29.940> with<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:31.490> maybe<00:02:32.490> they<00:02:32.730> should

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
what goes on with that maybe they should

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.140 
what goes on with that maybe they should
find<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.330> different<00:02:34.160> method<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.340> releasing

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
find a different method of releasing

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.080 
find a different method of releasing
them<00:02:36.330> because<00:02:37.200> i<00:02:37.380> did<00:02:37.800> not<00:02:37.830> i<00:02:38.580> really<00:02:38.850> didn't

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
them because i did not i really didn't

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.900 
them because i did not i really didn't
like<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.390> they're<00:02:39.709> releasing<00:02:40.709> like<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.250> bunch

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
like that they're releasing like a bunch

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.600 
like that they're releasing like a bunch
of<00:02:42.000> different<00:02:42.360> like<00:02:42.630> little<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:44.280> different

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
of different like little like different

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.370 
of different like little like different
blu-rays<00:02:45.180> because<00:02:45.390> like<00:02:45.510> there's<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:46.320> that

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
blu-rays because like there's not that

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.790 
blu-rays because like there's not that
many<00:02:46.590> episodes<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.430> one<00:02:47.700> i<00:02:47.940> mean<00:02:48.780> i<00:02:49.050> think

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
many episodes and one i mean i think

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.290 
many episodes and one i mean i think
would<00:02:50.010> have<00:02:50.130> been<00:02:50.250> good<00:02:50.490> if<00:02:50.550> they<00:02:50.790> added<00:02:51.180> it

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
would have been good if they added it

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.520 
would have been good if they added it
may<00:02:51.390> be<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.540> little<00:02:51.660> bit<00:02:51.840> more<00:02:51.990> episodes<00:02:52.380> on

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
may be a little bit more episodes on

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.800 
may be a little bit more episodes on
each<00:02:52.770> like<00:02:55.160> each<00:02:56.239> blu-ray<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:59.420> maybe<00:03:00.420> i<00:03:00.570> don't

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
each like each blu-ray and maybe i don't

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.479 
each like each blu-ray and maybe i don't
know<00:03:00.989> because<00:03:01.230> i<00:03:01.650> think<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.190> would<00:03:02.400> have

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
know because i think that would have

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.949 
know because i think that would have
been<00:03:02.550> better<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.940> my<00:03:03.090> opinion<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.690> don't<00:03:03.900> like

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
been better in my opinion I don't like

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.330 
been better in my opinion I don't like
having<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.470> bunch<00:03:04.739> of<00:03:04.830> different<00:03:05.160> little

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
having like a bunch of different little

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.360 
having like a bunch of different little
ones<00:03:05.519> so<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.750> don't<00:03:06.870> really<00:03:07.170> know<00:03:07.650> how<00:03:07.800> many<00:03:08.220> are

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
ones so I don't really know how many are

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.800 
ones so I don't really know how many are
in<00:03:08.400> each<00:03:08.610> cell<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.090> I'm<00:03:09.150> not<00:03:09.300> sure<00:03:09.330> how<00:03:09.750> many

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
in each cell and I'm not sure how many

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.140 
in each cell and I'm not sure how many
are<00:03:10.530> at<00:03:10.680> each<00:03:10.890> probably<00:03:11.340> like<00:03:11.459> 12<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
are at each probably like 12 of the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.500 
are at each probably like 12 of the
filtered<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:15.410> okay<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:17.280> says<00:03:17.310> Oh<00:03:17.670> cases<00:03:18.090> first

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
filtered so okay it says Oh cases first

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.130 
filtered so okay it says Oh cases first
17<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.610> but<00:03:20.610> like<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.910> orangeburg<00:03:21.690> has<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:22.080> a

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
17 so but like the orangeburg has like a

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.060 
17 so but like the orangeburg has like a
lot<00:03:22.380> more<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:23.100> know<00:03:23.130> in<00:03:23.730> each<00:03:23.940> one<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.290> lot

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
lot more you know in each one so a lot

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.940 
lot more you know in each one so a lot
of<00:03:26.100> them<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.550> that's<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:26.880> 30<00:03:27.800> something<00:03:28.800> like

but<00:03:34.300> you<00:03:34.390> know<00:03:34.510> it's<00:03:35.320> kind<00:03:35.440> of<00:03:35.560> sucks<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:35.980> see

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
but you know it's kind of sucks to see

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.890 
but you know it's kind of sucks to see
that<00:03:36.310> because<00:03:36.460> they<00:03:37.090> were<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.570> was<00:03:37.780> looking

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
that because they were I was looking

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.320 
that because they were I was looking
forward<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.410> seeing<00:03:38.590> more<00:03:38.680> coming<00:03:39.640> out<00:03:39.790> and

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
forward to seeing more coming out and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.710 
forward to seeing more coming out and
I've<00:03:40.450> been<00:03:40.570> a<00:03:40.600> lot<00:03:40.780> of<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.960> guys<00:03:41.020> work<00:03:42.720> but

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
I've been a lot of you guys work but

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.420 
I've been a lot of you guys work but
hopefully<00:03:44.080> they<00:03:44.230> find<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.560> new<00:03:44.710> way<00:03:44.890> soon<00:03:45.190> so

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
hopefully they find a new way soon so

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.830 
hopefully they find a new way soon so
they<00:03:45.520> can<00:03:45.550> keep<00:03:45.790> coming<00:03:46.090> out<00:03:46.210> with<00:03:46.420> them<00:03:46.600> I

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
they can keep coming out with them I

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.720 
they can keep coming out with them I
mean<00:03:47.710> I<00:03:47.800> hope<00:03:47.920> they<00:03:48.070> don't<00:03:48.220> count<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.550> like

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
mean I hope they don't count it like

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.980 
mean I hope they don't count it like
that<00:03:48.970> don't<00:03:49.240> think<00:03:49.510> they're<00:03:49.600> going<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.840> do

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
that don't think they're going to do

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.840 
that don't think they're going to do
that<00:03:50.200> we<00:03:50.980> probably<00:03:51.280> might<00:03:51.490> take<00:03:51.640> some<00:03:51.790> time

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
that we probably might take some time

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.340 
that we probably might take some time
releasing<00:03:52.240> them<00:03:52.450> again<00:03:52.720> though<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:53.080> don't<00:03:53.200> know

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
releasing them again though I don't know

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.080 
releasing them again though I don't know
what<00:03:53.500> do<00:03:53.560> you<00:03:53.620> guys<00:03:53.740> think<00:03:53.800> no<00:03:54.520> so<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.760> want<00:03:55.030> to
