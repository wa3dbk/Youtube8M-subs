that are in here

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.860 
that are in here
for<00:02:27.030> example<00:02:27.599> let's<00:02:28.170> take<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> look<00:02:28.680> at<00:02:29.870> let's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
for example let's take a look at let's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.400 
for example let's take a look at let's
say<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.379> 1912<00:02:32.160> steyr<00:02:32.550> Han<00:02:33.260> interesting<00:02:34.260> gun

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
say the 1912 steyr Han interesting gun

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.619 
say the 1912 steyr Han interesting gun
rotating<00:02:34.920> barrel<00:02:35.160> kind<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.459> cool<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.450> had

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
rotating barrel kind of cool if I had

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:37.930 
rotating barrel kind of cool if I had
one<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.019> would

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
one I would

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.070 
one I would
trying<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.000> find<00:02:39.120> out<00:02:39.239> more<00:02:39.360> about<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.750> flip

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
trying to find out more about it I flip

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.290 
trying to find out more about it I flip

these two particular guns have fairly
short<00:03:39.510> sections<00:03:39.959> because<00:03:40.290> they<00:03:40.530> weren't<00:03:40.709> very

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
short sections because they weren't very

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.620 
short sections because they weren't very
extensively<00:03:41.579> used<00:03:44.090> let's<00:03:45.090> see<00:03:45.329> for<00:03:45.599> example

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
extensively used let's see for example

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.720 
extensively used let's see for example
here's<00:03:46.079> another<00:03:46.230> one<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.829> 1910<00:03:47.310> Bergman

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
I think the the audience for this book

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.310 
I think the the audience for this book
is<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.030> bit<00:05:12.240> wider<00:05:12.540> than<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:12.960> might<00:05:13.110> suspect

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
is a bit wider than you might suspect

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.730 
is a bit wider than you might suspect
just<00:05:14.040> from<00:05:14.310> that<00:05:14.460> limitation<00:05:14.970> because<00:05:15.870> the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
just from that limitation because the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.590 
just from that limitation because the
military<00:05:17.040> pistols<00:05:17.730> used<00:05:18.000> by<00:05:18.210> these<00:05:18.390> countries
