00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.460 
stalks can't have greater yield
potential<00:02:19.970> than<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.239> same<00:02:20.540> hybrid<00:02:21.080> planet

potential than that same hybrid planet

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.770 
potential than that same hybrid planet
at<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.620> lower<00:02:21.800> population<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:23.300> reason<00:02:23.660> we

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
at a lower population and the reason we

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.420 
at a lower population and the reason we
see<00:02:24.020> this<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.500> because<00:02:24.800> as<00:02:24.920> we<00:02:25.040> get<00:02:25.220> more

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
see this is because as we get more

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.210 
see this is because as we get more
plants<00:02:25.849> per<00:02:26.000> acre<00:02:26.110> we<00:02:27.110> in<00:02:27.230> turn<00:02:27.470> get<00:02:27.739> more<00:02:27.950> ear

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
plants per acre we in turn get more ear

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.620 
plants per acre we in turn get more ear
for<00:02:28.550> acre<00:02:28.670> which<00:02:29.000> contributes<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.540> the

that<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.540> experiment<00:02:32.900> also<00:02:33.200> demonstrates

that this experiment also demonstrates

that this experiment also demonstrates
is<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.430> corn<00:02:34.880> grown<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.600> twin<00:02:35.840> row

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
is that corn grown in a twin row

is that corn grown in a twin row
configuration<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.400> lot<00:02:37.790> more<00:02:38.030> evenly

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
configuration is a lot more evenly

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.780 
configuration is a lot more evenly
spaced<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.080> it<00:02:39.650> can<00:02:39.770> actually<00:02:40.130> produce<00:02:40.340> a
