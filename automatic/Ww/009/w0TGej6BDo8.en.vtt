00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.769
 that means it will be Erich Pommer from China and maybe he would be for the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.070
 Hamburger December the degree program is from Eschenbach 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.390
 omits my first semester Boel Oscar 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.900
 I always know exactly how to think 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.830
 I come from municipalities 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.170
 is Indira Gandhi or at the University of Hannover are in recent semesters 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.860
 before studying internship 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.580
 against Hannover we all offered the preparatory program that 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.429
 means the culprit plans that is neither his preparation program for 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.920
 German students and also from Nice students 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.880
 it's going to be a bit scared and that's what we're all about 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.210
 Income can be us 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.210
 should be able to prepare for four hours 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.100
 b 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 so lives 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.150
 For example, they saw the North Sea as a disaster 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.490
 what helped a lot has got so promising as you 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.570
 could learn and how to render anonymous callers really sturdy and viruses 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.440
 so 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.440
 I thought that was right or even lower 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.760
 "We have a package of measures of this 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.960
 a program is called that Strache city rallye made 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.790
 although that is a bit 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.940
 exhausting though 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.820
 I enjoy that and companies have it 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.820
 Hanover is also very nice 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.250
 Yes, there are 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.720
 Katie Price in her sister city Tralee and 4 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.960
 I believe he participants get a prize 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.009
 either big role 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:32.680
 yes, of course I will change this Ernst Forster course 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.139
 hire all freshmen 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.529
 and then 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:42.019
 I think that's valuable because "I have a lot of Germany 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.489
 Students and foreign students met 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.829
 and percent they have more support when asked 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.629
 on the demands of these studies and percent 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.059
 I also have a lot of my Germany around and with these German students 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:58.529
 improve more 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:00.249
 all so far 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.079
 did not really meet many people 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.409
 Above all, I was able to learn so well 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.409
 and I can really say that they are missing no case 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.799
 then they test 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.109

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.329
