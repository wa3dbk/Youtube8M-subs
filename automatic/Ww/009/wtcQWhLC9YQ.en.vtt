00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
as they are prostate cancer so if you

try and eradicate the cancer since it's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.370 
try and eradicate the cancer since it's

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
like to take each of these questions and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.340 
like to take each of these questions and
try<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.170> put<00:02:43.320> some<00:02:43.530> frameworks<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:45.350> and

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
try and put some frameworks on this and

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.410 
try and put some frameworks on this and
what<00:02:46.530> kind<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:46.860> prostate<00:02:47.310> cancer<00:02:47.370> do<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.150> have

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
what kind of prostate cancer do we have

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.330 
what kind of prostate cancer do we have
and<00:02:48.780> actually<00:02:49.380> we<00:02:49.470> ended<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.830> last<00:02:50.040> session

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
and actually we ended the last session

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.650 
and actually we ended the last session
with<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.840> spirited<00:02:52.800> discussion<00:02:53.120> about<00:02:54.120> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
with a spirited discussion about the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.270 
with a spirited discussion about the
fact<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.020> some<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.500> these<00:02:55.620> cancers<00:02:56.130> are

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
fact that some of these cancers are

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.640 
fact that some of these cancers are
harmless<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.030> need<00:02:57.240> no<00:02:57.420> treatment<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
harmless and need no treatment and the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.890 
harmless and need no treatment and the
question<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.190> how<00:02:59.550> do<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.760> identify<00:02:59.820> that<00:03:00.660> is

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
question is how do you identify that is

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.840 
question is how do you identify that is
this<00:03:01.380> being<00:03:01.650> identified<00:03:02.100> well<00:03:02.550> in<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
this being identified well in the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.270 
this being identified well in the
community<00:03:03.360> are<00:03:03.540> people<00:03:04.260> being<00:03:04.440> over<00:03:04.770> or<00:03:04.950> under

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
community are people being over or under

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.450 
community are people being over or under
treated<00:03:05.700> as<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:07.260> mentioned<00:03:07.620> further<00:03:07.890> some<00:03:08.250> will

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
treated as I mentioned further some will

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.540 
treated as I mentioned further some will
kill<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:09.000> less<00:03:09.210> than<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.570> year<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.050> do<00:03:10.920> see<00:03:11.310> men

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
kill in less than a year I do see men

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.220 
kill in less than a year I do see men
whose<00:03:11.790> PSAs<00:03:12.300> are<00:03:12.480> doubling<00:03:12.870> every<00:03:13.200> 14<00:03:13.650> days

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
whose PSAs are doubling every 14 days

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.300 
whose PSAs are doubling every 14 days
and<00:03:16.230> whose<00:03:16.470> PSAs<00:03:17.040> are<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.090> thousands<00:03:18.720> and

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
and whose PSAs are in the thousands and

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.190 
and whose PSAs are in the thousands and
so<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.520> is<00:03:20.700> can<00:03:20.970> be<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.180> very<00:03:21.420> lethal<00:03:21.630> disease

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
so this is can be a very lethal disease

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.440 
so this is can be a very lethal disease
so<00:03:22.830> while<00:03:23.070> there's<00:03:23.340> some<00:03:23.520> people<00:03:23.820> being<00:03:24.030> over

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
so while there's some people being over

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.900 
so while there's some people being over
to<00:03:24.630> over<00:03:25.170> treated<00:03:25.620> it's<00:03:26.010> equally<00:03:26.430> true<00:03:26.700> that

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
to over treated it's equally true that

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.150 
to over treated it's equally true that
many<00:03:27.810> men<00:03:28.080> are<00:03:28.230> being<00:03:28.440> under<00:03:28.740> treated

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
many men are being under treated

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.800 
many men are being under treated
particularly<00:03:29.970> people<00:03:30.120> with<00:03:30.330> metastatic

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
particularly people with metastatic

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.650 
particularly people with metastatic
disease<00:03:31.050> are<00:03:31.620> routinely<00:03:32.370> under<00:03:32.850> treated<00:03:33.270> in

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
disease are routinely under treated in

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.230 
disease are routinely under treated in
the<00:03:34.080> United<00:03:34.440> States<00:03:34.740> if<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.640> take<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
the United States if you take the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.270 
the United States if you take the
incidence<00:03:36.750> figures<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.380> dr.<00:03:37.710> Bostic<00:03:38.160> was

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
incidence figures that dr. Bostic was

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.060 
incidence figures that dr. Bostic was
talking<00:03:38.820> about<00:03:38.910> from<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.750> autopsy<00:03:40.230> series

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
talking about from the autopsy series

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.030 
talking about from the autopsy series
you<00:03:41.910> estimate<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.450> 30<00:03:43.260> million<00:03:43.560> men<00:03:43.890> in

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
you estimate that 30 million men in

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.360 
you estimate that 30 million men in
America<00:03:44.550> will<00:03:44.700> have<00:03:44.730> prostate<00:03:45.360> cancer<00:03:46.370> well

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
America will have prostate cancer well

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.480 
America will have prostate cancer well
30<00:03:47.670> thousand<00:03:48.210> died<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:49.260> given<00:03:49.590> year<00:03:49.620> more<00:03:50.400> or

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
30 thousand died in a given year more or

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.080 
30 thousand died in a given year more or
less<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.970> that's<00:03:51.510> less<00:03:51.780> than<00:03:51.810> 1/2<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.410> percent

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
less and that's less than 1/2 a percent

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.630 
less and that's less than 1/2 a percent
so<00:03:54.090> really<00:03:54.720> this<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:55.080> disease<00:03:55.590> where<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.130> vast

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
so really this is a disease where a vast

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.140 
so really this is a disease where a vast
bulk<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.210> the<00:03:57.390> prostate<00:03:57.930> cancer<00:03:58.350> out<00:03:58.560> there<00:03:58.860> is

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
bulk of the prostate cancer out there is

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.140 
bulk of the prostate cancer out there is
not<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.210> threat<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.750> life<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.290> patient

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
not a threat to the life of a patient

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.050 
not a threat to the life of a patient
but<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.210> small<00:04:03.570> set<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.900> disease<00:04:04.740> which<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.610> in

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
but a small set of disease which is in

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.520 
but a small set of disease which is in

Bostwick said today the major tool we

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.360 
Bostwick said today the major tool we
have<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.530> fact<00:04:25.740> is<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.220> Gleason<00:04:26.640> grade

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.280 
have in fact is the Gleason grade
there<00:04:28.060> are<00:04:28.180> many<00:04:28.389> exciting<00:04:28.600> things<00:04:29.169> coming

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
there are many exciting things coming

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.469 
there are many exciting things coming
along<00:04:29.770> from<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.490> laboratory<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.210> allow<00:04:31.449> us

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
to more fully characterize the tumour

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.439 
to more fully characterize the tumour
