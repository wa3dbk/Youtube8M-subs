00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.420
 Hello my bender and today you 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.490
 talk about dangerous and damn 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.590
 interesting fashion which is something 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.109
 kind of yes and z only for mikroft 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.400
 and it's called kraft 5 very cool 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.279
 mod which found on one American 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.109
 website link in the description and let's get started 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.029
 in order firstly the zombies are no longer 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.250
 burn in the afternoon well it's natural as if yes 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.199
 it is already pasman darth and all over the world 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 such constructions are generated here in 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.279
 which you can find different things about 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.350
 I will tell them a little later so the zombies are not 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.360
 saying by day and now zombies can you not 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.309
 only to see but also to hear we have 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.320
 two new indicators as you can see how many 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.180
 she hears and how many of us see that is 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.399
 how hard to hear how much us 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.170
 see further we see how much zambia we 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.270
 already killed and how many players we killed 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.010
 very useful thing if you deliver from 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.789
 mod on multiplayer you can brag 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.420
 screenshots 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.879
 I have already flunked 115 zombies 537 people 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.590
 terribly and further we see three more 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.289
 indicator is an indicator of hunger 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.449
 measure and record blood of Dzharty 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.309
 of these indicators, shards alone are important 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.380
 because everyone else here for example 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.150
 blood count is the same as hearts 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.310
 timage you hearts the less this 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.470
 indicator and however it is all a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.360
 Gold index and of the same thing as 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.400
 hearts and actually about all 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.290
 indicators I told you therefore with 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.509
 pure conscience can go to the creative 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.250
 mode where all these indicators disappear 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.439
 now I will tell you about things and 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.119
 buildings in this mod 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.950
 buildings for example can be found in 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.020
 each building almost has a chest 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.450
 and in the chest there are useful things for example 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.250
 here we found the legs normal legs 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.259
 which will help us kill the zombies let's 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.329
 try using it to kill zombies go 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.670
 here buddy as you can see zombies are all now 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.740
 with different textures and they hit harder 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.960
 the sooner this I am seriously talking to you and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.390
 With this knife, we kill zombies 2 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.450
 strikes but there is one minus this zombie 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.090
 this knife is very fragile it is literally 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.460
 breaks for 3-4 blows which is regrettable and 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.110
 here we see the hospital just like everything in 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.270
 tom yes and z let's see what we have 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.000
 there are these hospital blood bags here 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.130
 no but there is morphine and other stuff let's 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.620
 let's go inside the coffee &amp; tea is not filled 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.990
 a game 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.270
 m literally so the first little chest 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.520
 what we have in it and in it we have an ax and 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.400
 medication and water let 's order 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.260
 across we found all edged weapons that 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.190
 there is in this fashion it is literally ours 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.200
 the cathedral and piss the layout of the long knife they 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.060
 all kill about the same with two 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.550
 strikes sometimes with one if you 're lucky 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.290
 farther u as for marfino here 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.180
 you can break your leg let's go out 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.610
 creative regime and actually fall from 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.740
 heights big till broke his leg and 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.600
 now we need to inject morphine so that 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.430
 we lost it on her and after some 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.290
 time you can run again 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.690
 I spoke and as you can see index 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.060
 blood it is an indicator of health and 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.430
 we also have a honey pack 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.260
 find in the hospital and not only if you 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.760
 want to quickly settle pinch 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.530
 right -click and restore 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.900
 modpak health can be used 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.090
 several times it is very comfortable and that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.430
 Thirst for thirst can be restored 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.620
 different way you can these can with pepsi 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.800
 a can of coke and even a flask of water 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.230
 which can put it in the ponds but 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.120
 we now have only a Pepsi bank 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.190
 let's drink and thirst for the idea 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.230
 recovered and remains empty 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.060
 can speccy also have pan killer 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.890
 they also restore your health 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.320
 like a normal birdie let's go to 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.120
 here on this one 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.100
 also probably some water or it's a fire 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.410
 honestly let's see what we have inside 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.850
 there is also a fire at these as hard 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.850
 zombies will spawn 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.500
 here we found a bat this one more but this 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.350
 can not be called cold weapons it 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.360
 most likely heavy weapons and also we 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.280
 here I found morphine in it I already said and 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.900
 ammunition store is here 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.510
 firearm is just the same 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.250
 very cool thing and let's turn on 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.080
 Creative mode I will show you all 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.510
 practically a firearm that 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.550
 There is in this mod here it is here it is all 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.510
 firearms as many as many many 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.580
 species here it 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.730
 and let's start with this gun 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.099
 ammo to him there is a gun here 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.290
 coal gas as it flies on is 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.330
 what's up with a gun look near well 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.480
 or if you just Voroshilov shooter 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.150
 next we have a shotgun Mayor May 1014 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.330
 as you can see to leave a canister that is 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.400
 You can be very popular because of the zombies 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.269
 useful thing but to him expensive cartridges 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.720
 it's hard to find them further we go mp5 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.110
 mp5k 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.180
 shortened something happens often but 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.250
 detail we are so hard to find before his 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.110
 very difficult to find so 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.150
 reconcile thoughts stop what are you going 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.100
 walk more often with a regular gun 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.620
 but why are there rails I do not know honestly 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.720
 saying this weird two years and then 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.539
 we are AK-47's on it Diss 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.570
 serious weapon and easier to find than 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.430
 will add that enough and she shoots with 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.229
 large spread ammunition to it is very 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.289
 easy to find common m. 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:56.039
 your ak-47 is your choice and sniper 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:59.070
 the rifle knows this very simply 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.990
 but almost frictional cool on 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.850
 in fact , I thought more purposefully if 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.600
 you click on the bus had to find 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.570
 so here 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.910
 much nicer to reach we reach 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.400
 we fall so much better and farther with us 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.289
 go jars of water Pepsi jars like 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.720
 I said before and a flask of water 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.190
 further we have a bandage to we can 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.680
 use it to restore health 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.570
 that's all medicines that 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.639
 have this mod and also have binoculars 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.099
 wine is like a cool thing if you hit 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.990
 f button then you can look with 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.240
 using binoculars on various zambies 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.340
 ahead and then for example kill them 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.500
 there is something else in general 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.200
 things in this mod it concerns complexity 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.300
 games honestly i played without creative mode and 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.820
 really difficult zombies are many zombies 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.080
 attacking you at night in general just 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.330
 Kick some going on 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.849
 but here are different bases for example 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.560
 this is some kind of red base spawn to me 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.270
 I especially liked the helicopter I do not know 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.160
 it will probably hardly show him 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.710
 Does the fact that it is rare it is very 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.349
 useful things in general present d z for 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.419
 minecraft so here's the mods on 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.370
 that's all I wanted to say about him and 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.470

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.090
