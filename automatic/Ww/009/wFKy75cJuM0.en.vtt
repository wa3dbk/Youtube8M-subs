00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 a metallic object of 200 kilos appeared 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.960
 in a forest of Siberia the past 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.599
 Sunday a group of residents of the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.990
 Russian town of another ski located 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.480
 3,600 km east of Moscow they found 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.150
 this metal part 2m 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.609
 diameter and 200 kilos of weight in an area 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.800
 of forest near your village attracted 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.380
 by its form and its possible origin 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.830
 according to them he could only have fallen from 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.900
 sky 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.880
 They decided to tow it to the city 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.759
 to be inspected by the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.829
 authorities the object so almost 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.050
 spherical and that is open on the part 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.149
 superior has been confiscated by the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.489
 Russian policeman being present 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.100
 in their custody waiting for more 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.460
 Analysis is not yet known with certainty 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.870
 what can this piece of metal be 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.390
 second and lime and the space agency 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.399
 Russia has ruled that it can be of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.500
 of space technology although the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.199
 conclusions will be revealed after a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.420
 more exhaustive analysis however 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.399
 all indications point to that in 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.260
 effect it is a piece of a 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.730
 satellite launched from the base of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.680
 kazakhstan 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.300
 inhabitants of other minds that claim 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.280
 they heard a great roar in the 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.240
 forest where this piece appeared in 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.040
 December 2011 on the 23rd of that month 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.710
 failed the third stage of a rocket 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.800
 Soyuz 2 that he was carrying in his compartment 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.360
 of cargo a meridian military satellite 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.490
 disintegrating and scattering its pieces 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.070
 for a large area of ​​the region of 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.190
 novosibirsk the object is titanium 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.260
 metal that due to its characteristics 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.450
 Lightness and strength is used with 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.270
 frequency in aviation missiles e 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.300
 aerospace industry its high cost what 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.760
 makes it prohibitive for other tasks 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.950
 if we unite all these signs it seems 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.050
 that the most reasonable explanation is that 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.850
 we are facing a piece of meridian cloud 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.400
 the initial refusal of the agency 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.380
 spatial space may be due to how hard 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.730
 that must be fit two failures 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 consecutive 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.150
 fobos grunt and now this one what leaves them 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.150
 very in evidence
