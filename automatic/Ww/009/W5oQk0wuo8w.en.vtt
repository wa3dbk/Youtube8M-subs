a<00:00:08.400> possibility<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.809> think<00:00:10.410> that

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
a possibility of that I think that

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.339 
a possibility of that I think that
there's<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:11.219> place<00:00:11.700> for<00:00:11.820> Damon<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.809> become<00:00:13.139> good

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
and somewhat moral and maybe a place for

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.470 
and somewhat moral and maybe a place for
Stefan<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.379> do<00:00:17.220> something<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.760> he's<00:00:18.029> not

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
Stefan to do something that he's not

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.640 
Stefan to do something that he's not
proud<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.020> again

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.259

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.640 
mythology's were kind of meant to change
I<00:00:27.630> mean<00:00:27.810> there's<00:00:28.019> something<00:00:28.320> really<00:00:28.560> cool

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
I mean there's something really cool

about<00:00:29.240> Mythology<00:00:30.240> being<00:00:30.510> able<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.750> change

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
about Mythology being able to change

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.560 
about Mythology being able to change
having<00:00:32.340> creative<00:00:32.669> license<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.239> change<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
mythology to adapt to modern time and I

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.780 
mythology to adapt to modern time and I
think<00:00:39.300> what's<00:00:39.450> great<00:00:39.629> about<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.989> old<00:00:40.170> classic

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
think what's great about the old classic

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.970 
think what's great about the old classic
Dracula's<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.500> different<00:00:43.800> time

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
Dracula's was that in a different time

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.279 
Dracula's was that in a different time
in<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.250> different<00:00:44.280> period<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.969> filmmaking<00:00:45.360> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
in a different period of filmmaking it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.200 
in a different period of filmmaking it
made<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> lot<00:00:46.770> more<00:00:46.890> sense<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.670> time<00:00:47.940> in

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
made a lot more sense and this time in

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.040 
made a lot more sense and this time in
error<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.050> mean<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:50.039> an<00:00:50.309> audience<00:00:50.700> now<00:00:52.969> we

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
error I mean we as an audience now we

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.080 
error I mean we as an audience now we
associate<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.289> much<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.680> modern<00:00:56.250> times<00:00:56.579> with

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
associate so much of modern times with

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.290 
associate so much of modern times with
our<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.750> aesthetically<00:00:58.469> find<00:00:58.739> appealing

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
our what we aesthetically find appealing

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
our what we aesthetically find appealing
at<00:01:00.300> least<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.840> would<00:01:01.260> say<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> mass<00:01:01.800> majority

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
at least I would say the mass majority

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.539 
at least I would say the mass majority
of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> market<00:01:03.180> does<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.920> watch<00:01:05.070> old<00:01:05.339> film

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
of the market does I can watch old film

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.010 
of the market does I can watch old film
some<00:01:05.820> glow<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> face<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.540> love<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.810> some

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
some glow in the face and love it some

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.370 
some glow in the face and love it some
people<00:01:07.140> don't<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.619> them<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.020> think<00:01:10.110> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
people don't like them and I think that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.370 
people don't like them and I think that
adapting<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.520> technology<00:01:11.549> now<00:01:12.390> are<00:01:12.689> adapting

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
adapting to technology now are adapting

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.859 
adapting to technology now are adapting
to<00:01:13.500> modern<00:01:13.860> times<00:01:14.130> now<00:01:14.400> really<00:01:15.390> lends<00:01:15.630> itself

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to modern times now really lends itself

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.990 
to modern times now really lends itself
to<00:01:15.990> being<00:01:16.110> able<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.560> drop<00:01:16.890> into<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.400> into<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
to being able to drop into it into a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.539 
to being able to drop into it into a
story<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.619> able<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> associate<00:01:20.280> more

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
story more to be able to associate more

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.700
