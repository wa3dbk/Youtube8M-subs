00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.549
 Hello I 'm the Irish to Negotiate 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.129
 with you and enjoy sharing 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.450
 two new site version features 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:21.820
 one of them has to do with the pelÃ© mode in the 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.520
 day by day at the opening of our store a 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.710
 of routines is very important is my 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.110
 payments and how we pay 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.540
 everton 16 brings here a functionality 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.750
 excellent integration with 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.850
 automatism whose judgment insisted on 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.870
 pick up the best event terminals from 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.940
 automatic payment 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.829
 this way these updates that 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.300
 we basically brought is the following 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.399
 when made and is 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.050
 made at the point of sale 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.420
 the value automatically goes to 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.879
 to premiere what he wanted behind 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.920
 when value minimize error and therefore 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.859
 also give credibility to the whole process 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.769
 other side also the shopkeeper does not lose 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.600
 time and typing a value has already been 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.180
 computer system at the same time. 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.160
 time for the customer to pay 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.810
 because it values â€‹â€‹a lot 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.910
 plus the process for not intervention 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.600
 human and the rest is history and we have 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.720
 we know 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.460
 enough pupil and you're already 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.900
 we'll see in terms of functionality is 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.260
 which is related to the personal way 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.940
 that we did here is is made of 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.430
 opportunities an area that is very 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.100
 in companies which take advantage of the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.540
 then vacation craft only daycare 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.650
 we used three large 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.640
 features I would like to 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.340
 share with you 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.920
 the first one is having a set of 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.530
 fields that can bring one or a filter 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.430
 the table employees way is tv everyone 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.800
 employees in behavior 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.710
 so if, even after 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.690
 This is another great opportunity and 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.880
 see on the basis of this reflection and poster 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.130
 updated records is the map of 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.140
 holiday and immediately understand all the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.910
 people who are involved are 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.220
 distributed graphically by this map 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.380
 series may also know the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.210
 of the holidays, the persons already booked 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.170
 they marked every holiday day in fact 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.630
 free to bookmark 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.700
 and last but not least as I 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.800
 I am also analyzing the conflicts and 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.519
 themes of what the visual is to see if everything is 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.959
 good 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.050
 as much as I say that we exist 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.030
 colleagues 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.220
 I infer I can divide the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.060
 click here and navigate to the registry and 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.640
 take the gaps is for is to correct 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.000
 This is it, I hope 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.770
 continuity and diverting 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.580
 comment the new version of the site 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.580
 defend
