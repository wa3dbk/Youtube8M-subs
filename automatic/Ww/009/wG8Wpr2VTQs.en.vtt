00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.500
 welcome a new video tutorial les 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.270
 your server and brother d'angelo speak 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.010
 6,666 and this time I bring you a 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.140
 new tutorial in which I'm going to 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.600
 explain how to record your gameplays from 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.770
 the correct way in this way 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.170
 we can record at a resolution not 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.720
 they will weigh a lot and we will be using a 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.420
 program which very few people what 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.250
 they usually know in the games the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.949
 they record with a program called frank 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.460
 but that program generates a lot of the pnc and 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.559
 when rendering the games 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.930
 they weigh a lot the videos weigh a lot like this 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.370
 that I do not recommend using that program and 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.190
 well let's start with this tutorial 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.400
 we will be using a program called the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.350
 history is a very good program if not 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.720
 you have it in the description of the video you 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.880
 I'll be leaving a link that will take you to 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.350
 the official page here you can 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.240
 download simply select 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.759
 download 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.520
 and you select the version you want 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.380
 download ok this is option 1 for 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.840
 download it also if you want it 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.479
 download from my blog you can what 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.100
 you can download I recommend that you 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.289
 downloads from my blog because here 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.450
 I put some images of how to download it 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.570
 okay 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.009
 and well what downloads do you install once 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.979
 what do you do installed then we are going to 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.219
 configure it we do not execute it with double 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.219
 click 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.729
 will be coming to this interface as 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.040
 we see is a more complete interface that of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.170
 What he is going to do is configure it 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.960
 let's go to the folder that we have 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.760
 from this side to choose where we are going to 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.670
 save our videos for this 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.369
 we will be adding a new folder of 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.710
 this side we add one and select 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.509
 the location where we want to store the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.690
 videos in this case I'll save them in the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.869
 desk let's accept we'll go down more 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.640
 below and we can find another location 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.770
 we select the folder and this is for 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.140
 save the images that we got that 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.570
 we got to capture then the same 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.180
 we choose a location now let's 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.580
 configure the keyboard to start 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.950
 record and stop the recording we go 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.200
 the keyboard we have this side as 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.390
 where it says to be and this we are going to 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.630
 select with what key do we want that 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.570
 start recording in this case that gf1 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.060
 and the second is with what keys we want 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.080
 take screenshots photos or 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.000
 screenshot they will select efe 2 and 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.610
 well now we're going to go 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.860
 and where to record 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.350
 and we are going to configure the options of 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.770
 video that I recommend first 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.480
 that a new codec is installed in the 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.370
 description of the video I'll be leaving you 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.680
 a link that will reflect this page 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.140
 web here is going to select this codec 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.000
 this codec what is going to do is that you 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.690
 will allow your games time 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.760
 in HD at the highest resolution and the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.590
 games are not going to weigh much what is going to 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.680
 do is it's going to compress the size of 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.190
 the games and you're not going to lose quality like that 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.200
 that we select download 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.720
 we wait for the five seconds that we 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.960
 they ask for this side and automatically 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.870
 will be initiating the download 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.610
 good once it has been downloaded 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.260
 we minimize what is our window and 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.750
 what we are going to do is close the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.240
 program where it says exit we close it 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.730
 to be able to install the codec we are going to 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.620
 run the application that we download 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.769
 we execute it as administrator 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.590
 we select next we select next 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.659
 we select install as we see is 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.180
 installing we can select next and 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.530
 we select finish once this is done 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.090
 we reopen what is ours 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.350
 program we execute it as 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.480
 administrator 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.360
 well now we are going to configure what 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.250
 is the video on this side in video codec 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.620
 let's select the codec that 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.170
 we just installed in this case is the 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.350
 pool 264 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.239
 vf w we are going to select it we are going to 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.430
 select the feather we have in 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.030
 this side here where it says preset what 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.130
 let's change from medium to ultra fast and 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.020
 let's check this box that we have 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.600
 on this side it is very important that the 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.480
 We mark that if we do not mark it, we will 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.690
 to make an error when recording 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.760
 done this we select ok from this side 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.500
 let's select the resolution in the 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.480
 which we want to work our games 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.790
 I recommend that if you want to record 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.060
 the games at the original resolution what 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.650
 leave as they are but if you want 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.660
 record them especially to upload them to 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.410
 youtube I recommend that you select 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:57.600
 this button and put the resolution hd that 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.600
 it is 1280 x 720 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.460
 done this is going to select the fps you 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.730
 I recommend that you use 30 for your 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.520
 computer does not try hard and does not 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.680
 do what is the game now let's 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.840
 configure what audio is for that 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.000
 we are going to go to the box that 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.550
 we have this side and good 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.610
 by default it will leave us 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.550
 option 1 that is marked to record what 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.650
 what is the game I recommend you here 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.440
 in audio format, put the first 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.890
 option remember that you have to be in 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.870
 pcm and if you want to record your voice if 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.750
 you want to comment on the games what is going to 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.850
 do is add a new source of 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.390
 sound will select the plus sign 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.090
 it happens with clicking on the number 2 and 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.300
 here where it says destination is going to select 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.940
 the microphone of your pc in this way 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.130
 you can record what is the audio and the 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.530
 game at the same time bone you can 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.720
 comment in this case to me I do not 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.030
 Interested in commenting on the gameplay so I 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.100
 I take it out once done this is already 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.130
 configured what is our 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.280
 and we can start recording in this 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.400
 case I will record a game called halo 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.830
 custom edition is an online game that the 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.710
 which generates a lot and I think it's a 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.680
 excellent test to prove that the 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:25.160
 history records at a very good resolution 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.260
 and without generating much good lag before 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.400
 say goodbye I want to ask you to give him a 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:34.250
 like to this video subscribe in the md 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.090
 like on facebook and well then let's start 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.090
 with the recording
