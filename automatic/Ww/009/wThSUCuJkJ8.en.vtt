one<00:03:32.579> of<00:03:32.669> the<00:03:32.730> things<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.060> we<00:03:33.150> do<00:03:33.329> is<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.690> our

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
one of the things that we do is in our

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.809 
one of the things that we do is in our
R&amp;D<00:03:33.989> development<00:03:34.919> as<00:03:35.069> we<00:03:35.280> get<00:03:35.459> in<00:03:35.609> there<00:03:35.790> we

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
R&amp;D development as we get in there we

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.729 
R&amp;D development as we get in there we
say<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.419> is<00:03:36.540> what<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:36.810> really<00:03:37.169> wish<00:03:37.349> we<00:03:37.530> had

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
say this is what we really wish we had

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.009 
say this is what we really wish we had
get<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.579> design<00:03:39.060> then<00:03:39.389> we<00:03:39.540> take<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.870> out<00:03:39.989> and

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
get a design then we take it out and

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.080 
get a design then we take it out and
just<00:03:40.169> thrash<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:40.919> stuff<00:03:41.160> in<00:03:41.370> competition<00:03:42.060> so

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
just thrash this stuff in competition so

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.030 
just thrash this stuff in competition so
we<00:03:42.299> beat<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.690> up<00:03:42.840> change<00:03:43.139> it<00:03:43.319> if<00:03:43.470> we<00:03:43.590> need<00:03:43.799> to

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
we beat it up change it if we need to

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.550 
we beat it up change it if we need to
really<00:03:44.879> get<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.150> perfected<00:03:45.599> and<00:03:45.930> then<00:03:46.260> we<00:03:46.349> come

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
really get it perfected and then we come

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.009 
really get it perfected and then we come
back<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:47.069> and<00:03:47.340> with<00:03:47.549> our<00:03:47.699> R&amp;D<00:03:47.849> teams<00:03:48.449> they<00:03:48.840> go

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
back in and with our R&amp;D teams they go

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.979 
back in and with our R&amp;D teams they go
ahead<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.379> perfect<00:03:49.769> this<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.430> quality

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
ahead and perfect this and the quality

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.030 
ahead and perfect this and the quality
workmanship<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.049> they<00:03:52.290> can<00:03:52.470> put<00:03:52.650> into<00:03:52.799> it's

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
workmanship that they can put into it's

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.039 
workmanship that they can put into it's
much<00:03:53.280> better<00:03:53.489> than<00:03:53.760> we<00:03:53.879> can<00:03:54.090> do<00:03:54.239> but<00:03:54.750> they<00:03:54.930> get

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
much better than we can do but they get

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.080 
much better than we can do but they get
those<00:03:55.260> designs<00:03:55.650> perfected<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.790> at<00:03:56.910> that

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
those designs perfected and at that

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.640 
those designs perfected and at that
point<00:03:57.269> we<00:03:57.510> can<00:03:57.660> then<00:03:57.840> roll<00:03:58.109> this<00:03:58.230> into<00:03:58.470> our

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
point we can then roll this into our

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.860 
point we can then roll this into our
military<00:03:58.829> police<00:03:59.489> applications<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.480> we<00:04:00.599> know

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
military police applications and we know

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.479 
military police applications and we know
that<00:04:01.049> it's<00:04:01.199> been<00:04:01.379> tested<00:04:01.620> thoroughly<00:04:02.010> and

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
that it's been tested thoroughly and

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.050 
that it's been tested thoroughly and
hard

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
hard

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.659 
hard
we've<00:04:03.569> won<00:04:03.840> with<00:04:04.139> it<00:04:04.319> we've<00:04:04.799> beat<00:04:05.099> it<00:04:05.250> up<00:04:05.430> and

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
we've won with it we've beat it up and

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.420 
we've won with it we've beat it up and
they<00:04:06.030> can<00:04:06.209> trust<00:04:06.419> it<00:04:06.629> at<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:06.870> point<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:08.370> a

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
they can trust it at that point so a

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.039 
they can trust it at that point so a
couple<00:04:08.730> things<00:04:08.879> we<00:04:09.120> do<00:04:09.299> in<00:04:09.510> three<00:04:09.870> gun

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
couple things we do in three gun

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.930 
couple things we do in three gun
shooting<00:04:10.440> is<00:04:10.590> we<00:04:10.949> obviously<00:04:11.190> go<00:04:11.639> through<00:04:11.849> the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
shooting is we obviously go through the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.699 
shooting is we obviously go through the
various<00:04:12.269> guns<00:04:12.629> now<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:12.959> lot<00:04:13.199> of<00:04:13.319> times<00:04:13.500> there's

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
various guns now a lot of times there's

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.860 
various guns now a lot of times there's
an<00:04:13.859> option<00:04:14.250> on<00:04:14.370> this<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:14.879> depending<00:04:15.599> on<00:04:15.690> what

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
an option on this and depending on what

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.870 
an option on this and depending on what
equipment<00:04:16.139> what<00:04:16.680> division<00:04:16.949> you're<00:04:17.280> using<00:04:17.519> is

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
equipment what division you're using is

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.509 
equipment what division you're using is
we'll<00:04:18.090> do<00:04:18.780> different<00:04:19.140> things<00:04:19.349> so<00:04:20.099> on<00:04:20.280> this

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
we'll do different things so on this

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.550 
we'll do different things so on this
particular<00:04:20.849> event<00:04:21.390> we're<00:04:22.169> going<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.409> put

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
particular event we're going to put

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.350 
particular event we're going to put
three<00:04:22.860> rounds<00:04:22.890> on<00:04:23.400> each<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.820> silhouette

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
three rounds on each of the silhouette

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.649 
three rounds on each of the silhouette
targets<00:04:24.689> with<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.960> rifle<00:04:25.430> change<00:04:26.430> guns<00:04:26.759> break

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:27.659 
targets with the rifle change guns break

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:29.570 
targets with the rifle change guns break
all<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.139> clay<00:04:28.349> pigeons<00:04:28.800> in<00:04:28.949> the<00:04:28.979> back<00:04:29.250> and

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
all the clay pigeons in the back and

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.879 
all the clay pigeons in the back and
then<00:04:30.120> put<00:04:30.389> one<00:04:30.719> shot<00:04:31.020> on<00:04:31.229> each<00:04:31.409> of<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.650> round

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
then put one shot on each of the round

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.100 
then put one shot on each of the round
steel<00:04:32.370> targets<00:04:32.879> up<00:04:33.030> front<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:33.750> it's<00:04:33.900> kind<00:04:34.080> of

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
steel targets up front so it's kind of

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.659 
steel targets up front so it's kind of
the<00:04:34.229> shooters<00:04:34.530> choice<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:35.069> how<00:04:35.189> you<00:04:35.250> want<00:04:35.520> to

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
the shooters choice of how you want to

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.999 
the shooters choice of how you want to
do<00:04:35.789> this<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:36.270> depending<00:04:36.659> on<00:04:36.719> what<00:04:36.930> we<00:04:37.050> have<00:04:37.289> we

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
do this so depending on what we have we

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.170 
do this so depending on what we have we
can<00:04:38.189> do<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.370> different<00:04:38.729> ways

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
can do it different ways

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.420 
can do it different ways
Maggie's<00:04:39.509> shooting<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.870> open<00:04:40.229> shot<00:04:40.500> gun<00:04:40.710> so

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
Maggie's shooting the open shot gun so

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.100 
Maggie's shooting the open shot gun so
after<00:04:41.729> she<00:04:41.759> shoots<00:04:42.120> those<00:04:42.300> back<00:04:42.539> ones<00:04:42.810> you<00:04:42.960> can

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
after she shoots those back ones you can

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.869 
after she shoots those back ones you can
just<00:04:43.289> do<00:04:43.409> a<00:04:43.439> quick<00:04:43.650> reload<00:04:44.129> on<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.520> that<00:04:44.699> and

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
just do a quick reload on to that and

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.610 
just do a quick reload on to that and
then<00:04:44.939> shoot<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.569> steel<00:04:45.780> targets<00:04:46.259> with<00:04:46.439> that

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
then shoot the steel targets with that

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.589 
then shoot the steel targets with that
we'll<00:04:46.830> see<00:04:46.979> how<00:04:47.099> that<00:04:47.159> time<00:04:47.580> goes<00:04:47.849> and<00:04:48.150> then

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
we'll see how that time goes and then

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.240 
we'll see how that time goes and then
when<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:48.780> go<00:04:49.020> into<00:04:49.199> it<00:04:49.379> is<00:04:49.590> I'll<00:04:49.740> go<00:04:49.860> ahead<00:04:49.889> and

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
when I go into it is I'll go ahead and

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.010
