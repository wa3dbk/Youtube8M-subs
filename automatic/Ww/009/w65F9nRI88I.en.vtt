00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
and all the rest here we as the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.160 
and all the rest here we as the
components<00:00:40.880> of<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.530> transaxle<00:00:43.180> say<00:00:44.180> over

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
components of the transaxle say over

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.220 
components of the transaxle say over
here<00:00:45.700> we<00:00:46.700> had<00:00:46.880> developed<00:00:47.210> bodyguard<00:00:49.960> all<00:00:50.960> that

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
here we had developed bodyguard all that

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.610 
here we had developed bodyguard all that
so<00:00:51.980> part<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:52.400> it<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:53.510> then<00:00:53.720> we<00:00:54.020> had<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.410> clutch

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
so part of it and then we had the clutch

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
so part of it and then we had the clutch
rings<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.160> back<00:00:55.720> yeah

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
rings the back yeah

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.130 
rings the back yeah
the<00:00:57.900> bearings<00:00:59.570> the<00:01:00.570> input<00:01:00.900> shaft<00:01:01.880> and<00:01:03.140> Lester

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the bearings the input shaft and Lester

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.260 
the bearings the input shaft and Lester
the<00:01:04.290> pilots<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.980> long<00:01:05.640> slide<00:01:05.910> this<00:01:06.060> has

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the pilots that long slide this has

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.850 
the pilots that long slide this has
actual<00:01:06.660> main<00:01:06.840> difference<00:01:07.320> between<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
actual main difference between a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.680 
actual main difference between a
transaction<00:01:10.760> transmission<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:13.730> I<00:01:14.730> hit

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
transaction transmission is that I hit

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.320 
transaction transmission is that I hit
the<00:01:15.870> farmer<00:01:16.230> drive<00:01:16.500> built<00:01:17.370> inside<00:01:17.760> whereas<00:01:18.210> if

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
the farmer drive built inside whereas if

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.920 
the farmer drive built inside whereas if
the<00:01:18.510> transaction<00:01:18.960> does<00:01:19.580> it<00:01:20.580> has<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.180> diff<00:01:21.450> not

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the transaction does it has the diff not

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.200 
the transaction does it has the diff not
built<00:01:22.170> inside<00:01:22.530> direct<00:01:22.860> talk<00:01:23.100> our<00:01:23.550> ghost<00:01:23.940> rates

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
built inside direct talk our ghost rates

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.530 
built inside direct talk our ghost rates
the<00:01:24.390> wheels<00:01:26.000> transmission<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.120> goes<00:01:27.300> down<00:01:27.510> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the wheels transmission it goes down a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.570 
the wheels transmission it goes down a
shaft<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> DEF<00:01:28.410> through<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.190> rear<00:01:29.370> wheels

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
shaft as the DEF through the rear wheels

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.530 
shaft as the DEF through the rear wheels
so<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.100> say<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.550> trans<00:01:32.790> actual<00:01:33.180> passing

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
so you can say the trans actual passing

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.190 
so you can say the trans actual passing
was<00:01:33.660> a<00:01:33.690> lot<00:01:33.869> bigger

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
was a lot bigger

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.100 
was a lot bigger
the<00:01:35.040> Honda<00:01:35.280> transmission<00:01:36.119> transaxle<00:01:36.869> it's

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the Honda transmission transaxle it's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.980 
the Honda transmission transaxle it's
very<00:01:37.380> similar<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.070> manual<00:01:38.430> transmission

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
very similar to a manual transmission

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.180 
very similar to a manual transmission
instead<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.140> having<00:01:40.350> sync<00:01:40.710> roads<00:01:40.950> and

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
instead of having sync roads and

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.680 
instead of having sync roads and
selectors<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> clutch<00:01:42.450> which

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
selectors and as the clutch which

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.930 
selectors and as the clutch which
operates<00:01:43.140> from<00:01:43.320> hydraulic<00:01:43.619> pressure<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
operates from hydraulic pressure to

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.390 
operates from hydraulic pressure to
change<00:01:44.970> gear<00:01:45.509> ratio<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.530> supplied<00:01:47.160> to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
change gear ratio is really supplied to

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.100 
change gear ratio is really supplied to
the<00:01:47.460> second<00:01:47.880> clutch<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.420> first<00:01:48.660> clutch<00:01:48.930> is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the second clutch as the first clutch is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.350 
the second clutch as the first clutch is
released<00:01:49.440> allowing<00:01:50.400> drives<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:51.090> pass
