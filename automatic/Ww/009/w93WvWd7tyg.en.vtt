just<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.880> was<00:00:08.970> in<00:00:09.090> my<00:00:09.210> notes<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:09.840> videos<00:00:10.139> I've

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
just it was in my notes for videos I've

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
been meaning to make and I figured

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.610 
been meaning to make and I figured
that'd<00:00:12.269> be<00:00:12.389> kind<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.809> an<00:00:12.929> easy<00:00:13.080> wondering<00:00:13.500> for

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
that'd be kind of an easy wondering for

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.599 
that'd be kind of an easy wondering for
and<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.000> thought<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.299> would<00:00:15.420> chest<00:00:15.870> do<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.350> uh

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
and so I thought I would chest do it uh

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.150 
and so I thought I would chest do it uh
I've<00:00:17.609> had<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.060> adapt<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.630> slightly<00:00:19.070> but<00:00:20.070> i'll

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
I've had to adapt it slightly but i'll

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.590 
I've had to adapt it slightly but i'll
explain<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.730> minute<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.390> first

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
for Vanity's sake I don't know that was

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.460 
for Vanity's sake I don't know that was
just<00:03:25.060> me<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.210> like<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.570> idea<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:25.930> earrings<00:03:26.290> I

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
just me I like the idea of earrings I

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.290 
just me I like the idea of earrings I
think<00:03:26.650> they<00:03:26.740> look<00:03:26.920> cool<00:03:26.980> but<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:28.030> don't<00:03:28.240> like

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
think they look cool but I don't like

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.330 
think they look cool but I don't like
the<00:03:28.480> concept<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:29.140> poking<00:03:29.500> holes<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:30.160> put

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
the concept of poking holes to put

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.060 
the concept of poking holes to put
pretty<00:03:30.610> things<00:03:30.880> in<00:03:31.180> them<00:03:32.080> that<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.740> just

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
pretty things in them that it just

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.350 
pretty things in them that it just
wouldn't<00:03:33.670> what<00:03:33.820> do<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:33.940> think<00:03:34.090> about<00:03:34.120> like

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
wouldn't what do you think about like

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.940 
wouldn't what do you think about like
that<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:34.720> can't<00:03:34.990> tell<00:03:35.290> me<00:03:35.320> that's<00:03:35.530> not<00:03:35.680> weird

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
that you can't tell me that's not weird

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.100 
that you can't tell me that's not weird
and<00:03:36.280> someone<00:03:36.670> be<00:03:37.300> I've<00:03:37.480> just<00:03:37.660> never<00:03:37.780> done<00:03:37.900> it
