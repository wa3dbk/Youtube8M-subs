using mine he really liked it the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.790 
using mine he really liked it the
battery<00:00:14.849> life<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.269> all<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.410> features<00:00:16.560> you

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
battery life and all the features you

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.950 
battery life and all the features you
came<00:00:16.980> with<00:00:17.420> so<00:00:18.420> I'm<00:00:18.660> going<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.840> put<00:00:18.900> my<00:00:20.779> 1002<00:00:21.779> on

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
came with so I'm going to put my 1002 on

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.859 
came with so I'm going to put my 1002 on
top<00:00:22.550> all<00:00:23.550> right<00:00:23.760> straight<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.420> there<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
top all right straight it there in the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.429 
top all right straight it there in the
back<00:00:26.359> so<00:00:27.800> this<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.830> how<00:00:29.160> much<00:00:29.400> bigger<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.439> 1000

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
back so this is how much bigger the 1000

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.610 
back so this is how much bigger the 1000
a<00:00:31.560> chaise<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.250> at<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> bottom<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.620> it's

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
a chaise it's at the bottom and it's

a chaise it's at the bottom and it's
about<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.130> same<00:00:35.340> size<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.360> edges<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.989> have

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
about the same size on the edges I have

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.350 
about the same size on the edges I have
to<00:00:37.590> bring<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.890> around<00:00:40.340> it's<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.210> bit

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
to bring it around it's just a bit

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.690 
to bring it around it's just a bit
thicker<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> back<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:44.460> here

thicker on the back as you can see here

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.459 
thicker on the back as you can see here
with<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> rj45<00:00:45.899> port<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:48.200> bring<00:00:49.200> around<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
with the rj45 port and bring around the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.439 
with the rj45 port and bring around the
back<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.039> see<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.460> extended<00:00:51.180> battery

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.840 

goes<00:00:54.449> down<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:54.899> at<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> bottom<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:58.850> this

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
goes down here at the bottom and this

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.070 
goes down here at the bottom and this
little<00:01:00.469> this<00:01:01.469> little<00:01:02.149> swivel<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.809> guess

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
little this little swivel here I guess

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.050 
little this little swivel here I guess
you<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.320> call<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.830> much<00:01:05.549> bigger<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
you can call it is much bigger on the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.429 
you can call it is much bigger on the
1000<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> che<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.540> see<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.869> Deep's

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
1000 a che and you can see it Deep's

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.510 
1000 a che and you can see it Deep's
down<00:01:10.680> right<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:12.090> battery<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:13.520> have

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
down right here and the battery I have

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.359 
down right here and the battery I have
to<00:01:14.610> actually<00:01:14.760> prefer<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.520> 1080<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.840> because<00:01:19.369> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to actually prefer the 1080 a because it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
to actually prefer the 1080 a because it
keeps<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.790> cooler<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.659> tilted<00:01:22.170> you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
keeps it cooler because it's tilted you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.340 
keeps it cooler because it's tilted you
see<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> battery<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:24.840> brings<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> down

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
see with the battery it brings it down

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.210 
see with the battery it brings it down
and<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:26.130> gives<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.430> Kohler<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> again<00:01:28.220> much

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and it gives a Kohler and again much

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.270 
and it gives a Kohler and again much
more<00:01:29.369> battery<00:01:29.729> life<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> all<00:01:32.130> comes

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
more battery life so so it all comes

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.069 
more battery life so so it all comes
