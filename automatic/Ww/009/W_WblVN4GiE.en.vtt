00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
hi let's have a look at the rid which

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.269 
hi let's have a look at the rid which
impressed<00:00:25.820> chorus<00:00:26.240> vibrato<00:00:26.570> people<00:00:27.050> it's<00:00:27.920> got

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
impressed chorus vibrato people it's got

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.830 
impressed chorus vibrato people it's got
a<00:00:28.310> number<00:00:28.670> of<00:00:28.699> unique<00:00:29.090> features<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:29.509> it<00:00:29.720> which

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
a number of unique features to it which

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.510 
a number of unique features to it which
you<00:00:29.990> won't<00:00:30.079> find<00:00:30.410> on<00:00:30.529> any<00:00:30.740> other<00:00:31.039> course

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
you won't find on any other course

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.910 
you won't find on any other course
fiddle<00:00:31.930> but<00:00:32.930> first<00:00:33.110> of<00:00:33.260> all<00:00:33.320> let's<00:00:33.680> have<00:00:33.770> a

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
fiddle but first of all let's have a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.319 
fiddle but first of all let's have a
look<00:00:34.070> at<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.220> different<00:00:34.520> controls<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.180> then

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
look at the different controls and then

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.549 
look at the different controls and then
we'll<00:00:35.420> get<00:00:35.540> into<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.870> stuff<00:00:36.199> that<00:00:36.350> it<00:00:36.440> does

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
we'll get into the stuff that it does

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.640 
we'll get into the stuff that it does
that's<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:37.010> really<00:00:37.610> unique<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:38.059> special<00:00:38.650> the

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
that's a really unique and special the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.820 
that's a really unique and special the
first<00:00:39.830> control<00:00:40.160> we<00:00:40.250> have<00:00:40.400> here<00:00:40.640> is<00:00:40.730> mix<00:00:41.830> mixes

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
first control we have here is mix mixes

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.829 
first control we have here is mix mixes
basically<00:00:43.519> in<00:00:44.089> a<00:00:44.120> wet<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:44.390> dry<00:00:44.449> pretty

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
basically in a wet and dry pretty

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.079 
basically in a wet and dry pretty
self-explanatory<00:00:45.170> depth<00:00:45.920> same<00:00:46.339> thing<00:00:46.670> the

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
self-explanatory depth same thing the

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.420 
self-explanatory depth same thing the
the<00:00:47.449> decks<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:47.930> pulse<00:00:48.260> of<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.530> chorus<00:00:48.890> and

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
the decks of the pulse of the chorus and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.569 
the decks of the pulse of the chorus and
with<00:00:50.180> it's<00:00:50.480> a<00:00:50.540> voice<00:00:50.780> voices<00:00:51.559> is<00:00:52.040> a<00:00:52.100> really

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
with it's a voice voices is a really

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.130 
with it's a voice voices is a really
special<00:00:52.790> control<00:00:53.269> I'm<00:00:53.540> gonna<00:00:53.750> come<00:00:53.900> back<00:00:54.020> to

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
special control I'm gonna come back to

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.290 
special control I'm gonna come back to
that<00:00:54.170> in<00:00:54.289> a<00:00:54.320> second<00:00:54.649> velocity<00:00:55.160> allows<00:00:55.969> you<00:00:56.180> to

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
that in a second velocity allows you to

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.479 
that in a second velocity allows you to
control<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.960> speed<00:00:57.590> of<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:58.039> pulse<00:01:00.489> for

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
control the speed of the pulse for

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.940 
control the speed of the pulse for
really<00:01:01.730> fast<00:01:03.879> it's<00:01:04.879> really<00:01:05.000> really<00:01:05.660> slow<00:01:05.960> so

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
really fast it's really really slow so

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.290 
really fast it's really really slow so
slow<00:01:06.979> that<00:01:07.369> will<00:01:07.460> let<00:01:07.580> you<00:01:07.670> take<00:01:07.789> about<00:01:07.940> 45

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
slow that will let you take about 45

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.990 
slow that will let you take about 45
seconds<00:01:08.840> for<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.080> whole<00:01:09.229> pulse<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.850> come<00:01:10.850> and

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
seconds for the whole pulse to come and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.230 
seconds for the whole pulse to come and
go

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.850 

now<00:01:14.240> coming<00:01:14.720> back<00:01:14.900> here<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.260> voice<00:01:15.410> this<00:01:15.740> is

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
now coming back here to voice this is

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.320 
now coming back here to voice this is
the<00:01:15.950> thing<00:01:16.100> which<00:01:16.220> makes<00:01:16.430> this<00:01:16.610> field<00:01:16.910> really

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
the thing which makes this field really

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.210 
the thing which makes this field really
really<00:01:17.600> unique<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.410> big<00:01:18.590> differentiator

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
really unique the big differentiator

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.430 
really unique the big differentiator
between<00:01:19.340> different<00:01:20.030> chorus<00:01:20.300> pedals<00:01:20.660> is<00:01:20.840> the

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
between different chorus pedals is the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.490 
between different chorus pedals is the
delay<00:01:21.920> time<00:01:22.250> of<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:23.120> chorus<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:24.080> the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
delay time of the chorus the the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.110 
delay time of the chorus the the
difference<00:01:24.830> between<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.280> dry<00:01:25.490> signal<00:01:25.550> and

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
difference between the dry signal and

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.240 
difference between the dry signal and
the<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.870> modulated<00:01:27.350> signal<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.770> delay<00:01:28.010> time

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
the the modulated signal the delay time

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.070 
the the modulated signal the delay time
is<00:01:28.370> a<00:01:28.430> thing<00:01:28.610> which<00:01:28.730> makes<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.180> sound<00:01:29.360> really

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
is a thing which makes it sound really

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.110 
is a thing which makes it sound really
sweet<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:30.590> crisp<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.040> tight<00:01:31.220> already<00:01:31.910> sort

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
sweet and crisp and tight already sort

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.030 
sweet and crisp and tight already sort
of<00:01:32.180> watery<00:01:32.660> and<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.260> underwater<00:01:33.710> suit<00:01:33.950> of

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
of watery and and the underwater suit of

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.850 
of watery and and the underwater suit of
a<00:01:34.130> sound<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.050> this<00:01:36.050> is<00:01:36.230> the<00:01:36.350> only<00:01:36.470> people<00:01:36.740> that

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
a sound and this is the only people that

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.560 
a sound and this is the only people that
enables<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.400> with<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.550> control<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:38.150> choose<00:01:38.390> the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
enables you with a control to choose the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.110 
enables you with a control to choose the
delay<00:01:38.840> time<00:01:39.130> when<00:01:40.130> we<00:01:40.250> set<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.610> delay<00:01:40.880> time

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
delay time when we set the delay time

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.740 
delay time when we set the delay time
right<00:01:42.020> back<00:01:42.290> here<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:43.460> get<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.030> ressure<00:01:44.510> delay

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
right back here you get a ressure delay

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:54.710 
right back here you get a ressure delay
time<00:01:44.990> which<00:01:45.110> is<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.229> very<00:01:45.440> sweet<00:01:45.650> crisp<00:01:46.130> sound

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:11.510 

and<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.440> turn<00:01:55.620> around<00:02:10.220> isn't<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.370> sort

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
and as we turn around isn't really sort

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.060 
and as we turn around isn't really sort
of<00:02:11.580> policy<00:02:12.030> sounding<00:02:12.480> chorus<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.440> strangely

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
of policy sounding chorus and strangely

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.520 
of policy sounding chorus and strangely
enough<00:02:14.420> we<00:02:15.420> were<00:02:15.540> really<00:02:15.780> stoked<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.200> find<00:02:16.440> out

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
enough we were really stoked to find out

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.690 
enough we were really stoked to find out
that<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.740> was<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.100> chorus<00:02:17.400> people<00:02:17.610> that

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
that this was the chorus people that

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.310 
that this was the chorus people that
Andy<00:02:17.910> Summers<00:02:18.180> was<00:02:18.240> using<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.930> police

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
Andy Summers was using on the police

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.730 
Andy Summers was using on the police
reunion<00:02:19.770> tour<00:02:20.010> which<00:02:20.190> was<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:21.090> was<00:02:21.150> very<00:02:21.300> cool

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
reunion tour which was it was very cool

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.020 
reunion tour which was it was very cool
so<00:02:22.740> obviously<00:02:23.040> he<00:02:23.520> enjoyed<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.820> voice

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
so obviously he enjoyed the voice

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.200 
so obviously he enjoyed the voice
control<00:02:24.390> too<00:02:25.460> we<00:02:26.460> can<00:02:26.610> turn<00:02:26.790> around<00:02:26.880> further

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
control too we can turn around further

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.070 
control too we can turn around further
and<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:28.230> gets<00:02:28.380> into<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.480> really<00:02:30.480> long<00:02:30.780> delay

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
and it gets into the really long delay

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:40.180 
and it gets into the really long delay
times<00:02:31.380> sort<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.430> realm<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.820> ce-1

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:50.280 

if<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.520> was<00:02:41.700> your<00:02:44.270> desire

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.869 

now<00:02:51.290> these<00:02:51.709> two<00:02:51.920> switches<00:02:52.099> here<00:02:52.430> this<00:02:52.640> first

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
now these two switches here this first

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.610 
now these two switches here this first
one<00:02:53.150> enables<00:02:53.659> you<00:02:53.750> add<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.109> little<00:02:54.319> bit<00:02:54.439> of

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
one enables you add a little bit of

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.289 
one enables you add a little bit of
extra<00:02:54.890> sparkle<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.579> the<00:02:55.670> sound<00:02:55.909> particularly

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
extra sparkle to the sound particularly

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.089 
extra sparkle to the sound particularly
when<00:02:56.420> you're<00:02:56.540> using<00:02:56.689> a<00:02:56.900> shorter<00:02:57.530> delay<00:02:57.859> time

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
when you're using a shorter delay time

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.619 
when you're using a shorter delay time
you<00:02:58.549> might<00:02:58.700> want<00:02:58.849> to<00:02:58.879> have<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.030> little<00:02:59.359> bit<00:02:59.540> more

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
you might want to have a little bit more

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.179 
you might want to have a little bit more
spank<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.079> here<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:00.349> you<00:03:00.620> click<00:03:00.799> that<00:03:00.920> across

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
spank in here so you click that across

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:14.589 
spank in here so you click that across
and<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:11.470> can<00:03:12.470> click<00:03:12.650> there<00:03:12.769> back<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.640> and

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
and you can click there back and and

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.360 
and you can click there back and and
then<00:03:14.810> we've<00:03:14.930> got<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.470> one<00:03:15.680> here<00:03:15.889> now<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:16.189> is

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
then we've got this one here now this is

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.860 
then we've got this one here now this is
the<00:03:16.519> this<00:03:17.060> allows<00:03:17.299> you<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.510> sleep<00:03:17.720> between

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
the this allows you to sleep between

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.920 
the this allows you to sleep between
chorus<00:03:18.349> mode<00:03:18.560> or<00:03:18.769> vibrato<00:03:19.159> mode<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.930> it

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
chorus mode or vibrato mode and it

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.240 
chorus mode or vibrato mode and it
sounds<00:03:21.379> like<00:03:21.409> this<00:03:23.439> now<00:03:24.439> of<00:03:24.590> course<00:03:24.739> the

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
sounds like this now of course the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.580 
sounds like this now of course the
voicing<00:03:25.909> control<00:03:26.269> still<00:03:26.989> functions<00:03:27.439> with

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
voicing control still functions with

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.979 
voicing control still functions with
this<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.370> can<00:03:28.489> have<00:03:28.639> a<00:03:28.669> really<00:03:28.900> sort<00:03:29.900> of

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
this so you can have a really sort of

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.789 
this so you can have a really sort of
subtle<00:03:30.739> sounding<00:03:31.220> vibrato<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.659> see<00:03:33.169> a<00:03:33.470> short

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
subtle sounding vibrato I see a short

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:40.430 
subtle sounding vibrato I see a short
delay<00:03:33.919> time

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.140 

which<00:03:40.890> is<00:03:41.040> actually<00:03:41.160> my<00:03:41.400> favorite<00:03:41.430> sound<00:03:41.970> from

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
which is actually my favorite sound from

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.600 
which is actually my favorite sound from
the<00:03:42.210> pill

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.150 

or<00:03:51.610> slightly<00:03:52.510> longer<00:03:52.780> sin<00:03:53.080> longer<00:03:53.740> delay<00:03:53.950> time

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
or slightly longer sin longer delay time

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.280 
or slightly longer sin longer delay time
which<00:03:54.190> gives<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.730> center

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.759 

really<00:03:58.129> wobbly<00:03:59.170> right<00:04:00.170> through<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.620> most

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
really wobbly right through the most

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.740 
really wobbly right through the most
extreme<00:04:01.280> which<00:04:01.459> is<00:04:01.610> doing<00:04:01.879> almost<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.329> semitone

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
extreme which is doing almost a semitone

extreme which is doing almost a semitone
shift<00:04:03.310> which<00:04:04.510> instantly<00:04:05.510> has<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:05.930> facility

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409

to<00:04:06.530> enable<00:04:06.860> you<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:06.980> play<00:04:07.159> blues<00:04:07.579> licks<00:04:07.849> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
to enable you to play blues licks and

instantly turns them into bebop line
well<00:04:12.470> maybe<00:04:12.709> not<00:04:14.409> so<00:04:15.409> there's<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.489> functions

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
well maybe not so there's the functions

reed Redeemers chorus if you get two

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.390 
reed Redeemers chorus if you get two
amplifiers<00:04:29.789> and<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:30.750> take<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.050> two<00:04:31.400> outputs

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
amplifiers and you take the two outputs

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.400 
amplifiers and you take the two outputs
one<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:32.970> each<00:04:33.060> amplifier<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.780> actual<00:04:34.080> chorus

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
space between the two amplifiers so

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.710
