Ragan<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.760> get<00:00:26.939> all<00:00:27.150> around<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> corners

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
Ragan and you get all around the corners

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200 
Ragan and you get all around the corners
we're<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.789> edge

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
we're just going to do just the edge

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.479 
we're just going to do just the edge
right<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:31.349> gives<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.650> nice<00:00:31.830> tight<00:00:32.160> bond

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
right here it gives a nice tight bond

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
right here it gives a nice tight bond
and<00:00:32.820> then<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:34.079> put<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.680> image<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:36.050> next<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and then you put the image on next you

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.700 
and then you put the image on next you
put<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> image<00:00:37.649> over<00:00:37.969> you<00:00:38.969> take<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.710> backing

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
put the image over you take the backing

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.830 
put the image over you take the backing
off<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.340> little<00:00:41.610> about<00:00:41.790> four<00:00:42.030> inches<00:00:42.329> just

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
off a little about four inches just

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.590 
off a little about four inches just
enough<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> grab<00:00:43.590> then<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.030> flip<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.450> over

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
enough to the grab then you flip it over

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.389 
enough to the grab then you flip it over
and<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:47.850> rearrange<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.710> soon<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:50.100> here

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and you rearrange it so soon right here

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.779 
and you rearrange it so soon right here
if<00:00:50.610> everything<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:52.280> perfectly<00:00:53.280> where<00:00:53.640> you

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
if everything is all perfectly where you

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.310 
if everything is all perfectly where you
need<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.140> backing<00:00:55.379> right<00:00:55.770> here

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
need to be and the backing right here

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.990 
need to be and the backing right here
what<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> normally<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.280> unroll<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.789> like

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
what I normally do is I unroll it like

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.729 
what I normally do is I unroll it like
this<00:01:00.920> pull<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> backing<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:03.470> about<00:01:04.470> halfway

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
this pull the backing up about halfway

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:13.010 
this pull the backing up about halfway
and<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.450> kinda<00:01:08.119> zigzag<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.540> way<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.840> can

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and you kinda zigzag it this way you can

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.780 
and you kinda zigzag it this way you can
see<00:01:13.170> how<00:01:13.290> I'm<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> forty-five<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.700> it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
see how I'm do like a forty-five so it

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.490 
see how I'm do like a forty-five so it
pushes<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.270> air<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.540> way<00:01:15.780> pushes<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> air

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
pushes the air this way pushes the air

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.870 
pushes the air this way pushes the air
this<00:01:16.619> way<00:01:21.770> it's<00:01:22.770> air<00:01:22.979> release<00:01:23.220> final<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.790> if

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
this way it's air release final so if

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.310 
this way it's air release final so if
you<00:01:23.939> guys<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.270> air<00:01:24.479> bubble<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
you guys a little air bubble in is the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.740 
you guys a little air bubble in is the
other<00:01:25.409> deal<00:01:25.700> it'll<00:01:26.700> come<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:26.970> out<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.390> to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
other deal it'll come right out just to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.660 
other deal it'll come right out just to
use<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.170> little<00:01:28.259> finger<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.980 

it's<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:38.520> easy<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.570> next<00:01:39.750> thing

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it's just that easy so what next thing

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.200 
it's just that easy so what next thing
like<00:01:40.170> normally<00:01:40.620> do<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:41.100> I'm<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.820> wrap<00:01:42.180> it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
like normally do is I'm going to wrap it

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.990 
like normally do is I'm going to wrap it
around<00:01:42.450> right<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.490> actually<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:45.030> pulled

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
around right here actually got pulled

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.859 
around right here actually got pulled
right<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.300> but<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:51.240> jaggedy

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
right here but this is so the jaggedy

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
what you do next is you flip it over and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.570 
what you do next is you flip it over and
do<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> 45<00:02:07.399> 3<00:02:08.399> angle<00:02:08.729> cuts<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.330> right<00:02:09.570> here<00:02:10.580> and

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
do a 45 3 angle cuts like right here and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.100 
do a 45 3 angle cuts like right here and
what<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.790> normally<00:02:11.850> do<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> towel

what I normally do is I have a towel

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
what I normally do is I have a towel
underneath<00:02:14.840> can<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:16.080> another<00:02:16.230> 45-degree

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
underneath can you do another 45-degree

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.620 
underneath can you do another 45-degree
cut<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.650> then<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.519> just<00:02:20.670> kind<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.090> lock<00:02:21.390> it

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
cut and then you just kind of lock it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.180 
cut and then you just kind of lock it
it's<00:02:24.630> not<00:02:24.750> going<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.050> stick<00:02:25.260> too<00:02:25.470> much<00:02:25.739> because

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
it's not going to stick too much because

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.270 
it's not going to stick too much because
it's<00:02:26.519> wood<00:02:27.140> but<00:02:28.140> what<00:02:28.380> I'm<00:02:28.470> going<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.680> do<00:02:28.890> is

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
it's wood but what I'm going to do is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.370 
it's wood but what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:29.760> gonna<00:02:29.850> use<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.030> blowtorch<00:02:30.300> or<00:02:30.870> heat<00:02:31.170> gun

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
I'm gonna use a blowtorch or heat gun

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.830 
I'm gonna use a blowtorch or heat gun
and<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:32.580> going<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> melt<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.360> right<00:02:33.600> into

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
and it's going to melt it right into

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.069 
and it's going to melt it right into
place<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:38.070> lap<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.970> over<00:02:39.239> here<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
place and you lap it over here in the

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.920 
place and you lap it over here in the
corner<00:02:40.290> same<00:02:40.709> thing<00:02:41.000> lap<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.180> over<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
corner same thing lap it over here and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.330 
corner same thing lap it over here and
then<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.920> on<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.340> side<00:02:45.829> and<00:02:46.829> make<00:02:47.010> sure<00:02:47.190> it's

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
then you on this side and make sure it's

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.729 
then you on this side and make sure it's
left<00:02:47.549> over<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.090> then<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:49.410> we<00:02:49.709> do<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:51.350> go<00:02:52.350> 1/8

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
left over and then I know we do I go 1/8

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.830 
left over and then I know we do I go 1/8
inch<00:02:52.980> over<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.840> could<00:02:55.140> then<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:57.510> kind<00:02:57.750> of

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
inch over and I could then you kind of

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.340 
inch over and I could then you kind of
kind<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.380> just<00:02:58.530> walk<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.890> over<00:03:02.600> just<00:03:03.600> like<00:03:03.720> that

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
kind of just walk it over just like that

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.600 
kind of just walk it over just like that
you<00:03:06.350> pull<00:03:06.590> up<00:03:06.620> push<00:03:07.400> down<00:03:07.430> pull<00:03:07.940> up<00:03:08.120> push<00:03:08.360> down

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.860 

then<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.730> get<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.090> side<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.690> do<00:03:14.840> a

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
then you get to the side you do a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.390 
then you get to the side you do a
45-degree<00:03:15.770> angle<00:03:17.110> same<00:03:18.110> thing<00:03:18.560> pull<00:03:18.890> up<00:03:19.070> push

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
45-degree angle same thing pull up push

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:27.100 
45-degree angle same thing pull up push
down<00:03:22.390> flip<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.480> over<00:03:25.210> and<00:03:26.210> then<00:03:26.360> flip<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.900> up

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
down flip it over and then flip it up

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.680 
down flip it over and then flip it up
like<00:03:27.350> that<00:03:27.380> so<00:03:28.750> craps<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:32.000> normally<00:03:32.540> do<00:03:32.660> a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
like that so craps and I normally do a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.290 
like that so craps and I normally do a
45<00:03:33.200> or<00:03:34.160> not<00:03:34.340> right<00:03:34.580> go<00:03:34.850> straight<00:03:35.150> down<00:03:35.330> and

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
45 or not right go straight down and

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.940 
45 or not right go straight down and
then<00:03:40.990> so<00:03:41.990> you're<00:03:42.110> not<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.350> have<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.500> nice<00:03:42.680> clean

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
then so you're not you have a nice clean

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.880 
then so you're not you have a nice clean
edge<00:03:43.990> so<00:03:44.990> what<00:03:45.110> I'm<00:03:45.200> doing<00:03:45.260> right<00:03:45.470> now<00:03:45.590> I'm

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
edge so what I'm doing right now I'm

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.650 
edge so what I'm doing right now I'm
just<00:03:46.070> using<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.430> blowtorch<00:03:46.610> on<00:03:47.060> just<00:03:47.300> barely

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
just using a blowtorch on just barely

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.870 
just using a blowtorch on just barely
even<00:03:47.990> touching<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:49.310> can<00:03:49.430> use<00:03:49.550> a<00:03:49.580> heat<00:03:49.820> gun

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
even touching it you can use a heat gun

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.690 
even touching it you can use a heat gun
I<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.450> like<00:03:50.930> using<00:03:51.140> heat<00:03:51.380> gun<00:03:51.590> or<00:03:52.190> you<00:03:52.550> can

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
I I like using heat gun or you can

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.660 
I I like using heat gun or you can
actually<00:03:52.850> use<00:03:53.120> a<00:03:53.150> real<00:03:53.270> hot<00:03:53.870> blow-dryer<00:03:54.670> see

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
actually use a real hot blow-dryer see

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.060 
actually use a real hot blow-dryer see
this<00:03:56.030> one<00:03:56.210> was<00:03:56.690> doing<00:03:57.110> it's<00:03:57.350> just<00:03:57.470> melting<00:03:57.950> it

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
this one was doing it's just melting it

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.920 
this one was doing it's just melting it
right<00:03:58.340> into<00:03:58.640> place

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.530 

so<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.230> sits<00:04:03.560> on<00:04:03.740> there<00:04:03.950> now<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:05.150> let's<00:04:05.300> go<00:04:05.420> over

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
so it sits on there now so let's go over

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.500 
so it sits on there now so let's go over
here<00:04:05.810> real<00:04:05.960> quick<00:04:06.170> so<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:08.060> don't<00:04:08.210> want<00:04:08.330> to<00:04:08.420> do

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
here real quick so you don't want to do

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.470 
here real quick so you don't want to do
the<00:04:08.630> image<00:04:08.780> or<00:04:09.620> you<00:04:09.860> want<00:04:10.070> to<00:04:10.160> wait<00:04:10.330> do<00:04:11.330> this

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
the image or you want to wait do this

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.670 
the image or you want to wait do this
simply<00:04:11.750> first<00:04:12.050> doesn't<00:04:12.709> matter<00:04:12.860> commander<00:04:14.680> so

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
simply first doesn't matter commander so

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.770 
simply first doesn't matter commander so
let's<00:04:15.860> see<00:04:16.340> how<00:04:16.430> its<00:04:16.580> tacking<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.150> right<00:04:17.330> now

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
let's see how its tacking in right now

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.890 
let's see how its tacking in right now
it<00:04:19.320> just<00:04:19.530> kind<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.889> barely<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:21.530> just<00:04:22.530> be<00:04:22.620> careful

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
it just kind of barely I just be careful

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.360 
it just kind of barely I just be careful
so<00:04:24.900> once<00:04:25.110> this<00:04:25.230> when<00:04:25.530> it's<00:04:25.680> on<00:04:25.830> there<00:04:26.070> then<00:04:26.220> you

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
so once this when it's on there then you

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.430 
so once this when it's on there then you
can<00:04:26.520> kind<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.850> really<00:04:27.060> get<00:04:27.240> into<00:04:27.600> it<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:30.440> sink

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
can kind of really get into it and sink

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.720 
can kind of really get into it and sink
it<00:04:31.560> in<00:04:31.650> even<00:04:32.040> more<00:04:32.220> that's<00:04:32.430> what<00:04:32.639> you're

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
it in even more that's what you're

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.280 
it in even more that's what you're
trying<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.000> do<00:04:33.180> is<00:04:33.360> get<00:04:33.540> try<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.780> get<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.139> in

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
trying to do is get try to get it in

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.800 
trying to do is get try to get it in
there<00:04:34.440> as<00:04:34.530> much<00:04:34.710> as<00:04:34.889> you<00:04:34.980> can<00:04:35.419> and<00:04:36.419> just<00:04:36.660> take

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
there as much as you can and just take

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:46.100 
there as much as you can and just take
your<00:04:36.840> time<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:44.460> we're<00:04:44.639> on<00:04:44.880> this<00:04:45.150> material<00:04:45.419> it

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
your time so we're on this material it

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.750 
your time so we're on this material it
is<00:04:46.230> really<00:04:46.530> jaggedy<00:04:47.040> on<00:04:47.160> this<00:04:47.370> side<00:04:47.580> right

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
is really jaggedy on this side right

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.210 
is really jaggedy on this side right
here<00:04:47.820> so<00:04:48.540> what<00:04:48.720> I'm<00:04:48.870> doing<00:04:49.320> I'm<00:04:49.560> overlapping

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
here so what I'm doing I'm overlapping

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.010 
here so what I'm doing I'm overlapping
it<00:04:50.610> at<00:04:51.570> least<00:04:51.980> quarter<00:04:52.980> of<00:04:53.070> an<00:04:53.190> inch<00:04:54.020> because

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
it at least quarter of an inch because

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.560 
it at least quarter of an inch because
this<00:04:55.260> has<00:04:56.040> a<00:04:56.070> smoother<00:04:56.550> sit<00:04:56.790> surface<00:04:57.270> and

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
this has a smoother sit surface and

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.130 
this has a smoother sit surface and
it'll<00:04:58.410> grab<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.980> on<00:04:59.190> more<00:04:59.660> and<00:05:00.660> I<00:05:00.750> want<00:05:01.050> it

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
it'll grab it on more and I want it

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.210 
it'll grab it on more and I want it
lifting<00:05:01.590> up<00:05:01.740> so<00:05:02.070> what<00:05:02.400> I'm<00:05:02.490> doing<00:05:02.520> is<00:05:03.950> I'm<00:05:04.950> just

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
lifting up so what I'm doing is I'm just

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.430 
lifting up so what I'm doing is I'm just
going<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.520> quarter<00:05:05.850> inch<00:05:06.000> over<00:05:06.419> heating<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.320> up

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
going to quarter inch over heating it up

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.820
