00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
of all wasn't so good but second half we

of all wasn't so good but second half we

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
were better but we received three goals

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.730 
were better but we received three goals
in<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> second<00:00:18.000> half<00:00:18.029> that's<00:00:18.330> something<00:00:18.740> kind

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
in the second half that's something kind

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.590 
in the second half that's something kind
of<00:00:19.800> happened<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.369> because<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:23.600> yeah

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
of happened and because of that we yeah

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.029 
of happened and because of that we yeah
absolutely<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.369> will<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.689> blame<00:00:28.039> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
absolutely and I will not blame the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.790 
absolutely and I will not blame the
defenders<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.939> think<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.410> whole<00:00:31.590> team

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
defenders I think it's the whole team

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.280 
defenders I think it's the whole team
who<00:00:32.730> goes<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.000> defense<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:33.780> were<00:00:34.170> all

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
who goes to defense so we were all

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.600 
who goes to defense so we were all
responsible<00:00:35.270> for<00:00:36.270> their<00:00:36.450> four<00:00:36.660> balls<00:00:37.489> as<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
responsible for their four balls as I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.229 
responsible for their four balls as I
say<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.420> strange<00:00:39.719> game<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> think<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:41.239> we

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
say it was a strange game I think we we

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.119 
say it was a strange game I think we we
didn't<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.590> things<00:00:43.800> today

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
didn't do the right things today

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.389 
didn't do the right things today
and<00:00:44.539> that's<00:00:45.539> why<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.960> lost<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.379> we<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.800> now

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and that's why we lost so we have to now

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.020 
and that's why we lost so we have to now
we<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.059> try<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.860> fix<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.160> mistakes<00:00:50.879> we

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
we have to try to fix the mistakes we

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.930 
we have to try to fix the mistakes we
made<00:00:51.210> today<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.590> think<00:00:52.590> about<00:00:52.860> next<00:00:53.610> Sunday

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940

that<00:00:56.370> was<00:00:56.640> open<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:56.969> think<00:00:57.289> we<00:00:58.289> were<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.620> nearly

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that was open I think we were to nearly

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.130 
that was open I think we were to nearly
down<00:00:59.520> switch<00:00:59.760> quarter<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.960> were

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
down switch quarter to one and we were

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.319 
down switch quarter to one and we were
living<00:01:01.680> against<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.489> quickly<00:01:02.969> days<00:01:03.120> for

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
living against but the quickly days for

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.750 
living against but the quickly days for
that<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.570> weren't<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.280> bad<00:01:05.580> but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that we weren't so it was it was bad but

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.789 
that we weren't so it was it was bad but
the<00:01:06.450> worst<00:01:06.659> weather<00:01:06.810> was<00:01:07.229> after<00:01:07.619> when<00:01:07.740> we

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the worst weather was after when we

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.130 
the worst weather was after when we
scored<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> 3-2<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:08.939> right<00:01:09.600> away<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.930> got

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
scored a 3-2 and then right away we got

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.740 
scored a 3-2 and then right away we got
the<00:01:10.320> court<00:01:10.770> -<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.400> was<00:01:11.520> things<00:01:12.270> that's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the court - so that was things that's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.179 
the court - so that was things that's
why<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.900> say<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> strange<00:01:13.740> game<00:01:13.950> because

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
why I say it was a strange game because

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.010 
why I say it was a strange game because
when<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.490> could<00:01:14.670> come<00:01:14.939> back<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.689> receive<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
when we could come back and we receive a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.590 
when we could come back and we receive a
golden<00:01:16.320> may<00:01:17.189> put<00:01:17.520> us<00:01:17.549> down<00:01:17.880> again<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.479> was

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
golden may put us down again so it was

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.130 
golden may put us down again so it was
difficult

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
difficult

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.950 
difficult
yeah<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.090> say<00:01:21.240> when<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.840> were

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
yeah I think that as I say when we were

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.980 
yeah I think that as I say when we were
-<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.590> believe<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.729> could<00:01:23.880> win<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> game

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
- and I believe we could win the game

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.230 
- and I believe we could win the game
again<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.830> were<00:01:25.979> three<00:01:26.189> -<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.790> started<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
again and we were three - we started to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
again and we were three - we started to
believe<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.659> again<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.350> had<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> big<00:01:28.770> chance

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
believe that again we had a big chance

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.569 
believe that again we had a big chance
with<00:01:29.130> Hugo<00:01:30.119> great<00:01:30.509> strike<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> bar<00:01:32.280> so

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
with Hugo great strike on the bar so

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.380 
with Hugo great strike on the bar so
that<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> pity<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> 3/3<00:01:35.579> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
that was a pity because I was a 3/3 so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.080 
that was a pity because I was a 3/3 so
after<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.960> think<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.229> three<00:01:37.439> after<00:01:37.650> that

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
after that I think it's three after that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.280 
after that I think it's three after that
option<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.240> receive<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> fourth<00:01:39.810> tour<00:01:39.960> so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
option will receive the fourth tour so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.590 
option will receive the fourth tour so
it's<00:01:40.520> it's<00:01:41.520> difficult<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> talk<00:01:42.090> about<00:01:42.479> this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
it's it's difficult to talk about this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.590 
it's it's difficult to talk about this
Henry<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.290> absolutely<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.600> feel

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
Henry it's absolutely I think I feel

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
Henry it's absolutely I think I feel

that<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.610> play<00:01:47.850> better<00:01:48.030> because<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:48.899> was

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that I play better because I think was

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.460 
that I play better because I think was
not<00:01:50.159> good<00:01:50.340> performance<00:01:50.790> from<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.329> team<00:01:51.509> so

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
not good performance from the team so

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.190 
not good performance from the team so
it's<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.909> team<00:01:54.119> feeling<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> what<00:01:55.170> I
