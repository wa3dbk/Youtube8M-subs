inch-and-a-half<00:01:13.539> couplers<00:01:15.240> look<00:01:16.240> at<00:01:16.329> them

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
inch-and-a-half couplers look at them

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.510 
inch-and-a-half couplers look at them
together<00:01:16.689> with<00:01:17.499> PVC<00:01:17.829> glue<00:01:17.979> if<00:01:18.219> you<00:01:18.310> do<00:01:18.429> it
