CNE i mean the the coolest thing about

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.479 
CNE i mean the the coolest thing about
the<00:02:28.390> cini<00:02:28.629> like<00:02:28.900> everybody<00:02:29.290> knows<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:30.190> you

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
the cini like everybody knows that you

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.100 
the cini like everybody knows that you
pretty<00:02:30.879> much<00:02:30.970> need<00:02:31.269> them<00:02:31.420> for<00:02:31.599> race<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.959> snow

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
pretty much need them for race and snow

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.470 
pretty much need them for race and snow
cross<00:02:32.379> but<00:02:33.099> at<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.340> same<00:02:33.549> time<00:02:33.790> like<00:02:34.060> when<00:02:34.390> you

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
cross but at the same time like when you

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.960 
cross but at the same time like when you
think<00:02:34.690> about<00:02:34.720> when<00:02:34.989> you're<00:02:35.049> on<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> trail<00:02:35.970> your

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
think about when you're on a trail your

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.180 
think about when you're on a trail your
steering<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.690> is<00:02:37.959> pretty<00:02:38.530> critical<00:02:38.799> because

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
steering is is pretty critical because

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.920 
steering is is pretty critical because
you're<00:02:39.819> ripping<00:02:40.120> down<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.299> trail<00:02:40.569> full<00:02:40.810> of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
you're ripping down a trail full of

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.050 
you're ripping down a trail full of
trees<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.379> stuff<00:02:41.530> things<00:02:41.829> go<00:02:41.980> wrong<00:02:42.250> there

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
trees and stuff things go wrong there

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.879 
trees and stuff things go wrong there
isn't<00:02:43.329> much<00:02:43.480> there<00:02:44.079> isn't<00:02:44.500> much<00:02:44.620> cushion

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
isn't much there isn't much cushion

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.530 
isn't much there isn't much cushion
there's<00:02:45.190> no<00:02:45.310> foam<00:02:45.549> pit<00:02:45.819> off<00:02:45.970> in<00:02:46.120> those<00:02:46.269> trees

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
there's no foam pit off in those trees

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.819 
there's no foam pit off in those trees
you<00:02:46.690> hit<00:02:46.840> one<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.019> those<00:02:47.079> trees<00:02:47.350> is<00:02:47.560> pretty

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
you hit one of those trees is pretty

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.440 
you hit one of those trees is pretty
well<00:02:47.950> going<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.160> stop<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.609> so<00:02:49.000> your<00:02:49.150> steering

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
well going to stop you so your steering

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.150 
well going to stop you so your steering
is<00:02:49.569> pretty<00:02:49.780> critical<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.530> that's<00:02:50.950> what's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
is pretty critical and and that's what's

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.550 
is pretty critical and and that's what's
cool<00:02:51.340> about<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.819> cnas<00:02:52.269> ease<00:02:52.540> even<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.049> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
cool about the cnas ease even the the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.199 
cool about the cnas ease even the the
trail<00:02:53.859> models<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.370> they<00:02:54.459> have<00:02:54.670> you're<00:02:55.120> gonna

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
trail models that they have you're gonna

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.599 
trail models that they have you're gonna
get<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:55.660> much<00:02:55.720> more<00:02:56.049> bite<00:02:56.349> you're<00:02:57.280> gonna<00:02:57.400> be

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
get so much more bite you're gonna be

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.250 
get so much more bite you're gonna be
able<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.849> do<00:02:58.000> those<00:02:58.180> turns<00:02:58.540> you're<00:02:58.780> gonna<00:02:58.870> yeah

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
able to do those turns you're gonna yeah

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.539 
able to do those turns you're gonna yeah
you're<00:02:59.470> just<00:02:59.500> gonna<00:02:59.739> have<00:02:59.829> so<00:03:00.280> much<00:03:00.400> more

you're just gonna have so much more
confidence<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.299> your<00:03:01.599> steering<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.260> other

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
confidence in your steering the other

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.410 
confidence in your steering the other
thing<00:03:02.739> that<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:02.920> really<00:03:03.040> like<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.340> they<00:03:03.670> because

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
thing that I really like is they because

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.240 
thing that I really like is they because
of<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.230> way<00:03:05.349> they<00:03:05.500> feel<00:03:05.709> they've<00:03:05.950> got<00:03:06.099> a<00:03:06.130> lot

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
of the way they feel they've got a lot

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.069 
of the way they feel they've got a lot
of<00:03:06.310> flex<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:06.880> it's<00:03:07.000> almost<00:03:07.209> like<00:03:07.510> added

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
of flex so it's almost like added

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.140 
of flex so it's almost like added
suspension<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:08.829> mean<00:03:08.950> these<00:03:09.069> things<00:03:09.130> are<00:03:09.459> going

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
suspension I mean these things are going

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.640 
suspension I mean these things are going
through<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.419> bumps<00:03:10.750> well<00:03:10.959> they're<00:03:11.169> turning

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
through the bumps well they're turning
