00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
lights that will not be blocked will be

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.760 
lights that will not be blocked will be
circles<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.630> first<00:01:57.869> circle<00:01:58.229> blocks<00:01:58.469> ever

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
circles the first circle blocks ever

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.789

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
right here and as you can see it's

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.380 
right here and as you can see it's
getting<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.110> nice<00:02:10.289> pour<00:02:10.649> there<00:02:10.890> now<00:02:11.879> what<00:02:12.270> you

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
getting a nice pour there now what you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.820 
getting a nice pour there now what you
need<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.020> bit

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
need is a bit

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.210 
need is a bit
very<00:02:13.980> damaged<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.640> though<00:02:15.380> I've<00:02:16.380> tried<00:02:17.010> this

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
very damaged and though I've tried this

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.400 
very damaged and though I've tried this
with<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> normal<00:02:17.880> an<00:02:18.180> bow<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.840> works<00:02:19.050> about

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
with a normal an bow and it works about

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.640 
with a normal an bow and it works about
four<00:02:20.190> out<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.430> five<00:02:20.580> times<00:02:21.230> but<00:02:22.230> when<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.500> do

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
four out of five times but when you do

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.610 
four out of five times but when you do
the<00:02:22.800> damage<00:02:23.070> in<00:02:23.430> an<00:02:23.550> bow<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:24.060> find<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.960> just

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the damage in an bow I find that it just

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.050 
the damage in an bow I find that it just
always<00:02:26.580> works

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
always works

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.780 
always works
it<00:02:27.750> hasn't<00:02:27.960> never<00:02:28.290> worked<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.800> me<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
it hasn't never worked for me so the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.580 
it hasn't never worked for me so the
damage<00:02:30.060> amble<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.780> way<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.960> go<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.410> you

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
damage amble is the way to go and you

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.280 
damage amble is the way to go and you
can't<00:02:31.890> use<00:02:32.130> any<00:02:32.430> other<00:02:32.640> anvil<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.390> has<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.900> be<00:02:34.080> I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
can't use any other anvil it has to be I

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.620 
can't use any other anvil it has to be I
mean<00:02:34.530> not<00:02:34.890> any<00:02:35.100> other<00:02:35.340> block<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.940> has<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.420> be<00:02:36.540> an

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
mean not any other block it has to be an

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.020 
mean not any other block it has to be an
anvil<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.410> like<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.280> said<00:02:38.520> it's<00:02:38.670> better<00:02:38.850> to

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
anvil and like I said it's better to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.880 
anvil and like I said it's better to
have<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.210> very<00:02:39.570> damaged<00:02:40.020> handle<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.740> one

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
this will be able to be done in survival

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.980 
this will be able to be done in survival
this<00:02:59.670> does<00:02:59.910> not<00:03:00.090> have<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.540> done<00:03:00.720> and

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
this does not have to be done and

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.990 
this does not have to be done and
creative<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.650> can<00:03:01.800> be<00:03:01.920> done<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.220> survived<00:03:02.610> and

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
creative it can be done and survived and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.390 
creative it can be done and survived and
that's<00:03:03.959> basically<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.530> plus<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.070> and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
that's basically the plus of this and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.190 
that's basically the plus of this and
moshav<00:03:06.060> even<00:03:06.330> said<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:06.660> gonna<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:06.870> harder<00:03:07.140> to

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
moshav even said it's gonna be harder to

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.050 
moshav even said it's gonna be harder to
find<00:03:07.320> diamonds<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.130> vit<00:03:08.370> they<00:03:08.760> want<00:03:09.000> to

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
find diamonds so vit they want to

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.290 
find diamonds so vit they want to
implement<00:03:09.300> this<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.900> Minecraft<00:03:10.260> 1.7<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:12.120> now

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
implement this in Minecraft 1.7 so now

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.510 
implement this in Minecraft 1.7 so now
what<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.840> guys<00:03:12.990> have<00:03:13.320> been<00:03:13.530> waiting<00:03:13.740> for<00:03:14.250> is

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
what you guys have been waiting for is

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.640 
what you guys have been waiting for is
after<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.090> put<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.390> button<00:03:15.600> down<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.170> just

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
after you put the button down you just

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.699 
after you put the button down you just
tap<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.550> boom<00:03:18.180> there<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.750> go<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.680> have

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
tap it and boom there you go you have

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.970 
tap it and boom there you go you have
now<00:03:19.980> generated<00:03:20.280> three<00:03:21.150> diamonds<00:03:21.870> now<00:03:22.800> this

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
now generated three diamonds now this

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.979 
now generated three diamonds now this
will<00:03:23.130> only<00:03:23.310> work<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.880> three<00:03:24.150> rows<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.690> cannot

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
will only work for three rows you cannot

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.979 
will only work for three rows you cannot
make<00:03:25.230> one<00:03:25.260> row<00:03:25.769> because<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.489> red<00:03:27.030> water<00:03:27.660> is

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
make one row because the red water is

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.580 
make one row because the red water is
not<00:03:28.410> enough<00:03:28.890> fuel<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.150> power<00:03:30.330> source<00:03:30.750> so

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
not enough fuel to the power source so

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.560 
not enough fuel to the power source so
you<00:03:31.650> must<00:03:31.920> have<00:03:32.130> three<00:03:32.580> redstone<00:03:33.000> blocks<00:03:33.269> and

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
you must have three redstone blocks and

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.360 
you must have three redstone blocks and
three<00:03:33.840> water<00:03:34.080> if<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:34.530> have<00:03:34.709> any<00:03:34.860> more<00:03:35.100> it's

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
three water if you have any more it's

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.550 
three water if you have any more it's
