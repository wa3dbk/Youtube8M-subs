00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
we issued earlier on still happy with

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.310 
we issued earlier on still happy with
this<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.469> still<00:00:50.100> looks<00:00:50.280> ok<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.719> snowing

quite<00:00:52.739> hard<00:00:53.100> now<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.430> through<00:00:54.120> most<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.600> Wales

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
quite hard now and through most of Wales

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.600 
quite hard now and through most of Wales
the<00:00:55.230> Midlands<00:00:55.680> down<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.039> southern<00:00:56.309> parts<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
the Midlands down to southern parts of

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.160 
the Midlands down to southern parts of
England<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.079> these

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
England so I think we can go with these

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.700 
England so I think we can go with these
accumulations<00:01:00.050> probably<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.260> little<00:01:01.500> bit

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
accumulations probably a little bit

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.910 
accumulations probably a little bit
lower<00:01:02.329> across<00:01:03.329> more<00:01:03.989> southern<00:01:04.289> part<00:01:04.619> so

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
lower across more southern part so

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.279 
lower across more southern part so
probably<00:01:05.819> within<00:01:06.029> this<00:01:06.270> zone<00:01:06.329> here<00:01:07.049> we're

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
probably within this zone here we're

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.139 
probably within this zone here we're
more<00:01:07.469> down<00:01:07.740> towards<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.279> the<00:01:08.850> sort<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.649 
and parts of Scotland too but back to
today<00:01:44.099> and<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.999> a<00:01:45.029> snow<00:01:45.239> event<00:01:45.359> that's

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
today and with a snow event that's

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.239 
today and with a snow event that's
ongoing<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.319> it<00:01:46.439> becomes<00:01:46.649> lighter<00:01:46.979> this

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:47.249 
ongoing is it becomes lighter this

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:49.069 
ongoing is it becomes lighter this
afternoon<00:01:47.700> which<00:01:47.849> indeed<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> snow<00:01:48.539> will<00:01:48.779> do

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
afternoon which indeed the snow will do

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.019 
afternoon which indeed the snow will do
I<00:01:49.289> think<00:01:50.039> we<00:01:50.099> don't<00:01:50.219> have<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.489> do<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:50.789> them

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:51.029 
I think we don't have to do with them

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:52.639 
I think we don't have to do with them
some<00:01:51.270> very<00:01:51.450> low<00:01:51.599> temperatures<00:01:52.049> overnight<00:01:52.349> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
some very low temperatures overnight the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.080 
some very low temperatures overnight the
winds<00:01:52.889> will<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.099> going<00:01:53.340> into<00:01:53.489> the<00:01:53.669> east<00:01:53.849> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
winds will be going into the east and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.269 
winds will be going into the east and
that<00:01:54.479> means<00:01:54.689> temperatures<00:01:54.989> falling<00:01:55.409> now<00:01:55.709> this

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:56.279 
that means temperatures falling now this

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:58.729 
that means temperatures falling now this
is<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.579> mirror<00:01:56.999> temperature<00:01:57.450> from<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.929> GFS

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739 
is the mirror temperature from the GFS

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.589 
is the mirror temperature from the GFS
and<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> think<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.309> probably<00:01:59.700> gone<00:02:00.359> on<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
and I think it's probably gone on the

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.479 
and I think it's probably gone on the
cautious<00:02:00.809> side<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.259> think<00:02:01.409> generally<00:02:02.009> widely

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
cautious side I think generally widely

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.010 
cautious side I think generally widely
across<00:02:02.609> the<00:02:02.819> country<00:02:03.119> temperatures<00:02:03.840> minus

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
across the country temperatures minus

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.559 
across the country temperatures minus
ones<00:02:04.380> 2-5<00:02:05.039> could<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.489> down<00:02:05.669> as<00:02:05.880> low<00:02:06.209> as<00:02:06.329> minus

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
ones 2-5 could be down as low as minus

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.679 
ones 2-5 could be down as low as minus
sevens<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.409> some<00:02:08.039> places<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.939> when<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.329> think

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:09.689 
sevens in some places so when I think

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.179 
sevens in some places so when I think
certainly<00:02:09.989> get<00:02:10.170> ready<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.619> ice<00:02:10.799> tonight

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:11.189 
certainly get ready for ice tonight

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.830 
certainly get ready for ice tonight
that's<00:02:11.849> going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.269> problem<00:02:12.480> on<00:02:12.719> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
that's going to be a problem on the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.480 
that's going to be a problem on the
roads

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
roads

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.340 
roads
and<00:02:14.790> then<00:02:15.240> tomorrow<00:02:15.420> temperatures<00:02:15.840> really

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and then tomorrow temperatures really

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.380 
and then tomorrow temperatures really
don't<00:02:16.620> rise<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.190> fast<00:02:17.610> Doggett's<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.180> snow

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
don't rise that fast Doggett's of snow

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.880 
don't rise that fast Doggett's of snow
flows<00:02:18.660> around<00:02:18.840> particularly<00:02:19.380> in<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> east

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
flows around particularly in the east

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.680 
flows around particularly in the east
and<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.160> south<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.700> temperatures

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
and the south and temperatures

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.690 
and the south and temperatures
struggling<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.350> get<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.650> freezing<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:23.340> many

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
struggling to get to freezing for many

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.760 
struggling to get to freezing for many
areas<00:02:24.080> right<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.230> way<00:02:25.320> across<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.620> country

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
areas right the way across the country

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.770 
areas right the way across the country
only<00:02:26.400> perhaps<00:02:26.580> down<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.300> far<00:02:27.480> southwest

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
only perhaps down in the far southwest

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.200 
only perhaps down in the far southwest
may<00:02:28.740> we<00:02:28.860> see<00:02:29.010> temperatures<00:02:29.280> rise<00:02:29.610> above

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
may we see temperatures rise above

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.590 
may we see temperatures rise above
freezing<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.820> course<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.180> then<00:02:33.360> leads

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
freezing and of course that then leads

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.300 
freezing and of course that then leads
on<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.900> another<00:02:34.110> cold<00:02:34.410> night<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.890> Saturday

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
on to another cold night on Saturday

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.920 
on to another cold night on Saturday
again<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.580> think<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.790> GFS<00:02:36.240> probably<00:02:36.750> has

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
again I think the GFS probably has

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.750 
again I think the GFS probably has
underplayed<00:02:37.560> these<00:02:37.830> loads<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.370> think<00:02:38.580> more

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
underplayed these loads I think more

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.930 
underplayed these loads I think more
generally<00:02:38.790> minus<00:02:39.510> 2<00:02:39.750> s<00:02:39.810> 2<00:02:39.990> minus<00:02:40.710> 8<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.670> I

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
generally minus 2 s 2 minus 8 and I

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.030 
generally minus 2 s 2 minus 8 and I
think<00:02:42.180> some<00:02:42.360> minus<00:02:42.630> tens<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.050> places<00:02:43.410> too<00:02:43.560> but

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
think some minus tens in places too but

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.590 
think some minus tens in places too but
you<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.190> see<00:02:44.370> how<00:02:44.400> widespread<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.210> hard<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
you can see how widespread and hard the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.090 
you can see how widespread and hard the
frosty<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.350> ice<00:02:46.710> will<00:02:47.160> just<00:02:47.400> continue<00:02:49.100> and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
frosty so the ice will just continue and

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.340 
frosty so the ice will just continue and
with<00:02:50.250> temperatures<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:50.910> Sunday<00:02:51.540> again<00:02:52.020> around

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
with temperatures on Sunday again around

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.750 
with temperatures on Sunday again around
freezing<00:02:52.650> really<00:02:53.100> we're<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.250> not<00:02:53.490> going<00:02:53.640> to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
freezing really we're just not going to

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.700 
freezing really we're just not going to
see<00:02:53.880> much<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.330> Thor<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.170> ice<00:02:55.290> continues

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
see much of a Thor so the ice continues

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.160 
see much of a Thor so the ice continues
still<00:02:56.250> further<00:02:56.520> problems<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.060> come<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.420> then

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
still further problems to come and then

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.980 
still further problems to come and then
we<00:02:58.590> get<00:02:58.740> into<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.130> next<00:02:59.370> problem<00:02:59.580> that's<00:03:00.120> down

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
we get into the next problem that's down

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.900 
we get into the next problem that's down
the<00:03:01.140> road<00:03:01.260> here<00:03:01.530> which<00:03:01.800> is<00:03:01.980> snow<00:03:02.370> coming<00:03:02.670> back

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
the road here which is snow coming back

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.760 
the road here which is snow coming back
into<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.360> East<00:03:03.660> during<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.380> course<00:03:04.590> of

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.420 
into the East during the course of
sunday<00:03:06.440> it's<00:03:07.440> all<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.800> do<00:03:07.920> with<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.100> area<00:03:08.370> of

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
sunday it's all to do with the area of

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.860 
sunday it's all to do with the area of
low<00:03:08.580> pressure<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:09.120> can<00:03:09.240> see<00:03:09.510> here<00:03:09.840> down

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
low pressure you can see here down

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.820 
low pressure you can see here down
towards<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.740> southeast<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.820> country<00:03:12.150> I

towards the southeast of the country I

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.260 
towards the southeast of the country I
just<00:03:13.830> changed<00:03:13.980> my<00:03:14.160> color<00:03:14.430> they're<00:03:14.790> down

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
just changed my color they're down

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.340 
just changed my color they're down
towards<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.630> southeast<00:03:15.960> of<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.200> country

towards the southeast of the country

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.200 
towards the southeast of the country
this<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.100> an<00:03:17.190> area<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.430> low<00:03:17.520> pressure<00:03:17.640> which

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
this is an area of low pressure which

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.430 
this is an area of low pressure which
going<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.480> be<00:03:18.540> moving<00:03:18.690> its<00:03:18.960> way<00:03:19.020> northward

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
going to be moving its way northward

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.210 
going to be moving its way northward
during<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.310> course<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.790> sunday<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.890> that

during the course of sunday so that

Northeast<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:10.440> we're<00:04:10.560> talking<00:04:10.680> Yorkshire

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
Northeast so we're talking Yorkshire

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.430 
Northeast so we're talking Yorkshire
we're<00:04:11.730> talking<00:04:12.090> Lincoln<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:12.870> also

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
we're talking Lincoln and also

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.560 
we're talking Lincoln and also
Norfolk<00:04:14.010> as<00:04:14.190> well<00:04:14.550> I<00:04:17.000> have<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.120> say<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.450> on

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
Norfolk as well I have to say that on

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.390 
Norfolk as well I have to say that on
this<00:04:18.780> one<00:04:19.020> confidence<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.739> little<00:04:20.250> bit

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
this one confidence is a little bit

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.250 
this one confidence is a little bit
lower<00:04:20.609> we're<00:04:20.910> tracking<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.540> all<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.900> time<00:04:21.930> so

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
lower we're tracking it all the time so

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.990 
lower we're tracking it all the time so
obviously<00:04:22.530> we'll<00:04:22.979> keep<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.340> updated<00:04:23.460> but

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
obviously we'll keep you updated but

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.580 
obviously we'll keep you updated but
certainly<00:04:24.390> looks<00:04:24.600> like<00:04:24.780> another<00:04:25.050> snow<00:04:25.320> event

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
certainly looks like another snow event

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.250 
certainly looks like another snow event
is<00:04:25.950> going<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.370> be<00:04:26.460> on<00:04:26.580> its<00:04:26.729> way

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
is going to be on its way

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260 
is going to be on its way
and<00:04:28.380> then<00:04:29.160> how<00:04:29.280> long<00:04:29.340> does<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.640> last<00:04:29.730> well<00:04:30.120> this

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
and then how long does it last well this

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.860 
and then how long does it last well this
is<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:31.280> gfs<00:04:32.280> ensemble<00:04:32.870> temperature

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
is the gfs ensemble temperature

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.170 
is the gfs ensemble temperature
prediction<00:04:34.320> taking<00:04:34.680> us<00:04:34.770> through<00:04:34.800> until<00:04:35.730> the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
prediction taking us through until the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.090 
prediction taking us through until the
third<00:04:36.420> of<00:04:36.570> februari<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.200> can<00:04:37.350> see<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.830> keeps

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
third of februari you can see it keeps

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.980 
third of februari you can see it keeps
us<00:04:38.250> cold<00:04:38.640> right<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.270> way<00:04:39.390> through<00:04:39.420> next<00:04:39.780> week

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
us cold right the way through next week

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.300 
us cold right the way through next week
with<00:04:40.140> these<00:04:40.260> temperatures<00:04:40.650> really<00:04:40.890> not<00:04:41.130> doing

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
with these temperatures really not doing

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.700 
with these temperatures really not doing
anything<00:04:41.610> but<00:04:42.030> then<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.270> warms<00:04:42.450> up<00:04:42.720> late<00:04:43.530> next

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
anything but then it warms up late next

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.760 
anything but then it warms up late next
weekend<00:04:44.220> into<00:04:44.700> Friday<00:04:45.060> this<00:04:45.690> is<00:04:45.930> for<00:04:46.320> the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
weekend into Friday this is for the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.100 
weekend into Friday this is for the
London<00:04:47.370> area<00:04:47.490> but<00:04:48.330> we<00:04:48.510> are<00:04:48.660> going<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:48.960> seem

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
London area but we are going to seem

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.900 
London area but we are going to seem
quite<00:04:49.320> a<00:04:49.350> north-south<00:04:50.070> split<00:04:50.490> across<00:04:50.700> the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
quite a north-south split across the

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
quite a north-south split across the
country<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:52.160> if<00:04:53.160> we<00:04:53.280> look<00:04:53.430> at<00:04:53.750> Glasgow<00:04:54.750> the

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
country and if we look at Glasgow the

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.540 
country and if we look at Glasgow the
same<00:04:55.230> temperature<00:04:55.620> profile<00:04:55.980> for<00:04:56.130> Glasgow<00:04:56.490> you

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
same temperature profile for Glasgow you

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.460 
same temperature profile for Glasgow you
can<00:04:56.700> see<00:04:56.880> it<00:04:57.270> stays<00:04:57.600> cold<00:04:57.870> through<00:04:58.110> next<00:04:58.260> week

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
can see it stays cold through next week

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.920 
can see it stays cold through next week
and<00:04:58.650> temperatures<00:04:59.130> barely<00:04:59.670> lift<00:05:00.210> into<00:05:00.660> the

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
and temperatures barely lift into the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.270 
and temperatures barely lift into the
week<00:05:01.080> after<00:05:01.320> so<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.650> think<00:05:01.770> what<00:05:02.010> we're<00:05:02.130> going

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
week after so I think what we're going

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.580 
week after so I think what we're going
to<00:05:02.370> be<00:05:02.430> seeing<00:05:02.670> is<00:05:03.030> this<00:05:03.480> increase<00:05:04.440> of

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
to be seeing is this increase of

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.440 
to be seeing is this increase of
temperatures<00:05:04.980> of<00:05:05.130> Mar<00:05:05.460> they're<00:05:05.700> trying<00:05:06.270> to

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
temperatures of Mar they're trying to

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.090 
temperatures of Mar they're trying to
break<00:05:06.690> back<00:05:06.960> into<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.350> south<00:05:07.530> next<00:05:07.740> weekend

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
break back into the south next weekend

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.130 
break back into the south next weekend
but<00:05:08.280> never<00:05:08.490> really<00:05:08.700> making<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.210> staying<00:05:09.870> cold

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
but never really making it staying cold

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.780 
but never really making it staying cold
in<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.380> North<00:05:10.590> there<00:05:10.980> will<00:05:11.220> be<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.400> band<00:05:11.670> of

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
in the North there will be a band of

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.700 
in the North there will be a band of
snow<00:05:11.970> again<00:05:12.600> I<00:05:12.660> think<00:05:12.840> next<00:05:13.170> weekend<00:05:13.590> we've

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
snow again I think next weekend we've

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.350 
snow again I think next weekend we've
got<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:13.950> watch<00:05:14.100> on<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.640> boundary<00:05:15.030> between<00:05:15.060> the

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
got to watch on the boundary between the

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.880 
got to watch on the boundary between the
cold<00:05:15.630> air<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.080> north<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.470> milder<00:05:16.770> air

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
cold air to the north and the milder air

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.160 
cold air to the north and the milder air
to<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.100> south<00:05:17.240> probably<00:05:18.240> I<00:05:18.360> would<00:05:18.480> guess

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
to the south probably I would guess

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.110 
to the south probably I would guess
through<00:05:19.800> central<00:05:20.160> island<00:05:20.520> through<00:05:20.790> Wales

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
through central island through Wales

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.730 
through central island through Wales
through<00:05:21.750> northern<00:05:22.140> England<00:05:22.440> perhaps

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
through northern England perhaps

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.470 
through northern England perhaps
southern<00:05:23.070> Scotland<00:05:23.520> as<00:05:23.640> well<00:05:23.820> and<00:05:24.030> then<00:05:24.450> I

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
southern Scotland as well and then I

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.880 
southern Scotland as well and then I
think<00:05:24.750> what<00:05:24.840> happens<00:05:25.140> after<00:05:25.380> that<00:05:25.530> is<00:05:25.590> the

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
think what happens after that is the

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.280 
think what happens after that is the
cold<00:05:26.160> air<00:05:26.340> pushes<00:05:26.700> back<00:05:26.880> side<00:05:27.300> into<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.140> early

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
cold air pushes back side into the early

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.070 
cold air pushes back side into the early
part<00:05:28.500> of<00:05:28.590> februari<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.970> again<00:05:30.360> I'm<00:05:30.660> still

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
part of februari and again I'm still

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.870 
part of februari and again I'm still
going<00:05:31.200> to<00:05:31.260> go<00:05:31.380> for<00:05:31.620> this<00:05:31.710> idea<00:05:32.160> of<00:05:32.310> it'll<00:05:32.760> be

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
going to go for this idea of it'll be

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.360 
going to go for this idea of it'll be
between<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.300> 10th<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:33.780> the<00:05:33.960> 15th<00:05:34.350> fed<00:05:34.830> before

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
between the 10th and the 15th fed before

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.870 
between the 10th and the 15th fed before
we<00:05:36.330> see<00:05:36.540> mild<00:05:36.810> air<00:05:37.020> proper<00:05:37.530> getting<00:05:38.070> now<00:05:38.310> don't

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
we see mild air proper getting now don't

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.640 
we see mild air proper getting now don't
hold<00:05:39.120> me<00:05:39.270> to<00:05:39.300> that<00:05:39.450> too<00:05:39.810> much<00:05:39.960> but<00:05:40.380> that's

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
hold me to that too much but that's

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.290 
hold me to that too much but that's
where<00:05:40.950> I'm<00:05:41.070> thinking<00:05:41.370> about<00:05:41.430> things<00:05:41.820> just<00:05:42.180> at

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
where I'm thinking about things just at

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.270 
where I'm thinking about things just at
the<00:05:42.360> moment<00:05:42.510> so<00:05:43.410> plenty<00:05:43.770> to<00:05:43.860> be<00:05:43.950> going<00:05:44.190> on

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
the moment so plenty to be going on

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.550 
the moment so plenty to be going on
there<00:05:44.610> with<00:05:45.150> I<00:05:45.330> think<00:05:45.660> you'll<00:05:45.840> agree<00:05:46.020> it

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
there with I think you'll agree it

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.900 
there with I think you'll agree it
certainly<00:05:47.070> looks<00:05:47.280> as<00:05:47.370> if<00:05:47.430> it's<00:05:47.580> going<00:05:47.640> to<00:05:47.790> be

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
certainly looks as if it's going to be

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.640 
certainly looks as if it's going to be
an<00:05:48.030> interesting<00:05:48.390> week<00:05:48.630> also<00:05:48.990> worth<00:05:49.500> of
