as few bubbles in there as possible to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.149 
as few bubbles in there as possible to
start<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.470> there's<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.710> bubbles

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
start with there's going to be bubbles

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.530 
start with there's going to be bubbles
no<00:01:26.250> matter<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.939> that's<00:01:27.030> why<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.270> have

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
no matter what and that's why we have

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.060 
no matter what and that's why we have
the<00:01:27.689> bubble

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
the bubble

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.149 
the bubble
removal<00:01:28.550> tool<00:01:29.140> but<00:01:30.140> this<00:01:30.320> way<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.560> have<00:01:30.740> less

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
removal tool but this way you have less

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.510 
removal tool but this way you have less
that<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:31.520> have<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.820> move<00:01:32.090> once<00:01:32.960> here<00:01:33.370> you<00:01:34.370> got

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
that you have to move once here you got

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.020 
that you have to move once here you got
to<00:01:34.610> lay<00:01:34.729> down<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:37.250> basically<00:01:37.850> this<00:01:37.970> is

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
to lay down so basically this is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.030 
to lay down so basically this is
probably<00:01:38.750> going<00:01:38.900> to<00:01:38.960> be<00:01:39.050> about<00:01:39.140> what<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:39.830> see

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
probably going to be about what you see

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.770 
probably going to be about what you see
once<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.340> have<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.550> lay<00:01:40.820> down<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.600> then

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
once you have that lay down you then

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.899 
once you have that lay down you then
want<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:42.020> take<00:01:42.170> your<00:01:42.290> tool<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:43.400> just<00:01:43.430> working

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
from the center just push these bubbles

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.359 
from the center just push these bubbles
out<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.470> kind<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:48.770> have<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:48.920> do<00:01:49.130> one

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
out and you kind of have to do one

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.940 
out and you kind of have to do one
bubble<00:01:49.670> at<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.820> time<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.619> it<00:01:51.619> can<00:01:51.740> take<00:01:51.890> a

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
bubble at a time and it can take a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.280

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
this that will be peeling off once we're

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.190 
this that will be peeling off once we're
done<00:02:17.730> getting<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> bubbles<00:02:18.510> out<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:22.050> don't

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
be afraid to put a little pressure on it

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.910 
be afraid to put a little pressure on it
because<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.480> need<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.660> apply<00:02:25.050> some<00:02:25.290> force<00:02:25.320> for

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
because you need to apply some force for

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:48.330 
because you need to apply some force for
the<00:02:26.010> store

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.800 

you<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.910> see<00:02:49.120> we've<00:02:49.239> got<00:02:49.390> them<00:02:49.510> pretty<00:02:49.750> much

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
you can see we've got them pretty much

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.430 
you can see we've got them pretty much
half<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.860> whole<00:02:51.040> half<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.580> bubble<00:02:51.940> free

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
half that this whole half is bubble free

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.420 
half that this whole half is bubble free
it's<00:02:53.440> like<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.650> said<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:53.920> does<00:02:54.069> take<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.280> little

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
it's like I said it does take a little

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.280 
it's like I said it does take a little
time<00:02:54.730> but<00:02:55.200> they<00:02:56.200> will<00:02:56.379> come<00:02:56.590> out<00:02:58.140> one<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.230> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
time but they will come out one of the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.770 
time but they will come out one of the
major<00:02:59.560> problems<00:02:59.800> that<00:03:00.519> does<00:03:00.790> tend<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.510> crop<00:03:01.750> up

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
major problems that does tend to crop up

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.080 
major problems that does tend to crop up
if<00:03:02.110> it's<00:03:02.290> looking<00:03:03.010> really<00:03:03.190> bad<00:03:03.459> at<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:03.790> point

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
if it's looking really bad at this point

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.670 
if it's looking really bad at this point

no matter what you do is probably dust
on<00:03:39.129> the<00:03:39.280> screen<00:03:39.549> underneath<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.209> bubble<00:03:40.510> and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
on the screen underneath the bubble and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.300 
on the screen underneath the bubble and
there's<00:03:40.900> not<00:03:41.079> too<00:03:41.349> much<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.680> can<00:03:41.860> do<00:03:42.040> about<00:03:42.160> it

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
there's not too much you can do about it

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.030 
there's not too much you can do about it
and<00:03:42.700> if<00:03:43.480> it's<00:03:43.690> if<00:03:44.049> it's<00:03:44.170> just<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.500> tiny<00:03:44.650> go<00:03:44.890> home

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
and if it's if it's just a tiny go home

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.930 
and if it's if it's just a tiny go home
it<00:03:45.129> might<00:03:45.220> be<00:03:45.370> something<00:03:45.549> you<00:03:45.670> can<00:03:45.730> live<00:03:45.910> with

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
it might be something you can live with

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.180 
it might be something you can live with
but<00:03:46.090> if<00:03:46.360> not<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.720> might<00:03:46.870> want<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.140> try<00:03:47.769> again

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
but if not you might want to try again

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.280 
but if not you might want to try again
use<00:03:48.579> another<00:03:48.879> screen<00:03:49.150> protector<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:50.170> think

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
use another screen protector but I think

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
use another screen protector but I think
I<00:03:50.319> see<00:03:50.440> right<00:03:50.590> now<00:03:50.650> we've<00:03:50.890> got<00:03:50.950> pretty<00:03:51.190> much

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
I see right now we've got pretty much

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.729 
I see right now we've got pretty much
all<00:03:51.489> my<00:03:51.610> bubbles<00:03:51.970> out<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.420> since<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.410> have<00:03:53.440> that

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
all my bubbles out and since I have that

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.009 
all my bubbles out and since I have that
I<00:03:53.769> can<00:03:53.980> go<00:03:54.069> ahead<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.250> take<00:03:54.519> off<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:55.690> second

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
I can go ahead and take off the second

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.160 
I can go ahead and take off the second
screen<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:57.450> as<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.540> can<00:03:58.660> see<00:03:58.690> we've<00:03:58.989> got<00:03:59.019> a

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
screen and as you can see we've got a

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.930 
screen and as you can see we've got a
screen<00:03:59.410> protector<00:03:59.560> installed<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.760> looks

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
screen protector installed and it looks

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.989 
screen protector installed and it looks
pretty<00:04:01.269> much<00:04:01.510> perfect
