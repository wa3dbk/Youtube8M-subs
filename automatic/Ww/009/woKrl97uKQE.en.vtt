00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.740
 place stands 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.970
 because one is for wolfgang lippert 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.280
 not negotiable 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.430
 the respect of the customer, how he sees 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.350
 the international catwalk trends in 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:40.089
 the ropes advance catwalks of this world 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:44.960
 years ago had lines taken back 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:47.600
 Heavily emphasized and cool fan 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.220
 you have to hook the luster and the hook 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.800
 view health 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.710
 jana germany's next top model -gewinnerin 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.660
 2011 wants to be here in the l2 where the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.070
 Celebrities give the jack a hand 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.070
 Make trend hairstyle 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.880
 Today we have the look of Mary 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.560
 katrantzou from london decided the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.540
 we know so far that he is implementing 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.180
 just a bit of course not 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.440
 quite so for the catwalk and that one 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.360
 So it really on the red 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.950
 carpet or even in the bar or ins 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.560
 café will be through a lot 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.590
 strained because it is smoothed felt 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.570
 and yes it is very difficult for me 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.670
 the hair that the shiny to get 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.160
 well what I now intend today with her 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.900
 is an illumina color of bella's 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.880
 really beautiful because it is the 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.560
 mr superschön gloss gives puck 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.270
 a the hair of its structure 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 really so far becomes more supple and 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.740
 you will also feel nice with later 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.550
 Now illumina color is rich in dominatrix 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.110
 is a revolutionary new thing so 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.670
 gives that have incredibly beautiful 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.370
 gloss and gives an awesome 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.229
 luminosity has to and what we 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.810
 we feel that david essential 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.810
 handy and beautiful to be found 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.120
 it gets very very soft and 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.600
 one sees therefore also shines correctly 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.610
 looks really healthy too down and up 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.640
 is not so artificial but already 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.560
 Really natural so I am going to this now 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.960
 sleek look we'll be shaping 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.940
 Keep everything relatively in mind 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.390
 we will not go out of country now 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.610
 no big volume 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.950
 and it is already relatively simple 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.980
 simple but still a bit 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.450
 the aha effect 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.010
 after the back braided party 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.540
 has been put up and the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.640
 Side parts close to the head to the rear 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.260
 were set, the upper head 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.770
 copied and also braided high 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.770
 plugged 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.060
 So what we have designed now 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.090
 that is important is simply that 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.100
 Club sides will hold this time 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.080
 nice tight best with gel that 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.990
 whole fix it with really so 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.220
 nice crunchy tight and what is me like that 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.140
 have broken up a bit is the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.000
 whole cooking party that now 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.590
 has so far relaxed is not quite so 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.810
 not quite as cool and through 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.090
 this twirled on the back of the head will be 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.520
 whole a bit playful and optimal 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.530
 I do not care if it's noon for lunch 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.690
 the evening always looks good 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.880
 So I'm very excited it still has 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.140
 got so fast and so neat 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.070
 unfortunately you can not do that at home 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.050
 imitate quickly 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.590
 and yes it is a real work of art 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.590
 become
