00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:23.550
 gala one to whom waves were given by zález 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.100
 the razor blocks of syrup I have 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.710
 26 years the 100 the coruña but I take 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.570
 nine years in london living without 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 family is engaged in fashion 7 30 years 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.100
 then it has always been a very 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.079
 present in my life we played at home 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.760
 with the fabrics nothing made dresses 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.679
 scrape my wrists all there is 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.320
 unconsciously absorbed if it has 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.550
 all that knowledge there 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.320
 I always had the blog but I was with the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.109
 university and is collaborating with her 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.650
 for many things at once and from 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:55.580
 2010 I take it more seriously 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.460
 We are going to be bloggers like at the beginning 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.010
 I really had very few references if 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.990
 there were some who helped us how 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.780
 taking the pictures would not be the jump and 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.330
 aleix for example what would be the code 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.710
 fader el xerez the street style which 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.230
 he taught us a little how we should 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.420
 focus how we should take the pictures is 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.460
 fantastic that thanks to blogs the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.010
 social networks fashion has been able 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.510
 democratize that is now accessible to 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.820
 almost everyone anywhere 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.250
 from the world we can all see what is 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.020
 puts someone the japan what he gets 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.020
 another person in Peru that's fantastic 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.450
 we have them without secret dreams all 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.040
 sunism like that and prove that today that gives 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.480
 same where means that we can all be 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.940
 super the most modern with slings 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.550
 the fashion for me is the letter of 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.550
 presentation to the world allows you to play 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.299
 to be different then to me it seems to me that 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.820
 It's fantastic to be able to express everything 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.530
 that 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.290
 what really inspires me to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.390
 make them the looks are from the movie 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.390
 I've seen the day before from the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.550
 new musical group all everything influenced what 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.649
 that is around me and has a great 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.709
 influence of the end of the 60 process 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.510
 of the 70 that is direct favorite me 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.740
 I play a lot because of my mood 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.180
 I let it influence a lot because of what it is 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.560
 around me the fact of having videos 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.930
 where those who manrique will be much 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.510
 culturally initially of my style 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.610
 it's eclectic because I do not even know what 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.470
 that will be able to me tomorrow bohemian is 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.209
 Relaxed media because I like to be 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.239
 comfortable with clothes I do not like that the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.040
 clothes I forced myself to is in a posture not 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.840
 be comfortable and I think that is transmitted 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.190
 a lot through my blog SENATORS us 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.290
 present these trends but 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.120
 really many people that we do not know 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.890
 how to adapt them to our style 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.769
 then he tried through the blog a 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.280
 little and propose my personal idea of 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.020
 how would I put it 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.970
 I used a woman like I hope that 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.350
 have the same hobbies that I have 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.640
 when I go to buy a store that 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.130
 really customers now what 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.319
 we need we want to be able to use it 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.390
 we all want to mix everything in 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.190
 internet - other lives 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.260
 the staff itself perhaps in a 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.450
 catwalk every thing that is conceived of 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.310
 a super meticulous way and thought of 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.470
 a street style is something much cooler 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.280
 which requires no effort but rather 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.319
 is the person as the attitude 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.870
 for next season I like a lot 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:25.500
 the idea of ​​being able to mix patterns and 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.050
 prince very varied both tribal and 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.300
 the floral but for example that is not 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.950
 mix the two for that you have to 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.900
 remember it's worth mixing the 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.540
 sprints but not from the two families 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.890
 different I like to have like 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.220
 much for example mind can mix 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.520
 a skirt had more 40 years with a 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.550
 rocker cotton shirt for me 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.030
 the lilac blue ones would be key 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.230
 all the cakes that are green roses 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.570
 the green for example I think a color 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.110
 ideal this season also in color 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.610
 lemon lemon and yellow so that 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.620
 dares to try yellow 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.050
 the mustard is like a yellow more 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.019
 light I really like to create 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.360
 a longer closed neck dress 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.090
 of the feet and add a blouse but 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.489
 big and rolled up because it breaks 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.180
 completely the scheme to have 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:23.250
 floral maybe I would put necklaces 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.650
 and perhaps colorful but unique necklaces 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.120
 a color example now that I wear the sun 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.210
 then with a collar but the necklace is 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.310
 Black makes it more chic but does not lend it 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.100
 importance for the Olympic trend 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.030
 It varies a lot with the caps for super 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.470
 interesting the time to run with 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.180
 steal from the boyfriend perhaps with his hair 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.180
 so more casual not so much 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.470
 a tribal decade I love because the 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.350
 hair maybe me that's where I would make a 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.580
 bunch of braids and I would play a little 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.600
 complete it in that way but what 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.510
 they would put many braided bracelets or 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.920
 wood or meat or whatever that that 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.600
 adapt a bit with the texture 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.600
 organic from all the 1st 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.280
 how many really 24 hours a day then 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.990
 you think in the morning you look at the mobile 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.909
 emails 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.260
 what happened and what has happened in the world 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:23.530
 you are never disconnected 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.530
 i 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.999
 or 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.310
 do not 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.580
 do not
