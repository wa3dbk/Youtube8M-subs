with<00:02:45.210> my<00:02:45.360> values<00:02:45.720> as<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.070> clinician<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.850> food

with my values as a clinician the food
is<00:02:48.210> life<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.950> food<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.330> an<00:02:51.330> integral<00:02:51.840> part
