to<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.269> barcode<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.050> as<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.260> see<00:02:19.470> has<00:02:19.650> five

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
stripes down it which I'm assuming is

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.750 
stripes down it which I'm assuming is

I'm really glad that husband decided to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.059 
I'm really glad that husband decided to
include<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:42.080> in<00:02:43.080> terms<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.410> weaponry<00:02:43.769> like

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
include that in terms of weaponry like

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.559 
include that in terms of weaponry like
where<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.549> curve<00:02:44.730> he<00:02:44.910> does<00:02:45.060> indeed<00:02:45.209> come

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
where that curve he does indeed come

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.620 
where that curve he does indeed come
with<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.930> DC<00:02:46.319> 15s<00:02:46.799> carbine<00:02:47.220> pistol<00:02:47.730> although

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
with the DC 15s carbine pistol although

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.140 
with the DC 15s carbine pistol although
once<00:02:49.349> again<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.650> think<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.790> figure<00:02:51.030> will

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
once again I think and this figure will

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.819 
once again I think and this figure will
be<00:02:51.269> released<00:02:51.569> with<00:02:51.720> two<00:02:51.989> of<00:02:52.140> those<00:02:52.319> when<00:02:52.739> he

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
be released with two of those when he

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.460 
be released with two of those when he
sees<00:02:53.040> release<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.610> battle<00:02:53.849> pack<00:02:54.470> another

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
sees release in the battle pack another

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.650 
sees release in the battle pack another

review<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.170> code<00:03:07.500> but<00:03:07.799> some<00:03:08.069> gory

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
review of that code but some gory

I<00:03:16.500> definitely<00:03:17.129> recommend<00:03:17.549> picking<00:03:17.639> these<00:03:17.970> two

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
I definitely recommend picking these two

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.390 
I definitely recommend picking these two
figures<00:03:18.540> up<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.900> they<00:03:19.709> make<00:03:19.889> great<00:03:20.010> addition

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
figures up and they make great addition

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.430 
figures up and they make great addition
to<00:03:20.430> any<00:03:20.790> collection<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.810> they<00:03:21.989> are<00:03:22.109> really

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
to any collection and they are really

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.020 
to any collection and they are really
cool<00:03:22.620> variants<00:03:23.100> on<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.459> echo<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.760> fires

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
cool variants on the echo and fires

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.780 
cool variants on the echo and fires
characters<00:03:24.799> so<00:03:25.799> there<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.069> go<00:03:26.250> that's<00:03:26.609> them

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
characters so there you go that's them

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.930 
characters so there you go that's them
two<00:03:26.970> side<00:03:27.209> by<00:03:27.359> side<00:03:27.389> I<00:03:28.250> hope<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.430> enjoyed<00:03:29.700> how
