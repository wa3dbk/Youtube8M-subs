00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the note sound with our left hand these

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.490 
the note sound with our left hand these
two<00:00:23.970> parts<00:00:24.359> down<00:00:24.539> get<00:00:24.720> our<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.869> show<00:00:25.080> also<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.470> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
two parts down get our a show also is a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.230 
two parts down get our a show also is a
little<00:00:25.740> little<00:00:26.070> tricky<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.430> little<00:00:26.910> hard<00:00:27.090> at

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
little little tricky a little hard at

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.349 
little little tricky a little hard at
first<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.050> uses<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.460> legato<00:00:30.060> technique

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
first but it uses a legato technique

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.420 
first but it uses a legato technique
meaning<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.349> only<00:00:31.619> use<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:32.759> left<00:00:33.030> hand

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
meaning that you only use your left hand

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.670 
meaning that you only use your left hand
it<00:00:35.430> also<00:00:35.670> uses<00:00:36.059> hammering<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.380> pulling

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
it also uses hammering on and pulling

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.049 
it also uses hammering on and pulling
off<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.160> basically<00:00:38.309> all<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.760> doing<00:00:39.000> is

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
off it it's basically all you doing is

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.479 
off it it's basically all you doing is
hammering<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.480> pulling<00:00:39.809> off<00:00:39.989> into<00:00:40.890> open<00:00:41.280> notes

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
hammering on pulling off into open notes
