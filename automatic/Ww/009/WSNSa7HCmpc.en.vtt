00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hi it's damn matt this book I'm 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.570
 shows how the tasks and a 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 terrarium 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.920
 so first we need branches a 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.250
 substrate me it will be sand with 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.279
 coconut fiber that is there or genius of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.289
 cartons to make different substrates 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:24.779
 you will want that done that so we're going 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.519
 go there so you do not really see 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.820
 with the boxes but after we will see 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.820
 the results 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.820
 here 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.480
 yeah the same yeah I think I have 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.160
 put too much in the center but that should be the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.770
 make 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.770
 so now we gently remove 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.250
 here 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.090
 that's it 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.370
 yes I was a little here is his jacket and 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.880
 assist now we will go to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.860
 branches 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.210
 if it is almost the most important 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.550
 for mints so that they can 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.060
 better than me I put it in the center 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.330
 here are the holds and that like everything at 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.070
 the hour I showed you young coconut 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.020
 so I'm going to put them well because 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.960
 that there are holes so I'm going to be able 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.410
 go and plant on the branch 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.170
 that's how we make a guy's got to 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.869
 either stable or not that it crushes 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.360
 demonstrate how this is my report 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.050
 can put plants that more in 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:44.330
 but there I have none so here I go 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:48.560
 add bamboo branches 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.560
 it makes exotic emirates 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.110
 it's really important for - 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.540
 more but with me as if mans 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.710
 I'm going to put flowers on him 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.270
 cool no orchids repressing so 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.970
 then his comeback fear so that I want neither 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.819
 tax in fact we cut the bottle the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.940
 top lamy upside down in the bottle 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.120
 suddenly it's a little hole as badly 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.769
 and it avoids half drowning in 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:30.050
 the other so that's it so I'm going to 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:32.180
 look for the gouache wanted to apologize 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.730
 because here again lead the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.790
 Subadult leaf should go to Cuba from 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.940
 sorry since it's actually not so 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.269
 small species that that 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:49.700
 so here she goes and I'll put her 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:54.709
 on the flower and that's it 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.280
 really a basic terrarium like for 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.700
 this species 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.700
 Nounkeu 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.560
 after we will pass on another terror 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.980
 uk where I planted a door so 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.100
 this one new way it grows like this 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.010
 as well so after according to 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.630
 the kind of mint you put some 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.460
 different decorations 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.460
 then after month the agreement go hi
