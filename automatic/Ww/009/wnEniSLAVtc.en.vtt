00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 adequate asset is what rafa says 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.379
 problem is in that player who stage 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.330
 precisely the defense that is the 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.820
 main the main key of this 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.700
 played this penalty that we see here in 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.070
 how much to carvajal is this foot that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.960
 this left foot that advances that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.449
 that we will take as reference and in 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.130
 As for the defense we see this shoulder of 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.510
 here on the left that we will go down and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.359
 we will take as reference and then in the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.599
 I ground both lines of defense and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.189
 forward if we throw them we see that it is not 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.640
 out of play for very little the truth 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.380
 so you can see it better we go to 3d 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.180
 we go to bernabÃ©u and we will have both 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.730
 players like carlos been cool pretty 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.600
 On the one hand benzema carvajal on the other 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.600
 defense side of the real valladolid 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.560
 but you 're also in the field we 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.130
 with the reflection from above 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.480
 in 100 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.250
 four go down to the box but I feel 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.710
 I'm a marathon or on that list 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.540
 principality for fai health 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 but out on the street caught rafael 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.880
 salgado and threw himself also how nice what 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.320
 better to lower the red player than 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.479
 they will correspond already red and the foot will 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.460
 He advanced that we said and then as soon as 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.600
 to the shoulder of the defense now we 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.850
 we will approach and we will see 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.680
 Well, what we are going to do is make 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.899
 a cutting plane for continue 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.149
 cut the arm and simply isolate the 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.670
 exact point of your shoulder we see it here 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.670
 a plane varies to the cut in the blue line 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.050
 that would cut the arm you see not just by 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.910
 the shoulder but let's go down the band 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.550
 the plane we would already have the blue line and 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.620
 we see with 0.09 meters 9 centimeters 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.810
 and this would be a little bit more or less 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.370
 I would be linier not what I would see and more 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:48.070
 or less here this perspective fits and 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:52.090
 raised a little more or less the zones 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.560
 what has been done there but good 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.800
 geometry what has to be the same 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.780
 thing can be expressed from crowd of 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.040
 different as a point but so much is a 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.040
 little more avant-garde what you did 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.690
 with gatti in that big machine 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.140
 account that heroine who calls to remove a 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.140
 horror and 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.570
 credibilities but after the space 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.570
 section because we chase
