everything the way it's supposed to come

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.910 
everything the way it's supposed to come
it<00:01:05.850> comes<00:01:06.030> with<00:01:06.330> these<00:01:06.740> six<00:01:07.790> plastic<00:01:08.790> shells

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920

which<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.040> will<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.280> into<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.760> moment<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.330> came

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
which I will get into in a moment I came

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.230 
which I will get into in a moment I came
with<00:01:13.439> two<00:01:13.560> extra<00:01:14.010> which<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.850> supposed<00:01:15.180> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
with two extra which are supposed to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
with two extra which are supposed to
come<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.500> put<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> two

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
come in here I really like I put the two

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.350

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.990 
extra and then in there and these shows
I'm<00:01:24.780> guessing<00:01:25.590> they're<00:01:25.890> pretty<00:01:26.159> easy<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.670> lose

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
the ray gun but that doesn't count

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.229 
the ray gun but that doesn't count
because<00:03:12.820> that's<00:03:13.030> lobbies<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:17.940> let's<00:03:18.940> get<00:03:19.060> into

because that's lobbies so let's get into
the<00:03:19.329> features<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:20.049> gun<00:03:21.010> more<00:03:21.450> came<00:03:22.450> with

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
the features of this gun more came with

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.050 
the features of this gun more came with
a<00:03:22.630> barrel<00:03:22.959> plug<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.500> case<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:24.340> don't<00:03:24.790> know<00:03:24.940> in

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
a barrel plug in case I don't know in

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.640 
a barrel plug in case I don't know in
case<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.390> don't<00:03:25.620> shoot<00:03:26.620> anyone<00:03:26.859> by<00:03:27.310> accident

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.569 
I'm afraid that if you shoot the gun
with<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.810> BB<00:03:32.079> inside<00:03:32.410> well<00:03:32.890> this<00:03:33.070> is<00:03:33.250> in<00:03:33.400> there

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
it might Jam your gun so that's really a

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:44.819 
it might Jam your gun so that's really a

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
which I will not do because I will risk

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.379 
which I will not do because I will risk
the<00:04:01.099> sights<00:04:01.340> being<00:04:01.760> not<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.329> way<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.480> wanted<00:04:02.870> to

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
the sights being not the way I wanted to

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.509

6-inch<00:04:05.389> barrel<00:04:05.709> obviously<00:04:06.709> I<00:04:06.739> got<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.099> 6-inch

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
6-inch barrel obviously I got the 6-inch

cuz<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:07.959> figured<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:09.079> want<00:04:09.379> Morel<00:04:11.200> western-style

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.770 
cuz I figured I want Morel western-style
I<00:04:12.560> guess<00:04:12.769> not<00:04:13.040> just<00:04:13.280> like<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.459> 2-inch<00:04:14.030> like<00:04:14.239> cops

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.670 
I guess not just like a 2-inch like cops
use<00:04:15.130> so<00:04:16.130> let's<00:04:16.250> get<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.699> cylinder<00:04:17.150> you

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
use so let's get to the cylinder you

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.779 
use so let's get to the cylinder you
actually<00:04:18.680> have<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:18.889> push<00:04:19.099> it<00:04:19.280> out<00:04:19.400> because<00:04:19.609> you

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
actually have to push it out because you

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.550 
actually have to push it out because you
can't<00:04:20.030> hold<00:04:20.329> it<00:04:20.539> and<00:04:20.720> then<00:04:20.840> like<00:04:20.959> go<00:04:21.169> like<00:04:21.320> that

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
can't hold it and then like go like that

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.140 
can't hold it and then like go like that
because<00:04:22.009> it<00:04:22.310> will<00:04:22.430> not<00:04:22.610> come<00:04:22.759> out<00:04:22.880> you

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
uh yeah now this is a spring it is not a

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.990 
uh yeah now this is a spring it is not a
co2<00:04:49.520> or<00:04:49.789> a<00:04:50.030> gas<00:04:50.500> so<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:51.530> cock<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.729> basically

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
co2 or a gas so to cock it you basically

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.899 
co2 or a gas so to cock it you basically

it triggers different you just aim the
fire<00:05:11.349> I<00:05:12.349> heard<00:05:12.949> that<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.220> FPS<00:05:13.610> on<00:05:13.849> this<00:05:14.030> gun<00:05:14.210> is

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
fire I heard that the FPS on this gun is

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.939 
fire I heard that the FPS on this gun is
about<00:05:15.070> 200<00:05:16.070> to<00:05:16.190> 300<00:05:16.669> maybe<00:05:16.880> 250<00:05:17.650> I'm<00:05:18.650> pretty

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
about 200 to 300 maybe 250 I'm pretty

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.469 
about 200 to 300 maybe 250 I'm pretty
sure<00:05:19.039> it's<00:05:19.190> higher<00:05:19.310> than<00:05:19.340> 250<00:05:19.970> but<00:05:20.150> I'm<00:05:20.300> not

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
sure it's higher than 250 but I'm not

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.790 
sure it's higher than 250 but I'm not
sure<00:05:20.630> I<00:05:21.520> hear<00:05:22.520> I<00:05:22.550> also<00:05:22.820> heard<00:05:23.090> that<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.800> longer

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
sure I hear I also heard that the longer

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.969 
sure I hear I also heard that the longer
the<00:05:25.130> barrel<00:05:25.370> is<00:05:25.669> the<00:05:26.030> more<00:05:26.900> accuracy<00:05:27.680> you<00:05:27.860> will

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
the barrel is the more accuracy you will

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.610 
the barrel is the more accuracy you will
have<00:05:28.300> so<00:05:29.300> that's<00:05:29.449> why<00:05:29.570> I<00:05:29.599> got<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:29.990> 6-inch<00:05:30.409> I
