00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
really sorry it's really important to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.230 
really sorry it's really important to
separate<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.410> bangs<00:00:59.620> into<00:00:59.920> two<00:01:00.130> layers<00:01:00.370> top

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
separate the bangs into two layers top

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.420 
separate the bangs into two layers top
and<00:01:01.450> bottom<00:01:01.750> so<00:01:02.560> I'll<00:01:02.680> take<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.070> top<00:01:03.220> layer

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
and bottom so I'll take the top layer

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.620 
and bottom so I'll take the top layer
bangs<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:05.350> just<00:01:06.220> separate<00:01:06.910> those<00:01:07.120> two<00:01:07.150> I'll

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
bangs and just separate those two I'll

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.960 
bangs and just separate those two I'll
just<00:01:07.780> use<00:01:07.960> a<00:01:07.990> tiny<00:01:08.230> elastic<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:09.820> don't

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
just use a tiny elastic because I don't

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.470 
just use a tiny elastic because I don't
have<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.120> clip<00:01:10.330> right<00:01:10.510> now<00:01:10.690> so<00:01:15.000> I'll<00:01:16.000> do<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.210> to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
have a clip right now so I'll do that to

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.319 
have a clip right now so I'll do that to
get<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.750> out<00:01:16.870> of<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.050> way

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.830 

all<00:01:22.329> right<00:01:22.479> so<00:01:22.929> now<00:01:23.109> I<00:01:24.090> probably<00:01:25.090> want<00:01:25.359> to<00:01:25.479> clip

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
all right so now I probably want to clip

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.459 
all right so now I probably want to clip
this<00:01:26.049> piece<00:01:26.289> of<00:01:26.439> hair<00:01:26.679> up<00:01:27.069> there<00:01:27.429> too<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:29.259> just

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
this piece of hair up there too but just

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.349 
this piece of hair up there too but just
so<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.619> get<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.770> idea<00:01:30.100> this<00:01:30.880> is<00:01:31.090> what<00:01:31.240> the

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
so you get the idea this is what the

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.120 
so you get the idea this is what the
back<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.109> bottom<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.500> my<00:01:32.530> hair<00:01:32.770> look<00:01:32.950> like

so it's basically just like I said a
circle<00:01:37.090> around<00:01:37.990> my<00:01:38.229> whole<00:01:38.409> head<00:01:38.590> including<00:01:39.130> my

that<00:02:13.480> when<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.720> use<00:02:14.019> that<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.940> when<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.180> use<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
that when I use that and when I use the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.949 
that when I use that and when I use the
fifteen<00:02:16.989> dollar<00:02:17.980> hair<00:02:18.849> dye<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.420> takes<00:02:19.810> the

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
fifteen dollar hair dye it takes the

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.900 
fifteen dollar hair dye it takes the
same<00:02:20.170> amount<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.470> time<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.799> fade<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.730> has

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
same amount of time to fade and it has

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.690 
same amount of time to fade and it has
the<00:02:22.060> same<00:02:22.269> effect<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.500> I'm<00:02:24.160> just<00:02:24.340> gonna<00:02:24.519> use<00:02:24.670> a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
the same effect so I'm just gonna use a

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.500 
the same effect so I'm just gonna use a
cheaper<00:02:25.090> one

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
cheaper one

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.360 
cheaper one
because<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.870> have<00:02:26.109> to<00:02:26.260> do<00:02:26.709> my<00:02:26.859> roots<00:02:27.069> all<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
because I have to do my roots all the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.940 
because I have to do my roots all the
time<00:02:27.549> my<00:02:28.359> natural<00:02:28.750> hair<00:02:28.900> color<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.620> an

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
time my natural hair color is like an

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.550 
time my natural hair color is like an
ash<00:02:30.370> blonde<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.079> that<00:02:32.079> wouldn't<00:02:32.349> look<00:02:32.500> very

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
ash blonde so that wouldn't look very

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.900 
ash blonde so that wouldn't look very
good<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.310> I'm<00:02:34.150> gonna<00:02:34.739> just<00:02:35.739> die<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.310> bottom

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
good so I'm gonna just die the bottom

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.180 
good so I'm gonna just die the bottom
part<00:02:37.389> of<00:02:37.660> my<00:02:37.720> hair<00:02:37.930> what<00:02:38.470> up<00:02:38.590> whatever<00:02:38.889> you

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
part of my hair what up whatever you

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.059 
part of my hair what up whatever you
have<00:02:39.400> hanging<00:02:39.669> out<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:41.380> is<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> two-step

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
have hanging out and this is a two-step

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.569 
have hanging out and this is a two-step
process

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
process

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.909 
process
so<00:02:43.000> whatever<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.750> box<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:44.139> hair<00:02:44.290> dye<00:02:44.470> says<00:02:44.709> to

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:44.919 
so whatever the box of hair dye says to

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.370 
so whatever the box of hair dye says to
do<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.040> think<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.459> just<00:02:45.489> leave<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.819> in<00:02:45.970> for<00:02:46.380> for

do I think you just leave it in for for
about<00:02:47.590> 15<00:02:48.010> or<00:02:48.040> 20<00:02:48.160> minutes<00:02:48.430> maybe<00:02:48.880> longer

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
about 15 or 20 minutes maybe longer

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.990 
about 15 or 20 minutes maybe longer
whatever<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.900> says<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:51.280> then<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.579> rinse<00:02:51.730> that

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
whatever it says and then you rinse that

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.580 

and<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.819> use<00:04:04.970> this<00:04:05.150> powder<00:04:05.480> it<00:04:05.840> comes<00:04:06.110> out<00:04:06.350> a

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
for medium brown to light blonde hair so

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.170 
for medium brown to light blonde hair so
this<00:04:20.030> one's<00:04:20.269> right<00:04:20.480> for<00:04:20.510> me

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
most of the powder is blue so this is

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.650 
most of the powder is blue so this is
what<00:04:27.320> I<00:04:27.350> use<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.130> says<00:04:28.370> here<00:04:28.970> to<00:04:29.210> mix<00:04:29.419> two

with one ounce of volume cream so you

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.770

here I usually use half and half and

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.409

faster<00:06:16.729> or<00:06:17.120> whatever<00:06:17.419> so<00:06:17.960> when<00:06:18.259> I<00:06:18.440> trim<00:06:18.770> my

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
faster or whatever so when I trim my

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.890 
faster or whatever so when I trim my
bangs<00:06:19.070> I<00:06:19.550> do<00:06:19.910> separate<00:06:20.389> them<00:06:20.599> again<00:06:20.900> and<00:06:21.250> then

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
bangs I do separate them again and then

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.930 
bangs I do separate them again and then
the<00:06:23.900> brown<00:06:24.139> here<00:06:24.889> that's<00:06:25.160> hanging<00:06:25.400> down<00:06:25.729> below

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
the brown here that's hanging down below

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.770 
the brown here that's hanging down below
I<00:06:26.419> just<00:06:27.190> know<00:06:28.190> I'll<00:06:28.370> just<00:06:28.550> trim<00:06:29.180> that<00:06:29.360> so<00:06:29.630> it's

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
I just know I'll just trim that so it's

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.370 
I just know I'll just trim that so it's
not<00:06:29.930> in<00:06:30.110> my<00:06:30.259> eyeballs<00:06:30.770> and<00:06:31.130> then<00:06:31.990> with<00:06:32.990> the

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
not in my eyeballs and then with the

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.159 
not in my eyeballs and then with the
blonde<00:06:34.099> part<00:06:34.520> I<00:06:34.789> want<00:06:35.389> to<00:06:35.449> make<00:06:35.599> sure<00:06:35.900> that

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
blonde part I want to make sure that

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.580 
blonde part I want to make sure that
it's<00:06:36.410> shorter<00:06:36.949> than<00:06:37.130> the<00:06:37.280> brown<00:06:38.169> so<00:06:39.169> it<00:06:39.199> has

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
it's shorter than the brown so it has

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.100 
it's shorter than the brown so it has
like<00:06:39.770> a<00:06:39.830> peekaboo<00:06:40.430> effect<00:06:40.460> so<00:06:41.360> in<00:06:41.599> order<00:06:41.720> to<00:06:41.900> do

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
like a peekaboo effect so in order to do

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.589 
like a peekaboo effect so in order to do
that<00:06:42.259> I'll<00:06:42.500> just<00:06:42.740> take<00:06:42.949> my<00:06:43.130> scissors<00:06:43.449> I'll<00:06:44.449> do

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.670 
that I'll just take my scissors I'll do
it<00:06:44.720> right<00:06:44.840> now<00:06:45.460> but<00:06:46.460> you<00:06:46.759> just<00:06:47.389> want<00:06:47.599> to<00:06:47.690> I'll

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680

00:06:50.030 --> 00:07:09.450 
just show you because I need to trim
anyways<00:06:53.409> this<00:06:54.409> is<00:06:54.590> how<00:06:54.770> I<00:06:54.800> trim<00:06:55.130> my<00:06:55.159> bangs

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.500 

kind<00:07:09.970> of<00:07:10.060> like<00:07:10.270> an<00:07:10.419> upward<00:07:10.810> chopping<00:07:11.590> motion

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:12.510 
kind of like an upward chopping motion

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.020 
kind of like an upward chopping motion
so<00:07:13.510> that<00:07:13.660> it's<00:07:13.840> not<00:07:13.990> just<00:07:14.380> one<00:07:15.220> flat<00:07:15.550> straight

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
so that it's not just one flat straight

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:22.770 
so that it's not just one flat straight
chop

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:22.780 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.610 

so<00:07:23.260> pretty<00:07:23.470> much<00:07:23.650> just<00:07:23.890> like<00:07:24.040> that

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.860 

you<00:07:27.430> can<00:07:27.610> use<00:07:27.760> any<00:07:27.970> colors<00:07:28.330> it<00:07:28.510> doesn't<00:07:28.780> have

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:28.870 
you can use any colors it doesn't have

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.110 
you can use any colors it doesn't have
to<00:07:28.990> be<00:07:29.110> brown<00:07:29.350> underneath<00:07:29.830> you<00:07:30.040> if<00:07:30.070> you<00:07:31.030> know

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 
to be brown underneath you if you know

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.730 
to be brown underneath you if you know
depending<00:07:31.479> on<00:07:31.570> where<00:07:31.780> you<00:07:31.870> work<00:07:32.080> you<00:07:32.290> can<00:07:32.470> have

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740 
depending on where you work you can have

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.879 
depending on where you work you can have
it<00:07:32.889> the<00:07:33.130> pink<00:07:33.490> or<00:07:33.820> red<00:07:34.120> or<00:07:34.530> something<00:07:35.530> cool

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:35.889 
it the pink or red or something cool

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:38.550 
it the pink or red or something cool
like<00:07:35.919> that<00:07:36.100> but<00:07:36.780> no<00:07:37.780> for<00:07:38.020> me<00:07:38.139> I'm<00:07:38.229> going<00:07:38.380> to<00:07:38.470> do

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 
like that but no for me I'm going to do

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.010 
like that but no for me I'm going to do
brown<00:07:39.750> and<00:07:41.160> voila<00:07:42.630> hopefully<00:07:43.630> this<00:07:43.840> was

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.020 
brown and voila hopefully this was

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.710 
brown and voila hopefully this was
helpful<00:07:44.050> and
