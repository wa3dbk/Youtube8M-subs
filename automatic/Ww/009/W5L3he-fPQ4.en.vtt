00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.240 
with it so receiving this version 3 I'm
really<00:01:12.820> confused<00:01:13.090> as<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.330> why<00:01:13.630> or<00:01:14.380> what<00:01:14.650> was

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
really confused as to why or what was

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.679 
really confused as to why or what was
done<00:01:15.430> with<00:01:15.549> it<00:01:15.700> so<00:01:15.820> I'm<00:01:16.000> actually<00:01:16.149> not<00:01:16.360> sure

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
done with it so I'm actually not sure

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.050 
done with it so I'm actually not sure
what<00:01:17.590> would<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.920> changes<00:01:18.310> were<00:01:18.640> made<00:01:18.880> between

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
what would the changes were made between

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.260 
what would the changes were made between
version<00:01:19.630> 2<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:19.869> version<00:01:20.079> 3<00:01:20.409> so<00:01:21.159> I<00:01:21.430> thought

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
version 2 and version 3 so I thought

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.969 
version 2 and version 3 so I thought
this<00:01:22.390> was<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.600> fantastic<00:01:22.810> case<00:01:23.320> already<00:01:23.680> it's

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
this was a fantastic case already it's

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.010 
this was a fantastic case already it's
you<00:01:24.219> know<00:01:24.310> extremely<00:01:24.670> lightweight<00:01:24.880> it's<00:01:25.329> you

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
you know extremely lightweight it's you

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.319 
you know extremely lightweight it's you
know<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.170> minimal<00:01:26.560> case<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:27.729> got<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.880> flap<00:01:28.180> on

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
know a minimal case you got a flap on

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.719 
know a minimal case you got a flap on
the<00:01:28.359> back<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.930> tuck<00:01:29.200> tuck<00:01:29.649> this<00:01:30.009> up<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:30.490> around

the back to tuck tuck this up and around

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.319 
the back to tuck tuck this up and around
for<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.090> standing<00:01:31.570> position<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:32.829> so<00:01:33.329> actually

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
for a standing position like so actually

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.240 
for a standing position like so actually
goes<00:01:34.509> something<00:01:34.780> about<00:01:34.930> right<00:01:35.109> there<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:36.070> a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
goes something about right there and a

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.370 
goes something about right there and a
vertical<00:01:36.579> position<00:01:36.670> so<00:01:37.210> I'm<00:01:37.899> not<00:01:38.079> quite<00:01:38.350> sure

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
vertical position so I'm not quite sure

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.260 
vertical position so I'm not quite sure
what<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.009> problem<00:01:39.280> was<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:39.729> they<00:01:39.939> needed<00:01:40.060> to

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
what the problem was that they needed to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.050 
what the problem was that they needed to
do<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.420> version<00:01:40.869> 3<00:01:41.109> it's<00:01:41.679> got<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.009> magnetic<00:01:42.369> you

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
know feet with sleepweight feature so it

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.069

works<00:01:45.189> great

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
works great

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.080

greatest idea of what I think about this

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.859 
greatest idea of what I think about this

with<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:12.490> ice<00:02:12.790> smart<00:02:13.180> case<00:02:13.480> now<00:02:14.050> what<00:02:14.530> they

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
with the ice smart case now what they

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.220 
with the ice smart case now what they
did<00:02:14.920> was<00:02:15.130> they<00:02:15.280> took<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.490> combo<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.780> case

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
did was they took a combo of this case

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.170 
did was they took a combo of this case
and<00:02:18.100> all<00:02:18.220> they<00:02:18.310> did<00:02:18.370> was<00:02:18.610> do<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.819> front<00:02:19.030> cover

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
and all they did was do the front cover

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.600 
and all they did was do the front cover
differently<00:02:19.630> that's<00:02:20.170> what<00:02:20.350> all<00:02:20.440> they<00:02:20.560> did<00:02:20.770> so

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
differently that's what all they did so

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.670 
differently that's what all they did so
I've<00:02:22.330> already<00:02:22.570> got<00:02:22.660> my<00:02:22.750> iPad<00:02:23.050> in<00:02:23.200> here<00:02:23.380> all<00:02:23.530> you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
I've already got my iPad in here all you

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.320 
I've already got my iPad in here all you
do<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.040> install<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.760> iPad

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
do to install the iPad

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.690 
do to install the iPad
is<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.080> like<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.350> one<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.680> slide<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.400> iPad

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
is just like this one you slide the iPad

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.070 
is just like this one you slide the iPad
in<00:02:27.850> that<00:02:28.000> way<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.300> tuck<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.600> little<00:02:28.870> flap

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
in that way and tuck this little flap

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.300 
in that way and tuck this little flap
underneath<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.340> iPad<00:02:30.640> 2<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.930> here<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.010> is

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
underneath the iPad 2 so here it is

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.760 
underneath the iPad 2 so here it is
now<00:02:34.090> obviously<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.930> sleep/wake<00:02:35.500> feature

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
now obviously the sleep/wake feature

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.680 
now obviously the sleep/wake feature
just<00:02:36.100> worked<00:02:36.250> fine<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.330> looks<00:02:37.450> exactly

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
just worked fine and it looks exactly

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.340 
just worked fine and it looks exactly
the<00:02:37.930> same

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
the same

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.570 
the same
you've<00:02:38.470> got<00:02:38.680> your<00:02:38.800> leather<00:02:39.040> border<00:02:39.490> around

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
you've got your leather border around

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.120 
you've got your leather border around
the<00:02:39.820> sides<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.570> you've<00:02:41.260> got<00:02:41.530> cutouts<00:02:41.920> for

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
the sides and you've got cutouts for

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.090 
the sides and you've got cutouts for
everything<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.660> everything<00:02:44.530> actually<00:02:44.770> lined

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
everything and everything actually lined

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.580 
everything and everything actually lined
up<00:02:45.220> really<00:02:45.730> well<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.750> leather<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.470> can

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
up really well and it is leather you can

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.170 
up really well and it is leather you can
smell<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.010> doesn't<00:02:48.250> have<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.460> chemical<00:02:49.090> smell

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
smell it doesn't have a chemical smell

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.380 
smell it doesn't have a chemical smell
smells<00:02:49.570> just<00:02:49.660> like<00:02:49.750> leather<00:02:50.400> now<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:52.150> special

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
smells just like leather now the special

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.150 
smells just like leather now the special
part<00:02:52.690> about<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:53.020> one<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:53.620> front<00:02:53.890> flap

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
part about this one is this front flap

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.630 
part about this one is this front flap
it<00:02:55.030> uses<00:02:55.630> this<00:02:56.080> sort<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.800> method<00:02:57.100> or<00:02:57.400> roll<00:02:57.610> up

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
it uses this sort of method or roll up

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.140 
it uses this sort of method or roll up
method<00:02:58.060> or<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.870> typing<00:02:59.470> position<00:02:59.890> as<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.670> just

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
method or the typing position as I just

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.980 
method or the typing position as I just
did<00:03:01.390> very<00:03:01.990> easy<00:03:03.420> now<00:03:04.420> I've<00:03:04.570> talked<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.930> few

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
did very easy now I've talked to a few

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.120 
did very easy now I've talked to a few
people<00:03:05.200> about<00:03:05.350> this<00:03:05.620> one<00:03:05.709> because<00:03:05.860> I've<00:03:05.980> used

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
people about this one because I've used

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
people about this one because I've used
this<00:03:06.310> one<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.490> little<00:03:06.640> bit<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:08.700> requires<00:03:09.700> a

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
this one a little bit and it requires a

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.540 
this one a little bit and it requires a
break-in<00:03:10.750> period<00:03:11.200> big<00:03:11.890> time<00:03:12.100> because

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
break-in period big time because

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.070 
break-in period big time because
obviously<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.240> siping<00:03:13.540> position<00:03:13.900> works

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
obviously the siping position works

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.160 
obviously the siping position works
great<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:14.620> mean<00:03:14.950> it's<00:03:15.760> not<00:03:15.970> too<00:03:16.240> not<00:03:17.110> too

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
great I mean it's not too not too

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.260 
great I mean it's not too not too
vertical<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.740> think<00:03:18.250> it's<00:03:18.370> perfect<00:03:18.730> for<00:03:18.790> typing

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
vertical I think it's perfect for typing

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.420 
vertical I think it's perfect for typing
position<00:03:19.420> however<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.440> vertical<00:03:21.010> standing

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
position however the vertical standing

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.270 
position however the vertical standing
position<00:03:21.959> requires<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.290> little<00:03:23.650> bit<00:03:23.920> of

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
position requires a little bit of

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.670 
position requires a little bit of
break-in<00:03:24.970> time<00:03:25.150> otherwise<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.720> doesn't<00:03:26.440> stand

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
break-in time otherwise it doesn't stand

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.330 
break-in time otherwise it doesn't stand
up<00:03:26.920> straight<00:03:27.480> but<00:03:28.480> in<00:03:28.630> most<00:03:28.840> cases<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.380> does<00:03:29.680> so

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
up straight but in most cases it does so

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.460 
up straight but in most cases it does so
as<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.640> can<00:03:30.730> see<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:31.930> sort<00:03:32.080> of<00:03:32.200> how<00:03:32.350> it

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
as you can see this is sort of how it

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.850 
as you can see this is sort of how it
works

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
works

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.090 
works
and<00:03:34.230> let's<00:03:35.230> see<00:03:35.320> if<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.440> get<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.709> stand<00:03:35.860> here

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
and let's see if I get to stand here

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.960 
and let's see if I get to stand here
yeah<00:03:36.610> see<00:03:37.570> so<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.959> sounds<00:03:38.230> fine<00:03:38.670> but<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:39.820> does

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
yeah see so it sounds fine but it does

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.850 
yeah see so it sounds fine but it does
require<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.360> little<00:03:40.540> breaking<00:03:40.900> in<00:03:41.200> as<00:03:41.380> far<00:03:41.650> as

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
require a little breaking in as far as

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.300 
require a little breaking in as far as
all<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.450> grooves<00:03:43.750> here<00:03:43.989> on<00:03:44.290> all<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
all the the grooves here on all the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.750 
all the the grooves here on all the
bending<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.000> case<00:03:46.180> now<00:03:46.870> as<00:03:47.170> well<00:03:48.040> as<00:03:48.370> I

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
bending of the case now as well as I

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.979 
bending of the case now as well as I
move<00:03:49.150> over<00:03:49.390> here<00:03:49.620> as<00:03:50.620> these<00:03:51.130> break<00:03:51.489> in<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:52.660> lays

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
move over here as these break in it lays

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.410 
move over here as these break in it lays
flatter<00:03:53.470> so<00:03:54.280> right<00:03:54.459> now<00:03:54.580> it's<00:03:54.760> kind<00:03:55.030> of<00:03:55.180> a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
flatter so right now it's kind of a

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.990 
flatter so right now it's kind of a
bumpy<00:03:55.840> surface<00:03:56.470> however<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:57.670> does

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
bumpy surface however it does

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.030 
bumpy surface however it does
magnetically<00:03:58.870> seal<00:03:59.170> to<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.470> front<00:03:59.739> of<00:03:59.920> the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
magnetically seal to the front of the

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.340 
magnetically seal to the front of the
case<00:04:00.220> that's<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.760> point<00:04:00.970> of<00:04:01.090> this<00:04:01.239> one<00:04:01.450> you

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
case that's the point of this one you

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.180 
case that's the point of this one you
can<00:04:02.500> feel<00:04:02.769> it<00:04:02.950> latch<00:04:03.130> onto<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.610> case<00:04:04.050> see

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
can feel it latch onto the case see

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.949 
can feel it latch onto the case see
but<00:04:06.670> as<00:04:06.850> this<00:04:07.090> breaks<00:04:07.480> in<00:04:07.600> a<00:04:07.630> little<00:04:07.840> bit

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
but as this breaks in a little bit

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.830 
but as this breaks in a little bit
better<00:04:08.110> it<00:04:08.410> will<00:04:08.620> attach<00:04:09.130> much<00:04:09.850> better<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.720> the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
better it will attach much better to the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.080 
better it will attach much better to the
outside<00:04:11.260> frame<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.860> it'll<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.670> vertical

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
outside frame and it'll a vertical

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.280 
outside frame and it'll a vertical
standing<00:04:13.360> position<00:04:13.720> will<00:04:13.840> be<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:13.959> lot<00:04:14.140> better

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
standing position will be a lot better

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.229 
standing position will be a lot better
so<00:04:15.040> this<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:15.640> case<00:04:15.820> that<00:04:15.850> you're<00:04:16.060> going<00:04:16.180> to

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
so this is the case that you're going to

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.509 
so this is the case that you're going to
have<00:04:16.330> to<00:04:16.419> give<00:04:16.540> a<00:04:16.570> little<00:04:16.810> bit<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:17.049> time<00:04:17.519> it'll

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
have to give a little bit of time it'll

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.979 
have to give a little bit of time it'll
break<00:04:18.609> in<00:04:18.790> nicely<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.299> work<00:04:19.510> really<00:04:19.720> well

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
break in nicely and work really well

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.780 
break in nicely and work really well
otherwise<00:04:20.560> until<00:04:21.010> then<00:04:21.160> it's<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.400> little<00:04:21.640> bit

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
otherwise until then it's a little bit

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.850 
otherwise until then it's a little bit
weird<00:04:22.750> getting<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.229> vertical<00:04:23.560> standing

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
weird getting the vertical standing

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.469 
weird getting the vertical standing
position<00:04:24.220> however<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.729> standing<00:04:25.360> position

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
position however the standing position

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.540 
position however the standing position
for<00:04:25.930> typing<00:04:26.350> is<00:04:26.560> perfectly<00:04:26.950> fine<00:04:27.100> as<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.430> can

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
for typing is perfectly fine as you can

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.700 
for typing is perfectly fine as you can
see<00:04:27.669> here<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:29.020> can<00:04:29.140> see<00:04:29.260> it<00:04:29.410> holds

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
see here and you can see it holds

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.190 
see here and you can see it holds
together<00:04:30.010> perfectly<00:04:30.640> fine<00:04:30.820> a<00:04:31.060> little<00:04:31.870> bit<00:04:32.110> of

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
together perfectly fine a little bit of

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.310 
together perfectly fine a little bit of
a<00:04:32.260> jostle<00:04:32.620> there<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:32.919> it<00:04:33.040> comes<00:04:33.190> right<00:04:33.310> free

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
a jostle there and it comes right free

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.920 
a jostle there and it comes right free
anyway<00:04:35.320> this<00:04:35.950> is<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.880> bow<00:04:37.060> iSmart<00:04:37.720> case

flap attached to the leather part maybe
a<00:04:54.820> little<00:04:55.030> bit<00:04:55.150> easier<00:04:55.479> requiring<00:04:56.289> a<00:04:56.410> less

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
a little bit easier requiring a less

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.490 
a little bit easier requiring a less
break-in<00:04:56.949> time<00:04:57.160> but<00:04:58.150> it<00:04:58.690> still<00:04:58.870> does<00:04:59.139> this<00:04:59.229> job

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
break-in time but it still does this job

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.749 
break-in time but it still does this job
and<00:04:59.740> they<00:04:59.830> did<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.009> great<00:05:00.220> job<00:05:00.250> trying<00:05:00.699> to

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
and they did a great job trying to

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.420 
and they did a great job trying to
converge<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.509> smart<00:05:02.470> cover<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:03.130> the

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
converge the smart cover and the

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.420 
converge the smart cover and the
executive<00:05:04.270> leather<00:05:04.449> case<00:05:04.720> like<00:05:05.229> this<00:05:05.410> one<00:05:05.650> so

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
executive leather case like this one so

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.469 
executive leather case like this one so
all<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:06.639> all<00:05:06.699> they<00:05:06.820> did<00:05:06.970> a<00:05:07.000> good<00:05:07.120> job<00:05:07.180> and

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
all in all they did a good job and

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.719 
all in all they did a good job and
there's<00:05:07.600> multiple<00:05:08.220> colors<00:05:09.220> you<00:05:09.370> know<00:05:09.460> brown

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
there's multiple colors you know brown

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.360 
there's multiple colors you know brown
red<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:10.060> black<00:05:10.300> so<00:05:10.720> this<00:05:11.470> is<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.740> leather<00:05:12.100> case

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
red and black so this is a leather case

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.189 
red and black so this is a leather case
it<00:05:12.610> is<00:05:12.729> very<00:05:13.000> lightweight<00:05:13.270> and<00:05:13.720> is<00:05:13.990> available

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
it is very lightweight and is available

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.939 
it is very lightweight and is available
now<00:05:14.620> so<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:15.360> recommend<00:05:16.360> it<00:05:16.479> but<00:05:16.720> hold<00:05:17.470> tight<00:05:17.710> you

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
now so I recommend it but hold tight you

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.680 
now so I recommend it but hold tight you
know<00:05:18.070> they<00:05:18.370> might<00:05:18.550> release<00:05:19.060> a<00:05:19.090> revision<00:05:19.600> on

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
know they might release a revision on

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.500 
know they might release a revision on
this<00:05:19.840> case<00:05:20.220> but<00:05:21.220> if<00:05:21.699> you're<00:05:21.910> looking<00:05:22.240> for<00:05:22.419> this

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
this case but if you're looking for this

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.110 
this case but if you're looking for this
sort<00:05:22.660> of<00:05:22.780> combo<00:05:23.199> go<00:05:24.010> for<00:05:24.280> it<00:05:24.370> you're<00:05:24.850> not<00:05:24.940> going

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
sort of combo go for it you're not going

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.180 
sort of combo go for it you're not going
to<00:05:25.210> miss<00:05:26.050> out<00:05:26.229> on<00:05:26.350> anything<00:05:26.590> it'll<00:05:26.889> require<00:05:27.070> a

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
to miss out on anything it'll require a

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.350 
to miss out on anything it'll require a
little<00:05:27.280> bit<00:05:27.400> of<00:05:27.520> break-in<00:05:27.789> time<00:05:27.940> but<00:05:28.150> it'll<00:05:28.270> be

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
little bit of break-in time but it'll be

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.570 
little bit of break-in time but it'll be
perfectly<00:05:28.720> fine<00:05:28.960> so<00:05:29.289> all<00:05:29.889> in<00:05:30.010> all<00:05:30.070> this<00:05:30.280> is<00:05:30.340> the

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
perfectly fine so all in all this is the

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.000 
perfectly fine so all in all this is the
