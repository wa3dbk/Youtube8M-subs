00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 I think it 's so alright, everything that 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.120
 I left the video and steal the boss 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.330
 morning 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.090
 is all sixth route is that I java 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.790
 I was sitting in an attempt to embarrass myself 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.670
 port does not know is that the same sit is 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.660
 which is here only had a London puddle 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.480
 and corina beat just because not here in the blog 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.699
 I know the urine and it is not soft, but it is 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.580
 Funnier and I like it more 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.260
 say gum and prost another time in 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.960
 which guided there to be in these toilets 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.860
 It's when I wake up in the morning and when I'm 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.170
 sleepy 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.300
 I can not deal with problems such as 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.890
 triple jet and I do not know how it is continuous 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.370
 but it 's better that way you do not even have the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.280
 and challenges the laws of the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.280
 physics is that sometimes it is being done 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:03.289
 not just a perfect jet going thing and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.289
 when it is in the mt that I went to 1 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.740
 thousand micro bubbles niche and hit everything in 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.680
 cap I do not know how it's possible but 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.920
 happens a few years ago and admit that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.909
 traveling sit maybe was reason for 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.460
 to have shame 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.020
 But I'm coming to see you now. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.920
 We are talking about catching and I will tell you 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.009
 a story 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.229
 once I went to eat a sandwich at 32 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.520
 from a concert by jorge palma and once 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.829
 per month there is a general cleaning in the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.990
 my style would normally take the visa 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.820
 greater before document 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.810
 but everything always has the tendency is 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.229
 irregular 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.530
 I thought why is country will pass and 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.610
 not worth noting is something that goes 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.829
 be good 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.020
 it will not be time I know it will not 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.759
 be on the good side but there is anything inside 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.829
 You do not want to believe me. 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.710
 I want to believe that it happens and I 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.790
 already on the way to the concert is when 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.869
 the team had less than 30 seconds until the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.539
 time 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.100
 I'm going to run between 32 which is a cafe and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.510
 would not return the houses 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:25.230
 The bank entered the first day and is 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:28.080
 exclusive of where the mother of the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.190
 minimum mobile phone service for more claw 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.410
 And I thought I 'm in the bathroom. 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.540
 of garages 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.500
 No, I'm not going because I go into 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.050
 inter-lane urinals 25 minutes 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.110
 then opened the door were about ten 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.420
 travel in line and occupy 1 billion 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.130
 At that time the washbasins were 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.800
 scene had all the ingredients to 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.310
 make you feel ashamed but I do not know 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.690
 Why did not you and I went there with a tattoo? 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.090
 What was I waiting for? 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.090
 What happened and I thought I was 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.220
 in the bathroom in the queue is that you enter the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.890
 follow me the one thing she once did 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.020
 was all this would have left a smell 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.150
 more pleasant and the targets 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.000
 the congress there lived the smell can be 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.730
 but the interesting thing about it is the 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.370
 brain that is what chooses what is 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.800
 embarrassing or not already chose the scenes 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.630
 much less embarrassing for not 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.750
 leave the extra line in common a 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.690
 part of the body manages to make 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.640
 we feel ashamed of what other 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.250
 body parts do I think this is 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.290
 one of the things we believe 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.840
 to be human we have to leave 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.330
 donated to our animal door but that she 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.040
 own a choice of things is what 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.150
 distinguishes between animals 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:52.760
 i and in ours this is a c bad we 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.760
 we feel the animals is not 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.760
 looks
