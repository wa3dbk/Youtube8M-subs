world<00:00:48.660> I've<00:00:49.079> been<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.739> curious<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.280> try<00:00:50.670> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
world I've been very curious to try it

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
world I've been very curious to try it
but<00:00:51.180> every<00:00:51.420> time<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.629> go<00:00:51.870> check<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
but every time I go check it out the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.410 
but every time I go check it out the
fact<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.309> geared<00:00:53.670> towards<00:00:54.059> shadow

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
fact that it's geared towards shadow

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
fact that it's geared towards shadow
kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.379> two<00:00:55.620> tiered<00:00:55.890> me<00:00:56.129> from<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.520> just

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
kind of like two tiered me from it just

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.819 
kind of like two tiered me from it just
because<00:00:57.180> my<00:00:57.360> eye<00:00:57.390> look<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.230> about<00:00:58.289> liner

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
because my eye look is all about liner

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
because my eye look is all about liner
so<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.820> wasn't<00:01:00.000> sure<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.329> you'd<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.480> worth
