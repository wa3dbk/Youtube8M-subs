00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 voo continuation and end of our soap opera 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.370
 now and since the beginning of the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.319
 week have done just the turn of the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.830
 cities of France that will welcome the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.420
 holidaymakers 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.160
 today we will focus on 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.660
 vacationers we followed two 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.030
 families getting ready to leave 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.460
 the first time a circuit of 15 days 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.600
 on the bike the other a retired couple is going 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.520
 escape for a month in 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.859
 motorhome in the french countryside 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.109
 so you have to think of everything to avoid 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.109
 miss the beautiful parenthesis of summer 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.120
 for distances follows instructions 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.190
 of mom last workout before the 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.420
 great departure 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.700
 but how fast joola that would have 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.450
 maybe gone a little bit below in 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.370
 less than a week 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.739
 condomines Mandela family will leave 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.470
 lunel in the south of france direction 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.170
 geneva first and then isabelle 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.860
 Frederic Leonardo and Clarisse will descend 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.930
 along the rhone 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.880
 fifteen days by bike to return to their 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.400
 starting point then it takes a good 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.840
 last repetition that allows us to 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.660
 check already that the material holds 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.070
 the road and for the little one to check 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.650
 as well as when he gets out of his way 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.140
 usual he is more direct more 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.740
 attentive the trip will be at the pace 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.020
 about 40 km per day 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.210
 clarisse is too young to pedal 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:31.250
 but the eight-year-old is a regular 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.070
 bike outings to have descents of 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.000
 disassemble because I love it nice 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.000
 when it's too flat 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:51.200

 because they go to 2 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.560

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.090

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.810
 children 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:12.090

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.989
