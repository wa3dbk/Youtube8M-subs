be looking at the non grip matte finish

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220 
be looking at the non grip matte finish
we're<00:00:20.429> gonna<00:00:20.519> see<00:00:20.760> double<00:00:21.179> concave<00:00:21.449> sidewalls

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
we're gonna see double concave sidewalls

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.380 
we're gonna see double concave sidewalls
of<00:00:22.470> rounded<00:00:22.859> corners<00:00:23.279> now<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.029> double

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
of rounded corners now this double

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.910 
of rounded corners now this double
concavity<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.050> gonna<00:00:25.230> let<00:00:25.439> your<00:00:25.590> fingers

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
concavity is gonna let your fingers

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.710 
concavity is gonna let your fingers
really<00:00:26.070> contour<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.910> shaft<00:00:27.240> giving<00:00:27.660> you

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
really contour to the shaft giving you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.779 
really contour to the shaft giving you
nice<00:00:27.900> comfortable<00:00:28.439> hold<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:29.339> far<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
nice comfortable hold as far as the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.820 
nice comfortable hold as far as the
shaft<00:00:30.060> construction<00:00:30.689> goes<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.259> this<00:00:31.710> is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
shaft construction goes on this this is

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.020 
shaft construction goes on this this is
gonna<00:00:31.919> be<00:00:32.070> different<00:00:32.250> from<00:00:32.520> last<00:00:32.700> year's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
gonna be different from last year's

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.780 
gonna be different from last year's
Makos<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.230> gonna<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.740> what<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.550> saw

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
Makos and this is gonna be a what we saw

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.000 
Makos and this is gonna be a what we saw
on<00:00:35.970> the<00:00:36.090> top-of-the-line<00:00:36.570> Mako<00:00:37.110> 2<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.830> is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
on the top-of-the-line Mako 2 this is

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.560 
on the top-of-the-line Mako 2 this is
going<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.280> their<00:00:38.520> unique<00:00:38.970> carbon<00:00:39.210> system

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
going to be their unique carbon system

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.020 
going to be their unique carbon system
which<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.140> universally<00:00:40.890> aligned<00:00:41.520> carbon

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
which are universally aligned carbon

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.390 
which are universally aligned carbon
fibers<00:00:42.450> throughout<00:00:42.810> the<00:00:42.990> entire<00:00:43.290> shaft<00:00:43.740> now

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
fibers throughout the entire shaft now

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.940 
fibers throughout the entire shaft now
when<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.320> they<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:46.500> rid<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.740> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
when they do this they got rid of the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.100 
when they do this they got rid of the
Kevlar<00:00:47.340> wrap<00:00:47.580> from<00:00:47.790> two<00:00:47.940> years<00:00:48.150> ago<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.570> this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
Kevlar wrap from two years ago and this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.110 
Kevlar wrap from two years ago and this
provides<00:00:49.560> a<00:00:49.770> lot<00:00:50.100> tighter<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:50.880> wrap

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
provides a lot tighter of a wrap

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.420 
provides a lot tighter of a wrap
throughout<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.080> whole<00:00:52.200> shaft<00:00:52.470> making<00:00:53.250> this

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
throughout the whole shaft making this

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.580 
throughout the whole shaft making this
lighter<00:00:53.820> stronger<00:00:54.810> and<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.200> going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.560> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
lighter stronger and it's going to be a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.930 
lighter stronger and it's going to be a
little<00:00:55.890> bit<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.220> efficient<00:00:56.790> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
little bit more efficient and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.540 
little bit more efficient and
transferring<00:00:57.480> energy<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.990> well<00:00:58.200> and<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:59.400> we

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
transferring energy as well and as we

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.190 
transferring energy as well and as we
really<00:00:59.820> kind<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.120> zoom<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.720> here<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.050> can

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
really kind of zoom in on here you can

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.530 
really kind of zoom in on here you can
see<00:01:01.530> these<00:01:01.770> ridges<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> nice<00:01:03.180> texture

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
see these ridges this is a nice texture

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.389 
see these ridges this is a nice texture
that<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:03.930> use<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> top-line<00:01:04.920> mako<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
that they use in the top-line mako and

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.789 
that they use in the top-line mako and
then<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.909> m5<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.929> year's<00:01:07.170> generation

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
then this m5 of this year's generation

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
then this m5 of this year's generation
this<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.909> adds<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.270> little<00:01:09.299> bit<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
this just kind of adds a little bit of a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.319 
this just kind of adds a little bit of a
grip<00:01:10.530> texture<00:01:11.100> feeling<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.149> get

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
grip texture feeling just so you can get

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:13.880 
grip texture feeling just so you can get
a<00:01:12.359> little<00:01:12.570> bit<00:01:12.750> firmer<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.439> hold<00:01:13.649> especially

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
a little bit firmer of a hold especially

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.120 
a little bit firmer of a hold especially
on<00:01:14.310> these<00:01:14.460> non<00:01:14.729> grip<00:01:15.060> sticks<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:16.409> down<00:01:16.740> into

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
on these non grip sticks going down into

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.130 
on these non grip sticks going down into
the<00:01:17.399> blade<00:01:17.670> we're<00:01:18.119> gonna<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> couple<00:01:18.780> key

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the blade we're gonna see a couple key

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.440 
the blade we're gonna see a couple key
improvements<00:01:19.710> really<00:01:20.490> helping<00:01:20.850> durability

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
improvements really helping durability

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.810 
improvements really helping durability
from<00:01:21.570> last<00:01:21.869> year's<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.469> st<00:01:22.950> or<00:01:23.249> last<00:01:23.549> year's

Mako<00:01:24.450> m5<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:25.079> a<00:01:25.469> real<00:01:25.859> durable<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.969> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
Mako m5 is a real durable kind of a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.389 
Mako m5 is a real durable kind of a
power<00:01:27.299> type<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.929> stick<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.469> on<00:01:28.859> last<00:01:29.159> year's

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
power type of a stick so on last year's

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.099 
power type of a stick so on last year's
model<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:29.819> added<00:01:30.179> an<00:01:30.270> extra<00:01:30.390> spar<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
model they added an extra spar in the

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.200 
model they added an extra spar in the
middle<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.829> give<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.219> a<00:01:32.429> total<00:01:32.819> of<00:01:32.909> three

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
middle to give this a total of three

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.120 
middle to give this a total of three
middle<00:01:33.539> spars<00:01:33.840> running<00:01:34.590> through<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> blade

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
middle spars running through the blade

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.249 
middle spars running through the blade
now<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.240> year<00:01:36.479> they<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.749> three<00:01:37.049> through

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
now this year they have three through

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.499 
now this year they have three through
the<00:01:37.380> middle<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:37.770> also<00:01:37.950> one<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> bottom<00:01:38.819> so

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the middle and also one on the bottom so

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.510 
the middle and also one on the bottom so
this<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:39.869> stores<00:01:40.289> up<00:01:40.530> any<00:01:40.770> durability

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
this really stores up any durability

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
this really stores up any durability
issues<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.179> saw<00:01:42.359> last<00:01:42.630> year<00:01:42.929> in<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
issues that we saw last year in the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.770 
issues that we saw last year in the
Makos<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.819> to<00:01:44.880> add<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.359> lot<00:01:45.749> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
Makos this is going to add a lot of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.330 
Makos this is going to add a lot of
strength<00:01:46.109> it's<00:01:46.499> going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.679> make<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.920> nice<00:01:47.069> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
strength it's going to make it nice and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.279 
strength it's going to make it nice and
stiff<00:01:47.609> which<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.179> helps<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> accuracy<00:01:49.259> of

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
stiff which really helps the accuracy of

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.590 
stiff which really helps the accuracy of
your<00:01:49.409> shot<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:50.009> between<00:01:50.819> that<00:01:50.999> we<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.359> some

some heaviness in the blade this is due
to<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.170> adding<00:02:28.590> material<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.250> they<00:02:29.370> use<00:02:29.400> to

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
to that adding material that they use to

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.760 
to that adding material that they use to
really<00:02:30.300> try<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.600> make<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.050> as<00:02:31.200> durable<00:02:31.590> as

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
really try and make this as durable as

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.220 
really try and make this as durable as
possible<00:02:32.340> overall<00:02:33.240> it's<00:02:33.510> still<00:02:33.630> real

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
possible overall it's still real

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.260 
possible overall it's still real
lightweight<00:02:34.530> stick<00:02:35.070> it's<00:02:35.460> lighter<00:02:35.760> than<00:02:36.090> last

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
lightweight stick it's lighter than last

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.720 
lightweight stick it's lighter than last
year's<00:02:36.600> top-of-the-line<00:02:37.140> Mako<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:38.010> uh<00:02:38.040> you

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
year's top-of-the-line Mako so uh you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.699 
year's top-of-the-line Mako so uh you
know<00:02:38.850> this<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.120> really<00:02:39.480> balanced<00:02:39.900> nice<00:02:40.470> and

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
know this is really balanced nice and

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.250 
know this is really balanced nice and
lightweight<00:02:41.209> it's<00:02:42.209> really<00:02:42.840> good<00:02:42.990> for<00:02:43.170> those

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
lightweight it's really good for those

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.080 
lightweight it's really good for those
heavier<00:02:43.980> players<00:02:44.280> or<00:02:44.670> someone<00:02:44.970> who<00:02:45.060> really

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
heavier players or someone who really

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.900 
heavier players or someone who really
puts<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.840> lot<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:46.110> force<00:02:46.440> into<00:02:46.709> their<00:02:47.010> stick<00:02:47.310> so

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
puts a lot of force into their stick so

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.250 
puts a lot of force into their stick so
overall<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.300> think<00:02:48.600> they<00:02:48.690> did<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> really<00:02:48.930> good

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
overall I think they did a really good

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.900 
overall I think they did a really good
job<00:02:49.320> with<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.370> for<00:02:50.580> even<00:02:50.640> more
