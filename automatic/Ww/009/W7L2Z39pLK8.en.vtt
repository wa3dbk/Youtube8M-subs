00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
in the order beforehand so get them to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.990 
in the order beforehand so get them to
write<00:02:28.530> their<00:02:28.680> names<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.250> way<00:02:29.400> they'll

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
write their names in that way they'll

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.400

no<00:02:31.620> arguing<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:33.260> last<00:02:34.260> point<00:02:34.620> here<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:34.920> think

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
no arguing and last point here I think

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.060 
no arguing and last point here I think
is<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:36.240> catch<00:02:36.690> doesn't<00:02:37.170> count<00:02:37.350> if<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.890> catcher

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
is a catch doesn't count if the catcher

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.610 
is a catch doesn't count if the catcher
falls<00:02:38.400> off<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.790> bench<00:02:39.030> while<00:02:39.270> catching
