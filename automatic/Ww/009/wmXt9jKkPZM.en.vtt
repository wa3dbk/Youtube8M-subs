00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.589
 and then a good thing plus a video 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.170
 of the channel 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.960
 I'm going to make a video today for the area. 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.969
 beginners great beginners who the channel 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.830
 which is a sector that I think many 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.810
 people know that it is geared towards 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.109
 people are starting now in the world 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.470
 hardware and today I'll talk about 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.269
 windows 60 and 64-bit and 32-bit 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.929
 I'll give you more technical and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.439
 explain whether or not you are there is 64 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.579
 bits 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.300
 if the machine has 32 the co-op network and 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.600
 Here it goes 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.200
 Good, I'll explain first the difference. 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.350
 important the biggest difference is 32 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.140
 or 64-bit windows 32-bit 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 it recognizes only 3.5 and my 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.940
 memories on some machines he 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.829
 can get to know 4GB of memory exists 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.859
 some programs that make you 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.660
 to make your windows 32 bit recognize 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.680
 more memory and I'll even teach and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.130
 in the future 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.490
 already 64-bit windows can recognize 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.409
 more than 100 t few gb of memory 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.970
 It's funny that it 's only double and it closes a lot. 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.950
 but one country is there 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.990
 it is recommended for machines that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.670
 than three days was the mark of 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.270
 four gigas you have to install the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.150
 windows on your machine because 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.740
 because if you speak 12 32 bits one 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.390
 machine with three more games 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.159
 This game that is going to be missing it does not 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.409
 it will be used to call who is in 43 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.829
 days no matter how much memory 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.509
 that you have another factor that few 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.479
 people do not know that most of the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.100
 people think it 's okay that they do not 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.409
 sell windows 64-bit 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.380
 you have to install when it's all 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.750
 its processor is 64 bits 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.980
 some older teachers work 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.560
 with 32 bits 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.570
 is there a suddenly 1 4 if you have one 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.770
 machine does not install the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.980
 windows 64 installed by fans 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.520
 al khor will be the current ones in which 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:13.410
 any other cpu type is in 5 and 7 and 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:16.380
 3 having an amd fx you install 64 bit 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.960
 why why windows 64 bit 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.660
 it works much faster 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.550
 processing process more than the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.710
 double 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.610
 I'll give a basic example here assume 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.630
 2 32-bit one is an avenue 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.330
 one way avenue only if it is now if you 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.550
 compare with 64-bit windows 64- bit 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.430
 is an avenue with two 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.600
 passes a lot more car ie traffic 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.580
 of information 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.900
 in cp1 is greater because it can 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.210
 double processing 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.370
 if you have a good 64 bit cpu with more 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.890
 3GB of memory you have to install 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.959
 windows 64-bit if you install the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.640
 windows 7 32-bit 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.110
 you'll be wasting power 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.000
 of your pc and you will get serious 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.880
 problems because few people 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.550
 know if you let the blood used 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.130
 in your memory profile or more 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.550
 the probability of the penta defect is high 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.100
 because voltage will be left in the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.320
 memories that one of the databases do not 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.250
 working and will generate serious problems 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.050
 thereby 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.200
 so if I realize four gigs and 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.800
 took the technician and ocara installed 12 32 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.770
 bits 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.160
 you back there and are missing 64 bit 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.730
 this is the main difference is another 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.590
 thing 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.530
 some people are afraid to install 12 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.650
 64-bit because of this the team can 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.540
 not be compatible non programs 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.890
 because the problems with 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.170
 two bit paraiba 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.980
 good staff this was in those days the windows 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.970
 xp 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.739
 nowadays windows 7 onwards I think 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.650
 that even 12 view it even comes with a 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.000
 x86 folder for those who do not know the 86 is the 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.390
 number two bits 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.430
 it comes if you talk in 2 64 bit 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.400
 it will see the folder to which the programs and 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.160
 x86 program files because 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.079
 resolved to install the program is not 54 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.310
 bis automatically it will be 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:17.970
 installed on the facade x 85 rotate as 32 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.700
 bits ie windows 7 for example 64 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.100
 bits and supports any program well 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.340
 in two bits and 64 bits 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.430
 of course there are not many programs 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.700
 which uses 64 minutes but when using 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.860
 to enjoy pc performance better 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.000
 remembering that despite the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.870
 64-bit 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.300
 the program in use has 64 bits also if 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.640
 you install a 64-bit game 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.740
 He's going to have a lot more commitment than 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.280
 you even talk in a 32 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.590
 bits 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.560
 in the case of English it is remarkable a machine 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.370
 64-bit and 4GB memory is much more 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.260
 faster than the image and memory in a 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.620
 32-bit system 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:05.250
 okay that's the big difference if you have 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.750
 windows and captivate the 64 bits but 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.700
 although the problems do not work 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.170
 can install properly that will work 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.020
 quietly unless it is the 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.450
 system currently operates windows xp and 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.640
 windows 98 out there goes but I think 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.240
 no more books to ship in the 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.470
 people still use some so this is it 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.940
 that you liked 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.830
 You're there, we 're watching the 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.290
 video is the same as it is not a beginner but 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.400
 I like my channel like my voice and 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.800
 I wanted to watch because I know the galaxy you 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.830
 liked it disclose parts in addition to this 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.230
 kind of doubt and that's what I said and even 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.140
 more and here in the application will be the 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:47.150
 fan page and group link on radio 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.150
 for you are learning more there said
