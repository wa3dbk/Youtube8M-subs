going yet again and made some new
improvements<00:00:17.019> if<00:00:18.019> we<00:00:18.140> start<00:00:18.410> off<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:18.769> chess

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
improvements if we start off the chess

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.880 
improvements if we start off the chess
it<00:00:19.220> version<00:00:19.579> here<00:00:20.560> really<00:00:21.560> really<00:00:21.769> good

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
it version here really really good

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.970 
it version here really really good
design<00:00:22.249> very<00:00:23.029> similar<00:00:23.449> to<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.890> chest<00:00:24.890> zip

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
design very similar to the chest zip

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.120 
design very similar to the chest zip
system<00:00:25.579> that<00:00:25.789> the<00:00:25.880> XL<00:00:26.449> wet<00:00:26.810> suit<00:00:26.989> shoes<00:00:27.199> really

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
system that the XL wet suit shoes really

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.870 
system that the XL wet suit shoes really
easy<00:00:28.279> to<00:00:28.669> zip<00:00:29.029> up<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:29.569> unzip<00:00:30.339> and<00:00:31.339> it<00:00:31.609> seals

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
easy to zip up and unzip and it seals

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.240 
easy to zip up and unzip and it seals
away<00:00:32.239> here<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:32.899> one<00:00:33.260> really<00:00:33.530> good<00:00:33.649> thing<00:00:33.710> is

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
away here so one really good thing is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.310 
away here so one really good thing is
these<00:00:34.790> two<00:00:35.000> piece<00:00:35.180> of<00:00:35.300> material<00:00:35.420> me<00:00:35.840> over<00:00:36.050> top

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
these two piece of material me over top

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.479 
these two piece of material me over top
and<00:00:36.469> you're<00:00:36.710> minimizing<00:00:36.949> the<00:00:37.250> amount<00:00:37.370> of

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
and you're minimizing the amount of

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.209 
and you're minimizing the amount of
water<00:00:37.609> that<00:00:37.789> can<00:00:38.030> come<00:00:38.210> through<00:00:38.390> any<00:00:38.600> zip

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
water that can come through any zip

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.950 
water that can come through any zip
reason<00:00:40.219> for<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.399> chess<00:00:40.609> it<00:00:40.820> as<00:00:41.600> we've<00:00:41.809> said

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
reason for a chess it as we've said

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.810 
reason for a chess it as we've said
before<00:00:42.019> in<00:00:42.320> previous<00:00:42.440> videos<00:00:42.710> is<00:00:43.460> that

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
before in previous videos is that

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.400 
before in previous videos is that
without<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.120> zip<00:00:44.359> on<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.570> back<00:00:44.719> here<00:00:44.750> obviously

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
without a zip on the back here obviously

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.560 
without a zip on the back here obviously
a<00:00:45.440> zip<00:00:45.980> can't<00:00:46.309> can't<00:00:47.210> move<00:00:47.449> and<00:00:47.690> is<00:00:48.050> unfledged

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
a zip can't can't move and is unfledged

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.660 
a zip can't can't move and is unfledged
ability<00:00:50.570> within<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.929> wetsuit<00:00:51.460> which<00:00:52.460> makes

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
ability within the wetsuit which makes

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.979 
ability within the wetsuit which makes
it<00:00:52.730> easier<00:00:53.000> if<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:53.149> one<00:00:53.390> for<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.839> move

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
it easier if you one for you to move

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.689 
it easier if you one for you to move
around<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.379> web<00:00:54.559> suit<00:00:54.800> but<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.489> more<00:00:55.670> that

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
around the web suit but the more that

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.549 
around the web suit but the more that
you<00:00:55.910> can<00:00:56.059> move<00:00:56.359> and<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.749> better<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.170> material

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
you can move and the better the material

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:58.869 
you can move and the better the material
sticks<00:00:57.800> to<00:00:57.890> your<00:00:57.949> body<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.460> warm<00:00:58.670> are<00:00:58.789> you

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
sticks to your body the warm are you

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.369 
sticks to your body the warm are you
going<00:00:58.999> to<00:00:59.059> be<00:00:59.120> because<00:00:59.690> you<00:00:59.870> won't<00:01:00.050> create<00:01:00.289> any

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
going to be because you won't create any

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.259 
going to be because you won't create any
flat<00:01:00.769> panels<00:01:01.159> where<00:01:01.339> water<00:01:01.519> can<00:01:01.760> collect<00:01:02.089> and

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
flat panels where water can collect and

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.810 
flat panels where water can collect and
make<00:01:02.390> you<00:01:02.480> cold<00:01:02.920> some<00:01:03.920> really<00:01:04.190> nifty<00:01:04.339> features

actually Billabong's solar mesh panel
which<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:14.660> designed<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.500> trap<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.490> heat<00:01:17.060> from

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
which is designed to trap the heat from

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.120 
which is designed to trap the heat from
the<00:01:17.300> Sun<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.230> takes<00:01:18.440> it<00:01:18.590> into<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.920> suit

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
the Sun and it takes it into the suit

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.560 
the Sun and it takes it into the suit
and<00:01:19.370> puts<00:01:19.550> it<00:01:19.610> into<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.940> zoo<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.180> keeps<00:01:20.390> you

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
and puts it into the zoo and keeps you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.960 
and puts it into the zoo and keeps you
nice<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:20.810> toasty<00:01:21.410> warm<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.520> if<00:01:22.610> that<00:01:22.760> works

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
nice and toasty warm and if that works

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.610 
nice and toasty warm and if that works
that<00:01:23.210> will<00:01:23.270> be<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.390> huge<00:01:23.420> huge<00:01:24.020> bonus<00:01:24.500> when

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
that will be a huge huge bonus when

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.380 
that will be a huge huge bonus when
you're<00:01:24.770> out<00:01:24.860> at<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:24.980> water<00:01:25.160> so<00:01:25.910> that's<00:01:26.060> new

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390

blind stitched it and then stitched

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.970 
blind stitched it and then stitched
again<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.670> then<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.060> reinforce<00:01:50.570> that<00:01:50.980> they've

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
again and then to reinforce that they've

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.080 
again and then to reinforce that they've
actually<00:01:52.100> put<00:01:52.340> liquid<00:01:52.520> taping<00:01:52.820> on<00:01:53.000> the

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
actually put liquid taping on the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
warmth inside the wetsuit now we spoke

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.939 
warmth inside the wetsuit now we spoke
about<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:23.090> solar<00:05:23.690> panel<00:05:24.050> on<00:05:24.289> the<00:05:24.500> back<00:05:24.740> of<00:05:24.889> the

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
about the solar panel on the back of the

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.950 
about the solar panel on the back of the
suit<00:05:25.070> before<00:05:25.250> well<00:05:25.789> the<00:05:25.970> heat<00:05:26.479> from<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:26.720> solar

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
suit before well the heat from the solar

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.930 
suit before well the heat from the solar
panel<00:05:27.349> is<00:05:27.800> then<00:05:27.949> transferred<00:05:28.460> into<00:05:28.849> this

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
panel is then transferred into this

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.029 
panel is then transferred into this
material<00:05:29.449> which<00:05:29.630> yet<00:05:29.930> again<00:05:30.260> is<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.650> thermal

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
material which yet again is the thermal

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.310 
material which yet again is the thermal
material<00:05:31.520> so<00:05:32.030> one<00:05:32.360> it's<00:05:32.510> working<00:05:32.900> water<00:05:33.080> away

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
material so one it's working water away

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.350 
material so one it's working water away
and<00:05:33.680> it's<00:05:34.250> also<00:05:34.430> using<00:05:34.880> the<00:05:34.909> heat<00:05:35.150> from<00:05:35.270> the

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
and it's also using the heat from the

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.570 
and it's also using the heat from the
solar<00:05:35.630> panel<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.050> heat<00:05:36.229> up<00:05:36.409> this<00:05:36.620> panel<00:05:37.039> which

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
solar panel to heat up this panel which
