particular<00:00:33.059> brand<00:00:34.250> hardens<00:00:35.250> from<00:00:35.910> 5<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.450> 10

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
particular brand hardens from 5 to 10

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.490 
particular brand hardens from 5 to 10
minutes<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.620> work<00:00:37.770> pretty<00:00:37.800> fast

minutes so you have to work pretty fast
once<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.739> hardened<00:00:41.430> you're<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.840> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
once it hardened you're just going to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.990 
once it hardened you're just going to
take<00:00:43.140> out<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.620> marble<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.280> now<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.550> have

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000

your mold for the resin so for the
minifigure<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.960> inside<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.469> resin<00:00:49.860> I'm

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
minifigure going inside the resin I'm

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.700 
minifigure going inside the resin I'm
making<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.730> chapeau<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.960> make<00:00:52.230> any

mini<00:00:53.190> figure<00:00:53.550> you'd<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.940> out<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> polymer

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
mini figure you'd like out of polymer

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.500 
mini figure you'd like out of polymer
clay<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:56.430> resin<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:56.969> using<00:00:57.300> this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
clay for the resin I'm using this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.380 
clay for the resin I'm using this
particular<00:00:57.780> brand<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.879> instruction

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
particular brand and the instruction

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.139 
particular brand and the instruction
comes<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:01.079> two<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.829> ratio<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.550> Part<00:01:02.969> A

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
comes with two to one ratio for Part A

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.649 
comes with two to one ratio for Part A
and<00:01:03.510> B<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.159> use<00:01:05.339> another<00:01:05.729> brand<00:01:06.180> you

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and B but if you use another brand you

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.600 
and B but if you use another brand you
may<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.320> read<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> instruction<00:01:08.430> for

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
may want to read the instruction for

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.090 
may want to read the instruction for
that<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.330> may<00:01:09.659> vary<00:01:10.110> from<00:01:10.500> brand<00:01:10.710> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
that because it may vary from brand to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.080 
that because it may vary from brand to
brand<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.750> I'm<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.320> mix<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.430> part<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
brand so I'm going to mix the part the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.679 
brand so I'm going to mix the part the
two<00:01:15.270> parts<00:01:15.630> with<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> ratio<00:01:16.619> given<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.689> mix

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
two parts with the ratio given and mix

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.380 
two parts with the ratio given and mix
it<00:01:18.900> until<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.710> clear<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.670> pour<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.150> onto

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it until it's clear then I pour it onto

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
it until it's clear then I pour it onto
the<00:01:21.689> resin<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.290> wait<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> few<00:01:23.549> hours<00:01:23.759> until

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the resin I wait for a few hours until

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.510 
the resin I wait for a few hours until
the<00:01:24.479> resin<00:01:24.840> becomes<00:01:25.200> tacky<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.830> sticky<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the resin becomes tacky and sticky and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090 
the resin becomes tacky and sticky and
then<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.119> would<00:01:27.390> place<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.780> mini<00:01:28.350> figurine

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
then I would place the mini figurine

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.810 
then I would place the mini figurine
inside

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.630

suggest you watch crafted alights video

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.540 
suggest you watch crafted alights video
on<00:01:38.180> resin<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.810> shoot<00:01:39.200> it'll<00:01:39.830> give<00:01:40.040> you<00:01:40.160> a<00:01:40.220> lot

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
on resin and shoot it'll give you a lot

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.620 
on resin and shoot it'll give you a lot
more<00:01:40.580> info<00:01:41.210> if<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.480> use<00:01:41.720> resin<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:43.310> after<00:01:43.940> 24

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
more info if you use resin so after 24

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.870 
more info if you use resin so after 24
hours<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:45.440> should<00:01:45.710> look<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:45.950> this<00:01:46.160> mine

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
hours it should look like this mine

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.850 
hours it should look like this mine
looks<00:01:47.150> matte<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:47.900> I'm<00:01:48.200> just<00:01:48.500> using<00:01:48.710> some

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
looks matte so I'm just using some

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.360 
looks matte so I'm just using some
varnish<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.730> make<00:01:49.910> it<00:01:50.030> shiny<00:01:50.860> so<00:01:51.860> for<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.190> base

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
varnish to make it shiny so for the base

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.060 
varnish to make it shiny so for the base
of<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.729> snow<00:01:53.000> globe<00:01:53.330> I<00:01:53.630> am<00:01:54.170> just<00:01:54.470> using<00:01:54.680> some

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
of the snow globe I am just using some

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:26.729 
of the snow globe I am just using some
pink<00:01:55.310> polymer<00:01:55.729> clay

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.479 

so<00:02:27.739> now<00:02:27.980> I'm<00:02:28.250> just<00:02:28.519> arranging<00:02:29.140> everything<00:02:30.140> and

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
so now I'm just arranging everything and

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.720 
so now I'm just arranging everything and
placing<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:32.290> round<00:02:33.290> part<00:02:33.830> just<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.459> place<00:02:34.700> a

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
placing the round part just to place a

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.210 
placing the round part just to place a
mark<00:02:35.299> so<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.750> will<00:02:35.870> be<00:02:35.959> easier<00:02:36.349> later<00:02:36.650> after<00:02:37.190> I

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
mark so it will be easier later after I

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.699

bake<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.790> base<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.810> now<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.049> bake<00:02:39.379> the<00:02:39.530> clay

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709

base<00:02:40.040> but<00:02:40.280> not<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.730> resin<00:02:41.060> because<00:02:41.239> it<00:02:41.569> is

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
base but not the resin because it is

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.369 
base but not the resin because it is
flammable<00:02:43.269> after<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.420> clay<00:02:44.629> has<00:02:44.840> been<00:02:45.079> baked

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379

parts<00:02:48.530> together<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:59.060> kind<00:02:59.359> of<00:02:59.450> realized<00:02:59.900> it

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
parts together and I kind of realized it

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.979 
parts together and I kind of realized it
the<00:03:00.260> glue<00:03:00.560> was<00:03:00.859> yellow<00:03:01.190> but<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.970> didn't<00:03:02.450> mind<00:03:02.750> it

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
the glue was yellow but I didn't mind it

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.430 
the glue was yellow but I didn't mind it
