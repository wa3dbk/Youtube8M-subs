the seat and then start again and then
the<00:02:50.620> bridge<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.190> tricky<00:02:51.460> part<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.910> it's

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
the bridge is the tricky part and it's

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.640 
the bridge is the tricky part and it's
written<00:02:52.570> that<00:02:52.810> way<00:02:52.930> because<00:02:53.200> that's<00:02:53.320> sort<00:02:53.500> of

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
written that way because that's sort of

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.650 
written that way because that's sort of
the<00:02:53.740> one<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.310> key<00:02:54.550> sort<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.060> verses<00:02:55.420> in<00:02:55.450> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
the one of the key sort of verses in the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.150 
the one of the key sort of verses in the
song<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.140> sort<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.380> emphasizes<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.070> with

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
song so it sort of emphasizes it with

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.370 
song so it sort of emphasizes it with
the<00:02:57.280> changing<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:57.940> chords<00:02:58.300> from<00:02:59.230> a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
the changing of chords from a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.670 
the changing of chords from a
songwriting<00:02:59.740> standpoint<00:03:00.190> but<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.420> verse

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680

is<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.730> F<00:03:30.880> chord<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:32.290> then<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.680> put<00:03:32.860> a<00:03:32.890> fifth

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
is the F chord and then you put a fifth

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.380 
is the F chord and then you put a fifth
of<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.940> F<00:03:34.060> which<00:03:34.300> is
