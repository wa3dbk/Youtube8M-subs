the<00:03:21.190> minish<00:03:21.459> might<00:03:21.670> actually<00:03:21.940> accidentally

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
the minish might actually accidentally

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.470 
the minish might actually accidentally
dial<00:03:23.110> because<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.739> third<00:03:24.180> horse<00:03:25.180> no<00:03:25.299> she's

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
dial because the third horse no she's

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.470 
dial because the third horse no she's
not<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.379> good<00:03:26.500> thing<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:27.069> um<00:03:27.480> I'm

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
not and that is a good thing so um I'm

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.390 
not and that is a good thing so um I'm
running<00:03:29.200> sitting<00:03:29.500> down<00:03:29.620> mushrooms<00:03:30.010> as<00:03:30.129> I<00:03:30.220> go

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
running sitting down mushrooms as I go

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.880 
running sitting down mushrooms as I go
and<00:03:30.700> then<00:03:31.239> many<00:03:31.659> heroes<00:03:32.049> are<00:03:32.200> realizing<00:03:32.769> that

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
and then many heroes are realizing that

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.830 
and then many heroes are realizing that
they<00:03:33.040> cannot<00:03:33.340> win<00:03:33.609> because<00:03:33.909> we<00:03:34.150> have<00:03:34.540> taken

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
they cannot win because we have taken

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.720 
they cannot win because we have taken
out<00:03:34.930> too<00:03:35.079> many<00:03:35.290> inhibitors<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:35.889> noon<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.549> here

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
out too many inhibitors and noon in here

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.580 
out too many inhibitors and noon in here
is<00:03:36.819> coming<00:03:37.180> away<00:03:37.269> at<00:03:37.389> their<00:03:37.510> base<00:03:37.629> so<00:03:38.260> I'm

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
is coming away at their base so I'm

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.039 
is coming away at their base so I'm
basically<00:03:39.250> this<00:03:39.730> looks<00:03:40.000> like<00:03:40.180> an<00:03:40.540> amoeba<00:03:40.870> and

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
basically this looks like an amoeba and

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.890 
basically this looks like an amoeba and
the<00:03:41.260> video<00:03:41.590> pretty<00:03:41.799> soon<00:03:42.069> and<00:03:42.280> we<00:03:43.000> are<00:03:43.120> picking

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
but these it does whether it happens

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.309 
but these it does whether it happens
like<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.790> minute<00:03:52.180> ability<00:03:52.569> because<00:03:52.959> that

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
like a minute ability because that

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.500 
like a minute ability because that
around<00:03:54.129> 40<00:03:54.489> minutes<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.849> respawn<00:03:55.180> time<00:03:55.359> is

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510
