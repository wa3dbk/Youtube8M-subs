00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.010
 really this video should have been 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.780
 published 10 years ago but from 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.330
 today there will be a retro zone on my channel 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.550
 where we will analyze and look at some 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.980
 elements of the past that marked us the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.230
 life somehow the mobile phone 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.480
 then it was released to the market in 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.310
 the year 2004 acquiring some 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.670
 novel features for that 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.110
 time before starting the analysis 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.780
 I want that in the comments of this 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.570
 video tell me exactly if the 17 of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.840
 March 2004 had already been born or their age 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.270
 on that date well analyzing the context 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.340
 technological of those days a camera 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.950
 digital was very expensive equally an 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.870
 video camera this terminal was not 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.360
 precisely the first phone in nokia 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.460
 I had a camera much less the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.100
 better from that time but if we compare 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.409
 the prices was a relatively mobile 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.810
 more economical that had a camera 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.240
 digital as something too new in 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.610
 that time at that time those who 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.560
 may remember nokia towards constants 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
 innovations with respect to the designs 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.460
 of the phones although some the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 have truly ended as a resounding 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.490
 failure 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.740
 the physical aspects of this mobile 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.049
 were one of the main reasons for 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.509
 its success since its colorful casings 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.399
 they attracted young people likewise their 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.500
 flying saucer lights were very 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.140
 important in his taste in youth 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.750
 from that good time in terms of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.240
 operating system had a series of 40 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.939
 cameras and a simple recording of 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.799
 video clips in my opinion in some 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.409
 aspects this mobile stays a little 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.280
 short if we compare it with its predecessor 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.890
 the Nokia 3200 this phone had 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.720
 functions like the radio fm the port of 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.000
 infrared that would not have stayed 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.579
 wrong to complete the functions of this 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.340
 phone would also have been easier 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.950
 Take the photos to the computer though 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.649
 this one had usb port connection the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.630
 cable was something complicated to find and 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.880
 at that time or at least in my 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.190
 country that technology was for people 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.290
 wealthy since very few knew her 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.870
 then many of the photographs 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.720
 taken by the mobile phone were lost 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.790
 over time in addition to this I had the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.569
 phone very good coverage in the network 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.489
 why 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.560
 then the battery life was 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.420
 good also the resolution of the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.450
 obvious camera not compared with the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.489
 today's phones like it considered 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.430
 that this mobile phone was one of the 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.290
 that marked a time in this industry 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.269
 very good for that time but today 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.549
 rest in peace in the drawers more 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.139
 hidden from your house or in a discarded 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.920
 there or industry elements 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.920
 radioactive
