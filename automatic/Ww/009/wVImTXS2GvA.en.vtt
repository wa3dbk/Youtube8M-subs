 GDP 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:13.509
 m 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.230
 a serious step back in the 2000 first 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.820
 year 3 years ahead of what interest 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.480
 made for three militants after 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.720
 small but revolution 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.859
 developers from the company of beautiful 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.279
 thought that since the militants bureau is big 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.430
 part of the time the plant shoots by 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.980
 bullish can number people by yourself 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.840
 opponents do not increase to the limit 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.780
 all then when you need to throw out 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.880
 but also to propagate the development of the system 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.400
 for a tick added already about 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.270
 super soldier sam last hope 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.070
 humanity how are you using 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.750
 mysterious artifacts sent to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.800
 the past is amazing 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.950
 didn't work 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.340
 serious goals need to be distracted by different 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.210
 little things cameron focused 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.100
 exclusively on shooting 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.000
 we protect one arena we select 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.880
 a backpack of cartridges bestowed by heaven and 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.890
 immediately born 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.230
 various weapons opponents each with 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.460
 his aunt exhibition 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 eight years later when coming soon 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.060
 third serious self esteem is not new 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.750
 he had his developers on hand 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.330
 completed engine serious engine 3 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880
 they took and decided to upgrade 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.870
 original game due to their newest 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.120
 modern developments 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.140
 graphic work clearly fell on 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.020
 place counted and seconds 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.460
 turned over with seriousness 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.540
 and we got quite relevant and in Egypt 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.180
 owning movements what used to be 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.830
 right on the ground the sand from the desert and serve 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.670
 lawsuits look enough 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.190
 realistic 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.140
 thanks to the physical and schools total 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.730
 opponents honestly scatter 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.270
 neighborhoods on July 1 break under hail 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.490
 shot 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.910
 gigantic to be and adjoining by 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.100
 raise the whole payment will be gibbs 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.770
 which sometimes almost nothing is visible 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.380
 there is even more of its own nose 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.500
 then sporting interest to pass the game at 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.370
 This memory note difference from 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.700
 of the original 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.659
 bc revival in the lineup are present 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.729
 some rough edges 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.320
 who were still in original ideas and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.110
 everything is not so rosy with 3d models 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.259
 besides 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.369
 skeletons for example after an unsuccessful attack 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.839
 Why then for some time collected by 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.369
 the original game we just don't 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.849
 noticed but now his eyes are still less 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.489
 familiar peak of enemies and indeed here in 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.510
 generally on the one hand causes pleasant 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.680
 memories of the first passage 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.169
 serious yourself is good when there is but 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:28.939
 remember 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.349
 on the other hand, in terms of sound and recording quality 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.599
 now is not so but his soul and judging by 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.599
 all no restoration they 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.429
 in any case of the appearance of such 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.249
 remake story 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.339
 although the developers did not add new ones 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.349
 fishmen or even weapons 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.999
 now enjoy 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.769
 passing self-praise impossible 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.109
 he has not gone anywhere and a secret place 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.939
 the variety that was famous 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.479
 are original 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.379
 if you are at one time most of them 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.459
 missed parents need now 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.089
 salaries will be looking for 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:03.639
 besides extra 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.229
 ammunition for weapons there sometimes 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:07.449
 discover a rather original style 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.119
 if you look into the near future 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:11.229
 can be found in the plans of developers 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:13.699
 similar remake of vasilyev sms 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.159
 it turned out but you already remember 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.159
 wonderful annual rate 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.709
 i can't wait to go through it 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.039
 updated version 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:23.409
 the same output of these modern versions 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:25.169
 is a good advertisement in itself 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.309
 lead of the third part 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:29.769
 also for novation or go after 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.199
 the fact that the average is second 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.489
 time will tell 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.650
 and at least for the schedule you can not 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.269
 worry
