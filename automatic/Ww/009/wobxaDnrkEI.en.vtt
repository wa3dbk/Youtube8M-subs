then<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.470> aggressively<00:04:22.470> fish<00:04:22.830> for<00:04:23.070> one<00:04:23.370> fish

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
then you aggressively fish for one fish

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.210 
then you aggressively fish for one fish
and<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.720> capture<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.229> fish<00:04:25.470> take<00:04:25.889> picture

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
and you capture that fish take picture

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.020 
and you capture that fish take picture
and<00:04:26.400> put<00:04:26.520> them<00:04:26.639> back<00:04:26.789> it's<00:04:27.330> real<00:04:27.690> rewarding

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
and put them back it's real rewarding

colors<00:05:02.830> work<00:05:03.070> great<00:05:03.520> you've<00:05:04.000> got<00:05:04.210> to<00:05:04.300> work<00:05:04.419> a

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
colors work great you've got to work a

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.530 
colors work great you've got to work a

but<00:05:07.540> sometimes<00:05:07.780> those<00:05:08.110> nesting<00:05:08.560> fish<00:05:08.710> they'll

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
but sometimes those nesting fish they'll

but sometimes those nesting fish they'll
pick<00:05:09.130> it<00:05:09.250> up<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:09.460> spit<00:05:09.639> out<00:05:09.669> so<00:05:10.060> fast<00:05:10.470> you've

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
pick it up and spit out so fast you've

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:18.310 
pick it up and spit out so fast you've
got<00:05:11.710> to<00:05:11.830> be<00:05:11.949> really<00:05:12.160> good<00:05:12.310> on<00:05:12.550> reaction<00:05:12.940> time

putting<00:05:19.100> boats<00:05:19.340> around<00:05:19.640> nesting<00:05:20.210> fish<00:05:20.450> I

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
putting boats around nesting fish I

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.290 
putting boats around nesting fish I
really<00:05:21.770> try<00:05:21.980> to<00:05:22.010> be<00:05:22.160> ginger<00:05:22.550> around<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.030> nest
