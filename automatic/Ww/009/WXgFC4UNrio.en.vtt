00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello youtube friends today we are going to 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:09.270
 show them how to install an emulator in 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.629
 your ios device is an ipad an ipod 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.340
 touch or even on an iphone 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.719
 there are several simulators I am 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.540
 tested are the ones that I will recommend 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.100
 in this case but you on the page in the 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.640
 what will I give you? 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.370
 get others and then we start ok 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.320
 you need first is a device 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.710
 ios in this case I here 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.559
 in this ipad mini I have installed the nds 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.670
 for ios which is basically an emulator 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.690
 of nds 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.659
 and in the other case here I have installed in 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.820
 the iphone 51 of the gba for ios that is 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.290
 basically the gateway advance the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.110
 inhabitant 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.310
 and then I'll show you in any 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.310
 device you can install it 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.100
 this is a test we are going to see in this 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.949
 case opens with the big screen here 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.790
 I have what is the pokemon diamond what 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.190
 download as they come there 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.650
 in the settings you can find this that 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.470
 is the frames kit the ib salut on 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.480
 basically deactivates the sound the frame 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.730
 I recommend that you leave it in 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.930
 automatic controls is the opacity 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.360
 of the control the type if you want to use 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.550
 that a regular shot a joystick you 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.160
 you can use it and it's for 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.020
 developers because the frames by 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.330
 second but I do not recommend that you 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.740
 let's go to nothing and let's start the game 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.130
 it's a test I'm going to show you how 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.130
 install it 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.840
 how is the fire really starts well 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.140
 it's fast and there's no problem with 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.030
 the game 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.159
 we can not hear the game audio 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.430
 it does not run slow they can see that it does not run 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.430
 slow 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.940
 then the topic is 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.270
 and you can see the pokemon diamond 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.080
 I will not be able to play now, since 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.400
 it is basically a test, nothing more 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.490
 I'll have to set everything up again 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.810
 but they see works well it does not get stuck is not 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.810
 it is not slow 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.870
 and it works in two vertical modes 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.140
 and good in this case this new one does not 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:47.150
 it works in landscape because 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:51.079
 is a child of that because preside it s not 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.400
 you can flip horizontally but let's go 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.590
 to show them now if we start 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.590
 direct a page that I 'm going to leave you 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.819
 the description and in the note 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.370
 is that is a forum i is wifi point 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.550
 puntocom here we will find a lot 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.769
 free software so to speak here is 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.170
 the one from jávea for ios that basically 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.080
 is the one I have on the iphone 5 and 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.470
 it works very well and we can find 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.620
 here another one for gameboy color that is the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.430
 first game boy this is 2 emulate the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.870
 English publisher that is 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.969
 something for android knit tm 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.540
 basically it's a sega emulator 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:40.469
 genesis and this one that is for nds that is 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.239
 good for ds for airs and 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.730
 is in scaling that is a number of 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.709
 nintendo even here you can save 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.959
 this re with record myscreen that 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.090
 basically what it does is that you can 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.130
 record what is on your screen of your 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.200
 Once device 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.900
 and we can also find the one of snes 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.000
 the super nintendo improve mario bros 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.090
 or something like that and we're going to show you how 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.090
 install to start this ok one thing 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.700
 you can only install one unfortunately 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.400
 stealth will only install one of these 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.440
 but basically the queen reech what 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.930
 normal in the installation of one is very 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.780
 quick but right now I have as they saw 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.250
 the nds installed today is still the 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.650
 of Javea so they can see how 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.940
 they are replaced they are supposed to 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.250
 developers are working to 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.740
 can already install several 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.870
 versions or several types of emulators 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.850
 in the same device we hope to be 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.400
 may soon we will keep you at 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.140
 so much and let's start here to install 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.520
 basically the beasts that click on 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.039
 install 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.849
 as you can see I'm clicking on this takes a 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:47.819
 little bit and it tells you w 1.9.2 you want to install 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.849
 gba forest and then we're not going to give anything to 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.369
 install 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.580
 and then as you can see this is an icon 

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:58.879
 of installation and it was replaced by the dds 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.709
 that the ts that I had already installed in 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.389
 done and you still see the bs icon and 

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:03.529
 at the end it will be replaced by the 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.529
 jávea 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:08.830
 well there is progressing and there is the 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:12.310
 new gba icon 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.050
 we are going to open it and as you can see I do not have 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.770
 rooms since they were in the other 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.500
 emulator removes them completely and 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.850
 Well here are other configurations but 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.409
 it's the same, I recommend you do not move 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.739
 nothing alone to this what 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:30.489
 the hauls that to be able then they can 

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:33.800
 proposal to choose a corner or a 

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:36.469
 theme for your own control the 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.050
 nintendo wii ware of get boy advance and 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.249
 Well, let's start the rooms 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.649
 obviously you did not have where 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:44.719
 get them since it's illegal the same 

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:47.089
 page we give you as a search for 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.399
 safari as you can see there was searched only 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:51.199
 we will automatically install some 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:53.479
 others as a test but of course not 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.429
 I recommend doing it since it is illegal here 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.249
 we're just going to show you how to 

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:58.939
 and also use it and you can too 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.649
 do what 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.659
 nothing more then it follows obviously is 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:04.800
 illegal to provide so do not ask me 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:07.580
 links for 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.400
 rooms sites or something 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.569
 but let's start we're going to give 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.729
 click on the first one that we find 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:17.150
 and a list of rooms will appear 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.950
 various 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:23.960
 so let's install whatever 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:26.320
 pokemon really am a fan of 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.320
 Pokemon 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.040
 we are going to stay where the 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:34.790
 download now 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.790
 we click 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:41.250
 once it is downloaded it will appear 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:44.639
 this is pokemon number of 6.6 mb and 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.319
 this option to open in the 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.620
 that you are going to select, they make you open 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:51.870
 in does not appear like that if you have 17 if 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.880
 it will look like this if you do not have 17 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.000
 it's going to look more or less like here 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.479
 I think but you have to give in 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 open in gba for ios what is this 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.889
 click is changed to the illuminator 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.949
 automatically and you already have the game in 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:10.050
 your list of roms you give click and see 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:13.050
 Well, very easily, you need a game 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.330
 it's very cool it really works very 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.430
 fast does not have any ship no I do not know 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.569
 has closed in a game has a 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:23.059
 treasure for self saved too 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.710
 you can see there I'm starting the game 

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:27.960
 I have an embroidered car 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.310
 you can play in landscape too 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.449
 obviously on an ipad or in a 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:35.030
 Larger device looks better 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:38.750
 but there is no 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:40.850
 the something that gets stuck 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.730
 here we are going to change it landscape to see 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.320
 if it works if you see the landscape change 

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.350
 seen only a larger screen 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.849
 it looks much better controls here 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:54.179
 are lr a p 

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:57.069
 and the lever that obviously is a 

00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:59.319
 virtual touchpad ok 

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:01.389
