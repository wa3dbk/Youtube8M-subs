00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.129

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.990
 inside me that really 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.120
 I needed to do a tribute from this 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.540

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.670
 it's up to you and the song to listen 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.840

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.070

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.900
 died and I finished it barely 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.480
 a week since I did not see myself with strength 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.900

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:39.910

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.300

 that we have until we lose it but 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.060

 side when you shake and sunbathe 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.730
 when I saw your eyes turned off I did not 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.490
 regret of having become what 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.490

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.040
 hand blaming me for not being able to 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.830
 having done everything to the memory we were 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.080
 together side by side on the other hand 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.690
