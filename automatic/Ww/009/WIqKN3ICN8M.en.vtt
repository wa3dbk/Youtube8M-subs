00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.030 

and<00:01:11.670> where<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.560> careful

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that they are looking really even and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.940 
that they are looking really even and
that<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.630> know<00:01:21.780> they're<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.110> matching<00:01:24.950> so

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
that you know they're really matching so

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.340 
that you know they're really matching so
here<00:01:26.820> I'm<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.210> adjusting<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.720> curtain<00:01:28.080> so

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
here I'm just adjusting the curtain so

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.470 
here I'm just adjusting the curtain so
you<00:01:28.440> don't<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:28.980> the<00:01:29.610> little<00:01:29.760> parts<00:01:30.180> where<00:01:30.450> I

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
you don't see the little parts where I

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.650 
you don't see the little parts where I
was<00:01:30.840> missing<00:01:31.320> some<00:01:31.560> material<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.220> guess<00:01:32.600> but<00:01:33.600> I

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
was missing some material I guess but I

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.570 
was missing some material I guess but I
think<00:01:33.870> it<00:01:34.140> works<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.470> well<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.010> it

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
think it works really well and it

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.910 
think it works really well and it
definitely<00:01:35.850> covers<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:37.020> my<00:01:37.350> nice<00:01:37.530> screen

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
definitely covers all my nice screen

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800 
definitely covers all my nice screen
grass<00:01:38.160> that<00:01:38.370> I<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.610> outside<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.330> it<00:01:39.420> looks<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
grass that I have outside and it looks a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.770 
grass that I have outside and it looks a
lot<00:01:40.200> spookier<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.480> whole

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
lot spookier and with that whole

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.870 
lot spookier and with that whole
Halloween<00:01:43.790> theme<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.090> I'm<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.450> for

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.060 

I<00:01:49.939> also<00:01:50.180> took<00:01:50.390> video<00:01:50.930> at<00:01:51.079> nighttime<00:01:51.320> I<00:01:51.770> think

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
I also took video at nighttime I think

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.560 
I also took video at nighttime I think
it<00:01:52.159> looks<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:52.549> much<00:01:52.579> better<00:01:52.759> because<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
it looks so much better because the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.660 
it looks so much better because the
light's<00:01:53.719> not<00:01:53.960> trying<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.409> shine<00:01:55.250> through<00:01:55.549> it

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
light's not trying to shine through it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.060 
light's not trying to shine through it
