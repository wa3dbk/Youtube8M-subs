is in my nature of the work the radio
needs<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.940> be<00:00:35.030> small<00:00:35.329> so<00:00:35.510> that<00:00:35.690> it's<00:00:35.989> not

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
needs to be small so that it's not

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.229 
needs to be small so that it's not

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
times when we communicator the luggage

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.469 
times when we communicator the luggage
Proteas<00:01:49.279> we<00:01:49.459> need<00:01:49.609> to<00:01:49.789> do<00:01:49.909> it<00:01:50.029> when<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.240> guests

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
Proteas we need to do it when the guests

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.580 
Proteas we need to do it when the guests
were<00:01:50.539> actually<00:01:50.749> standing<00:01:50.869> in<00:01:51.079> front<00:01:51.169> of<00:01:51.289> us<00:01:51.439> so

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
were actually standing in front of us so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.580 
were actually standing in front of us so
it's<00:01:52.179> difficult<00:01:53.179> to<00:01:53.509> do<00:01:53.599> it<00:01:53.719> in<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.959> in<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.409> subtle

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
it's difficult to do it in a in a subtle

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.399 
it's difficult to do it in a in a subtle
way<00:01:54.770> but<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:56.270> SL<00:01:56.599> series<00:01:56.779> really<00:01:57.079> helps<00:01:57.319> with

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
way but the SL series really helps with

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.979 
way but the SL series really helps with
that<00:01:57.590> because<00:01:57.770> it's<00:01:58.009> very<00:01:58.189> small<00:01:58.459> and<00:01:58.989> it's

00:01:59.979 --> 00:01:59.989 
that because it's very small and it's

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:02.229 
that because it's very small and it's
very<00:02:00.200> convenient<00:02:00.529> this<00:02:01.340> little<00:02:01.579> color<00:02:01.819> screen

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.239 
very convenient this little color screen

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:04.029 
very convenient this little color screen
is<00:02:02.389> a<00:02:02.419> big<00:02:02.899> improvement<00:02:03.049> on<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.739> radio

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
is a big improvement on this radio

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.280 
is a big improvement on this radio
that's<00:02:04.399> one<00:02:04.549> of<00:02:04.669> the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
that's one of the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.710 
that's one of the
we<00:02:05.500> need<00:02:05.680> now<00:02:06.340> we<00:02:06.400> can<00:02:06.760> read<00:02:06.970> pretty<00:02:07.240> much<00:02:07.360> the
