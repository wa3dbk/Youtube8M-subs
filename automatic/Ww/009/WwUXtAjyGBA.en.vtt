00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.300
 Hey-it's here to introduce this time 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:15.050
 Cree cherry blossom 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:18.980
 There is a description that 800 out of 1,000 lumens are famous in the adoption of kilo-Kelbi . 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:22.849
 It is LED light It is very bright diving light 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:28.130
 It is completely waterproof light It is said that water depth 60m correspondence for a while 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.289
 It is here of the tree falling asleep formula rather than a button type of the ordered 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.870
 The 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:38.080
 Very strong in the water pressure referred to as the on-off twist blankets this 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:39.760
 Kedomo has become the specifications in yea Maamu water is is not home completely waterproof Well two 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.820
 It of sounds is here compared 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.510
 General that is very bright and also here 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.170
 Certain brands that do it but things Sakura 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.500
 I would like to compare it's a little on land 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.210
 Well then 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.450
 that 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.340
 i don't go from this mode ball eyes, so it's easy to understand 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.340
 I will go from the mode description I will turn off once 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.300
 I would like to mode described with a little light in the yea yes now hybrid light 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.050
 But 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.050
 Here it is- 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.510
 Now when you get late 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.860
 Once in high mode 5 mode 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:28.900
 High middle low crash 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.560
 It is now high mode is sos mode file mode 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.190
 Here 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.890
 If you get twisted 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.810
 Obu 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:43.400
 Twist this again and you 're in high mode 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.790
 There is a mode memory function. It is a very smart live. 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.790
 off 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.530
 If you say that you want to change the mode you want 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.930
 It just was not paying attention and here Kedomo I this is here 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.780
 Clicks are clicks into place this well 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.740
 Kachikachi old prison mode 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.159
 Tick 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.670
 It is a strobe 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.700
 Quick click and sos mode 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.170
 Yes So for example sos acting blindly 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.439
 I 'll erase that now 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.640
 I erased 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:21.790
 I still have a little time to put it in place and I will not buy it again 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:28.120
 Starting from sos mode 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.140
 Since you have been to the beach need I Ano over stars only in that most of it is yeah particular mode 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.519
 I think that is not 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.830
 I think there are many people who only use high mode, but that is the combination now 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.380
 Ne 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.270
 To ask them cut 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.760
 Something if you say e also give way 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.849
 It is said that it starts from a little high mode 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.890
 Very to say that this code benefit function is especially Takeda 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:53.000
 I think that is the point I got immediately 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.600
 So I would like to do some kind of irradiation experiment on the track, but first of all 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.240
 This general 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.470
 Fe bb is coming 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.470
 There is a step 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.849
 The difference raw feet 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.849
 This is of 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.680
 Not general 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.030
 Day 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.270
 Kotake is different 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.960
 If figar is not common 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.680
 I think you can see the obvious difference here too 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.210
 It's not so light, but this is different too 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.730
 Now Hano 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:34.400
 I'm coming to add that flower holder 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:36.990
 That face is about 7 meters wide and he is a woman on the other side 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.100
 It lights up that this is not general now 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.200
 Although 10m about two Neokaa has in light of decided that the sides or rather hill to pull from this 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.700
 It does not go 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.400
 Krill 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.440
 It is clear and such a thing 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.050
 General said 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.590
 free 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.040
 Which is it now 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.830
 On land, there is only this difference 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.990
 I think you can understand 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:07.540
 Anyway, it's just a feature anyway 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:15.000
 That's completely waterproof and it's ok up to 60 meters so it's actually a bit on the face 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:15.000
 Only the old ones who want to javelin 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.590
 Here 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.660
 Follow 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:31.830
 White and WoW five 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.830
 I have a little put I'd have is that 30 centimeters Kanechotto flow 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.529
 This kind of feeling Is course 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.999
 30 centimeters place removes two people 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:43.470
 It is 800lm in water and very bright 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:45.270
 It is a perfume 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.930
 Pas nature 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.069
 It is not an extremely good environment 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:56.710
 Until I only this Ya also like a laser beam 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.710
 I think in light and What is not it become you can see 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.650
 Well snorkeling and the rich are diving 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.650
 I think it is useful 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.430
 Well, in the medium to narrow the high mode is ne bush 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.430
 Amulet when you get it twisted 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:22.500
 From the mode that I want to see again 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.940
 I can light up the sake and buy alcohol already 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.390
 Is 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.770
 Waiting for arrival etc 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:34.700
 I think it would be nice to have a waist but very bright 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:39.980
 It is this light, so don't irradiate directly to that person 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:44.080
 I think if you can go inside mode description and underwater show car 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.080
 Thank you very much for closing
