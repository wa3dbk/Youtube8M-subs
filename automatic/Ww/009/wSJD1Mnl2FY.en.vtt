00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:14.700
 Hello, today's video will be 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:18.560
 interesting and it is impossible all of course speech 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.910
 will go about yusbi 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.539
 wires and 2 miles as I call 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:31.700
 or rather to say about what they are from 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:35.950
 made some time ago I acquired 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:41.440
 phone lenovo will not hide the company and 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.440
 with him the show is such a wire 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:01:03.449
 show closer think there can be seen well wire 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.449
 from lenovo and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:19.899
 noticed an interesting fact here for me 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:21.660
 comparison took a few wires this 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.670
 less lesbian 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:29.259
 one another or the edge likes by the way too 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.450
 wire purchased with the phone 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.229
 or otherwise 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.380
 this is what i showed lenovo it at me 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.950
 there was a wire with a crib 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:47.799
 with all adapters 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:50.970
 me another wire less love and wire 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.790
 from samsung 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.930
 the most interesting fact I noticed then 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.479
 when my kids played nir with ears and 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.770
 they themselves on one of the toys magnet 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.259
 attended one fine moment 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.069
 my wire from lenovo and all the toys 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.730
 just stuck to me this 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:20.110
 of course there was no small news because 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.519
 how I was interested in this question and I 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.040
 I decided to check several of them 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:28.120
 all sorts of different wires i want them 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.720
 checks found a neodymium magnet so 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.620
 called here he is here on the tip 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.860
 Bishop file check 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.190
 wire here to compare whether immediately take 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.910
 wire on you 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.910
 doing this experience 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.489
 see the wire in the middle 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.489
 magnet 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.120
 that is, what does it mean that 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.140
 the wire is not made from non-ferrous metal but 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.400
 from iron 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.560
 ordinary which magicians for 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.739
 compare take other wires I'm all 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.540
 what wires i had in the arena house 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.120
 all of them are many but keep in mind that 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:19.030
 those which I often used all 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:22.989
 wires checked none more wire 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.989
 does not stick 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.150
 and this as you see has a property 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.720
 to stick 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.780
 that is, the Chinese have already reached the point that 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.959
 began to make wires with 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.560
 ordinary iron 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:54.010
 I understand that there can be made of iron 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:59.410
 right but it suggests that if 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.540
 inside metal live not passed through 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.890
 that is, sooner or later I will have to 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.739
 buy new wire 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.650
 yulki to connect to 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.080
 phone 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.230
 maybe yes here the cross section is better well i 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.590
 I would not say that this suggests that 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.139
 this is a wire of better quality even 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:25.960
 the simplest the cheapest chinese 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:29.590
 wires but the manufacturer company is not 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.630
 Nova has reached such perfect 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.630
 started making wires regret something 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.030
 resilience 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.430
 the iron wire is five times higher 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:48.590
 resistance than copper wire 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:51.880
 there is not 5 there is 4.8 orography 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.740
 here and so saves even on it 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.130
 seemingly elementary wire should 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.020
 be 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:02.420
 flexible soft and durable but due to 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.140
 In order that the metal of the tape 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.100
 wire 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:10.130
 will not be as durable as 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.670
 elemental copper wire in principle 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.930
 all that I wanted to tell show 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.520
 convey to you 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.680
 if interested you can check at home 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.600
 its wires if the wire is taken on 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:29.540
 magnet means he i'm more than sure 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.700
 his life will be much lower 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.330
 than in copper wires 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:39.740
 but for comparison here this wire 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:43.070
 samsung is about 7 years old and he is still 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.820
 working and working i'm more than sure 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.830
 that copper wires bend at all 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.060
 the rest is more enduring than 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:57.460
 metal alive 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.460
 Thank you all for your attention to new meetings
