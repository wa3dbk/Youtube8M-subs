dialogue<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:06.950> might<00:02:07.130> not<00:02:07.310> sound<00:02:07.880> just<00:02:08.270> like

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
dialogue I might not sound just like

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.449 
dialogue I might not sound just like
Jack<00:02:08.750> obviously<00:02:09.440> but<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.649> think<00:02:09.739> I<00:02:10.190> sound

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
Jack obviously but I think I sound

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.949 
Jack obviously but I think I sound
pretty<00:02:10.520> similar<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.060> Jack<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.420> mean<00:02:11.690> I've<00:02:11.810> done

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
pretty similar to Jack I mean I've done

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.290 
pretty similar to Jack I mean I've done
voice<00:02:12.200> impressions<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:12.920> him<00:02:13.520> on<00:02:13.790> my<00:02:13.940> channel

as<00:02:35.299> well

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
as well

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.059 
as well
just<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.319> can<00:02:36.409> see<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.709> little<00:02:36.920> bit<00:02:37.010> of

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
just so you can see a little bit of

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.490 
just so you can see a little bit of
gameplay<00:02:37.390> on<00:02:38.390> how<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.659> all<00:02:38.750> works<00:02:38.989> but<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.260> think

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
gameplay on how it all works but I think

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.289 
gameplay on how it all works but I think
this<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.769> for<00:02:40.010> PC<00:02:40.400> only<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.790> don't<00:02:40.879> think<00:02:41.180> this

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
this is for PC only I don't think this

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.720 
this is for PC only I don't think this
will<00:02:41.450> work<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.870> consoles<00:02:42.439> which<00:02:43.010> kind<00:02:43.640> of

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
will work on consoles which kind of

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.759 
will work on consoles which kind of
sucks<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.269> ask<00:02:44.450> me<00:02:44.690> but<00:02:44.989> anyways<00:02:45.440> let's

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
sucks if you ask me but anyways let's

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.830 
sucks if you ask me but anyways let's
get<00:02:45.950> right<00:02:46.190> into<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.579> footage<00:02:46.909> so<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.420> guys

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
get right into the footage so you guys

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.660 
get right into the footage so you guys
are<00:02:48.019> probably<00:02:48.170> wondering<00:02:48.950> what<00:02:49.310> does<00:02:49.519> this

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
are probably wondering what does this

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.399 
are probably wondering what does this
grenade<00:02:50.000> mod<00:02:50.180> do<00:02:50.420> what's<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:50.930> special<00:02:51.200> about

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
grenade mod do what's so special about

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.530 
grenade mod do what's so special about
it<00:02:51.590> apart<00:02:52.099> from<00:02:52.310> well<00:02:52.730> playing<00:02:53.150> custom

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
it apart from well playing custom

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.630 
it apart from well playing custom
dialogue<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.200> that's<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.440> good<00:02:54.560> question<00:02:55.099> once

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
dialogue and that's a good question once

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.250 
dialogue and that's a good question once
you<00:02:55.760> throw<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.120> grenade<00:02:56.359> mod<00:02:56.540> out<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:57.109> will

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
you throw the grenade mod out it will

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.589 
you throw the grenade mod out it will
create<00:02:57.500> an<00:02:57.680> antigravity<00:02:58.099> field<00:02:58.760> which<00:02:59.090> sounds

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
create an antigravity field which sounds

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.470 
create an antigravity field which sounds
pretty<00:02:59.810> badass<00:03:00.170> right<00:03:00.769> it<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.640> it's<00:03:02.060> really

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
pretty badass right it is it's really

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.110 
pretty badass right it is it's really
badass<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.340> anything<00:03:04.340> caught<00:03:04.579> within<00:03:04.819> this

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
badass and anything caught within this

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.170 
badass and anything caught within this
anti-gravity<00:03:05.900> field<00:03:06.109> well<00:03:06.609> yeah<00:03:07.609> pretty<00:03:08.060> much

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
anti-gravity field well yeah pretty much

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.089 
anti-gravity field well yeah pretty much
float<00:03:08.690> away<00:03:08.840> as<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.319> can<00:03:09.470> see<00:03:09.650> here<00:03:09.859> in<00:03:09.980> this

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
float away as you can see here in this

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.280 
float away as you can see here in this

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
this anti-gravity field they will still

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.430 
this anti-gravity field they will still
be<00:03:18.139> stunned<00:03:18.500> but<00:03:19.159> they<00:03:19.340> won't<00:03:19.609> float<00:03:20.120> away<00:03:20.299> and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440

mod will also not be able to shoot you
for<00:03:44.359> a<00:03:44.389> short<00:03:44.480> time<00:03:44.930> this<00:03:45.260> is<00:03:45.410> really<00:03:45.440> really

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
for a short time this is really really

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.970 
for a short time this is really really
awesome<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:47.019> slightly<00:03:48.019> overpowered<00:03:48.739> but

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
awesome and slightly overpowered but

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.300 
awesome and slightly overpowered but
still<00:03:49.400> really<00:03:49.699> awesome<00:03:50.859> it's<00:03:51.859> really<00:03:51.889> similar

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
still really awesome it's really similar

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.409 
still really awesome it's really similar
to<00:03:52.430> lilith<00:03:53.269> days<00:03:53.870> skill<00:03:54.349> or<00:03:55.120> there's<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.180> couple

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
to lilith days skill or there's a couple

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.750 
to lilith days skill or there's a couple
other<00:03:56.569> skills<00:03:56.959> that<00:03:57.079> kind<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.709> have<00:03:57.889> the<00:03:58.190> you

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
other skills that kind of have the you

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.689 
other skills that kind of have the you
know<00:03:58.849> similar<00:03:59.299> ability<00:04:00.010> where<00:04:01.010> when<00:04:01.609> you

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:01.699 
know similar ability where when you

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.030 
know similar ability where when you
shoot<00:04:01.910> them<00:04:02.180> they<00:04:02.569> lose<00:04:02.959> accuracy<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:03.889> they

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
shoot them they lose accuracy and they

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.530 
shoot them they lose accuracy and they
slow<00:04:04.340> down<00:04:04.579> for<00:04:04.879> a<00:04:04.940> short<00:04:05.150> period<00:04:05.359> of<00:04:05.480> time

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
slow down for a short period of time

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.869 
slow down for a short period of time
kind<00:04:06.349> of<00:04:06.440> similar<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.739> that<00:04:07.010> now<00:04:07.400> as<00:04:07.639> you<00:04:07.760> can

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
kind of similar to that now as you can

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.339 
kind of similar to that now as you can
see<00:04:07.940> in<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:08.269> footage<00:04:08.480> I<00:04:08.840> just<00:04:09.049> launched

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
see in this footage I just launched

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.439 
see in this footage I just launched
myself<00:04:09.530> up<00:04:09.980> on<00:04:10.099> this<00:04:10.159> building<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:10.940> created

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
myself up on this building and created

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.110 
myself up on this building and created
myself<00:04:11.629> a<00:04:12.169> vantage<00:04:12.560> point<00:04:12.799> with<00:04:13.310> this<00:04:13.579> with

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
myself a vantage point with this with

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.670 
myself a vantage point with this with
this<00:04:14.269> grenade<00:04:14.540> mod<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.989> neutrino<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.620> I

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
this grenade mod the neutrino and I

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.490 
this grenade mod the neutrino and I
think<00:04:15.980> that's<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.209> first<00:04:17.449> time<00:04:17.630> actually

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
think that's the first time actually

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.170 
think that's the first time actually
saying<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:19.010> name<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.400> this<00:04:19.519> grenade<00:04:19.909> mod

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
saying the name of this grenade mod

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.960 
saying the name of this grenade mod
sorry<00:04:20.870> mister<00:04:21.289> games<00:04:21.500> I<00:04:21.650> should<00:04:21.949> have<00:04:22.729> said<00:04:22.849> at

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
sorry mister games I should have said at

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.040 
sorry mister games I should have said at
the<00:04:23.060> beginning<00:04:23.419> but<00:04:23.510> yeah<00:04:23.690> that's<00:04:23.870> how<00:04:23.990> you

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
the beginning but yeah that's how you

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.570 
the beginning but yeah that's how you
pronounce<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.680> neutrino<00:04:25.130> I<00:04:25.159> don't<00:04:25.460> even

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
pronounce it the neutrino I don't even

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.339 
pronounce it the neutrino I don't even
really<00:04:26.090> get<00:04:26.300> what<00:04:26.449> that<00:04:26.479> means<00:04:26.810> but<00:04:27.139> I'm

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
really get what that means but I'm

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:28.899 
really get what that means but I'm
guessing<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.919> has<00:04:28.070> something<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.430> do<00:04:28.639> with<00:04:28.729> low

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:28.909 
guessing it has something to do with low

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:30.750 
guessing it has something to do with low
gravity<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.539> think<00:04:29.990> it's<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.229> beast<00:04:30.440> name

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
gravity I think it's a beast name

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.460 
gravity I think it's a beast name
anyways<00:04:31.760> yeah<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.240> pretty<00:04:32.900> much<00:04:33.020> created

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
anyways yeah I pretty much created

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.440 
anyways yeah I pretty much created
myself<00:04:33.889> a<00:04:34.039> vantage<00:04:34.430> point<00:04:34.820> you<00:04:34.909> can<00:04:35.210> launch

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
myself a vantage point you can launch

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.810 
myself a vantage point you can launch
yourself<00:04:35.960> really<00:04:36.800> high<00:04:37.039> up<00:04:37.219> in<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.490> air<00:04:37.700> if

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
yourself really high up in the air if

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.980 
yourself really high up in the air if
you<00:04:37.909> just<00:04:38.060> throw<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.360> down<00:04:38.389> in<00:04:38.630> your<00:04:38.659> feet

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
you just throw it down in your feet

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.420 
you just throw it down in your feet
don't<00:04:39.289> jump<00:04:39.710> that<00:04:40.010> will

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
don't jump that will

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.270 
don't jump that will
block<00:04:40.759> out<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:42.350> effect<00:04:42.710> but<00:04:42.889> if<00:04:43.009> you<00:04:43.100> just

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
block out the the effect but if you just

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.249 
block out the the effect but if you just
stand<00:04:43.639> there<00:04:43.729> you<00:04:44.240> can<00:04:44.419> launch<00:04:44.600> yourself<00:04:44.750> to

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
stand there you can launch yourself to

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.680 
stand there you can launch yourself to
new<00:04:45.800> heights<00:04:46.009> but<00:04:46.820> yeah<00:04:47.210> guys<00:04:47.449> I<00:04:47.630> think

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
new heights but yeah guys I think

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.270 
new heights but yeah guys I think
that'll<00:04:48.020> pretty<00:04:48.169> much<00:04:48.259> wrap<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.830> up<00:04:48.949> for<00:04:49.160> this

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
that'll pretty much wrap it up for this

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.330 
that'll pretty much wrap it up for this
