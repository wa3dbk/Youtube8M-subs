00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.130
 hello today we will do 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.860
 polastik beads and earrings from polymer 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.230
 clay master class provided Natalia 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.890
 for work we need polymer 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.309
 clay 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:18.460
 here we took fimo white clay 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.449
 turquoise number 32 and chocolate you in 75 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.460
 sharp blade rolling pin or pasta machine 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.289
 Bead Calibration Mold 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.560
 brush or salt to give texture 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.789
 beads separator 1 2 white leaves 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.469
 paper for work surface 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.510
 cut off the right amount of plastic and 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.969
 matter transition color white brown 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.010
 white turquoise 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.769
 then the resulting layer fold 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.609
 we roll a thin long tape we roll 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.530
 sausage so that white was inside 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.989
 we get the resulting sausage slightly to 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.049
 each became about 10 dead 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.489
 centimeters cut swam edges 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.829
 we cut them across into 2 parts 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.350
 then cut each sausage along another 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.720
 four pieces 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.280
 the first way to make beads we take 4 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.560
 pieces of brown 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.960
 compress zubakov code on fold 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.270
 next to one of the parts of the turquoise 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.540
 colors are cut into two parts as well 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.380
 squeeze and lay out squeeze up 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.890
 all sides 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.420
 shrink cut into 2 3 parts 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.340
 fold again squeeze cut 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.860
 floated edge and get the first 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.730
 sausage as the final result here 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.730
 such a bead 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.520
 the second way to make beads we do everything 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.700
 same thing just don't compress the parts with 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.760
 the sides and lay out as in the video order 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.860
 we press cut we fold again 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.890
 we get such a sausage 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.720
 and then beads to make it more comfortable 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.150
 beads can be slightly squeezed 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.760
 the sausage on the sides of the base do 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.400
 oval bead now left to bake 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.070
 poshlifovat of varnish and assemble 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.970
 any of them like this 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.550
 beauty 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.850
 Thank you for your attention and creative to you 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.850
