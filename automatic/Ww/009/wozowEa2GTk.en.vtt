 independent of the independent type of 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.730
 Type 1 diabetic 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.289
 independent of being type 2 diabetic I 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.520
 I want to chat with you 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.630
 about the importance of you 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.680
 eliminate from your life 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.330
 throw in the trash even the most fats 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.000
 I already told you in another video about good 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.500
 fats you should use now 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.210
 This video I want to talk about fats 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.899
 What do you have to take out of your life? 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.170
 you are diabetic and is already with his 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.910
 body is all diabetic is with a cup 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.820
 inflamed I do not usually say that 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.230
 included in my training was 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.940
 internet is that uncontrolled diabetes 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.940
 I'll go into details about it there . 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.649
 It is important for you to deflate your 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.809
 body because people who have type 2 diabetes 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.170
 mainly in type 1 also more 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.670
 type 2 is 90 percent of diabetics in the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.350
 Brazil today they have inflamed body 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.450
 has a condition that is called 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.670
 resistance to insulin then resistance 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.439
 to insulin what is the cell your body 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.810
 are inflamed they do not receive the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.850
 glucose does not open almost gets in excess 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.930
 circulating through the body and insulin 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.580
 not enough 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.170
 the function of insulin is to put it runs 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.750
 into the cell then when the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.299
 Celtic resistant and it does not 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.860
 glucose is toxic to your body 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.619
 you accompanying the channel should already have 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 Heard about it, I'm not talking about 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.689
 this in other videos but it's always good 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.030
 remember that glucose access is toxic and 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.820
 the more fats also ignite your 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.820
 body and increases insulin resistance 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.829
 keeps the liver inflamed and this is very 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.340
 good and what are these bad fats 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.619
 doctor rock can ask the fats 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.350
 The main ones are those that are 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.750
 unfortunately the best-selling are taken 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.250
 like the good guy are actually villain who 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.060
 are the polyunsaturated fats which 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.320
 are they 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.020
 those eyes there you see in 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.690
 supermarket to the hills, and most 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.590
 of homes in Brazil have these oil eyes 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.470
 soybean oil the team 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.780
 the cotton oil finally these eyes that 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.010
 are made from vegetable seeds are 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.950
 Polyunsaturated vegetable oils are eyes 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.069
 which are for your health risk 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.970
 they inflame your body they worse or 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.980
 diabetes 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.540
 they inflame their child and thus form 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.819
 cells of your body 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.299
 so you should avoid those eyes 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.099
 also avoid margarine which is a type 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.140
 of vegetable oil 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.970
 the margarine the terrible food nor 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.760
 would call food ne 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.739
 I would call it an abomination. 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.420
 absurd you have to use butter 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.450
 milk instead of margarine 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.040
 use the butter to cook use oil 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.530
 coconut if you can to cook in the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.930
 place of those eyes there that is much better 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.610
 even the lard is an excellent 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.569
 cooking option 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.489
 I say that there is in other videos of 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.269
 channel can search where you will 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.900
 meet 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.540
 then it is to take away those fats 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.420
 Another terrible bad thing is 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.549
 trans fat trans fats that are 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.000
 present on the hills in these foods there 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.079
 biscuit stuffed in these foods 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.630
 mainly shorter and industrial 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.780
 hissing is food the various foods 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.310
 light whole foods is 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.090
 especially those of the cases 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.359
 cisco enrollment wanted these 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:44.280
 cookies that kind of these cakes 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:45.750
 several ne brauns is full of is this 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.919
 type of fat that I open trance 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.530
 trans fat 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:52.319
 she is terrible inflamed oxy cells 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.329
 besides worse information for you that is 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.470
 diabetics want to get better 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.359
 this evil, right? 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.430
 and for you who want to take a step further 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.220
 For you, what you want is just 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.530
 transformation from today I created 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.620
 a training based on studies of 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.450
 high level of scientific evidence 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.880
 largest universities in the world are 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.849
 as Harvard University to see the 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.769
 California is already used in countries 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.560
 first world as sweden one 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.770
