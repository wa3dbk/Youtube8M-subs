which I hope they can you know tweak it
out<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.289> basically<00:00:25.289> polish<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> usable

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
out and basically polish it to a usable

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.220 
out and basically polish it to a usable
vegetable<00:00:28.830> State<00:00:29.039> usable<00:00:29.580> state<00:00:30.050> let's<00:00:31.050> check

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
vegetable State usable state let's check

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.500 
vegetable State usable state let's check
it<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:33.260> yes<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.500> likes<00:00:34.710> quite<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> bit<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.550> as

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it out yes it likes quite a bit and as

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.420 
it out yes it likes quite a bit and as
you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.750> see<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.960> even<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.800> were<00:00:38.280> really

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you can see that even if you were really

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.920 
you can see that even if you were really
quick<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.030> won't<00:00:39.180> really<00:00:39.510> be<00:00:39.600> that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
quick that it won't really be that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.500 
quick that it won't really be that
responsive<00:00:41.210> finishing<00:00:42.210> go<00:00:42.300> slow<00:00:44.510> basically

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
responsive finishing go slow basically

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.490 
responsive finishing go slow basically
you<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.930> leprosy<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.820> this<00:00:47.820> creates

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
you know the leprosy so this creates

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.729 
you know the leprosy so this creates
like<00:00:49.500> alternative<00:00:51.050> basically<00:00:52.050> widgets<00:00:52.559> or

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
like alternative basically widgets or

like alternative basically widgets or
icons<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> okay<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.590> example<00:00:56.070> let's<00:00:57.739> go

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
icons and so okay for example let's go

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.569 
icons and so okay for example let's go
to<00:00:58.859> photos<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.859> go<00:01:01.949> back<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.190> forth

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579

to photos and you can go back and forth
through<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.460> but<00:01:05.460> besides<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.960> you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110

there's<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.799> scrollable<00:01:33.500> like<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.680> guess<00:01:34.890> this

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
there's a scrollable like I guess this

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.210

a<00:01:48.899> little<00:01:49.079> bit<00:01:49.259> buggy<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.750> believe<00:01:52.520> if

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
a little bit buggy but I believe if

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.410 
a little bit buggy but I believe if
these<00:01:54.329> little<00:01:54.689> bugs<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:58.189> fixed

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.620 

don't<00:02:01.750> really<00:02:02.110> be<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.680> good<00:02:03.189> alternative

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
don't really be a good alternative

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.760 
don't really be a good alternative
launcher<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.280> let's<00:02:06.490> go<00:02:06.610> back<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:07.560> not<00:02:08.560> the

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
launcher so let's go back to not the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.070 
launcher so let's go back to not the
wallpapers<00:02:09.539> let's<00:02:10.539> go<00:02:10.750> back<00:02:11.340> okay<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:15.340> has

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
wallpapers let's go back okay so it has

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.360 
wallpapers let's go back okay so it has
your<00:02:17.080> recent<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:18.120> guess<00:02:19.120> launched<00:02:20.110> amps<00:02:20.980> which

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
your recent I guess launched amps which

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.760 
your recent I guess launched amps which
are<00:02:21.550> those<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.900> recently<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.590> you've

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
are those that recently that you've

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.240 
are those that recently that you've
previously<00:02:24.130> used<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.940> last<00:02:25.150> ones<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.250> it

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
previously used the last ones so it

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.240 
previously used the last ones so it
shows<00:02:27.489> that<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:28.540> shows<00:02:28.870> what's<00:02:29.769> running<00:02:30.069> in

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
shows that it shows what's running in

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.690 
shows that it shows what's running in
the<00:02:30.340> background<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:33.040> that's<00:02:33.250> running<00:02:33.489> in<00:02:33.640> the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
the background so that's running in the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.050 
the background so that's running in the
background<00:02:34.620> fire<00:02:35.620> breath<00:02:35.890> also<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> video

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
background fire breath also the video

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.170 
background fire breath also the video
which<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:37.870> think<00:02:38.110> it's<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.290> really<00:02:38.319> good<00:02:39.180> really

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
which I think it's a really good really

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.479 
which I think it's a really good really
good<00:02:41.040> idea<00:02:42.870> for<00:02:43.870> it's<00:02:44.049> more<00:02:44.260> like<00:02:44.410> a

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
good idea for it's more like a

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.710 
good idea for it's more like a
multitasking<00:02:45.870> 3d<00:02:47.069> thing<00:02:48.069> that<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.209> guess<00:02:49.540> they

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
multitasking 3d thing that I guess they

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.890 
multitasking 3d thing that I guess they
were<00:02:49.840> trying<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.140> do<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.760> let's<00:02:52.000> say<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.600> watch

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
were trying to do so let's say is watch

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.009 
were trying to do so let's say is watch

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
you go back it restarts so these are the

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.729 
you go back it restarts so these are the
little<00:03:19.959> bug<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.410> has<00:03:20.470> button<00:03:21.070> it's<00:03:21.609> pretty

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
little bug that has button it's pretty

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.699 
little bug that has button it's pretty
it's<00:03:23.739> pretty<00:03:23.859> it's<00:03:24.430> pretty<00:03:24.519> good<00:03:25.560> pretty<00:03:26.560> good

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
it's pretty it's pretty good pretty good

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:37.600 
it's pretty it's pretty good pretty good
idea<00:03:28.140> from<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.200> same<00:03:29.470> action<00:03:29.799> scenes

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.280 

so<00:03:38.930> that's<00:03:39.930> one<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:41.150> good<00:03:42.150> ideas<00:03:43.050> that<00:03:43.260> I

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
so that's one of the good ideas that I

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.540

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
thought this launcher had you can also

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.150 
thought this launcher had you can also
stream<00:03:48.270> music<00:03:49.020> but<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:51.030> internet<00:03:51.480> and

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
stream music but is the internet and
