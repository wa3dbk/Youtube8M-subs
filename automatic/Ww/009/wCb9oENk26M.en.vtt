 first time all this having passed the version 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.120
 hem can be found in detail on the Internet 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.680
 we can tell in general how 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.640
 we said in the previous series 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 on the territory of finland europe and russia 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.950
 the glacier ruled a huge thickness was 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.140
 that's two kilometers 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.900
 where the Baltic Sea is now at all 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.759
 very showed further pushing and then 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.180
 did well really just was white 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.549
 covered 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.740
 in addition to supplies, he pushed through 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.350
 the ground has happened to him a century of trouble 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.000
 he set yes but not until the last days 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 ended about 10,000 years ago everything 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.780
 became so rule will come nigga from 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.040
 which kilometer thickness is above all 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.920
 year in seedlings 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.570
 and arrested three of the enemy in the region 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240
 a central chatter formed a lake 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.979
 with freshwater lake because they 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.170
 connected the family to who else got 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.600
 Baltic for and then it increased 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.600
 in size because water performed 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.579
 here and it burst towards the ocean there 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.320
 where now give yes and analysis is 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.620
 connected with the ocean with failed 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.560
 sea ​​baltic sea 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.810
 it was a few times this how it all 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.710
 was happening it was not on its young 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.400
 the main thing that you 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.590
 lake palms I'm 35 years ago 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.310
 she connected she was fucked pin 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.920
 us scene 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.960
 but then the land that was freed from 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.960
 she connected the neighborhood vyborg it was 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.770
 the strait of land but the land freed from 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.620
 oppression of the enemy glacier after succeeds 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.050
 she started up as a trap Marat 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.150
 would yes because they didn't pressure the question and in 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.280
 the result of this is that marine bundle 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.680
 which connected succeeded again gordon 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.630
 duct as it rose and ceased 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.640
 exist in general and the Baltic became 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.550
 tomorrow there will be a lake for a while 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.040

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.540
 2 you took out a closed lake and in it 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.340
 already flooded large enough 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.810
 number of rivers all the same yes nothing 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.360
 flowed nothing flowed she 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.950
 naturally as 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.700
 performed gold instruments climbed 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.290
 12 meters and at this time 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.970
 rivers ha she fell into the palm of the river tosna 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.970
 as far as I remember and zhora she fell for 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.970
 present 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.549
 nga vlada river was ricotta pillar here 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.670
 that is, they are like this 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.250
 spread out and in the middle was a passage and 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.349
 new lake level has risen and in the area 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.390
 Here are the local peoples of the world know in the area 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.450
 gratifying held pleasantly water in St. Petersburg 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.840
 on all the same broke the defense reports to and 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.560
 and I joined in the Baltic Sea there through lonely in 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.170
 The Gulf of Finland 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.940
 it turned out the river Neva and actually from here 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.040
 we can even suggest the name of the river 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.220
 where did it come from there are two options either 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.970
 it is from the word new new 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.370
 this is hello they are not European words she 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.950

 as there is anger swamps it swamps the same 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.760
 place with a really marsh 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.500
 and but this is all really happening in 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.560

 pins life there exactly relative 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.970
 if etymology 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.319
 the origin of the word is Indo-European 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.900
 it seems, and yes, respectively 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.699
