00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.480
 and for starters, I'm just about disinfecting 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.240
 areas around the brows and directly 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.130
 under the hairs myself now i take my 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.600
 a mixing palette you can take 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.090
 saucer and well and easy 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.670
 please tarof that stomp mix it 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.949
 the whole thing is squeezing one centimeter 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.329
 product and now by one centimeter 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.890
 paint me need 3 drops 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.550
 oxidant 3 percent I have it 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.700
 cream 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.700
 mix and all well using 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.660
 wand that was in the set now 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.399
 I type products on a brush I begin 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.300
 to put 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:53.219
 mid eyebrows just so eyebrow looks 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.020
 in the end, more natural that is there 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.850
 the paint will last longer 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.440
 and eyebrows will be colored the most 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.660
 as you see now I have everything pretty 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.150
 zamek it now I take a cotton swab 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.630
 and correct so this form is not 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.400
 need top now draw the tip 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.659
 eyebrows can not particularly stand on ceremony 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.500
 and apply thick then add 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.500
 adjust 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.780
 but I marked my eyebrow shape not 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.060
 scared what it looks like now 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.430
 it will not be intense because 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.380
 brown dark just coloring should 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.330
 act for it i wore fat 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.000
 layer now i'll start filling the second one 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.189
 eyebrow and looking at how much time I have 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.259
 will go maybe I have a little bit with him 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.259
 colors from the beginning of this eyebrow 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.200
 I am starting to wash her first eyebrows 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.050
 beginnings 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.209
 did it about the usual wadded disk 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.950
 moistened with water and the tip of my eyebrow i will give 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.410
 just a little bit all the time for painting 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:25.680
 now true cotton pad and completely 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.630
 I could because I have blond hair 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.940
 always afraid to overdo it and therefore 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.100
 I wash it off a little earlier it seems to me 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.080
 I have enough intensity at all 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.989
 paint can give even more intense 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.239
 the result is even darker 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.940
 hold now I will paint the eyelashes 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.130
 I will take cotton disks and scissors 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.100
 cotton disc on 2 halves take red 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.010
 I take a black paint squeeze a centimeter 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.680
 diluted with three droplets of oxidant and 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.239
 I mix with a stick which was 1 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.519
 now I put petroleum jelly under my eyes to 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.640
 not stain the skin around the eyes will have to 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.700
 to apply paint on the eyelashes I 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.880
 wetted these halves of vodkin cotton 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.360
 drive and now attach them as you can 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.130
 closer to the forester row in principle you we 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.370
 we can bend to any shape that is 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.440
 make a small arc life so i 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.090
 attached a very strange sensation in 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.519
 Generally what is my method 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.310
 I'm taking this one step to take my knitting 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.359
 a palette on which there is paint and 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.700
 here are such movements and you are completely 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:38.430
 I fill the brush to this tools 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.900
 paint and start painting the eyelashes as 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.900
 I do n't usually paint them mascara 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.580
 I try of course you do as you can 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.950
 be careful not to get the paint in 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.620
 eyes and cilia flathead eyebrows i 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.110
 still see the paint throughout 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.090
 ten minutes well I applied my 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.450
 improvise coziness ears in the second eye 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.940
 also 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.410
 and now I will wait about 7 8 minutes to 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.810
 paint on action 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.790
 it took eight minutes and it's time to wash 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.730
 I usually have all this beauty 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.959
 wash off just by running water and 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.060
 using some kind of gel for 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.970
 washing which usually wash off 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.340
 cosmetics and 35 now I will do it and 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.290
 come back to the eyelashes look like now I 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.770
 I do not know how much you can see 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.710
 the difference I certainly see her in the mirror 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.760
 eyelashes have become much darker and 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.669
 I usually like it more 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:37.570
 emphasize aid for viralki i usually 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:39.250
 I use this same for several times 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.410
 my mind the difference was noticeable were very 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.740
 like the result and then curling eyelashes 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.410
 then they stand out strongly in Tobol and 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.840
 now tell you a couple in which you are me 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.200
 asked about these paints paints on 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.260
 actually give intense color that is 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.210
 well ask for hairs throughout 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.460
 ten minutes if you keep them 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.130
 either direct or on the eyelashes we have 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.770
 for it on dye it and this intense 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.140
 the result is the following as you see the tube 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.930
 not very big here 15 milliliters 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.270
 but it's enough for a long time I used on 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.520
 throughout the summer and making 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.970
 painting not only yourself but also your 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.830
 close that is enough for a long time red 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.690
 in fact well and probably the most 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.760
 all questions of interest so long 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.310
 keeps the result at me he holds 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.910
 approximately part of a month and a half then 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.340
 eat through one and a half 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.920
 heart can be painted with new again 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.140
 I really like it that color update 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.120
 I can at home anytime now 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.980
 color or or eyebrows and eyelashes 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.800
 so I advise you to try because 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.840
 that it is completely simple and principle 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.060
 absolutely not expensive thank you so much for 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.650
 attention and while the girls see each other in 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.300
 next video ask your questions 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.260
 if you still have them 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.260
