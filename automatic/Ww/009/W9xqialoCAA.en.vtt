time and stuff in these let's plays

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.930 
time and stuff in these let's plays
because<00:07:26.040> I'm<00:07:26.220> pretty<00:07:26.430> much<00:07:26.460> just<00:07:26.550> going<00:07:26.790> to<00:07:26.850> be

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 
because I'm pretty much just going to be

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.720 
because I'm pretty much just going to be
doing<00:07:27.090> a<00:07:27.270> bunch<00:07:27.480> of<00:07:27.680> segments<00:07:28.680> at<00:07:29.160> once<00:07:29.490> and

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:29.730 
doing a bunch of segments at once and

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.490 
doing a bunch of segments at once and
then<00:07:29.850> I'll<00:07:29.910> just<00:07:29.940> divide<00:07:30.150> them<00:07:30.419> up<00:07:30.480> into<00:07:30.630> video

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 
then I'll just divide them up into video

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.830 
then I'll just divide them up into video
parts<00:07:31.800> later<00:07:32.040> on<00:07:32.390> so<00:07:33.390> i'll<00:07:33.450> probably<00:07:33.600> be

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 
parts later on so i'll probably be

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.630 
parts later on so i'll probably be
pausing<00:07:34.230> at<00:07:34.290> random<00:07:34.650> points<00:07:34.950> in<00:07:35.280> the<00:07:35.340> videos

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:35.640 
pausing at random points in the videos

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.900 
pausing at random points in the videos
to<00:07:35.940> just<00:07:36.150> reach<00:07:37.020> the<00:07:37.050> video<00:07:38.010> limit<00:07:38.370> time<00:07:38.580> or

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:38.910 
to just reach the video limit time or

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.230 
to just reach the video limit time or
whatever<00:07:39.240> so<00:07:40.040> yeah<00:07:41.040> that<00:07:42.030> means<00:07:42.180> that

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 
whatever so yeah that means that

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.909
