00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hi, I'm here to show you 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.250
 my toy library show organization 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.130
 that we made with the art that the government 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.349
 analyze and I wanted I think that everything 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.299
 world is the same as me who is without 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.850
 children that take place with pictures 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.960
 toys is super hard to leave everything 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.970
 organized 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.710
 we tried more or less to make 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.449
 a way that is organized rather than 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.070
 they also play this 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.619
 business can be neutral and everything is 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.230
 organized and she can not move 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.180
 in a world does not work for children 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.809
 I'll start showing you the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.000
 niches that who did this is the project 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.160
 of the brazil brand that did quite a lot 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.660
 all my room she did these three 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.170
 niches for what toys 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.539
 easily accessible for children. 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.289
 and I split the enrico island clock 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.579
 about the game 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.920
 I explained what they most 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.960
 playing in these niches of a 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.640
 organized way that you can not be 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.949
 fully organized organization that I 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.230
 I say so limpinhos in is broken 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.270
 try to put it all together even this this 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.700
 family the toy line then they 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.340

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.710
 we did 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.540
 note put in fact I have to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.150
 talk what works for me is what I 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.040
 I always say and write down a better one. 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.619
 way then for example so they 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.500
 They play a lot of lego so there's a lot of 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.580
 cast thing I made a box of only 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.070
 Lego 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.700
 Then comes the part of the things of the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.360
 Of course you can not be super tidy. 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.750

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.700

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.990

 that is not a toy that they 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.959
