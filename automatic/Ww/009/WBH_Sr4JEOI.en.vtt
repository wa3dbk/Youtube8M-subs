00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
you ported one version to the others oh

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.700 
you ported one version to the others oh
yeah<00:00:29.310> oh<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.960> same<00:00:31.140> game<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.500> every

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
yeah oh it's it's the same game on every

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.010 
yeah oh it's it's the same game on every
platform<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.399> obviously<00:00:33.300> we're<00:00:33.540> using<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
platform but obviously we're using the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.170 
platform but obviously we're using the
strengths<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.219> different<00:00:35.610> platforms

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
strengths of the the different platforms

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.119 
strengths of the the different platforms
to<00:00:36.329> bring<00:00:36.870> new<00:00:37.170> freshness<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> blog

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
to bring new freshness to the blog

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.310 
to bring new freshness to the blog
experience<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> game<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.870> loved<00:00:40.140> on

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
experience so the game that you loved on

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.540 
experience so the game that you loved on
Wii<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.800> now<00:00:41.070> available<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.730> ps3<00:00:41.940> ps3<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.899> 360

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
Wii is now available on ps3 ps3 and 360

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.740 
Wii is now available on ps3 ps3 and 360
2.0<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.760> probably<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> best<00:00:45.239> way<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.480> describe

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
2.0 is probably the best way to describe

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.080 
2.0 is probably the best way to describe
it<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.910> went

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
it so it's I think the way that we went

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.549 
it so it's I think the way that we went
about<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.600> probably<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.930> easiest<00:00:49.289> way<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
about it and probably the easiest way to

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.080 
about it and probably the easiest way to
summarize<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.489> say<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> things

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
summarize that is to say all the things

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
summarize that is to say all the things
that<00:00:51.390> were<00:00:51.750> really<00:00:51.989> great<00:00:52.379> about<00:00:52.500> blob<00:00:52.860> we

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that were really great about blob we

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.619 
that were really great about blob we
kept<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> things

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
kept them in there and all the things

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.119 
kept them in there and all the things
are<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.170> bit<00:00:55.350> broken<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:55.920> could<00:00:56.070> have

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
are a little bit broken or could have

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.979 
are a little bit broken or could have
been<00:00:56.280> done<00:00:56.430> better<00:00:56.489> we've<00:00:57.180> rethought<00:00:57.750> them

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
been done better we've rethought them

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.959 
been done better we've rethought them
entirely<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.649> then<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.520> cap<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.940> off

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
entirely and then to cap it all off

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.490 
entirely and then to cap it all off
we've<00:01:00.449> stuck<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> whole<00:01:01.050> bunch<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> new

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
we've stuck in a whole bunch of new

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.990 
we've stuck in a whole bunch of new
features<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.460> think<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> ones

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
features and I think one of the ones

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.280 
features and I think one of the ones
that<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.239> immediately<00:01:03.329> leaps<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:03.989> use

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that are immediately leaps out at use

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.399 
that are immediately leaps out at use
the<00:01:04.530> 2d<00:01:05.000> gameplay<00:01:06.000> experience<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.140> like

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the 2d gameplay experience so it's like

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
the 2d gameplay experience so it's like
we<00:01:07.590> wanted<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> give<00:01:08.100> people<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.580> kind<00:01:08.909> of

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
we wanted to give people that kind of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.289 
we wanted to give people that kind of
you<00:01:09.299> know<00:01:10.049> ability<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.250> inside<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.090> blob

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you know ability to go inside the blob

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.300 
you know ability to go inside the blob
world<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.200> go<00:01:13.320> inside<00:01:13.470> buildings<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
world so you can go inside buildings you

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.510 
world so you can go inside buildings you
go<00:01:14.460> underground<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.810> there's<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> whole<00:01:16.520> series

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
go underground if there's a whole series

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.580 
go underground if there's a whole series
of<00:01:17.700> things<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.869> heber<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
of things that you get to be in heber to

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.660 
of things that you get to be in heber to
the<00:01:19.710> gunplay<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.280> was<00:01:20.369> something<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the gunplay and it was something that

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.700 
the gunplay and it was something that
came<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.390> pre-production<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.530> was

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
came out in pre-production that was

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.130 
came out in pre-production that was
incredibly<00:01:23.310> fun<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.810> wanted<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
incredibly fun and we really wanted to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.600 
incredibly fun and we really wanted to
share<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.650> your<00:01:25.830> looks<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.460> we've

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
share that with your looks and so we've

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850 
share that with your looks and so we've
ended<00:01:26.880> up<00:01:26.939> making<00:01:27.360> over<00:01:27.869> 100<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
ended up making over 100 to the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.859 
ended up making over 100 to the
environments<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.729> are<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:30.000> integrated

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
environments that are all integrated

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.020 
environments that are all integrated
into<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> 12<00:01:31.680> big<00:01:31.950> levels<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.520> make<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
into the 12 big levels that make up the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
into the 12 big levels that make up the
core<00:01:33.240> game<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.170> quite<00:01:34.380> quite<00:01:34.740> funny

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
core game so it's it's quite quite funny

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.969 
core game so it's it's quite quite funny
we've<00:01:35.670> taken<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.299> long<00:01:36.869> hard<00:01:37.290> look<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> game

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
we've taken a long hard look at the game

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190 
we've taken a long hard look at the game
that<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.340> should<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.880> thought<00:01:39.270> how<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:40.020> do

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
that we should and thought how can we do

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.490 
that we should and thought how can we do
this<00:01:40.350> better<00:01:40.619> without<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:42.409> messing<00:01:43.409> up

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
this better without really messing up

game i think the significant difference
is<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.119> story<00:01:48.360> drives<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.110> experience

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
is that the story drives the experience

is that the story drives the experience
a<00:01:49.740> lot<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.430> rather<00:01:50.640> than<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.000> being<00:01:51.030> more

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
people hated in the last game and I

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.209 
people hated in the last game and I
don't<00:04:01.290> know<00:04:01.379> why<00:04:01.709> there<00:04:01.949> was<00:04:02.040> such

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:02.219 
don't know why there was such

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.369 
don't know why there was such

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
unreasonable hatred for it but people

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:05.719 
unreasonable hatred for it but people
didn't<00:04:04.560> like<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.889> whole<00:04:05.069> flicking<00:04:05.609> to

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
didn't like that whole flicking to

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.959 
didn't like that whole flicking to
jumped<00:04:06.030> in<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.319> so<00:04:07.769> we<00:04:08.039> did<00:04:08.370> think<00:04:08.729> long

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:08.969 
jumped in and and so we did think long

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.300 
jumped in and and so we did think long
and<00:04:09.000> hard<00:04:09.180> for<00:04:09.900> fully<00:04:10.169> probably<00:04:10.680> half<00:04:11.039> an<00:04:11.159> hour

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
and hard for fully probably half an hour

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.860 
and hard for fully probably half an hour
and<00:04:11.519> thought<00:04:11.699> why<00:04:11.969> don't<00:04:12.000> we<00:04:12.269> map<00:04:12.509> it<00:04:12.629> to<00:04:12.659> the<00:04:12.840> a

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
and thought why don't we map it to the a

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.409 
and thought why don't we map it to the a
button<00:04:13.259> and<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.620> feels<00:04:13.889> like<00:04:14.099> a<00:04:14.159> a<00:04:14.430> wind<00:04:15.120> for

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
button and it feels like a a wind for

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.029 
button and it feels like a a wind for
common<00:04:15.719> sense<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.259> a<00:04:16.380> win<00:04:16.560> for<00:04:16.739> people

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
common sense and a win for people

everywhere that enjoy playing games
there<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:18.959> still<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.199> little<00:04:19.409> bit<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.650> waggle<00:04:19.949> in

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
there is still a little bit of waggle in

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.339 
there is still a little bit of waggle in
there<00:04:20.250> but<00:04:20.820> it's<00:04:21.029> really<00:04:21.389> it's<00:04:21.719> it's<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:22.199> lot

there but it's really it's it's a lot

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:22.850 
there but it's really it's it's a lot
more

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
it's not a brain challenging game but I

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.499 
it's not a brain challenging game but I
think<00:04:29.129> what<00:04:29.250> is<00:04:29.430> cool<00:04:29.639> about<00:04:29.699> it<00:04:29.939> is<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.270> level

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
think what is cool about it is the level

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.480 
think what is cool about it is the level
of<00:04:30.569> difficulty<00:04:30.870> like<00:04:31.259> our<00:04:31.500> level<00:04:31.889> design<00:04:32.189> team

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.820 
right and so the the gameplay things
that<00:05:04.860> invest<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.699> above<00:05:06.629> ground<00:05:06.810> levels<00:05:07.229> then

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
that invest the above ground levels then

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.559 
that invest the above ground levels then
start<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.669> transform<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.210> underground

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
start to transform the underground

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:11.089 
start to transform the underground
levels<00:05:09.810> as<00:05:09.900> well<00:05:09.930> so<00:05:10.289> things<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:10.560> blob<00:05:10.860> does

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
levels as well so things that blob does

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.040 
levels as well so things that blob does
on<00:05:11.279> the<00:05:11.370> ground<00:05:11.580> have<00:05:11.879> an<00:05:12.000> influence<00:05:12.240> on<00:05:12.479> the

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
on the ground have an influence on the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.559 
on the ground have an influence on the
shape<00:05:13.500> of<00:05:13.650> things<00:05:13.800> above<00:05:14.639> ground<00:05:14.879> and<00:05:15.150> of

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
shape of things above ground and of

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.119 
shape of things above ground and of
course<00:05:15.779> in<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.199> environments<00:05:16.740> themselves

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
course in the environments themselves

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.920 
course in the environments themselves
blob<00:05:17.490> transforms<00:05:18.090> everything<00:05:18.360> we<00:05:18.599> paint<00:05:18.870> the

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
blob transforms everything we paint the

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.230 
blob transforms everything we paint the
ground<00:05:19.169> now<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:19.650> paint<00:05:20.219> there<00:05:20.550> is<00:05:20.669> nothing

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
ground now you paint there is nothing

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.490 
ground now you paint there is nothing
left<00:05:21.479> unpainted<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.759> so<00:05:23.759> the<00:05:23.939> I<00:05:24.300> think<00:05:24.719> what

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
left unpainted and so the I think what

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.230 
left unpainted and so the I think what
makes<00:05:25.680> it<00:05:25.860> a<00:05:25.919> fun<00:05:26.099> experience<00:05:26.460> now<00:05:26.789> is<00:05:26.819> that

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
makes it a fun experience now is that

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.850 
makes it a fun experience now is that

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 
as you can see that there was a lot of

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.480 
as you can see that there was a lot of
love<00:06:53.189> in<00:06:53.340> the<00:06:53.400> last<00:06:53.610> game<00:06:53.819> this<00:06:54.389> one<00:06:54.629> is<00:06:55.319> just

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
love in the last game this one is just

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.580 
love in the last game this one is just
it's<00:06:56.490> not<00:06:56.669> so<00:06:56.819> much<00:06:56.879> it's<00:06:57.240> it's<00:06:57.539> slicker<00:06:58.169> it's

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
it's not so much it's it's slicker it's

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.980 
it's not so much it's it's slicker it's
just<00:06:59.009> where<00:06:59.370> refusing<00:06:59.879> to<00:07:00.000> make<00:07:00.150> a<00:07:00.180> product<00:07:00.509> we

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
just where refusing to make a product we

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.339 
just where refusing to make a product we
want<00:07:01.199> it<00:07:01.289> still<00:07:01.740> to<00:07:01.919> have<00:07:02.039> that<00:07:02.279> feeling<00:07:02.639> of

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:03.349 
want it still to have that feeling of

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.450 
want it still to have that feeling of
human<00:07:04.349> beings<00:07:04.650> are<00:07:04.740> involved<00:07:05.159> in<00:07:05.250> creating

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
human beings are involved in creating

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.390 
human beings are involved in creating
this<00:07:05.759> and<00:07:06.090> i<00:07:06.719> still<00:07:06.930> think<00:07:07.169> that<00:07:07.319> when<00:07:08.129> it<00:07:08.219> goes

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 
this and i still think that when it goes

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.969 
this and i still think that when it goes
out<00:07:08.550> the<00:07:08.729> door<00:07:08.759> will<00:07:09.180> probably<00:07:09.569> be<00:07:09.979> things

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 
out the door will probably be things

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:12.950 
out the door will probably be things
that<00:07:11.099> we<00:07:11.279> still<00:07:11.550> want<00:07:11.789> to<00:07:11.879> have<00:07:12.120> fixed<00:07:12.389> in<00:07:12.719> and

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
that we still want to have fixed in and

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.809 
that we still want to have fixed in and
made<00:07:13.169> better<00:07:13.409> but<00:07:13.770> it's<00:07:14.219> the<00:07:14.400> best<00:07:14.430> possible

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:14.819 
made better but it's the best possible

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:16.519 
made better but it's the best possible
game<00:07:15.210> that<00:07:15.389> we<00:07:15.479> can<00:07:15.509> make<00:07:15.779> at<00:07:15.900> this<00:07:16.020> stage<00:07:16.289> and

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:16.529 
game that we can make at this stage and

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:18.800 
game that we can make at this stage and
it's<00:07:16.650> just<00:07:16.830> it's<00:07:16.979> already<00:07:17.969> hugely<00:07:18.389> fun<00:07:18.689> to

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
it's just it's already hugely fun to

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.059 
it's just it's already hugely fun to
play<00:07:18.990> and<00:07:19.229> people<00:07:19.620> that<00:07:19.680> have<00:07:19.800> been<00:07:19.919> coming

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:20.069 
play and people that have been coming

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:22.610 
play and people that have been coming
into<00:07:20.310> the<00:07:20.430> studio<00:07:20.629> give<00:07:21.629> us<00:07:21.750> a<00:07:21.870> really<00:07:22.229> warm

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.620 
into the studio give us a really warm

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.140 
into the studio give us a really warm
feedback<00:07:23.099> about<00:07:23.250> it<00:07:23.520> so<00:07:23.669> i<00:07:23.699> think<00:07:23.849> it's

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150 
feedback about it so i think it's

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.089 
feedback about it so i think it's
definitely<00:07:24.419> on<00:07:24.779> the<00:07:24.870> right<00:07:25.050> track<00:07:25.289> and<00:07:25.560> so<00:07:25.740> by

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 
definitely on the right track and so by

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:28.839 
definitely on the right track and so by
the<00:07:26.159> time<00:07:26.370> it<00:07:26.550> comes<00:07:26.580> out<00:07:26.940> and<00:07:27.150> spring<00:07:27.599> 2011

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.849 
the time it comes out and spring 2011

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:33.020 
the time it comes out and spring 2011
it's<00:07:29.849> going<00:07:30.120> to<00:07:30.180> be<00:07:30.300> really<00:07:30.599> kick<00:07:30.900> ass
