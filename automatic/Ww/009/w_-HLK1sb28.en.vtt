00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.919
 hello everyone tungsten first 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.820
 Yaroslavl video blogger today with us 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:20.769
 Such a reviewer on the center is not quite 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:26.720
 Of course the retro thing but acquired in 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:30.080
 2002 model with a and to 22 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.160
 for many years he pleased this center very much 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.340
 not a bad thing all you need in it 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.770
 now of course it's out of date here 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.040
 playing mp3 discs here he is only 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.740
 plays regular CDs 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.320
 what is there for 5 disks here is not 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.200
 carousel loading such as 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.940
 at first it was popular such carousel 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.400
 there is a way there is a completely different topic 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.960
 2 tape decks could be rewritten 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.550
 although now no one at all 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:09.170
 nothing uses everything already rusted 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:13.509
 here is how much dust there and look because 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.509
 that for a long time he stood idle 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:22.149
 you know CDs play cassettes 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.800
 radio and there is aux input 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.210
 it was also possible to set the alarm here 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.899
 and to allow you to 6 am 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.300
 woke up some nice music 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.310
 lift up the back what is written in 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:44.240
 Singapore could still be manually 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:46.429
 set voltage there 240 230 220 also 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.580
 the antenna was connected and by the way the radio 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:52.009
 well here generally accepted 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:58.540
 wonderful here these 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:01.729
 aux-in left and right channel and let's 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.270
 let's connect here I have one 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:14.590
 such a cord from twisted pair is severe 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:14.590
 cord connect to the phone here 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.590
 how many meters to live 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.590
 and coral beach 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.769
 So what we have in there Muzychko 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:34.230
 I called but in general I will answer something new to buy 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.439
 even think about what to buy two 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.239
 pci new some center of the eye 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.000
 look toward elji 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.030
 but they are such a center in principle, then nothing 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.760
 but as one such repairman told me 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.190
 equipment in general 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.319
 if something breaks there then everything is already 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.659
 you can throw out there to solder something 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.569
 make senseless there and so they 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:01.199
 not bad these center elji as not advertising 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.540
 it's just my opinion and you were 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:06.419
 tungsten subscribe to our channel 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.250

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.250
