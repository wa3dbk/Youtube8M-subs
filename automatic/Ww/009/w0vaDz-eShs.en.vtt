00:00:02.826 --> 00:00:08.214
 "Little devil" 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.187
 You lost the soul without explanation, 

00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:35.587
 drowning dreams with a lot of rancor. 

00:00:35.587 --> 00:00:39.217
 You created, well, a halo of pain. 

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:42.982
 Your heart froze. 

00:00:43.256 --> 00:00:46.553
 You wanted to share the loneliness 

00:00:46.553 --> 00:00:49.645
 stealing souls with kindness. 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:57.752
 Tears that overflow and fill your interior full. 

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:06.582
 Ice in the bowels. 

00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:11.289
 What anguishes you? 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.891
 Who played, hurting? 

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:18.514
 Who hurt you, little devil? 

00:01:18.514 --> 00:01:25.614
 Without thinking about what he was doing. So much rage contained ... 

00:01:25.614 --> 00:01:32.723
 Never again would she cry, this time she would take revenge. 

00:01:32.723 --> 00:01:43.931
 There is no umbrella that protects from storms without ceasing that will never end. 

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:50.817
 Streets of sulfur, bodies without pulse. Hurting. Frost in your interior. 

00:01:50.817 --> 00:01:58.197
 Streets of sulfur, bodies without pulse. The illusions, without fire inside you. 

00:02:06.163 --> 00:02:10.376
 Who played, hurting? 

00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:13.873
 Who hurt you, little devil? 

00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:21.372
 Ruthless lies, envied ill-fated. 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:28.394
 Never again would she cry, this time she would take revenge. 

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:35.391
 Without thinking about what he was doing. So much rage contained ... 

00:02:35.563 --> 00:02:39.014
 Who played your game? 

00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:42.689
 It is better to calm your ego. 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:49.730
 You bet without thinking, now you can not leave it. 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.881
 Enough already, it destroys you. The close ending is, already. 

00:02:56.881 --> 00:03:03.630
 Stripped of your strength and all illusion. 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:17.990
 Walking aimlessly, going up and down, lost in the elevator.
