possibly can I think it's a really good
thing<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.529> think<00:00:31.769> about<00:00:31.829> is<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.949> your

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
thing to think about is that it's your

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.040 
thing to think about is that it's your
system<00:00:35.280> there's<00:00:35.879> nothing<00:00:36.269> wrong<00:00:36.449> there's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
system there's nothing wrong there's

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.139 
system there's nothing wrong there's
nothing<00:00:37.350> wrong<00:00:37.589> with<00:00:37.769> taking<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.790> bunch<00:00:39.000> of

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
nothing wrong with taking a bunch of

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.259 
nothing wrong with taking a bunch of
shots<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.659> kind<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.960> get<00:00:40.140> into<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.470> rhythm

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
shots just kind of get into the rhythm

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.910 
shots just kind of get into the rhythm
and<00:00:42.530> once<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.920> other<00:00:44.070> system<00:00:45.920> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
and once you get that other system you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.740 
and once you get that other system you

separate images there's nothing wrong
with<00:01:16.810> this<00:01:17.020> is<00:01:17.200> not<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.380> qualitative<00:01:18.310> thing

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
with this is not a qualitative thing

with this is not a qualitative thing
necessarily<00:01:18.880> but<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.149> decided<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.600> ask<00:01:19.780> myself

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
necessarily but I decided to ask myself

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.279

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
to try to shoot a body of work it's a

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.840 
to try to shoot a body of work it's a
small<00:01:23.590> body<00:01:23.799> work<00:01:24.070> but<00:01:24.220> at<00:01:24.250> least<00:01:24.369> a<00:01:24.490> body<00:01:24.700> of

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
small body work but at least a body of

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
like I've achieved that and i think it

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.830 
like I've achieved that and i think it
was<00:01:30.610> tough<00:01:30.880> because<00:01:31.060> i<00:01:31.270> did<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.509> first<00:01:31.539> few
