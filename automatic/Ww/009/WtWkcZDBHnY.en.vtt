 districts also a lot 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.379
 discovery potential of further 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.010
 expect many new puzzles in the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.140
 game 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 some can be made optional 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.460
 others have to be solved in order to play 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.899
 to get ahead 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.910
 of course expect us in this dlc 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.700
 also a few new features and exactly 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.070
 we want to show you who this is 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.170
 dlc package has been installed once 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.479
 The new mission can not be about 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.070
 to go to a menu item but must 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.560
 dive into the game world 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.990
 in the courtyard of your headquarters 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.119
 CafÃ© Theater is waiting for a carriage 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.310
 you and right here you can do that 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.540
 start adventure 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.670
 It is important to know that one 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.450
 unity played until the fourth act 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.790
 must have 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.290
 only then is the dlc to activate 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.119
 let's come to one of the new ones 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.369
 features in the game it awaits us 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.680
 namely a new faction in the kings 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.900
 the raiders as the name implies 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.850
 this is pretty rough 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.729
 the boys in the underground after old 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.259
 appreciate and grab gifts look everywhere 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.810
 in the underground you meet them 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.820
 they are alone in illegal robbery 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.290
 not very difficult to do in 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.210
 the group already 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.430
 Here they grab especially fast and 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.740
 aggressive in addition, they run with 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.909
 Steinen what partly short except us 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.189
 can fight 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.930
 so you meet the looters in 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.070
 a larger group is highest 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.200
 be careful 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.970
 But we still have a tip for you 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.369
 how to make big groups of looters 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.409
 but can handle 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.900
 Often these larger groups have one 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.670
 leader and when defeated occurs 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.480
 the rest of the group scares the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.790
 retreat 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.920
 however, a leader also has 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.470
 about more vital energy and is thus 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.299
 harder to defeat 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.579
 Also expect three templars 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.870
 outpost of may exempt such 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.879
 have different difficulty levels 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.870
 and bring one after the liberation 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.329
 amount of money 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.019
 another new feature is the 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.819
 Lantern 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.049
 Of course, this helps you in the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.879
 dark catacombs 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.890
 But it does not just improve the view 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.269
 but is mainly there for 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.340
 to drive away animals 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.930
 in the long hallways one becomes the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.160
 example ever by mistake mice on 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.680
 hindered 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.150
 unpack the lantern here with l3 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.109
 the little creatures forgave themselves in 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.329
 windeseile 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.290
 the same applies to rats in the 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.940
 underground and also for nasty kefer 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.879
 Also new is the beauty shotgun one 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.440
 really powerful weapon the two 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.390
 attack possibilities combined on the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.310
 on one side serves the guillotine flinte 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.900
 as a firearm and we can handle it 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.090
 fire different bullets 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.220
 on the other hand, that could be so 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.260
 also beat on your opponents because on 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.419
 run the flinke is a huge casual 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.819
 attached where he and the name of the weapon 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.829
 to deduce is particularly in the melee 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.389
 shows the powerful flin with extreme 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.190
 hurt a lot where it's at 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.989
 The kings is now available as a download 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.639
 is available for everyone 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.090
