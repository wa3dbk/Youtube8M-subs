 microphone and we started 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.030
 Goodnight 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.460
 good a round match of the athletic one 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.180
 can you rate the best of this 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.230
 season for you 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.150
 good for the result by the entity 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.160
 of the rival 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.350
 and for some moments of the game 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.310
 developed is a very match 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.310
 important to us 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.470
 good night credit and marcelo the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.170
 match and added to what was another day 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.120
 in seville the match against betis is 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.920
 the continuity you dismissed is still 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.150
 soon to assess that the thesis is 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.150
 better than a few months ago 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.580
 good 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.120
 the improvements are always evaluated when 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.890
 they have some continuity in the party 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.040
 from Betis we had some moments 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.410
 lucid today too 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.750
 to the extent that we manage to extend in 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.890
 the time and in the commitments that 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.260
 happen an acceptable level we can 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.530
 talk about 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.560
 a kind of recovery of the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.310
 first half of the year 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.340
 of the season 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.479
 it was a vital victory was needed was 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.030
 I was talking about this week of urgency 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.950
 understood team and with the attitude that 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.490
 has shown that he thinks of the attitude of 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.070
 how the party has gone 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.920
 good to play against the athletic one of madrid 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.140
 It is a 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.430
 challenge in the sense that 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:25.260
 is a team that goes beyond 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.260
 fluctuations of the procedure always has 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.950
 to reach goal situations and form of 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.860
 unbalance the party then 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.000
 it was indispensable to play very concentrated 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.300
 with a lot 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.190
 very carefully 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.490
 attention and with much attention the two 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.410
 things the team got them 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.970
 what value does it give Marcelo to the fact of 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.520
 that they have marked and men like susaeta 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.170
 and of frames that look like they were a 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.040
 little angry with the rival goal 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.700
 lately 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.599
 good for those that the team finds 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.569
 in more than more in several members the 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.959
 Unlevel ability is always good 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.489
 susaeta and of frames are this framework is a 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.900
 player who has a lot of contact with the 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.709
 arch although it gets 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.400
 do not consider as many goals as 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.079
 proportionally one thinks that you can 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.390
 get happens is in season 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.720
 past turned quite hopefully this is 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.090
 a starting point for it 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.130
 are marcelo is that the look of the game 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.260
 considers key in the second half 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.600
 for the superiority of the athletic in the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.150
 first half there was quite balance 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.050
 between the two teams good to the extent 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.540
 that we got the first time 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.460
 we dominate more than we were 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.430
 dominated but 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.430
 we suffer dangerous situations that 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.430
 forever 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.670
 diminish the sense of power that 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.700
 one team can translate into another 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.290
 of superiority in the second half 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.350
 although the first time is true that 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.630
 it was even the ball was more our 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.670
 but the situations were shared 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.290
 or slightly higher for us 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.340
 second time 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.280
 we arrived a lot and and much more we arrived 78 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.800
 times 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.450
 and they did not generate too many options for us 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.150
 goal and that 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.180
 it ends up giving you aplomb and tranquility a 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.490
 team to the teacher also 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.940
 it can be said that the athletic has returned 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.400
 as I said at the beginning for 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.050
 the continuity and succession of 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.960
 positive results will make us think 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.530
 in a different way from the one so far 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.440
 we have thought in relation to what we 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.860
 cost 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.230
 this have a good level hopefully these two 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.010
 parties are 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:06.200
 the basis of a development towards a 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.200
 ostensible and lasting improvement 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.370
 that is to say of the performance today from the 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.560
 Portal porter who have linked this 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.580
 sometimes and that however has had 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.439
 some intervention of merit 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.990
 good is the job the footballer has 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:25.940
 those vagaries the one of the archer is made 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.270
 much more 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.729
 remarkable in the ratio of success and error 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:36.659
 because what happens according to 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:38.849
 is wrong or has no consequence 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:41.610
 very significant on the scoreboard 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.909
 today I achieve that they did not convert 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.430
 situation that would have been very 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:50.400
 important for further development 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.860
 of the game legal importance this of 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.449
 have marked or marked 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.860
 first, as was the party in 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.569
 the first part of that intervention by 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.980
 example that has been made by cabals that 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:03.710
 had portugal 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:07.250
 with a rival as with both trade and with 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:13.550
 as fierce as the athletic one of madrid 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:15.320
 and going at a disadvantage is as it always is 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.310
 difficult he was at a disadvantage with 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.310
 this opponent much more 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.380
 is that to what degree is victory in front 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.900
 to the madrid technique that last year 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.220
 won the final of europa league and this 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.260
 year must in the calderÃ³n was superior to 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.060
 athletic has served for a motivation 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.470
 extra players for the issue of 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.840
 rematch that there have been two yet and 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.630
 talking throughout the week one or 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.950
 in one for me that 's a detail 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.169
 inconsequential the truth late no 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:48.139
 they have revenge and 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:50.930
 and we already lost it and they won it this 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:53.580
 match for us was necessary with 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.650
 independence of the rival 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.450
 can you tell us something about the situation 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:02.510
 physics of borja ekiza 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:06.190
 I really do not have information is true 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.190
 as to be able to transmit 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.220
 using this big the litis eskerrik 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.220
 asko
