00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.120
 so 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.190
 new video which indeed some inquire 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.900
 that many stations do not work 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.020
 So I say I have it now 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.130
 also tested over months 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.390
 initially were with me, even so the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.480
 was from half a year about the 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.410
 really these sources swell like that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.289
 that was really unstable 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.329
 every two weeks or maybe times 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.950
 at least once a month 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.540
 have to update the channel list or 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.960
 at least that single sender of the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.860
 does not work that is meanwhile 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.289
 Do you have the providers more or less 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.210
 turn on handle get that's when 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.440
 you have the reasonable source as well 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.090
 I have mine for example like this 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.249
 a page in the last videos was from 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.659
 half a year where I really everything 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.480
 had set and also long afterwards 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.739
 I've been looking for it since then 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.260
 on the system on it I have now 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.699
 here for example on the pc from there mali 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.469
 always ported the files to mine 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.440
 on my android box or elsewhere 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.540
 on the phone as I said these channels 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.340
 work so safe to me now 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.470
 even compiled and the urls 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.850
 to it to the individual transmitters has itself 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.800
 since then not changed anymore 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.900
 because I have this here now 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.640
 the waiting list pc and if you have 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.890
 that just starts here too 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.560
 You should go swimming here 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.280
 Simply this industry Turkish sender 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.250
 they just look at the one 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.350
 Subordinates are one sees immediately 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.720
 sometimes on it and you click now so 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.270
 in front of the wild so I have dsl 6000 now 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.700
 which is now less common nowadays 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.650
 In normal household is there you have 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.100
 looks that are impeccable deer otto 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.690
 the switching times are faster 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.250
 as I have said faster 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.570
 as with most sat receivers 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 keep silent about unitymedia or else 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.710
 so providers in which then takes 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.550
 usually even a little bit longer 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.820
 you can see it really works 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.820
 perfect 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.960
 this switches the transmitter 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.490
 this problem my son here 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.750
 from my phone camera of the is 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.170
 unfortunately often enough the spins one 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.430
 a bit but otherwise you can see it 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.680
 just works without it 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.630
 problems you can really do everything 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.970
 look at 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.300
 [Music] 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.620
 But picture quality is really great 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.380
 if you should ask me 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.200
 easy on her I know yes answer 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.490
 usually within one day 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.370
 and can usually continue maybe 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.420
 it's just these sources of sources 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.510
 I do not actually give then 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.400
 Continue because I do not know how 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.500
 is legally handles and so on so 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.120
 but also no personal emails 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.040
 semantic I answer halt 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.930
 just not because I say 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.580
 I always in the videos because you 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.170
 do not know what is behind it and how 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.750
 far these are the one has it myself 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.310
 search this channel list and 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.690
 Just try it yourself 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.980
 I also managed to stop it 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.780
 few days worked where you look 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.120
 really times with pages describe 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.430
 must deal and see which are 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.630
 rather , which ones do not work and you do 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.340
 That can be so easy in the end 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.049
 together absolutely puts out to 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.440
 video opened where you can see 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.510
 in the end 2 show where yes and 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.130
 TV station in one is the 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.049
 The other name is simply the one 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.120
 left behind and it just becomes like that 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.230
 compiled an mpu list and the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.420
 we just retrieved normally 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.739
 but then until the next video and 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.190
 I would be happy if your positive 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.190
 leave feedback
