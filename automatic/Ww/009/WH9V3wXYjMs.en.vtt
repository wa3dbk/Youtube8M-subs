and<00:00:00.690> then<00:00:01.020> last<00:00:01.530> in<00:00:02.129> my<00:00:02.280> opinion<00:00:02.639> right<00:00:02.820> now

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:03.410 
and then last in my opinion right now

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.809 
and then last in my opinion right now
and<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:04.529> say<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:04.890> because<00:00:05.040> everybody<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.670> it

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
and I say this because everybody is it

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.639 
and I say this because everybody is it
the<00:00:06.180> ability<00:00:06.390> on<00:00:06.690> defense<00:00:07.080> now<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.290> handle

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
the ability on defense now to handle

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.759 
the ability on defense now to handle
no-huddle<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.990> think<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.110> have<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.380> practice

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
no-huddle I think you have to practice

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.480 
no-huddle I think you have to practice
it<00:00:11.059> we<00:00:12.059> do<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.809> offense<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.889> then<00:00:14.130> won't<00:00:14.340> do

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
it we do it on offense and then won't do

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.890 
it we do it on offense and then won't do
it<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.700> game<00:00:14.849> at<00:00:15.059> times<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.540> want<00:00:15.780> our

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
it in the game at times but I want our

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.390 
it in the game at times but I want our
defense<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.560> able<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.800> handle<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.070> now

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
defense to be able to handle it now

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.429 
defense to be able to handle it now
offense<00:00:18.390> if<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.660> don't<00:00:18.900> do<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.320> better

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
offense if you don't do it you better

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.900 
offense if you don't do it you better
find<00:00:19.710> periods<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.250> able<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.520> handle<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.789> to

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
find periods to be able to handle it to

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.189 
find periods to be able to handle it to
simulate<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.420> because<00:00:21.869> there's<00:00:22.050> no

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
simulate it because there's no

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.779 
simulate it because there's no
simulation<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.189> no<00:00:23.310> huddle<00:00:23.490> when<00:00:23.670> those

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
simulation like the no huddle when those

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.490 
simulation like the no huddle when those
guys<00:00:23.970> are<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.300> fast<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.140> draw<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.410> up

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
guys are going fast you can draw it up

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.950 
guys are going fast you can draw it up
seven<00:00:25.830> ways<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:26.160> silly<00:00:26.599> how<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.779> going

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
seven ways but silly how are you going

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.179 
seven ways but silly how are you going
to<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.320> how<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.619> going<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.039> able<00:00:29.099> to

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
to do it how you going to be able to

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.620 
to do it how you going to be able to
handle<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> no<00:00:29.609> header<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.090> that's<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
handle the no header I think that's the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.450 
handle the no header I think that's the
new<00:00:30.869> thing<00:00:31.199> that's<00:00:31.349> added<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.890> comes<00:00:32.070> off<00:00:32.219> base

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
new thing that's added it comes off base

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.510 
new thing that's added it comes off base
it<00:00:33.000> goes<00:00:33.149> off<00:00:33.329> base<00:00:33.570> defense<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.399> be

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it goes off base defense you have to be

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.360 
it goes off base defense you have to be
able<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.790> handle<00:00:36.059> no-huddle<00:00:36.450> situations<00:00:37.370> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
able to handle no-huddle situations and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.369 
able to handle no-huddle situations and
be<00:00:38.579> multiple<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.719> able<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.200> your

be multiple and be able to get your
calls<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.730> able<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.030> change<00:00:42.300> things

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
calls in and be able to change things

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.840 
calls in and be able to change things
because<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.989> can't<00:00:43.260> tell<00:00:43.469> me<00:00:43.710> because<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.309> hear
