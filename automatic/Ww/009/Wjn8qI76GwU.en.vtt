window for a beautiful view let's get
started

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
started

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.670 
started
so<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.129> build<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.640> uses<00:00:51.059> wool<00:00:51.329> glass<00:00:52.289> panes

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
so this build it uses wool glass panes

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.520 
so this build it uses wool glass panes
doors<00:00:53.190> stone<00:00:54.030> slabs<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.870> whatever<00:00:55.110> else<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
doors stone slabs and whatever else you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
doors stone slabs and whatever else you
want<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:56.070> put<00:00:56.280> inside<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.610> your<00:00:56.789> home<00:00:56.910> such<00:00:57.210> as

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
want to put inside of your home such as

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.779 
want to put inside of your home such as
all<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.809> fancy<00:00:58.020> stuff<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.579> first

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
all of this fancy stuff so the first

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.040 
all of this fancy stuff so the first
step<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.270> ahead<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.480> build<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.840> your

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
step is to go ahead and build up your

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.590 
step is to go ahead and build up your
secondary<00:01:01.980> color<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.520> wool<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:03.090> high<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
secondary color of wool for high and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.450 
secondary color of wool for high and
build<00:01:03.750> over<00:01:03.930> six<00:01:04.229> counting<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> top<00:01:04.979> block<00:01:05.250> as

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
build over six counting the top block as

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.480 
build over six counting the top block as
one<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.760> them<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.240> two<00:01:06.689> three<00:01:07.110> four<00:01:07.650> five<00:01:08.040> six

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
one of them so two three four five six

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.670 
one of them so two three four five six
and<00:01:11.450> building<00:01:12.450> down<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:14.060> my<00:01:15.060> bet<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
and building down like this my bet and

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.010 
and building down like this my bet and
the<00:01:16.680> next<00:01:16.890> step<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.189> use<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.810> primary<00:01:18.810> color

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the next step is use your primary color

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.649 
the next step is use your primary color
of<00:01:19.200> wool<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.590> outline<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
of wool and outline this but on a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.969 
of wool and outline this but on a
different<00:01:21.840> layer<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.590> they're<00:01:22.830> not

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
different layer so that they're not

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.859 
different layer so that they're not
touching<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.600> are<00:01:24.659> touching

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
touching but they are touching

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.060 
touching but they are touching
diagonally<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.140> glass<00:01:28.350> panes<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.950> right

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
diagonally so the glass panes go right

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.789 
diagonally so the glass panes go right
here<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.659> over<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.350> use

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
here and you can like over here I use

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.219 
here and you can like over here I use
this<00:01:32.009> stone<00:01:32.220> slabs<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.450> I'm<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.079> use

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
this stone slabs but I'm going to use

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.929 
this stone slabs but I'm going to use
gray<00:01:34.409> wool<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.890> actually<00:01:35.310> did<00:01:35.520> use<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> gray

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
gray wool I actually did use the gray

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.429 
gray wool I actually did use the gray
wool<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.270> said<00:01:36.450> stone<00:01:36.659> slabs<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.320> was

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
wool I said stone slabs because I was

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.499 
wool I said stone slabs because I was
thinking<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> floor<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.240> gonna<00:01:39.329> give

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
thinking of the floor so I'm gonna give

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.819 
thinking of the floor so I'm gonna give
you<00:01:39.540> guys<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> second<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> basic

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
you guys a second to get the basic

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.200 
you guys a second to get the basic
structure<00:01:41.100> done<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.460> I'll<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.640> right<00:01:41.790> back

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
structure done and I'll be right back

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.030 
structure done and I'll be right back
so<00:01:42.899> what<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.079> would<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.350> next<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:43.890> ahead<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
so what I would do next is go ahead and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.649 
so what I would do next is go ahead and
add<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> bushes<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.880> side<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.390> let's<00:01:45.540> go

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
add the bushes on the side so let's go

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.060 
add the bushes on the side so let's go
ahead<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.890> simple

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
ahead and do that it's a really simple

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.929 
ahead and do that it's a really simple
step<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:49.130> over<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.520> looks<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:50.850> we're

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
step and over here looks like we're

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.219 
step and over here looks like we're
gonna<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> problem<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.079> not

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
gonna have a problem because it's not

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.490 
gonna have a problem because it's not
big<00:01:52.530> enough<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:53.299> it<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.630> remedied<00:01:54.810> trust

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
big enough but it can be remedied trust

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.010 
big enough but it can be remedied trust
me

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.600 

so<00:01:59.020> now<00:01:59.290> that<00:01:59.350> that<00:01:59.530> is<00:01:59.710> done<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.070> would<00:02:00.400> go

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
so now that that is done I would go

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.219 
so now that that is done I would go
ahead<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.000> add<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.270> doors<00:02:01.479> again<00:02:01.990> making

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
ahead and add the doors again making

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.830 
ahead and add the doors again making

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
sure you I had the slab so the doors

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.539 
sure you I had the slab so the doors
kind<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.290> go<00:02:05.440> on<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.710> outside<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.159> all<00:02:06.400> this

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
kind of go on the outside and all this

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.090 
kind of go on the outside and all this
this<00:02:06.880> doesn't<00:02:07.210> look<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.450> best<00:02:07.479> it<00:02:07.900> that's

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
this doesn't look the best it that's

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.320 
this doesn't look the best it that's
optimal<00:02:09.100> for<00:02:09.250> space<00:02:09.520> so<00:02:09.789> let's<00:02:09.940> go<00:02:10.060> ahead<00:02:10.119> just

top<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.739> here<00:03:23.920> we're<00:03:24.130> going<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.459> have<00:03:24.610> the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
top of here we're going to have the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.649 
top of here we're going to have the
brewing<00:03:25.480> stand<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.350> enchanting<00:03:26.799> table

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.050 

so<00:03:31.659> let's<00:03:31.840> add<00:03:32.019> those<00:03:32.260> two<00:03:32.470> perfect<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:33.909> now<00:03:33.940> we

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
so let's add those two perfect so now we

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.670 
so let's add those two perfect so now we
just<00:03:34.150> need<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.540> memorize<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.170> pattern<00:03:35.319> for

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
just need to memorize the pattern for

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.500 
just need to memorize the pattern for
adding<00:03:35.890> over<00:03:36.069> here<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:36.549> let's<00:03:36.790> walk<00:03:37.060> over<00:03:37.390> to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
adding over here so let's walk over to

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.869 
adding over here so let's walk over to
this<00:03:37.659> home<00:03:37.890> using<00:03:38.890> this<00:03:38.980> as<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.250> good<00:03:39.489> reference

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
this home using this as a good reference

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.670 
this home using this as a good reference
so<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.299> looks<00:03:40.480> like<00:03:40.510> we<00:03:40.720> have<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.840> furnace<00:03:41.349> item

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
so it looks like we have a furnace item

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.490 
so it looks like we have a furnace item
drop<00:03:41.920> or<00:03:42.099> water<00:03:42.569> so<00:03:43.569> we<00:03:43.629> render<00:03:43.959> chest<00:03:44.230> and

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
drop or water so we render chest and

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
some water so how this works is you do

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.980 
some water so how this works is you do
two<00:04:36.729> things<00:04:36.760> like<00:04:37.330> this<00:04:37.479> and<00:04:37.660> let's<00:04:37.780> make<00:04:37.930> sure

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
this isn't exposed the outside because I

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.040 
this isn't exposed the outside because I
do<00:04:39.639> have<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:39.910> kind<00:04:40.060> of<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.270> bad<00:04:40.419> place<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.870> build
