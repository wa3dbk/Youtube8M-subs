00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
think people who grassed how much all

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.099 
think people who grassed how much all
that<00:02:36.670> has<00:02:36.790> really<00:02:37.000> changed<00:02:37.480> what's<00:02:37.660> going<00:02:37.989> on

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
that has really changed what's going on

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.289 
that has really changed what's going on
it's<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.650> much<00:02:38.829> more<00:02:39.010> power<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.670> think<00:02:40.209> the

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
it's so much more power I think the

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.479 
it's so much more power I think the
worst<00:02:40.510> thing<00:02:40.600> about<00:02:41.040> doing<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.190> now<00:02:42.459> and

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
worst thing about doing this now and

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.309 
worst thing about doing this now and
being<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:43.419> now<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:43.840> because

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
being this now is because

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.869 
being this now is because
wish<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.739> would<00:02:44.860> have<00:02:44.890> had<00:02:45.099> all<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.489> when<00:02:45.849> I

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
wish I would have had all that when I

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.209 
wish I would have had all that when I
started<00:02:46.360> at<00:02:46.510> first<00:02:46.719> back<00:02:47.019> then<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.950> now<00:02:48.129> the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:48.219 
started at first back then so now the

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.860 
started at first back then so now the
best<00:02:48.489> you<00:02:48.640> can<00:02:48.819> do<00:02:48.939> is<00:02:49.090> make<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.420> most<00:02:49.599> of<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
best you can do is make the most of the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.319 
best you can do is make the most of the
