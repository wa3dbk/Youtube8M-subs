00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
hey it's me attack strength of 10 here

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.320 
hey it's me attack strength of 10 here
I'm<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.429> show<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.610> how<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.820> build<00:00:09.030> Lego

I'm going to show you how to build Lego

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.879 
I'm going to show you how to build Lego
trenches<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.710> first<00:00:11.190> off<00:00:11.570> well<00:00:12.679> first<00:00:13.679> if

trenches so first off well first if
you're<00:00:14.040> going<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.219> build<00:00:14.309> trenches<00:00:14.820> you're

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
you're going to build trenches you're

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.880 
you're going to build trenches you're
going<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.299> need<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.780> have<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.929> water<00:00:16.260> brick<00:00:16.560> so

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
going to need to have a water brick so

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.980 
going to need to have a water brick so
be<00:00:17.310> prepared<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:17.970> as<00:00:18.060> many<00:00:18.240> books<00:00:18.420> as<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.660> can

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
be prepared get as many books as you can

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.400 
be prepared get as many books as you can
now<00:00:20.240> one<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.270> my<00:00:21.390> techniques<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.140> show<00:00:22.350> you

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
now one of my techniques and I show you

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.060 
now one of my techniques and I show you
is<00:00:23.240> just<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> basic<00:00:24.900> technique<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.439> use<00:00:25.680> for<00:00:25.980> my

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
is just the basic technique I use for my

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.660 
is just the basic technique I use for my
video<00:00:26.430> princes<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.210> tanks<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.920> haven't

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
video princes and tanks if you haven't

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.970 
video princes and tanks if you haven't
seen<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.000> then<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.570> probably<00:00:30.900> should<00:00:31.769> watch

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
seen it then you probably should watch

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
seen it then you probably should watch
it<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:32.730> see<00:00:32.940> now<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.590> basic

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
it and you can see now it's just a basic

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.920 
it and you can see now it's just a basic
wall<00:00:36.000> bricks

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
wall bricks

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.160 
wall bricks
however<00:00:37.770> how<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.040> want<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.629> way<00:00:40.110> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
however how you want see the way you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.260 
however how you want see the way you
want<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.559> tell<00:00:40.770> how<00:00:41.010> high<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.309> by<00:00:41.760> taking<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
want to tell how high is by taking a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.930 
want to tell how high is by taking a
minifig<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.800> my<00:00:44.070> American<00:00:44.460> soldier

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
minifig like this my American soldier

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.139 
minifig like this my American soldier
minimum<00:00:45.420> grant<00:00:45.719> brick<00:00:45.989> arms<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.879> take

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
minimum grant brick arms and you take

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.319 
minimum grant brick arms and you take
like<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.870> base<00:00:49.200> plate<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:51.300> a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
like a base plate this is a actually a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.770 
like a base plate this is a actually a
brick<00:00:51.780> plate<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.280> put<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.789> top<00:00:54.270> of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
brick plate but and put it on top of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.900 
brick plate but and put it on top of
these<00:00:55.320> bricks<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.100> support<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.610> X<00:00:56.760> on

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
these bricks and have support for X on

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.910 
these bricks and have support for X on
the<00:00:57.030> other<00:00:57.090> side<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.719> these<00:00:57.960> make<00:00:58.829> sure

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the other side like these make sure

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.590 
the other side like these make sure
because<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.820> actually<00:01:00.000> kind<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.359> hard<00:01:00.539> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
because it's actually kind of hard to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.650 
because it's actually kind of hard to
get<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.109> balance<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.770> don't<00:01:01.980> have

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
get this to balance if you don't have

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.299 
get this to balance if you don't have
now<00:01:03.660> you're<00:01:03.809> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> stick<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.530> nice<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
now you're going to stick it on nice and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010 
now you're going to stick it on nice and
you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.850> use<00:01:05.970> these<00:01:06.180> small<00:01:06.479> wrists<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:06.930> you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
you can use these small wrists if you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.170 
you can use these small wrists if you
need<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:08.869> seal<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> whole<00:01:10.080> thing<00:01:10.409> off<00:01:11.180> okay

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
need to to seal the whole thing off okay

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.080 
need to to seal the whole thing off okay
and<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.340> side<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> can

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and that's it and from this side you can

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.560 
and that's it and from this side you can
seal<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
seal that that and you can see that and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.740 
seal that that and you can see that and
seal<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.990> side<00:01:19.259> if<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.799> need<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.189> now<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.479> if

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
seal that side if you need to now see if

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
seal that side if you need to now see if
you<00:01:21.930> want<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.189> want<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.460> friend

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you want your if you want your friend

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.999 
you want your if you want your friend
just<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:23.939> lower<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.680> tell

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
just to be lower you can you can tell

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.880 
just to be lower you can you can tell
the<00:01:26.670> scale<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.270> found<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.960> good<00:01:28.080> scale<00:01:28.409> because

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the scale I found a good scale because

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.490 
the scale I found a good scale because
the<00:01:29.640> minifig<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.570> shoot<00:01:30.780> right<00:01:30.960> over<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the minifig can shoot right over and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.819 
the minifig can shoot right over and
just<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:31.950> his<00:01:32.189> head<00:01:32.340> showing<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.140> if

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
just have his head showing and then if

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.810 
just have his head showing and then if
you<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.640> he<00:01:35.820> needs<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.270> reload<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.350> he<00:01:37.590> can

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
you if he needs to reload then he can

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.039 
you if he needs to reload then he can
Crouch<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.270> tiny<00:01:42.479> piece<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> his

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
Crouch and have just a tiny piece of his

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.560 
Crouch and have just a tiny piece of his
home<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.380> shown<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.850> he<00:01:45.060> won't<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> surrogate

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
home as shown so he won't be a surrogate

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.069 
home as shown so he won't be a surrogate
to<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.020> first<00:01:46.259> sign<00:01:46.790> now<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.630> change<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
to the first sign now you can change the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.700 
to the first sign now you can change the
scale<00:01:49.380> by<00:01:50.220> simply<00:01:50.939> adding<00:01:51.659> more<00:01:51.899> bricks<00:01:52.320> to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
scale by simply adding more bricks to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.149 
scale by simply adding more bricks to
this<00:01:53.009> line<00:01:53.939> right<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.649> making<00:01:55.979> it

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
this line right here and then making it

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.270 
this line right here and then making it
higher<00:01:56.509> now<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.810> side<00:01:58.110> I've<00:01:58.979> done

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
higher now on this side I've done

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.420 
higher now on this side I've done
basically<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> same<00:02:00.509> thing<00:02:01.070> except<00:02:02.070> I've

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
basically the same thing except I've

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.399 
basically the same thing except I've
added<00:02:03.350> thinner<00:02:04.350> plates<00:02:05.210> now<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.570> what<00:02:07.290> I've

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
added thinner plates now of what I've

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.729 
added thinner plates now of what I've
also<00:02:07.619> added<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.179> see<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:10.170> dirt

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
also added as you can see are this dirt

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.070 
also added as you can see are this dirt
sort<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.160> ramp<00:02:11.459> cause<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.060> need<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.270> fill<00:02:12.480> that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
sort of ramp cause I need to fill that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.310 
sort of ramp cause I need to fill that
Olaf<00:02:13.650> BM<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.450> can<00:02:15.600> do<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.750> ramps<00:02:16.140> like

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
Olaf BM so if I can do it ramps like

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.870 
Olaf BM so if I can do it ramps like
when<00:02:16.710> they're<00:02:16.890> running<00:02:17.100> they<00:02:17.490> can<00:02:17.640> look<00:02:17.820> just

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
when they're running they can look just

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.060 
when they're running they can look just
run<00:02:18.890> curtsy<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.460> can<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.700> run<00:02:21.000> right<00:02:21.690> down

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
run curtsy you can just run right down

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.640 
run curtsy you can just run right down
instead<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.190> jumping<00:02:23.460> down<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:25.080> he<00:02:25.350> can<00:02:25.500> just

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
instead of jumping down so he can just

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.160 
instead of jumping down so he can just
see<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:27.330> need<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.750> change<00:02:27.990> this

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
see that and you need to change this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.350 
see that and you need to change this
around<00:02:28.430> being<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.580> feel<00:02:29.880> like<00:02:29.970> there's<00:02:30.210> a<00:02:30.270> lot

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
around being I feel like there's a lot

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.780 
around being I feel like there's a lot
of<00:02:30.480> gap<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.050> back<00:02:31.200> here<00:02:31.710> but<00:02:32.130> say<00:02:32.310> use<00:02:32.580> all

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
of gap in the back here but say use all

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.640 
of gap in the back here but say use all
these<00:02:32.940> bricks<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:34.050> secure<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:36.170> I'll<00:02:37.170> be

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
these bricks to secure the I'll be

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.690 
these bricks to secure the I'll be
pleats<00:02:37.920> down<00:02:38.960> now<00:02:39.960> see<00:02:40.470> if<00:02:40.650> see<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.490> like

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
pleats down now see if see if you like

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.900 
pleats down now see if see if you like
the<00:02:42.150> scale<00:02:42.510> then<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.920> trenches<00:02:44.400> then<00:02:44.580> it's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
the scale then of the trenches then it's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.000 
the scale then of the trenches then it's
good<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.270> go<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:46.140> change<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.740> you<00:02:46.770> can<00:02:46.920> just

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
good to go if you change it you can just

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.120 
good to go if you change it you can just
like<00:02:47.820> say<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.060> want<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.300> change<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.720> side

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
like say I want to change to this side

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.300 
like say I want to change to this side
also<00:02:50.130> do<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.520> list<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.910> bricks<00:02:51.950> or<00:02:52.950> lots<00:02:53.190> of

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
also do is list the bricks or lots of

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.010 
also do is list the bricks or lots of
plates<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:55.190> then<00:02:56.190> go<00:02:57.000> over<00:02:57.150> here<00:02:57.420> my<00:02:57.720> giant

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
plates and then go over here my giant

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:06.320 
plates and then go over here my giant
reptile<00:02:59.300> add<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.700> bricks<00:03:02.970> down<00:03:05.120> let's<00:03:06.120> just

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
reptile add the bricks down let's just

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.560 
reptile add the bricks down let's just
look<00:03:06.570> for<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.840> bad<00:03:07.310> guys<00:03:08.310> I'm<00:03:08.550> not<00:03:09.150> using<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
look for the bad guys I'm not using the

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:17.060 
look for the bad guys I'm not using the
scale<00:03:10.070> but<00:03:11.070> then<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:14.670> can<00:03:14.850> see<00:03:15.620> adding<00:03:16.620> more

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
scale but then you can see adding more

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.990 
scale but then you can see adding more
bricks<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:18.239> make<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:19.020> trenches<00:03:19.410> height<00:03:20.000> so

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
bricks to make the trenches height so

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.530 
bricks to make the trenches height so
it's<00:03:21.390> about<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.900> same<00:03:22.140> height<00:03:22.530> as<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:23.540> these

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
it's about the same height as the these

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.600 
it's about the same height as the these
trenches<00:03:25.020> this<00:03:25.620> side<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:25.980> trench<00:03:26.190> but

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
trenches this side of the trench but

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.270 
trenches this side of the trench but
it's<00:03:27.150> just<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.480> slight<00:03:27.930> bit<00:03:27.959> higher<00:03:28.410> because<00:03:28.830> of

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
it's just a slight bit higher because of

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.260 
it's just a slight bit higher because of
the<00:03:29.790> plates<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:31.080> one<00:03:31.760> like<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:33.000> don't<00:03:33.120> know

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
the plates it's one like I don't know

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:44.810 
the plates it's one like I don't know
since<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.870> higher<00:03:34.140> end<00:03:34.500> gasps<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:43.489> then<00:03:44.489> you

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
since that higher end gasps and then you

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.850 
since that higher end gasps and then you
don't<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.360> you've<00:03:45.870> always<00:03:46.050> have<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.530> elevate

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
don't you you've always have to elevate

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.680 
don't you you've always have to elevate
this<00:03:47.040> more<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:49.760> that's<00:03:50.760> pretty<00:03:51.060> much<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.420> and

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
this more and that's pretty much it and

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.170 
this more and that's pretty much it and
then<00:03:51.959> if<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.830> want<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.220> can<00:03:53.430> just<00:03:53.550> change<00:03:53.880> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
then if you want you can just change the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.150 
then if you want you can just change the
height<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.690> use<00:03:55.260> them<00:03:55.410> any<00:03:55.500> things<00:03:55.739> for<00:03:55.920> scale

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
height and use them any things for scale

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.320 
height and use them any things for scale
because<00:03:56.520> if<00:03:56.700> you're<00:03:56.820> going<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.000> make<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> video

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
because if you're going to make a video

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.320 
because if you're going to make a video
you're<00:03:57.720> all<00:03:58.080> obviously<00:03:58.709> 1/2<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.910> mini<00:04:00.120> face

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
you're all obviously 1/2 the mini face

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.770 
you're all obviously 1/2 the mini face
to<00:04:00.570> scale<00:04:00.920> like<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.100> have<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:03.180> guy<00:04:03.390> shooting

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
to scale like you have this guy shooting

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:12.649 
to scale like you have this guy shooting
over<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.140> trench<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:05.360> then<00:04:06.360> just<00:04:06.690> say

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:22.350 

laughs<00:04:13.659> I<00:04:13.870> see<00:04:14.049> we<00:04:14.230> just<00:04:14.439> say<00:04:21.060> then<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.240> can

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
laughs I see we just say then you can

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.830 
laughs I see we just say then you can
have<00:04:22.539> the<00:04:23.289> Germans<00:04:25.530> charging<00:04:26.530> at<00:04:26.710> it<00:04:26.889> let's

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
have the Germans charging at it let's

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.150 
have the Germans charging at it let's
see<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:30.150> don't<00:04:31.150> obviously<00:04:31.300> that's<00:04:31.780> very<00:04:32.229> fake

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
see I don't obviously that's very fake

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.100 
see I don't obviously that's very fake
obviously<00:04:34.090> like<00:04:34.330> you<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.599> I<00:04:34.630> was<00:04:34.780> on<00:04:34.990> that

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
obviously like you and I was on that

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.469 
obviously like you and I was on that
close<00:04:35.410> but<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:36.430> know<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.580> get<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.940> idea

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
close but you know you get the idea

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.990 
close but you know you get the idea
like<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:38.050> make<00:04:38.229> this<00:04:38.410> any<00:04:38.979> bit<00:04:39.190> longer<00:04:39.550> the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
like you make this any bit longer the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.350 
like you make this any bit longer the
trench<00:04:40.270> longer<00:04:40.840> or<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.099> can<00:04:42.250> make<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.729> flat

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
trench longer or you can make the flat

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.400 
trench longer or you can make the flat
plane<00:04:43.599> Rider

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
plane Rider

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.290 
plane Rider
all<00:04:44.979> right<00:04:45.099> to<00:04:45.190> make<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.400> trench<00:04:45.669> water<00:04:45.940> you

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
all right to make the trench water you

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.210 
all right to make the trench water you
can<00:04:46.449> make<00:04:46.479> to<00:04:47.289> move<00:04:47.500> this<00:04:47.680> whole<00:04:47.830> thing<00:04:48.039> over

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
can make to move this whole thing over

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.260 
can make to move this whole thing over
so<00:04:49.380> that's<00:04:50.380> basically<00:04:50.860> it<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:52.289> stay<00:04:53.289> tuned<00:04:53.530> or
