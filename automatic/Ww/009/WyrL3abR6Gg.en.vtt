00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.500
 Always I am indebted 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:17.040
 This time I would like to describe the reflection of the newborn infant 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.040
 There are various kinds of reflection though 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.380
 this 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.380
 I think you will see the Figure 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.190
 Routing reflection This hot forest of Chungchon 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:35.110
 When I do my hand 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:39.330
 Towards this finger that was hung on the cheek 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.330
 It is a reflection that say the baby is going to have a mouth 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.010
 Sucking reflection 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.739
 As you suck the tits when you hold your finger in the mouth 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.739
 q It is a reflection that makes iron 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.060
 'S grasp version 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.840
 When I hold my finger on my palm 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.840
 Hold 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.120
 a is here 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:18.990
 Good symmetrical tonic cervical reflex 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:21.700
 The but you do in that tonic neck reflections towards the there is tilted to the left or right head bow 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.299
 Dressy 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.299
 To do 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.740
 Then it is already reflection 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:36.270
 Lift your head a little and drop it 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.350
 I say something like frozen clothes 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.500
 Cunning the form 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.920
 It is Morrow reflection 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.360
 What comes out well for exams etc 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.360
 I think this is around 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.750
 Then 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.060
 Nanae 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.340
 I thought it would be nice if you could remember what it was like 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.230
 So 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.320
 About the disappearance time and the reason of the reflection 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.490
 I hope you can explain in an easy-to-understand manner 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.620
 think 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.760
 First of all 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.760
 Well Morrow reflection 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.110
 This 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.430
 When I lower my head 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.430
 Like grab something 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.640
 This jet to protect 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.319
 About 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.340
 It burned down in 34 months 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:46.370
 When I 'm ready 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:46.370
 I think if you remember the time to sit in the neck, so you can also remember the time to sit on the neck 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.520
 It is next and it is aspiration reflection 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.110
 If the bring-to-mouth 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.960
 Though it is a reflection to be a chew 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.830
 This is about 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.950
 my burned down between 4 and 7 months 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.050
 To do 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:19.410
 It lasts 4 to 7 months 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:22.160
 Though Well, it generally referred to as the start of the baby food in about 600 single 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.120
 With 11 sucking and reflecting 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:32.739
 I can not eat baby food 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:38.319
 That 's what it 's like to eat and eat, but you can't eat food if you smoke it. 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:43.350
 Burned down At the same I think that it may learn to associate between from 4 months 7 months 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:46.600
 It is the time of weaning that time 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.010
 Though it is grasping reflection of fitting 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:55.250
 I 'll bring my pinky in my palm 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.250
 Though it is a reflection that holds a squeeze before 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:04.340
 In 8 rounds of the way of holding 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:10.390
 The so hold roughly this thing around 20 weeks 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.390
 Heavy with the floor that this month five months around now will I gradually from it 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.269
 Issu mer without waiting 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:22.530
 When I get old, I will be cuddling with my fingers 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.530
 This hand grasps burnout in about 34 months of reflection 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.320
 So epp 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:36.910
 I touch something already when I thought to cut things myself 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.910
 I will not touch my touch time if I hold it every time 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.009
 The wind that 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.270
 If you think about it 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.270
 Grasp of reflection 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.690
 Create in about 34 months 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.690
 I understand that 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.260
 In the tonic neck reflex 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.480
 It's coming out a while, but as I said before 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.220
 Let's go to one side 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.409
 Like to draw a bow when you face up 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.810
 Be dressed 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.380
 Though it is 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.070
 This is about 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.070
 Luxury moon 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.210
 About 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.220
 It will disappear 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.220
 If this will last forever 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.570
 There are big obstacles and 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.570
 The it comes to things like 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:37.189
 The tension neck reflex is the presence or absence of the disorder 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:37.189
 I get out of trouble with others 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.480
 Basically this reflection 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.330
 Reflection 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.880
 It means 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:52.780
 Nervous system properly for newborn infants 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:58.710
 If there is no reflection, it will check if there is any 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:03.720
 It will become the wind judgment that there is something abnormal in the nervous system 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:06.409
 So it 's the nervous system that I first see the reflexes 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.810
 And that it is screening 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:13.639
 What kind of reflection is there 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:16.600
 What kind of action do you take and the time when it disappears ? 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:23.160
 Well there is also a reason for the disappearance time 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:23.160
 I think it might be good if you can remember this time
