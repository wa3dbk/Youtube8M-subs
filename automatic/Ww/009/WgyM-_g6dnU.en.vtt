have started throwing in a little bit of
turpentine<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:25.250> andwe're<00:02:26.250> turpentine<00:02:26.760> is

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
turpentine to andwe're turpentine is

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.680 
turpentine to andwe're turpentine is
nice<00:02:27.840> hell<00:02:28.170> on<00:02:28.410> hand<00:02:29.030> because<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.150> say<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:30.540> you

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
nice hell on hand because I say if you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.420 
nice hell on hand because I say if you
do<00:02:30.900> get<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.170> ding<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.680> though<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.040> stuff<00:02:32.250> is

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
do get a ding in it though this stuff is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.340 
do get a ding in it though this stuff is
really<00:02:32.670> almost<00:02:32.910> impossible<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.780> ding<00:02:33.990> because

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
really almost impossible to ding because

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.150 
really almost impossible to ding because
it<00:02:34.470> isn't<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> coating<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.580> part<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.270> wood

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
it isn't a coating it's part of the wood

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.250 
it isn't a coating it's part of the wood
but<00:02:38.160> if<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.460> just<00:02:38.640> take<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.210> little<00:02:40.020> bit<00:02:40.200> of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
but if you just take a little bit of

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.300 
but if you just take a little bit of
turpentine<00:02:40.770> on<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.160> rag<00:02:41.460> it<00:02:42.530> dissolves<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:44.070> pie

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
turpentine on a rag it dissolves the pie

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.840 
turpentine on a rag it dissolves the pie
tire<00:02:44.640> again<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.210> it<00:02:45.480> works<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.930> right<00:02:46.140> back<00:02:46.350> in

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
tire again and it works it right back in

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.370 
tire again and it works it right back in
you<00:02:47.850> also<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.360> take<00:02:48.540> any<00:02:48.750> little<00:02:48.990> dents

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
you also you to take any little dents

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.010 
you also you to take any little dents
and<00:02:49.560> dings<00:02:50.000> though<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.360> surface<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.960> very

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
and dings though the surface is very

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.600 
and dings though the surface is very
resilient<00:02:52.680> anyway<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.690> feel<00:02:54.690> because<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.230> isn't

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
resilient anyway I feel because it isn't

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.250 
resilient anyway I feel because it isn't
it<00:02:56.610> isn't<00:02:56.790> just<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.270> surface<00:02:57.570> coating<00:02:58.170> like

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
it isn't just the surface coating like

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.720 
it isn't just the surface coating like
this<00:02:58.470> stuff<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.800> just<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.100> horribly<00:02:59.430> thin

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
this stuff is just a horribly thin

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.480 
this stuff is just a horribly thin
surface<00:03:00.090> coating<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:01.200> stuff<00:03:01.440> goes<00:03:01.950> into<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
surface coating this stuff goes into the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.870 
surface coating this stuff goes into the
wood<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.900> stays<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.620> wood<00:03:04.880> but

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
wood and it stays in the wood but

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.950 
wood and it stays in the wood but
another<00:03:06.150> really<00:03:06.480> important<00:03:07.110> thing<00:03:07.730> people

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
another really important thing people

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.780 
another really important thing people
tend<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.050> forget<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.530> mention<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:11.580> key

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
tend to forget to mention the key

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.290 
tend to forget to mention the key
ingredient<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.600> heat<00:03:13.610> when<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.640> put<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.150> stuff

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
ingredient is heat when I put this stuff

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.940 
ingredient is heat when I put this stuff
on<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:17.220> will<00:03:17.400> put<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.700> layer<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.000> pine<00:03:18.390> tar<00:03:18.660> and

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
on you will put a layer of pine tar and

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.330 
on you will put a layer of pine tar and
linseed<00:03:19.950> oil<00:03:19.980> on<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.720> I'll<00:03:21.870> heat<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.230> until<00:03:23.130> it

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
linseed oil on and I'll heat it until it

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.750 
linseed oil on and I'll heat it until it
bubbles<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.390> then<00:03:25.350> rub<00:03:25.650> off<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.100> excess<00:03:26.490> and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
bubbles and then rub off the excess and

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.190 
bubbles and then rub off the excess and
there's<00:03:27.240> a<00:03:27.300> good<00:03:27.480> time<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.720> little<00:03:28.020> bit<00:03:28.140> of

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
there's a good time a little bit of

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.190 
there's a good time a little bit of
turpentine<00:03:28.380> helps<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.040> rub<00:03:29.220> off<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.460> excess

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
turpentine helps to rub off the excess

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.720 
turpentine helps to rub off the excess
but<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.230> do<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.590> repeatedly<00:03:32.190> because<00:03:32.580> what

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
but I do that repeatedly because what

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.510 
but I do that repeatedly because what
you're<00:03:32.910> trying<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.210> do<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.630> pine<00:03:33.870> tar<00:03:34.250> has<00:03:35.250> to

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
you're trying to do the pine tar has to

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.820 
you're trying to do the pine tar has to
be<00:03:35.700> carried<00:03:36.180> in<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.110> wood<00:03:37.320> with<00:03:37.800> the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
be carried in to the wood with the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.800 
be carried in to the wood with the
linseed<00:03:38.340> oil<00:03:38.460> and<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.940> heat<00:03:39.150> opens<00:03:39.540> up<00:03:39.660> the

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
linseed oil and the heat opens up the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.010 
linseed oil and the heat opens up the
pores<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.230> pulls<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.800> down<00:03:40.830> in<00:03:41.190> there<00:03:42.020> the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
pores and pulls it down in there the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.370 
pores and pulls it down in there the
heat<00:03:43.350> is<00:03:43.560> very<00:03:43.620> important<00:03:44.550> if<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.570> don't<00:03:45.930> have

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
heat is very important if you don't have

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.110 
heat is very important if you don't have
it<00:03:46.560> burst<00:03:46.830> into<00:03:47.040> flames<00:03:47.220> once<00:03:47.730> in<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:47.940> while

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
it burst into flames once in a while

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.940 
it burst into flames once in a while
you're<00:03:48.360> not<00:03:48.510> doing<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.900> hot<00:03:49.110> enough<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.830> know

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
you're not doing it hot enough you know

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.340 
you're not doing it hot enough you know
it<00:03:50.070> really<00:03:50.250> has<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.820> bubble<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.390> learned<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.170> do

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
it really has to bubble I learned to do

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.200 
it really has to bubble I learned to do
it<00:03:52.470> from<00:03:52.710> my<00:03:52.860> cross-country<00:03:53.610> skis<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:54.000> have<00:03:54.180> a

skis and they have to be tired before
they're<00:03:59.540> waxed<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.690> that's<00:04:00.870> what<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.200> have

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
they're waxed and that's what you have

they're waxed and that's what you have

to do you have to use pine tar and you

to do you have to use pine tar and you

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
have to get it get it on fire once in a

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.410 
have to get it get it on fire once in a
while<00:04:07.640> but<00:04:08.690> beautiful<00:04:09.690> finish<00:04:10.670> adds<00:04:11.670> density

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
while but beautiful finish adds density

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.240 
while but beautiful finish adds density
to<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.570> wood<00:04:12.810> though<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.140> adds<00:04:13.410> resilience<00:04:14.010> to

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
to the wood though it adds resilience to

it and it's completely impervious to
weather<00:04:20.299> really<00:04:21.299> great<00:04:21.660> finish<00:04:22.169> but<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.220> do

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
weather really great finish but you do

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.940 
weather really great finish but you do
have<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.150> heat<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.390> because<00:04:25.200> it's<00:04:25.350> not<00:04:25.470> tacky

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
have to heat it because it's not tacky

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.590 
have to heat it because it's not tacky
