00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:06.370
 what you see here is a dutch 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.350
 greenhouse at the moment in the Netherlands 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.510
 actually grows everywhere with all growers 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.280
 in this way a small part is on 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.380
 and whatever we do is 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.900
 use LED lighting come here then 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.419
 in our cupboard with LED lighting in front 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.970
 us the way in winter and safe 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.540
 and a clean and tasty Dutch product 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.220
 to grow 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.439
 welcome to the wonderful world of the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.570
 grow tomatoes for a tasty tomato 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.970
 first you need a good variety 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.980
 We like the animals that sit here all 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.230
 properties in hidden from the 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.040
 tomatoes that we grow here and of course 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.810
 and where necessary 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.300
 temperature that we also bring in this 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.080
 greenhouse and a plant needs light to 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.390
 to grow 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.670
 such fun and what we do here as well 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.110
 then with lamps and that is greenhouse horticulture 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.760
 in a nutshell 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.130
 at the tomato nursery in bergschenhoek 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.200
 they have taken a new path 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.520
 in addition to the conventional cabinet lamp, the sodium 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.040
 high pressure lamp 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.640
 the tomatoes grow on led lamps and watch 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.800
 what we see here 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.649
 LED lights that hang between the crops 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.740
 and that splendor and more beautiful large degree 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.140
 and I see you red and blue light 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.270
 instead of yellow light 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.430
 so it's a red and blue light here 4 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.680
 red and the red light that can do that 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.150
 record plans very easily because the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.770
 LED lights do give light 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.380
 hardly any heat can the lamps 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.610
 hang between the plants and so optimally 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.170
 contribute to the process of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.380
 photosynthesis 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.020
 the conversion of light into plant food 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.970
 you want and determine where because the belly of 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.590
 the plant where the route degree sit that 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.600
 loyal shine 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.310
 up in bloom that then sets that and 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.390
 the trusses begin below that 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.490
 the rossi then actually grow 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.600
 but growing tomatoes in the belly 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.549
 and you have to be modest about it 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.290
 the fastest and fastest growing on that 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.700
 which is the most fun of the LED 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.500
 you are the very first cupboard in it 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.810
 the netherlands with LED lighting yes yes we 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.130
 believe in the merry between 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.909
 highlight that being in scandinavia too 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.280
 already done a lot 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.830
 good results and that is you the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.119
 plant also shines where it is needed 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.799
 is where the most useful is actually in 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.180
 instead of just on top 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.890
 here we see the first harvest from below 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.500
 led to grow 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.869
 nice juicy beautiful red pink looks and 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.099
 does not outweigh an expensive investment 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.599
 in the led lamp 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.480
 had a led lamp gives very little 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.540
 heat when he wants as much light 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.219
 upstairs with emphasis lamp as well 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.230
 With LED then we need a double 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.780
 number of those lamps you get with men 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.069
 you give a lot of warmth and all that 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.269
 heat at the top of the plant to find 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.650
 that plant does not leak 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.480
 now we get a better distribution of 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.920
 light and heat because we bring 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.689
 a part of the heat that led 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.370
 beams are 35 degrees so we bring one 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.439
 share down just as an advantage with 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.500
 the advantage of nicer tomatoes is high 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.180
 production more pieces per meter and less 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.370
 energy costs because LED has less 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.959
 energy costs another for the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.819
 the LED lamp lasts 3 times longer than 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.859
 the usual cabinet lamp 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.590
 at least 10 years instead of four years 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.849
 The first LED harvest is now on the market 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.099
 brought 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.230
 the. watches over the quality of the tomato 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.799
 producer organization 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.049
 tasty all great for bread 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.169
 tasty for sauce and will be the consumer 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.489
 to realize that this is a tomato member 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.159
 is 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.090
 no but the family tomato must 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.400
 just be good 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.189
 must taste it have quality stay 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.169
 also prepare a go most tomatoes 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.879
 from yami to abroad 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.889
 this greengrocer in rotterdam north is in 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.470
 enthusiastically see this the 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.079
 good then doctors look brother enough 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.799
 are the very first LED tomatoes from 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.349
 The Netherlands 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.060
 so stupid notion 200 also tastes good 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.290
 good is 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.530
 no yes that first anyway 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.449
 more energy efficient for the Netherlands 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.639
 yes something to praise as well 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.560
 mother on you absolutely back to the 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.750
 tomato nursery in bergschenhoek 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.859
 because the LED tomato is also better off 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.569
 taste 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.430
 that can only be tested if the 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.650
 unexposed tomato cupboard 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.470
 has been picked ' and when they are ripe in this 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.449
 I would be a little yes then we will 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.250
 as it were, we research 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:59.519
 actually expect that as a result 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.620
 the juice flows better through the light 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.629
 that plant and therefore also a better one 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.400
 taste of persecution has exciting time 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.400
 exciting he absolutely absolute
