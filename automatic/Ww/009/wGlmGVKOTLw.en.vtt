00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.069
 so stand out 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:13.979
 but not for Spanish football my team 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.199
 far from a mild way 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.210
 and maybe not 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.359
 it is not all colorful 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.039
 we play mom 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.260
 defending our bow and that is that 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.010
 that they do not mark us and then try to take advantage of them that we can generate another 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.779
 has changed but 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.779
 but I think I've added things to him 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.440
 that it's good for a footballer to always join him 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.640
 sacrifice adding other aspects that are not always 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.870
 things with the ball or let's see or less showy but they are just as 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.370
 effective for a team 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.970
 to be 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.970
 mainly comfortable and light 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.170
 well that scores a lot to play with the boot very fair 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.720
 on the foot 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.600
 for that is based on that it fits has nothing to do with this and that is 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 very very soft dane 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.820
 mainly comfort 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.080
 avalan 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.890
 you usually need to use the stolen three workouts before to 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.600
 feel it like homs ap center the like a boot and with that boot not 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.310
 it was not necessary it was very 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.770
 let's say that the issue of control is something that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.060
 we are doing 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.000
 everyday 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.620
 they go toto the players train that all of which come in 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.270
 is to score goals however there are some that score more than others 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.970
 and well the boots of a thug are 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.110
 they are the element of work and 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.360
 while more like asean 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.190
 it is easier 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.260
 get a goal that you are looking for in each workout if we have a boot 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.349
 that the uncomfortable that is heavy that 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.349
 with which you did not feel good is much harder 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:13.989
 because 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.170
 what they talked about the previous answer of football comfort 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.159
 there is a phrase that 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.670
 that almost always say between footballer that there is nothing like hitting 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:28.989
 wrong to the ball 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.259
 there are times that he does not hit the goalie badly he thinks that one is going to hit him well 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:35.259
 incisive for the other side 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.149
 I think that it has a lot of improvisation 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.929
 I do not know but there are too many things in my head 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.929
 in a fraction of a second that's when you have to say what are you doing 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.519
 that's why the difference 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.779
 colo colo with great football players who decide well in ee 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.929
 technically very good 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:58.490
 the physically very many good dishes 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.490
 those that make the difference sanz that follow you well that the hardest 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:10.879
 iodine a lot is very difficult to play with boots in tenosique with which it does not fall 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.589
 but that what we said before 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:19.789
 I know that the field is always wet and it is very easy to fall when sliding 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:23.609
 it is clear that yes 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.949
 what we said what he said before of air comfort 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.529
 that the quota is not a problem that they are the opposite, that's what 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.529
 go with these bikes 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:39.599
 I think there are many things that 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.309
 they are from birth, they bring some or not others 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.929
 in football and in any other profession 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.829
 but that is improved day by day and that most of what 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.829
 of what he does and what he knows and what Luque 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.239
 You can become or know how to make the premier 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.239
 all children of the teletype of me 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.459
 from my city the place where 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.549
 Mendez said he still feels 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.549
 is and every time that percent put together the 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.070
 today I ask several colleagues to join me voted people do not even notice in the 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:22.069
 Newspaper 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.949
 The same is to be among them the pilot worldwide 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:28.179
 to defend the Argentine shirt
