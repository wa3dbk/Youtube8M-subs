 ready who speaks then president of ca 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.070
 certainly I learned very well I am 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.310
 ready when you want I go back to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.560
 parma now i was training and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.269
 when you want, I will immediately return to Palermo 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:32.489
 so let's start at once I have to come to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.090
 what foot thing knows is kidding that not 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.420
 it made me laugh 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.120
 however it is fine between two Oretta 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.260
 then I take the plane and immediately return to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.110
 palermo so we begin the season 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.390
 together with first I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.170
 they greet her all my fans send her 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.510
 a wish for a good start to the season 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.260
 they all cheer for us so we hope it is 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.260
 have a great season 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.280
 sure I'm sure all my fans 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.910
 they continue to follow us because they have 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.070
 always done 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.380
 so now I close the call there 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.390
 maybe we hear later when it lands 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.590
 palermo those to after what we do 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.590
 so let's go to palermo 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 then we start not to disconnect at 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.000
 player you know what happened one 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.729
 couple of days ago due to the fact of 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.200
 bailouts and since I intended 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.610
 to continue it because in any case a series 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.500
 that I really like a lot 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.030
 at the outcome of starting it again directly 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.409
 from Palermo for my dream anyway 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.720
 was to play later 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.640
 then Naples and then Palermo 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.100
 maybe even go in early sooner to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.560
 get stronger to make us notice too 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.420
 from the big teams and now anyway 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.259
 let's see if offers come if 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.979
 leave or participate in the premiere 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.290
 part of the season until January 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.460
 then comes the first offer of 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.920
 loan had to and must be 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:05.659
 offered interesting because they are if they are 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.659
 pakistan offers to citadel 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.760
 girls the offer of the citadel is not 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.630
 evil is not bad however we are stars 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.740
 always b and ii you have to wait because 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.660
 the first time it happens to me only 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.739
 current vallo brother becky standard la 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.200
 sweden from the tenth third championships 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.150
 Swedish category we look at the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.880
 seasonal goals that we could 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.060
 serve are minimum rating 6.16 goals 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.380
 in the season 5 assists and 10 percent 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.459
 achievements 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.080
 then I choose you because you who 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.640
 however it would be nice to even go has 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.950
 impressed a team of b to make us 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.720
 enter more maybe if I don't know if a 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.980
 soon short but I think it is 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.510
 a loan for the whole season 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.120
 but since it would be a great opportunity 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.830
 to make us assert however to go to one 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.260
 team like the citadel where they are not 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.030
 all so strong otherwise to stay 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.980
 to the palermo because you know that anyway 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.850
 as we have seen from the first part 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.940
 of the player career we succeeded 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.720
 always playing every now and then without not 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.090
 We played often but we played then 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.579
 there is a reminder why they want that 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.470
 decide now so you don't want to go 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.239
 next I wanted to play the first game 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.570
 but you do n't want to move on instead 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.489
 fact that I want you to decide 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.370
 then I do something now 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.880
 while to finish this mini 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.709
 Introductory episode I decided to 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.260
 let's see 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.959
 no this is not the shoes then homo 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.750
 arrange them sky look for the shoes 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.150
 we only see if, like everyone stuck, no 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.290
 here they are and at the end the shoes that 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.390
 we had 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.340
 last time I like it so much 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.040
 these which are the ones at the end o 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.380
 in reality, however, that these too 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.260
 the purple ones are not bad so we use 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.250
 these shoes these shoes then not here 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.460
 We can 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.310
 do nothing in the features here 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:14.990
 nothing nothing I've redone the character 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.670
 as we had we had it at the beginning of his career 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.150
 we can't change anything else 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:24.020
 so come on and we saved the 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.180
 player as well as guys I know that 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.150
 you wanted a longer video and I understand you 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.950
 anyway but i want to decide if 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.990
 stay in Palermo in the citadel 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.690
 however this offer arrived maybe 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.840
 going forward they will reach high but not 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.669
 I'm sure it can also be that not 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.250
 no offer comes just this 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.669
 series b and then if we think about it if not 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.669
 we accept 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.180
 Today, not only is there a video to do 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.100
 anyway, it took too long 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.450
 time point really little time 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.480
 today to stay ahead of the play 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.830
 so I ask you to comment on this 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.380
 video absolutely why really 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.250

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.320

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.140
 white only comes the black white one 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.370
 I destroyed it the other time with 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.370
