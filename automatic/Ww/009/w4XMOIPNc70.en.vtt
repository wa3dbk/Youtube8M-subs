00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.670
 you are dear friends with you lyudmila 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.400
 in this video I want to appeal 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.930
 to those who registered in the project 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.830
 my referral link 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:22.640
 the fact is that the project failed 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.340
 and registration by member links 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.369
 for some reason, they started going under the project itself 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.610
 under the exchange of how this happens 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.800
 I paid in the video about your registration 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.620
 attention to what's on this gray 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.020
 the stripes above are written who invited 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.330
 you need this line in the project 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.890
 be sure to check before 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.730
 fill in the following fields 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.260
 as you can see here I opened my link 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 written lyudmila polanichko when 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.610
 the participant fills in the fields for 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.110
 registration data and presses 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.200
 register button 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.650
 right after that it puts it in personal 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.720
 cabinet 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.479
 because the activation letter 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.170
 link in the project does not come and here 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.100
 when he enters his personal account then 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.939
 He sees that instead of Ludmila Polanica 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:23.210
 whose user name is on the line to in place 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:25.969
 the sponsor is worth traffic trafficmonsoon about 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.490
 I wrote this and said in Skype 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:32.229
 several people I looked 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.719
 registration of one of the participants live 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.990
 screen display and concluded 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.789
 that I should write a letter to the support 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.509
 right here on the gray box in your personal 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.020
 the office 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.189
 data is written date of registration by date 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.999
 last login 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.709
 your username Elagin your sponsor me 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.700
 here Alexander voluntarily 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.389
 This is my sponsor Centurion 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.850
 most participants 

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:01.209
 registering with my link here 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.939
 trafficmonsoon written 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:07.520
 so I found a button in my office 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.380
 support it is at the bottom of the page 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.010
 here you can write a letter to 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:17.600
 technical support I made a letter translated 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.170
 him in english and wrote 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.080
 that I advertise a project on 2 resources from 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.770
 your site and on youtube and mine 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.050
 referrals 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.380
 are recorded correctly for such 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.530
 link but they have written in their office 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.800
 sponsor trafficmonsoon why im not 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.540
 came the answer the next day rather in 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.050
 same day later the answer came to me 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.790
 what are the obvious participants before registering 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.520
 did not clear cookies in the browser 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.000
 either they did some registration with 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.430
 I did not believe one ip address 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.650
 that the project approves cannot be 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.560
 all who registered in the project 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.880
 dirty browsers or they do by 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.660
 multiple registrations from one 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.810
 computer but the admin answered me what else 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.770

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.170

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.600
 who signed up for my 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.220

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.480

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.420

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.270
 registered my sponsor user name as a 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.880
 the letter itself contains something like this 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.600
 the content I registered for such and such 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.020
 links 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:04.330
 My invite Lyudmila Polianichko my 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.200
 username should sponsor polina to 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.060
 foreigners do not like when we write 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.360
 huge letters so the shorter 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.640
 the letter, the better it is clearer and 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.260
 press submit button text 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.350
 letters what to write in the subject 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.780
 what is this to write in the body of the letter I will post 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.370
 under this youtube video 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.950
 someone will say the people are greedy and small and 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.910
 referrals i'm not greedy i'm for 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.360
 justice 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.700
 if i invited you project why you 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.720
 should give their clicks to some 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.690
 admin 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.760
 he and thousands of participants 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.860
 registered without referral link 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.730
 and I think such an income to him is quite 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.840
 enough 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:50.500
 because judging by the fact that we already 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.940
 the second time change the minimum on the output 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.480
 when i shot the first video 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.210
 the minimum for withdrawal was 2 dollars then he 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.300
 became 3 dollars today i saw that 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.070
 at least the withdrawal is already 4 dollars therefore 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.590
 let's not give our clicks 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.630
 the project let's register and 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.690
 to work under those who invited you to 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.900
 project if you do not write such a letter 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:20.150
 I will not be offended by your free will 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.130
 but those who still have a consciousness 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.470
 that the one who invited you must 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.660
 should receive referral for you 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.890
 provide you with informational support 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.830
 I make pages for everyone 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.090
 for advertising please contact me on skype 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.940
 write me a mail 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.760
 send your referral link your 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:44.360
 skype and mail I will make you such 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.150
 page but please if you donâ€™t 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.950
 difficult to write such a letter in support 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.919
 It is those who registered on my 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.380
 link and got under the project with you 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.520
