00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello everybody, who was the ze 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.800
 Welcome to the fire is this one. 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.440
 is a series of refuge being games 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.030
 free, and as the name already says 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.750
 we will have shown this series of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.150
 games that are free does not make sense 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.789
 They're really cool, you can have fun. 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.609
 Best of all without paying anything today 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.609
 game chosen was the brow force which is a 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.130
 game is that it is still in the stage of 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.350
 tests it will still be released and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.010
 improved but I doubt when it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.930
 be released improved voice and paid and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.510
 even if it is paid 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.550
 it's going to be an absurdly expensive thing 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.890
 it's not going to be no because it 's a good match 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.190
 simple simple but good graphics 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.360
 fun good frenetic good to ease 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.020
 the stress 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.039
 Well, this is where I'll explain how to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.320
 game 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 if you are this guy here no 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.059
 necessarily this guy has several 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.610
 characters as you are redeeming 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.270
 the others are playing with them and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.090
 The goal of the game is to kill one 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.490
 little devil that's there in the background was left 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.689
 top guy heidi habituem if you have to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.810
 kill him 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.549
 we're just using happened there have to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.320
 kill and while one of them goes to 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.880
 that check can be flagged there 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.939
 and then you go away and make a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.130
 book and those goals that have here seven 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.560
 windows and will have this face that sticks 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.380
 he is going to change characters and there in the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.070
 bottom left corner is showing 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.280
 their lives lives 2 and two grenades 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.770
 It is for you to walk san jose had to 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.740
 Take the shift and use your grenades against 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.320
 returned to sing so great it destroys 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.390
 but you only have nothing at all and you have 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.640
 you have infinite no need to worry 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.180
 And then I'll show you here, see. 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.690
 There in the corner is life life 2 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.970
 When you have a tender affection for 3 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.119
 so if you die I 'm going to die 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.880
 purpose here it kills me of assis 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.530
 reborn as a different joker has 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.990
 lots of nice strokes 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.840
 this one by with various skills 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.580
 type for example there is one there that he plays 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.860
 dynamite has one that has more grenade than 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.580
 the others have one that his grenade can 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.990
 be controlled like you miss you and have a 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.800
 faster attack but to what is 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:34.130
 applied bazooka nÃ© type wheels and has 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.320
 a bazooka there's four here already came 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.260
 Here you lose that flag. 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.780
 Helicopter get only from him but everything 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.170
 you go to the next level 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.660
 I'm going to pass here very fast this is the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.900
 that you can control nothing he binds 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.709
 You can view this either as a 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.320
 ian and the lior type shot back 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.660
 You can have a guy over there like this. 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.190
 shoot here and hit and turn it on the farm 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.260
 the legal strategies 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.790
 If I catch the guy here, I 'm just not going. 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.540
 to waste this ability he 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:12.620
 have your leave the key to kill 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.720
 I killed, I hope so, I realize 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.590
 I just got that ball. 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.450
 let me get it here it's something cool 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.060
 that he thinks that the sniper 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.950
 his skill is he shoots much more 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.820
 away from the others it can kill of thing 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.090
 3 black at once this is the crucible 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.700
 rhythm I do not like it because the old 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.640
 take you from the media center and 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.010
 it looks good as such when you have the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.600
 It is practically impossible to 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.760
 to pass without dying with him 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.590
 I know that the rambo has ceased inducing 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.690
 speaking who is who 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.510
 the course of the game 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.730
 It's like telling me that I was a lawyer. 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.580
 multiplayer online is multiplayer with 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.920
 12 with two players 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.050
 so you have a brother at home if there is 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.640
 want to play for some fun 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.850
 You can play along with him. 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.960
 control the guy for seven years wsd go 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.140
 shoot 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.470
 the contrast is also staying here 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:17.360
 it has several free type and has a 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.459
 grenade that I leave for my 11 years and 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.590
 after she ends up being cheated 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.590
 he begins the journey of his normal 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.770
 You try to keep me from living now but 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.199
 This is cool to play when they start to play. 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.060
 blow up everything that happens every thing 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.860
 in this game so you do not believe then 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.699
 Sometimes they 're giving you a good one. 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.039
 passes away 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:45.990
 There you are, and you stay with an old defendant. 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.879
 My hand what I did it is that here 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.620
 have more power of the game until you go to 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.680
 behind the red sea 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.770
 this here is a guided missile side 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.259
 guided the vocabulary and let me 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.860
 I came here and got another way. 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:04.379
 soon the old woman believes with him this is the 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.069
 jack ripper he leaps high he 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:10.620
 walking the high is high it is more legend 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:14.610
 It's fast for you and everyone is here. 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.469
 the mother observes he does not do anything when 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.469
 he only has to laugh at what report 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:22.740
 I live in the universal church and thank you. 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.539
 there and basically this game I go 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.389
 leave link to download description 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.279
 he is very amusing and as he goes 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:33.180
 passing from cam is going enemies 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:35.099
 different as is the case here above 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:41.699
 There's a man down there and when I have 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:46.740
 who rush out to get what he 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:48.569
 and when he dies he may then not 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.810
 kill a suicide bomber and stay close to him 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:54.659
 such matei vaza we all could not 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.120
 be very time and good is that the video 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:06:00.060
 there have already enjoyed the game well 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.069
 way to play a friend of yours 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.190
 if you have a stressful day I 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:08.289
 I want to shoot the same game well. 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.599
 and here it is 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:11.619
 and we think it's cool one of them is mine 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.990
 face already made 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:22.439
 so let's finalize this video with a 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.439
 super bad spoke guys and tauÃ¡
