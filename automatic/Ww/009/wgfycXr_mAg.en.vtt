00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.800
 several hundred kilometers from the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.480
 mec to the pure as the sun I feel 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.270
 with a harmonic change 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.660
 more composing a song in my 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:37.220
 interior I know we will follow analog 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.060
 but I do not forget your magic perfume in this 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.110
 phone encounter 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:51.000
 I remembered that I'm crazy about you 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.000
 that everyone the way 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.670
 what 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.670
 at large distances 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.820
 that everything is 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.030
 when I feel you 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 near 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.370
 on page 19 you find the tabla tura 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.900
 of this song that actually the 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.940
 introduction is not for guitar is a 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.280
 adaptation so they can touch the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.140
 complete song what is important 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.650
 I want you to notice it is I think you have to 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.040
 use for each note that is indicated in 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.660
 the tablature of this song then 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.650
 that's where you should focus your attention 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.330
 because if not, if you do not type, it's fine 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.850
 probably not can not you do not you get it 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.370
 or you're going to have some bump that's going to sound 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.570
 then it will not sound good 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.570
 let's do it slowly 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.140
 all right 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.140
 i 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.860
 here is a slip 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.180
 you 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.180
 then I agreed 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.210
 and 2 harmonics 1 on the fourth string and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.640
 another in the first 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.290
 is the number enclosed in a square 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.290
 it means that it is harmonic 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.660
 world 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.660
 ah 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.090
 Y 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.420
 this being chord where it ends 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.550
 and then we start with the accompaniment 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.550
 of the song itself 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:17.709
 the suspended two are the biggest without the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:21.870
 ring finger re suspended two is a re 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.870
 older without the middle finger 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.750
 the third agreed is a the suspended two 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.440
 but with low in C sharp then 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.940
 the ring finger on the bass in the fifth 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.400
 fourth fret rope and with him with 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.150
 bending 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.989
 bending the floor index in this way 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.849
 the two strings the fourth and the third 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:55.540
 continues to hinder the sound of the second 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:58.480
 So that's the step I take to 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.909
 this chord because if it would not be very 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.840
 difficult to touch these two and step on the 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:07.220
 little finger but it is also possible 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.160
 if you can not do either of the two 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.400
 forms simply to session and no longer 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.900
 put the bass in C sharp 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.070
 because it is also marked as 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.370
 alternative 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:26.340
 but the arpeggio we use is going to be this 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:31.390
 thumb index two fingers index two fingers 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:34.620
 index two index fingers and the strum that 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.620
 we use in the in the choir 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.680
 Y 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:51.249
 ah 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:52.840
 is thumb thumb down three fingers 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:56.410
 down 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:08.340
 thumb down and grille index and the 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:10.720
 count is 1 2 3 4 and 1 2 3 4 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.290
 ah 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.290
 Y 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.970
 and it seems to me that with these indications 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.400
 you can now solve this song 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:30.449
 kilometers without flag that is in the 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:31.919
 page 18 of the 100 best romantic 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.050
 that you can also acquire it in your 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.050
