hey-ho<00:00:15.110> is<00:00:15.260> pulling<00:00:15.530> every<00:00:15.680> running

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
hey-ho is pulling every running

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.500 
hey-ho is pulling every running
injury-free<00:00:16.160> revolution<00:00:17.150> and<00:00:17.240> we've<00:00:17.330> had<00:00:17.480> a

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
injury-free revolution and we've had a

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.300 
injury-free revolution and we've had a
lot<00:00:17.869> of<00:00:17.900> people<00:00:18.140> talking<00:00:18.560> about<00:00:18.890> sort<00:00:19.250> of

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
lot of people talking about sort of

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.250 
lot of people talking about sort of
tight<00:00:19.610> adductors<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:20.240> how<00:00:20.600> you<00:00:20.660> can<00:00:20.960> tackle

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
tight adductors and how you can tackle

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.900 
tight adductors and how you can tackle
them<00:00:21.529> and<00:00:22.189> its<00:00:22.340> really<00:00:22.369> important<00:00:22.849> to

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
them and its really important to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.460 
them and its really important to
understand<00:00:23.450> your<00:00:23.599> adductors<00:00:23.810> as<00:00:24.110> a<00:00:24.140> runner

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
understand your adductors as a runner

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.380 
understand your adductors as a runner
because<00:00:24.830> we<00:00:25.460> forget<00:00:25.790> about<00:00:25.820> them<00:00:26.210> they're

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
because we forget about them they're

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.890 
because we forget about them they're
these<00:00:26.540> these<00:00:26.840> inside<00:00:27.349> muscles<00:00:27.890> on<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.520> leg

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
these these inside muscles on the leg

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.350 
these these inside muscles on the leg
but<00:00:29.900> they<00:00:30.289> are<00:00:30.650> quite<00:00:31.250> large<00:00:31.490> so<00:00:31.970> we've<00:00:32.210> got<00:00:32.330> a

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
but they are quite large so we've got a

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.390 
but they are quite large so we've got a
big<00:00:32.750> muscle<00:00:33.199> called<00:00:33.379> adductor<00:00:33.800> Magnus<00:00:34.220> that

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
big muscle called adductor Magnus that

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.820 
big muscle called adductor Magnus that
it<00:00:34.519> runs<00:00:34.730> right<00:00:35.629> sort<00:00:35.960> of<00:00:36.019> back<00:00:36.290> in<00:00:36.470> towards

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
it runs right sort of back in towards

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.799 
it runs right sort of back in towards
that<00:00:36.949> hamstring<00:00:37.460> level<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.570> actually

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
that hamstring level and it actually

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.330 
that hamstring level and it actually
comes<00:00:39.050> quite<00:00:39.350> entirely<00:00:39.769> through<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.129> front

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
comes quite entirely through the front

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.580 
comes quite entirely through the front
as<00:00:40.430> well<00:00:40.580> so<00:00:41.150> real<00:00:41.720> tension<00:00:42.260> through<00:00:42.410> there

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
as well so real tension through there

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.569 
as well so real tension through there
walking<00:00:42.860> will<00:00:43.460> limit<00:00:43.760> your<00:00:45.010> extension<00:00:46.040> it'll

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
walking will limit your extension it'll

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.549 
walking will limit your extension it'll
also<00:00:46.790> have<00:00:47.090> an<00:00:47.210> effect<00:00:47.450> on<00:00:47.629> your<00:00:47.870> affliction

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
also have an effect on your affliction

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.110 
also have an effect on your affliction
the<00:00:49.010> other<00:00:49.190> thing<00:00:49.430> that<00:00:49.460> it<00:00:49.670> does<00:00:49.700> is<00:00:50.090> it

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
the other thing that it does is it

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.080 
the other thing that it does is it
affects<00:00:50.570> your<00:00:50.780> mechanics<00:00:51.469> from<00:00:52.039> your<00:00:52.730> pelvic

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
affects your mechanics from your pelvic

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.240 
affects your mechanics from your pelvic
position<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:53.960> again<00:00:54.260> tightness<00:00:54.800> through<00:00:55.070> here

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
position so again tightness through here

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.340 
position so again tightness through here
can<00:00:55.460> kind<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.760> lock<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:56.180> up<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.539> it<00:00:56.960> almost

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
can kind of lock you up and it almost

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.229 
can kind of lock you up and it almost
wants<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:57.770> hint<00:00:58.039> you<00:00:58.250> into<00:00:58.640> almost<00:00:58.879> a<00:00:59.059> little

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
wants to hint you into almost a little

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.600 
wants to hint you into almost a little
bit<00:00:59.300> of<00:00:59.449> internal<00:00:59.899> rotation<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.739> again<00:01:01.010> we<00:01:01.430> see

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
bit of internal rotation so again we see

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:26.740 
bit of internal rotation so again we see
that<00:01:01.640> with<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.940> lot<00:01:02.149> of<00:01:02.270> runners<00:01:25.119> ok<00:01:26.119> guys<00:01:26.360> so

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
that with a lot of runners ok guys so

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.940 
that with a lot of runners ok guys so
today<00:01:27.110> we're<00:01:27.229> going<00:01:27.319> to<00:01:27.440> show<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.770> best

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
today we're going to show you the best

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.190 
today we're going to show you the best
way<00:01:28.069> to<00:01:28.099> adductor<00:01:28.819> muscles<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.840> first<00:01:30.080> way

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
way to adductor muscles the first way

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.660 
way to adductor muscles the first way
I'm<00:01:30.259> going<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.410> do<00:01:30.500> that<00:01:30.679> is<00:01:30.860> using<00:01:31.550> your

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
I'm going to do that is using your

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:40.779 
I'm going to do that is using your
contractile<00:01:32.330> acts<00:01:37.899> up<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:39.110> your<00:01:39.200> knees<00:01:39.789> so

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
contractile acts up and your knees so

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.190 
contractile acts up and your knees so
what<00:01:40.940> we<00:01:41.060> find<00:01:41.240> we<00:01:41.390> can<00:01:41.599> track<00:01:41.840> remote

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
what we find we can track remote

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.870 
what we find we can track remote
stretches<00:01:42.500> is<00:01:42.739> we<00:01:42.890> find<00:01:43.130> when<00:01:43.250> we<00:01:43.369> contract

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
stretches is we find when we contract

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.720 
stretches is we find when we contract
the<00:01:44.149> muscle<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.660> then

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.000 

gently<00:01:54.210> push<00:01:54.510> it<00:01:54.540> out<00:01:54.810> these<00:01:55.050> into<00:01:55.530> our<00:01:55.680> elbow

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
gently push it out these into our elbow

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.100 
gently push it out these into our elbow
so<00:01:56.190> we're<00:01:56.310> constructing<00:01:56.730> out<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.240> -<00:01:57.330> yeah

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
so we're constructing out here - yeah

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
so we're constructing out here - yeah
I'm<00:01:58.620> gonna<00:01:58.740> hold<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.190> for<00:01:59.400> five<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.850> eight

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
I'm gonna hold that for five to eight

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.390 
I'm gonna hold that for five to eight
seconds<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.010> do<00:02:02.280> is

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
seconds and then what I want to do is

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.010 
seconds and then what I want to do is
after<00:02:02.580> that<00:02:02.910> contraction<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.750> gently

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
after that contraction is just gently

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.260 
after that contraction is just gently
release<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.500> leads<00:02:04.980> out<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> side<00:02:05.700> let

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
release the leads out to the side let

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.210 
release the leads out to the side let
them<00:02:06.450> flop<00:02:06.720> out<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.170> side<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.830> you'll<00:02:08.100> get

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
them flop out to the side and you'll get

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.190 
them flop out to the side and you'll get
that<00:02:08.369> nice<00:02:08.550> stretch<00:02:08.730> let<00:02:09.150> me<00:02:09.210> try<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.450> again

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
that nice stretch let me try that again

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.230 
that nice stretch let me try that again
so<00:02:10.440> we've<00:02:10.560> pushed<00:02:10.740> up<00:02:11.040> into<00:02:11.340> our<00:02:11.790> elbow<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.180> I'm

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
so we've pushed up into our elbow so I'm

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.840 
so we've pushed up into our elbow so I'm
going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.390> hold<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.780> stretch<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.560> five<00:02:14.130> four

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
going to hold that stretch for five four

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.960 
going to hold that stretch for five four
three<00:02:15.410> two<00:02:16.410> one<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.370> then<00:02:17.580> I'm<00:02:17.700> going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.880> look

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
three two one and then I'm going to look

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.030 
three two one and then I'm going to look
at<00:02:18.090> let<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.450> release<00:02:18.690> down<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.890> what<00:02:20.010> you

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
at let it release down and what you

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.190 
at let it release down and what you
should<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.520> each<00:02:21.000> time<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.750> stretch<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
should be each time that you stretch the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.410 
should be each time that you stretch the
muscle<00:02:22.500> out<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.550> those<00:02:23.910> knees<00:02:24.180> will

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
muscle out but that those knees will

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.790 
muscle out but that those knees will
actually<00:02:24.750> get<00:02:24.870> large<00:02:25.140> with<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.410> ground<00:02:25.650> and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
actually get large with the ground and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.530 
actually get large with the ground and
you'll<00:02:25.920> get<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.160> nice<00:02:26.400> stretch<00:02:27.030> -<00:02:27.270> yeah

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540
