00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.100 
a longy read Mitchell has a little bit
of<00:01:47.490> shimmer<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.080> reason

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
of shimmer in it and that is the reason

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.200 
of shimmer in it and that is the reason
why<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> chose<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.860> because<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.550> has<00:01:50.700> shimmer<00:01:50.970> in

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
why I chose it because it has shimmer in

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.560 
why I chose it because it has shimmer in
it<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:52.910> didn't<00:01:53.910> want<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.540> just

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
it I didn't want it to be just

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.930 
it I didn't want it to be just
completely<00:01:55.410> mad<00:01:56.010> in<00:01:56.220> that<00:01:56.370> particular<00:01:56.520> area

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
completely mad in that particular area

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.609 
completely mad in that particular area
so<00:01:57.180> i'm<00:01:57.300> putting<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.990> patent<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.440> on

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
so i'm putting that and patent that on

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.710 
so i'm putting that and patent that on
there<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.190> as<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.180> tell<00:02:00.210> them<00:02:00.420> using

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
there and as you can tell them using

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.719 
there and as you can tell them using
patting<00:02:01.080> motions<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.710> using<00:02:02.009> patent<00:02:02.369> motion

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
patting motions and using patent motion

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.700 
patting motions and using patent motion
so<00:02:02.910> that<00:02:02.940> my<00:02:03.420> color<00:02:03.660> will<00:02:03.900> be<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.350> know<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.500> bit

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
so that my color will be you know a bit

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.400 
so that my color will be you know a bit
more<00:02:04.740> intense<00:02:05.310> especially<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:07.259> these

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
more intense especially I have these

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.260 
more intense especially I have these
individual<00:02:08.040> lashes<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.820> don't<00:02:09.000> want<00:02:09.179> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
individual lashes on and I don't want to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.260 
individual lashes on and I don't want to
get<00:02:09.649> powder<00:02:10.649> all<00:02:11.070> in<00:02:11.370> them<00:02:11.580> even<00:02:11.940> though<00:02:12.060> it's

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
get powder all in them even though it's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.060 
get powder all in them even though it's
inevitable<00:02:12.870> you're<00:02:13.080> going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.380> get<00:02:13.470> powder<00:02:13.739> in

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
inevitable you're going to get powder in

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.660 
inevitable you're going to get powder in
them<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:15.380> then<00:02:16.380> I'm<00:02:16.560> going<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.770> go<00:02:16.890> with<00:02:17.070> golden

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
bronze from the learning that brown

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.340 
bronze from the learning that brown
clothes<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.730> just<00:02:20.910> showed<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:22.080> is

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
clothes that I just showed you that is

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.810 
clothes that I just showed you that is
going<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.739> be<00:02:22.830> my<00:02:22.980> crease<00:02:23.250> color<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.760> I'm

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
going to be my crease color and I'm

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.870 
going to be my crease color and I'm
going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.000> keep<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.330> low<00:02:25.370> as<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.670> see<00:02:26.850> i

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
going to keep it low as you can see i

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.180 
going to keep it low as you can see i
start<00:02:27.300> with<00:02:27.450> small<00:02:27.600> circles<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.680> then<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
start with small circles and then and to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.240 
start with small circles and then and to
ensure<00:02:29.550> why<00:02:29.670> promotion<00:02:30.830> when<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.950> do<00:02:32.100> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
ensure why promotion when you do the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.620 
ensure why promotion when you do the
small<00:02:32.459> surface<00:02:32.790> when<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.120> first<00:02:33.360> start

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
small surface when you first start

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.259 
small surface when you first start
you're<00:02:33.810> basically<00:02:34.820> depositing<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.030> most

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
you're basically depositing the most

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.830 
you're basically depositing the most
color<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.830> edge<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:39.299> that's<00:02:39.510> why<00:02:39.660> they

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
color on the edge and that's why they

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.360 
color on the edge and that's why they
start<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.380> then<00:02:40.500> do<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.769> couple<00:02:41.280> of

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
start there and then do a couple of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.680 
start there and then do a couple of
small<00:02:41.549> circles<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.150> then<00:02:42.269> start<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:42.630> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
small circles and then start with the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.490 
small circles and then start with the
windshield<00:02:42.959> wiper<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.110> want<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.380> keep

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
windshield wiper so you want to keep

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.940 
windshield wiper so you want to keep
doing<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:48.080> if<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.200> hear<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.440> noise<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:49.920> the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
doing that if you hear that noise in the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.380 
doing that if you hear that noise in the
background<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.610> was<00:02:50.820> actually<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
background that was actually the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.539 
background that was actually the
microwave<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.709> other<00:02:52.890> notes<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
microwave and the other notes is the

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.570 
microwave and the other notes is the
fish<00:02:53.970> tank<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:55.560> I'm<00:02:55.680> going<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:55.920> take<00:02:56.070> my<00:02:56.220> manly

going to be a black that is a shingle

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.820 
going to be a black that is a shingle
roof<00:03:23.790> black<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.120> believe<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:25.350> once<00:03:25.530> again<00:03:25.650> you

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
do little circles into the crease area

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.190 
do little circles into the crease area
that's<00:03:36.810> what<00:03:36.960> you<00:03:37.080> want<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.290> do<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:39.200> that

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
that's what you want to do and that
