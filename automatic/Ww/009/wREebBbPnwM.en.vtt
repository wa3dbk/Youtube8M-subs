00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.370 

when<00:00:01.260> I'm<00:00:01.410> sea<00:00:01.829> fishing<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:03.060> use<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.720> few

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
when I'm sea fishing I use a few

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.190 
when I'm sea fishing I use a few
different<00:00:04.529> rigs<00:00:05.240> but<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.450> one<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:06.990> use

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
different rigs but the one that I use

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.299 
different rigs but the one that I use
most<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.400> time<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.030> sliding<00:00:09.710> ledger<00:00:10.710> rig

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
most of the time is a sliding ledger rig

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.060 
most of the time is a sliding ledger rig
and<00:00:12.440> it's<00:00:13.440> very<00:00:13.830> very<00:00:14.400> easy<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:15.059> tie<00:00:15.859> this<00:00:16.859> is

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and it's very very easy to tie this is

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.010 
and it's very very easy to tie this is
the<00:00:17.520> method<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.060> use<00:00:18.500> on<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.949> end<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.250> my

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
the method that I use on the end of my

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.259 
the method that I use on the end of my
shock<00:00:22.020> leader<00:00:22.580> is<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:24.300> swivel<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.910> all<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.119> is

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
shock leader is a swivel and all I do is

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.580 
shock leader is a swivel and all I do is
attach<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.730> short<00:00:29.730> piece<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.000> line<00:00:30.689> same

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
attach a short piece of line same

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.060 
attach a short piece of line same
breaking<00:00:32.460> strain<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.899> shock<00:00:34.170> leader<00:00:34.440> in

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
breaking strain as the shock leader in

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.520 
breaking strain as the shock leader in
this<00:00:35.280> case<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.790> 40<00:00:36.329> pound<00:00:37.399> then<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.670> put<00:00:39.450> on

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.900 

weight<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.600> this<00:00:45.600> particular<00:00:46.050> weight<00:00:46.500> I

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
weight and this particular weight I

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.500 
weight and this particular weight I
would<00:00:47.910> use<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:49.079> an<00:00:49.469> estuary<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.399> fish<00:00:50.730> this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
would use in an estuary that I fish this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.250 
would use in an estuary that I fish this
is<00:00:51.570> only<00:00:51.840> 3<00:00:52.440> ounce<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:54.449> s3<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.500> fish

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
is only 3 ounce the s3 that I fish

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.450 
is only 3 ounce the s3 that I fish
doesn't<00:00:58.260> involve<00:00:58.559> long<00:00:59.190> casting<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.460> that's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
doesn't involve long casting so that's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
doesn't involve long casting so that's
the<00:01:02.670> weight<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> use<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.229> 3<00:01:04.500> ounces

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the weight that I use is just a 3 ounces

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.160 
the weight that I use is just a 3 ounces
when<00:01:05.189> I'm<00:01:05.280> beach<00:01:05.489> casting<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.240> would<00:01:06.960> use<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
when I'm beach casting I would use a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.800 
when I'm beach casting I would use a
weight<00:01:07.470> much<00:01:07.979> bigger<00:01:08.250> than<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.510> but<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.600> say

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
weight much bigger than that but to say

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.240 
weight much bigger than that but to say
that's<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.260> type<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.500> weight<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> would<00:01:11.010> use

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that's the type of weight I would use

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:21.289 
that's the type of weight I would use
for<00:01:11.450> an<00:01:12.450> estuary<00:01:13.760> then<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.619> put<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.770> bead<00:01:20.299> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
for an estuary then I put on a bead and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.320 
for an estuary then I put on a bead and
then<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:22.159> tie<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.780> another<00:01:24.780> swivel<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:27.150> so

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
then I tie on another swivel and so

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.670 
then I tie on another swivel and so
that's<00:01:27.479> swivel<00:01:28.310> your<00:01:29.310> touch<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.900> hawk<00:01:31.049> length

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.429 

and<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:34.890> it

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
and that's it

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.959 
and that's it
basic<00:01:37.310> straightforward<00:01:39.759> sliding<00:01:40.759> ledger<00:01:41.659> rig

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
basic straightforward sliding ledger rig

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.990 
basic straightforward sliding ledger rig
very<00:01:43.969> very<00:01:44.509> easy<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:45.049> set<00:01:45.619> up<00:01:45.649> very<00:01:46.250> very<00:01:46.310> easy

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
very very easy to set up very very easy

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.480 
very very easy to set up very very easy
to<00:01:47.270> tie<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.679> advantages<00:01:49.219> of<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:50.179> sliding

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
to tie and the advantages of a sliding

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.219 
to tie and the advantages of a sliding
ledger<00:01:52.490> rig<00:01:52.819> is<00:01:53.539> that<00:01:53.719> when<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:53.990> fish<00:01:54.200> takes

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
ledger rig is that when the fish takes

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.969 
ledger rig is that when the fish takes
the<00:01:54.649> bait<00:01:54.759> it's<00:01:55.759> not<00:01:56.000> pulling<00:01:56.569> on<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:57.799> weight

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
the bait it's not pulling on the weight

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.809 
the bait it's not pulling on the weight
and<00:01:58.369> also<00:01:59.299> you<00:01:59.899> can<00:02:00.049> detect<00:02:00.500> bites<00:02:00.859> much

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
and also you can detect bites much

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.469 
and also you can detect bites much
easier<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.390> wrong<00:02:03.219> as<00:02:04.219> I<00:02:04.280> say<00:02:04.579> what<00:02:05.179> type<00:02:05.450> of

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
easier is wrong as I say what type of

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.270 
easier is wrong as I say what type of
weight<00:02:05.810> I<00:02:06.140> would<00:02:06.920> use<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:07.670> an<00:02:08.479> estuary<00:02:09.280> but

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
weight I would use on an estuary but

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.759 
weight I would use on an estuary but
when<00:02:10.399> I'm<00:02:10.519> beach<00:02:10.700> casting<00:02:11.239> I<00:02:11.450> would<00:02:12.260> use<00:02:12.500> a

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
when I'm beach casting I would use a

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.520 
when I'm beach casting I would use a
weight<00:02:13.549> much<00:02:14.209> bigger<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.049> three<00:02:15.379> ounce

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
weight much bigger this is a three ounce

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.970 
weight much bigger this is a three ounce
weight<00:02:16.000> beach<00:02:17.000> casting<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:18.170> talking<00:02:18.620> four

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
weight beach casting you talking four

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.319 
weight beach casting you talking four
five<00:02:19.340> even<00:02:19.730> six<00:02:19.760> ounce<00:02:20.329> weights<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.950> that's<00:02:22.069> it

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
five even six ounce weights so that's it

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:27.849 
five even six ounce weights so that's it
it's<00:02:23.329> a<00:02:23.450> sliding<00:02:24.160> ledger<00:02:25.160> rig
