00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
and I'll explain why in a minute and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.190 
and I'll explain why in a minute and
another<00:02:06.420> bunch<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.930> tissues<00:02:07.259> holding<00:02:07.940> an<00:02:08.940> old

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
another bunch of tissues holding an old

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.410 
another bunch of tissues holding an old
now<00:02:10.200> brush<00:02:10.530> he<00:02:10.830> says<00:02:11.069> lots<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.459> tissue<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.879> an

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
now brush he says lots of tissue and an

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.670 
now brush he says lots of tissue and an
old<00:02:12.599> again<00:02:12.959> nylon<00:02:13.470> brush

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
old again nylon brush

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.039 
old again nylon brush
nail<00:02:14.010> brush<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.909> I'll<00:02:15.060> explain<00:02:15.390> why<00:02:15.510> again<00:02:15.959> in

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
nail brush and I'll explain why again in

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.780 
nail brush and I'll explain why again in
a<00:02:16.140> minute<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.890> let<00:02:17.219> me<00:02:17.280> just<00:02:17.400> get<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:17.670> actual

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
a minute so let me just get the actual

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.910 
a minute so let me just get the actual
word<00:02:18.150> drone<00:02:18.390> out<00:02:18.719> and<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.290> can<00:02:19.319> have<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> quick

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
word drone out and you can have a quick

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.300 
word drone out and you can have a quick
look<00:02:19.950> how<00:02:20.849> this<00:02:21.120> fits<00:02:21.890> because<00:02:22.890> I'll<00:02:23.069> see<00:02:23.189> I've

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
look how this fits because I'll see I've

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.250 
look how this fits because I'll see I've
got<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> black<00:02:23.700> on<00:02:23.879> black<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:24.329> so<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.959> blades

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
got a black on black here so the blades

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.360 
got a black on black here so the blades
have<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.099> aligned<00:02:26.579> perfectly<00:02:28.250> along<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
have to be aligned perfectly along the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.309 
have to be aligned perfectly along the
length<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.819> unit<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.329> then<00:02:31.019> it<00:02:31.139> just

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
length of the unit and then it just

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.949 
length of the unit and then it just
literally<00:02:31.680> drops<00:02:32.159> in<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.939> knocking<00:02:33.689> the

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
literally drops in this is knocking the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.470 
literally drops in this is knocking the
propeller<00:02:35.689> if<00:02:36.689> you<00:02:36.900> don't<00:02:37.109> have<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:38.299> column<00:02:39.299> a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
propeller if you don't have the column a

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.729 
propeller if you don't have the column a
little<00:02:39.780> bit<00:02:40.139> of<00:02:40.230> play<00:02:42.139> so<00:02:43.139> the<00:02:43.349> unit<00:02:43.560> doesn't

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
little bit of play so the unit doesn't

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.710 
little bit of play so the unit doesn't
move<00:02:43.920> around<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.310> little<00:02:44.370> bit<00:02:44.579> so<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.510> really

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
move around a little bit so you really

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.729 
move around a little bit so you really
want<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> make<00:02:45.989> sure<00:02:46.049> that<00:02:46.260> you've<00:02:46.500> got<00:02:46.530> your

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
want to make sure that you've got your

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.869 
want to make sure that you've got your
apt<00:02:47.069> door<00:02:47.189> hang<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:47.629> in<00:02:48.629> place<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:50.400> hold<00:02:50.609> the

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
apt door hang on in place to hold the

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.629 
apt door hang on in place to hold the
layout<00:02:51.810> drone<00:02:52.079> in<00:02:52.260> place<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:53.189> it<00:02:53.280> does<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.459> good

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
layout drone in place and it does a good

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.909 
layout drone in place and it does a good
job<00:02:53.700> doing<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.239> each<00:02:55.079> battery<00:02:55.409> is<00:02:55.620> held<00:02:55.859> down

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
job doing that each battery is held down

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.379 
job doing that each battery is held down
by<00:02:56.099> good<00:02:56.909> velcro<00:02:58.010> straps<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.849> it's<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.359> very

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
by good velcro straps and it's a very

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.190 
by good velcro straps and it's a very
neat<00:03:00.930> very<00:03:01.469> recessed<00:03:02.099> hole<00:03:02.819> for<00:03:03.180> each<00:03:03.299> one<00:03:03.540> I'm

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
neat very recessed hole for each one I'm

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.869 
neat very recessed hole for each one I'm
going<00:03:04.409> to<00:03:04.500> just<00:03:04.680> put<00:03:04.859> sewing<00:03:05.099> white<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:05.669> just

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
going to just put sewing white in just

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.670 
going to just put sewing white in just
so<00:03:05.939> you<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.120> see<00:03:06.180> what<00:03:06.450> i<00:03:06.480> mean<00:03:06.629> by<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:06.840> so

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
so you can see what i mean by this so

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.729 
so you can see what i mean by this so
it's<00:03:07.950> actually<00:03:08.280> quite<00:03:08.489> deep<00:03:09.049> so<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.079> little

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
it's actually quite deep so a little

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.229 
it's actually quite deep so a little
white<00:03:11.010> bit<00:03:11.219> of<00:03:11.310> cardboard<00:03:11.790> there<00:03:11.969> the<00:03:12.090> right

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
white bit of cardboard there the right

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.300 
white bit of cardboard there the right
color<00:03:12.450> size<00:03:12.689> as<00:03:13.439> you<00:03:13.590> can<00:03:13.709> see<00:03:13.859> if<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.189> drop

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
color size as you can see if I just drop

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.979 
color size as you can see if I just drop
that<00:03:14.340> down<00:03:14.639> you<00:03:15.239> off<00:03:15.329> another<00:03:15.629> parrot

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
that down you off another parrot

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.229 
that down you off another parrot
ar.drone<00:03:16.230> battery<00:03:16.799> by<00:03:16.980> now<00:03:17.189> so<00:03:17.609> if<00:03:18.030> i<00:03:18.090> drop

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
ar.drone battery by now so if i drop

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.960 
ar.drone battery by now so if i drop
that<00:03:18.389> value<00:03:18.750> see<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.019> goes<00:03:19.229> down<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.970> good

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
that value see it goes down a good

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.059 
that value see it goes down a good
center<00:03:21.720> with<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.900> half<00:03:22.079> so<00:03:22.440> i<00:03:22.500> put<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:22.859> width

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
center with a half so i put it in width

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.819 
center with a half so i put it in width
ways<00:03:23.419> it's<00:03:24.419> almost<00:03:24.690> flushing<00:03:25.139> out<00:03:25.229> so<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:25.620> just

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
ways it's almost flushing out so we just

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.729 
ways it's almost flushing out so we just
again<00:03:26.430> use<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.940> white<00:03:27.090> card<00:03:27.359> here<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.590> back

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
again use the white card here the back

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:29.809 
again use the white card here the back
on<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:28.949> front<00:03:29.159> so<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.370> see<00:03:29.579> what<00:03:29.699> I'm

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
on the front so you can see what I'm

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.699 
on the front so you can see what I'm
doing<00:03:29.849> now<00:03:30.269> there's<00:03:31.139> actually<00:03:31.439> enough<00:03:31.560> room

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
doing now there's actually enough room

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.000 
doing now there's actually enough room
underneath<00:03:32.389> the<00:03:33.389> battery<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:34.560> if<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.799> want

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
underneath the battery that if you want

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.849 
underneath the battery that if you want
to<00:03:35.220> tuck<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.060> wire<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.049> cables<00:03:37.530> underneath

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
to tuck the wire and cables underneath

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.250 
to tuck the wire and cables underneath
you<00:03:38.189> can<00:03:38.430> do<00:03:38.609> so<00:03:39.479> you<00:03:39.540> don't<00:03:39.840> want<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.049> wires

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
you can do so you don't want the wires

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.319 
you can do so you don't want the wires
loose<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.859> think<00:03:41.519> that's<00:03:41.669> particularly<00:03:42.150> more

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
loose I think that's particularly more

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.819 
loose I think that's particularly more
useful<00:03:42.599> for<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.930> I've<00:03:43.019> got<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.319> ar.drone

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
useful for that I've got the ar.drone

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.589 
useful for that I've got the ar.drone
one<00:03:44.400> batteries<00:03:44.879> where<00:03:45.090> you've<00:03:45.209> got<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.359> little

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
one batteries where you've got a little

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.229 
one batteries where you've got a little
bit<00:03:45.750> more<00:03:45.900> wiring<00:03:46.409> and<00:03:46.859> cables<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.609> but

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
bit more wiring and cables going on but

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.819 
bit more wiring and cables going on but
as<00:03:48.449> you<00:03:48.599> can<00:03:48.659> see<00:03:48.900> with<00:03:49.169> why<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.379> batteries

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
as you can see with why the batteries
