00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.190
 Hello, girls and guys, how are you? 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.320
 I hope very well and I am super 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.600
 happy because even though I entered 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.750
 a little here I bring you the second 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.210
 this week's special video of return 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.680
 to classes really missed this I 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.570
 I hope you are also 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.550
 liking and good today 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.320
 I bring something that I think he has never said 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.810
 in a week back to school but 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.270
 I really loved the idea and they are some 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.800
 nails and I will show them closely 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.350
 to see them by the way I bring my 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.420
 scissors ring and it's pretty ugly 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.210
 but I still like it because they are 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.410
 scissors and then inside this 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.500
 thematic 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.859
 this is the design of the nails I hope that 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.489
 you can see it well it 's as if they were 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:58.370
 notebook sheets to me I loved the 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.070
 idea the truth and good the seriousness that the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.730
 technique to make them is quite easy 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.130
 you should not have a good pulse or anything you do not use 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.940
 many glazes and good if you want to know 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.250
 how to do 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.250
 these nail sheets notebook 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.370
 keep watching the video 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.710
 the first step is with a white enamel 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.960
 paint all our nails 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.390
 I'm using that brand 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.090
 white because I really get a 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.680
 very pleasant surprise with those enamels as well 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.250
 that I recommend that you cheer up 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.250
 try them 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.880
 let's let them dry and the next 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.729
 what am I going to do that really if 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.100
 they prefer what they can do before 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.740
 prepare the decoration that we are going to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.499
 put our nails for that what 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.709
 we will need is a picture sheet 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:55.799
 boy feathers of different colors and one 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:58.859
 rule or squad the first thing we're going to 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.740
 to do is mark the entire grid of 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:04.729
 our sheet with the blue pen since 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.920
 well the squares are already that color 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.440
 and it would really reach them with half 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.370
 sheet but then I found that and decided 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.370
 make it all 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.280
 it is very very important that it be well 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.280
 marked everything 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.440
 once we finish what we 're going to 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.090
 do is divide into several pieces 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.470
 to use them in each of our 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.750
 nail 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.240
 I divided it in half and so on until 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.850
 12 pieces were left in case 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.880
 wrong in something and what follows then 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.340
 is decorating can make letters dibujitos 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.560
 or numbers but for the letters or numbers 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.080
 remember that how are we going to make a 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.060
 transfer you must put them upside down 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.060
 so they are right on your nails 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.810
 now to transfer it what we're going to 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.120
 use is a little boat with alcohol 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.940
 let's dip our nail in the 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.180
 alcohol and then we will press with 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.489
 the sheet and how they see that is going 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.400
 transferring you have to have a lot 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.640
 careful to press well and throughout the 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.080
 area of the nail since once you 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.000
 we put there believe me it's not going to erase 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.370
 so that it looks good we have to 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.170
 do it all at once anyway 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.170
 they do not have to stay perfect 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.890
 and that's how all my nails were 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.630
 the last thing we're going to do is seal 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.660
 so you can use a brightness or 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.730
 nuanced in this case I chose the 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.310
 nuanced since obviously the 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.740
 notebook sheets are matte but with a 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.740
 Brightness would also look very pretty 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.900
 and with that they are ready as you can see 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.900
 it's pretty easy 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.830
 that you liked the idea to me and of 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.990
 I really did something super original and 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.910
 quite father I do not know if they dare to 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.370
 do it they know they can leave me a 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.200
 picture on my social networks I have twitter 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.480
 facebook instagram 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.090
 so that I can see them I wait for them in 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.310
 the comments to see what they thought 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.610
 and see you in the next video of this 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.610
 special week back to school bye
