quite<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.370> tea<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.609> well<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.270> was<00:01:01.020> good

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.270 

oh<00:01:07.799> no<00:01:08.799> not<00:01:08.979> really<00:01:09.039> i<00:01:09.549> think<00:01:09.850> we<00:01:10.740> prob<00:01:11.740> maybe

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
oh no not really i think we prob maybe

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.130 
oh no not really i think we prob maybe
nicest<00:01:12.820> made<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.090> few<00:01:13.329> changes<00:01:13.420> defensively

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.639 

but<00:01:17.610> having<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.759> two<00:01:18.939> playmakers<00:01:19.360> there<00:01:19.780> we

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
but having the two playmakers there we

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.230 
but having the two playmakers there we
could<00:01:20.860> have<00:01:20.950> played<00:01:21.070> deal<00:01:21.429> to<00:01:21.729> this<00:01:21.850> pipe<00:01:22.090> off

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
could have played deal to this pipe off

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.419 
could have played deal to this pipe off
a<00:01:22.450> bit<00:01:22.659> more<00:01:22.810> Center<00:01:23.110> I<00:01:23.140> think<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:23.950> just<00:01:24.159> want<00:01:24.369> to

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429
