00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.360 

the<00:00:00.599> success<00:00:01.020> of<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.319> program<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:02.010> going<00:00:02.250> to

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
the success of the program is going to

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.920 
the success of the program is going to
be<00:00:02.460> tested<00:00:03.149> by<00:00:03.870> our<00:00:03.899> ability<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.620> also<00:00:05.660> to<00:00:06.660> have

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
be tested by our ability to also to have

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.980 
be tested by our ability to also to have
power<00:00:07.290> over<00:00:07.770> matter<00:00:08.150> because<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.269> program<00:00:09.719> to

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
power over matter because the program to

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:20.720 
power over matter because the program to
put<00:00:10.230> simply<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:11.219> mind<00:00:11.700> over<00:00:12.120> matter<00:00:19.699> when<00:00:20.699> I

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
put simply is mind over matter when I

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.320 
put simply is mind over matter when I
first<00:00:21.090> started<00:00:21.619> teaching<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:25.490> after<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.880> moved

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
inherited them or somebody it was gifted

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.950 
inherited them or somebody it was gifted
or<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:38.220> came<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.700> some<00:01:38.909> other<00:01:39.060> way<00:01:41.630> but<00:01:42.630> then<00:01:42.810> we

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
or it came in some other way but then we

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.289 
or it came in some other way but then we
put<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> period<00:01:43.619> visit<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.369> has<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.939> through

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
put a period visit it has to be through

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.690 
put a period visit it has to be through
my<00:01:45.329> hard<00:01:45.750> earned<00:01:45.840> money<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
my hard earned money so I will go and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.670 
my hard earned money so I will go and
work<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.780> are<00:01:48.930> not<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> make

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
work but then you are not going to make

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.389 
work but then you are not going to make
enough<00:01:49.979> money<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:51.600> buy<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> Mercedes<00:01:52.350> Benz<00:01:52.560> so

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
enough money to buy a Mercedes Benz so

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.219 
enough money to buy a Mercedes Benz so
this<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.820> all<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.780> blahblah

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
this is all because of the blahblah

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.310 
this is all because of the blahblah
brain<00:01:55.790> because<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.820> works<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.600> cause<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
brain because it works on cause and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.810 
brain because it works on cause and
effect<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.380> Mercedes<00:02:01.799> Benz<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.520> like

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
effect so the Mercedes Benz is like like

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.719 
effect so the Mercedes Benz is like like
say<00:02:03.890> $70,000<00:02:05.299> so<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:07.039> $70,000<00:02:08.039> then

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
say $70,000 so if it is $70,000 then

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.029 
say $70,000 so if it is $70,000 then
what<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.509> now<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.200> don't<00:02:10.619> make

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
what you have to do now I don't make

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.590 
what you have to do now I don't make
that<00:02:11.220> kind<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.580> money<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:12.180> not

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
that kind of money I have not

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.860 
that kind of money I have not
to<00:02:12.720> qualify<00:02:12.990> for<00:02:13.350> my<00:02:15.980> mortgage<00:02:17.510> now<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.570> don't

to qualify for my mortgage now you don't

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.650 
to qualify for my mortgage now you don't
have<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.080> qualify<00:02:19.320> for<00:02:19.590> anything<00:02:20.570> where<00:02:21.570> do

have to qualify for anything where do
you<00:02:21.750> ask<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.140> question<00:02:22.580> what<00:02:23.580> asked<00:02:23.850> this

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
you ask this question what asked this

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.330 
you ask this question what asked this
question<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:25.140> part<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.770> brain<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
question is this part of the brain the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.130 
question is this part of the brain the
whole<00:02:26.900> brain<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.950> screwed<00:02:29.310> up<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:30.140> also

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
whole brain here is screwed up and also

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.500 
whole brain here is screwed up and also
back<00:02:31.530> here<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:33.450> parietal<00:02:33.780> lobe<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.320> also<00:02:34.740> a

back here to the parietal lobe is also a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.290 
back here to the parietal lobe is also a
you<00:02:36.510> know<00:02:36.660> creative<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.850> have<00:02:39.060> to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
you know creative this so you have to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.390 
you know creative this so you have to
get<00:02:39.720> rid<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.930> via<00:02:40.290> surgically<00:02:40.920> we<00:02:41.160> have<00:02:41.280> to

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
get rid of via surgically we have to

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.160 
get rid of via surgically we have to
remove<00:02:41.700> all<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.090> brain<00:02:44.450> then<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.660> will<00:02:45.870> have

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
remove all this brain then we will have

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.800 
remove all this brain then we will have
a<00:02:46.440> better<00:02:46.980> brain<00:02:47.250> because<00:02:48.210> it<00:02:48.240> stops

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
a better brain because it stops

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.560 
a better brain because it stops
everything
