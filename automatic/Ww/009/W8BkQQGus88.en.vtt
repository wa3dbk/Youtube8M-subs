00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
that's double-sided let me take this out

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.240 
that's double-sided let me take this out
again<00:03:24.360> this<00:03:25.360> has<00:03:25.600> two<00:03:25.900> sides<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.620> have<00:03:26.830> stuff<00:03:27.070> on

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
again this has two sides I have stuff on

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.000 
again this has two sides I have stuff on
this<00:03:27.370> side<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.020> have<00:03:29.170> stuff<00:03:29.410> on<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:29.770> side

this side and I have stuff on this side

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.390 
this side and I have stuff on this side
and<00:03:30.850> let's<00:03:31.840> say<00:03:32.080> that<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:32.320> just<00:03:32.410> wanted<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.160> make

and let's say that I just wanted to make

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.180 
and let's say that I just wanted to make
this<00:03:34.239> into<00:03:34.600> two<00:03:34.870> separate<00:03:35.500> pieces<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.980> paper

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
this into two separate pieces of paper

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.050 
this into two separate pieces of paper

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
this is two to one now for this

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.309 
this is two to one now for this
demonstration<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:45.030> want<00:03:45.300> I<00:03:45.480> had<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.660> two<00:03:45.959> sided
