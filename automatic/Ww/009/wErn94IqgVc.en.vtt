00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
because I've been from the start of my

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.610 
because I've been from the start of my
career<00:02:19.970> I've<00:02:20.209> always<00:02:20.390> been<00:02:20.629> that<00:02:21.079> they<00:02:21.290> linked

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.350 
me to ask it as kid was linked to me and
I<00:02:23.540> think<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:24.549> what<00:02:25.549> he<00:02:25.640> talks<00:02:25.879> about<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
I think that what he talks about the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.270 
I think that what he talks about the
depth<00:02:26.569> he<00:02:26.720> goes<00:02:26.900> into<00:02:27.140> his<00:02:27.319> really<00:02:27.739> like<00:02:27.950> um

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
depth he goes into his really like um

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.399 
depth he goes into his really like um
he's<00:02:29.090> got<00:02:29.269> a<00:02:29.299> character<00:02:29.689> behind<00:02:29.959> him<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.260> get

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
he's got a character behind him you get

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.170 
he's got a character behind him you get
me<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:30.709> when<00:02:30.859> he<00:02:30.920> talks<00:02:31.159> it<00:02:31.340> he<00:02:31.819> can<00:02:32.030> be<00:02:32.150> very

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
me so when he talks it he can be very

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.229 
me so when he talks it he can be very
deep<00:02:32.720> he<00:02:33.439> can<00:02:33.620> be<00:02:33.739> emotional<00:02:34.340> we<00:02:34.489> had<00:02:34.579> sarcasm

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
deep he can be emotional we had sarcasm

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.520 
deep he can be emotional we had sarcasm
