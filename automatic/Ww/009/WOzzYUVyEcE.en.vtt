00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.750 
house which blocks wind to the right
there's<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.190> line<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.640> trees<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:34.760> facing

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
there's this line of trees and facing

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.730 
there's this line of trees and facing
west<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.600> could<00:02:36.780> see<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> hill

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
west you could see that it's on a hill

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.350 
west you could see that it's on a hill
so<00:02:38.040> if<00:02:38.100> there<00:02:38.250> are<00:02:38.310> any<00:02:38.400> wind<00:02:38.760> coming<00:02:39.060> directly

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
so if there are any wind coming directly

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.590 
so if there are any wind coming directly
from<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.720> west<00:02:39.930> hopefully<00:02:41.480> combination<00:02:42.480> of

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
from the west hopefully combination of

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.720 
from the west hopefully combination of
the<00:02:42.690> trees<00:02:42.960> and<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> hill<00:02:43.530> would<00:02:43.740> help<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.370> on

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
the trees and the hill would help and on

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.900 
the trees and the hill would help and on
this<00:02:44.910> side<00:02:46.040> again<00:02:47.040> there's<00:02:47.430> another<00:02:47.550> hill

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
this side again there's another hill

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.400 
this side again there's another hill
sloping<00:02:48.510> up<00:02:48.630> towards<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.990> house<00:02:49.140> that's

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
sloping up towards the house that's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.440 
sloping up towards the house that's
behind<00:02:49.680> me<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.580> felt<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.210> was<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
behind me so I felt like this was the

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.780 
behind me so I felt like this was the
most<00:02:51.750> protected<00:02:52.590> place<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:53.040> my<00:02:53.190> property<00:02:53.700> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
most protected place on my property to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.960 
most protected place on my property to
put<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.620> will<00:02:55.620> eventually<00:02:55.920> build<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.490> step<00:02:56.790> in

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
put it I will eventually build a step in

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.030 
put it I will eventually build a step in
the<00:02:57.060> front<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.810> step<00:02:58.050> up<00:02:58.200> into<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.590> front<00:02:58.830> door

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040
