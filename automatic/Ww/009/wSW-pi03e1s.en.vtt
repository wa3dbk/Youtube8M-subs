00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:12.560 
okay I got my power supply down here let

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.620 
okay I got my power supply down here let
me<00:00:12.650> go<00:00:12.740> ahead<00:00:12.770> and<00:00:13.010> plug<00:00:13.400> it<00:00:13.580> in

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.880 

plugged<00:00:17.050> in<00:00:17.429> now<00:00:18.429> I<00:00:18.820> don't<00:00:19.539> know<00:00:19.660> if<00:00:19.779> y'all<00:00:20.410> i'm

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
plugged in now I don't know if y'all i'm

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.169 
plugged in now I don't know if y'all i'm
sure<00:00:21.099> most<00:00:21.279> you<00:00:21.429> know<00:00:21.550> how<00:00:21.640> to<00:00:21.699> do<00:00:21.880> this<00:00:22.000> but

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:22.179 
sure most you know how to do this but

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.150 
sure most you know how to do this but
you<00:00:22.300> can<00:00:22.449> actually<00:00:22.960> turn<00:00:23.470> the<00:00:23.710> power<00:00:23.859> supply

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
you can actually turn the power supply

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.159 
you can actually turn the power supply
power<00:00:24.759> on<00:00:25.149> without<00:00:25.480> actually<00:00:25.809> having<00:00:25.930> and

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
power on without actually having and

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.099 
power on without actually having and
hooked<00:00:26.349> up<00:00:26.559> to<00:00:26.829> the<00:00:27.099> computer<00:00:27.579> and<00:00:28.539> what<00:00:29.019> you

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
hooked up to the computer and what you

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.819 
hooked up to the computer and what you
want<00:00:29.259> to<00:00:29.320> do<00:00:29.439> if<00:00:29.559> you<00:00:29.679> look<00:00:29.919> at<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:31.140> 24-pin<00:00:32.140> see

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
want to do if you look at the 24-pin see

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.310 
want to do if you look at the 24-pin see
the<00:00:32.949> green<00:00:33.190> you<00:00:34.000> short-circuit<00:00:34.900> the<00:00:34.930> green

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
the green you short-circuit the green

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.280 
the green you short-circuit the green
and<00:00:35.699> either<00:00:36.699> the<00:00:37.120> black<00:00:37.269> that's<00:00:37.659> to<00:00:37.870> its<00:00:38.019> left

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
and either the black that's to its left

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.979 
and either the black that's to its left
or<00:00:38.680> the<00:00:38.829> other<00:00:38.949> black<00:00:39.190> so<00:00:39.519> you<00:00:39.820> tie<00:00:40.510> those<00:00:40.750> two

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
or the other black so you tie those two

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.840 
or the other black so you tie those two
together<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.559> your<00:00:41.980> power<00:00:42.159> supply<00:00:42.519> will<00:00:42.699> kick

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
together and your power supply will kick

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.180 
together and your power supply will kick
on<00:00:43.030> when<00:00:43.089> you<00:00:43.329> kick<00:00:43.510> on<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.659> power<00:00:43.989> so<00:00:44.949> let<00:00:45.129> me

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
on when you kick on the power so let me

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.770 
on when you kick on the power so let me
do<00:00:45.309> that<00:00:45.460> right<00:00:45.670> now<00:00:45.729> I<00:00:47.850> got<00:00:48.850> a<00:00:49.269> little<00:00:49.449> piece

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
do that right now I got a little piece

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.119 
do that right now I got a little piece
of<00:00:49.960> wire<00:00:50.140> made<00:00:50.439> up<00:00:50.650> to<00:00:50.799> do<00:00:50.949> this<00:00:55.920> okay<00:00:56.920> so<00:00:56.979> I

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
of wire made up to do this okay so I

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.999 
of wire made up to do this okay so I
have<00:00:57.280> those<00:00:57.460> two<00:00:57.790> shorted<00:00:58.239> together<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.920> I'm

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:00.009 
have those two shorted together and I'm

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:02.640 
have those two shorted together and I'm
now<00:01:00.189> going<00:01:00.369> to<00:01:00.430> kick<00:01:00.670> on<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:00.909> power<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:02.530> the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
now going to kick on the power on the

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.510 
now going to kick on the power on the
back<00:01:02.830> of<00:01:02.860> it<00:01:04.650> okay<00:01:05.650> it's<00:01:05.799> kicked<00:01:06.009> on<00:01:06.189> okay

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
back of it okay it's kicked on okay

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.840 
back of it okay it's kicked on okay
turned<00:01:06.880> on<00:01:07.090> looks<00:01:07.689> to<00:01:07.900> me<00:01:07.930> like<00:01:08.640> bread<00:01:09.640> is

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
what's showing right now so there's red

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.609 
what's showing right now so there's red
let<00:01:15.250> me<00:01:15.340> turn<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.610> light<00:01:15.759> off<00:01:16.560> okay<00:01:17.560> so

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
there's the red fan and it's still kind

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.559 
there's the red fan and it's still kind
of<00:01:20.200> brightness<00:01:20.710> room<00:01:21.240> let<00:01:22.240> me<00:01:22.329> turn<00:01:22.509> it

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
of brightness room let me turn it

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:29.910 
of brightness room let me turn it
there's<00:01:23.259> blue<00:01:24.539> and<00:01:25.590> green<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:29.170> there's

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
there's blue and green and then there's

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.800 
there's blue and green and then there's
off<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:31.539> have<00:01:31.689> four<00:01:31.929> settings<00:01:32.380> green<00:01:32.799> off

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
off so you have four settings green off

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.039 
off so you have four settings green off
blue<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.079> red<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.509> more<00:01:37.509> likely<00:01:37.749> i'll<00:01:37.960> be

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
blue and red and more likely i'll be

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.440 
blue and red and more likely i'll be
using<00:01:38.259> red<00:01:38.590> for<00:01:38.829> my<00:01:38.950> ability<00:01:39.340> since<00:01:39.549> i<00:01:39.850> use

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
using red for my ability since i use

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.669 
using red for my ability since i use
read<00:01:40.689> a<00:01:40.719> lot<00:01:42.719> now<00:01:43.719> i<00:01:43.780> know<00:01:43.869> if<00:01:44.170> no<00:01:44.289> other<00:01:44.409> power

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
read a lot now i know if no other power

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.889 
read a lot now i know if no other power
supplied<00:01:45.069> it<00:01:45.219> does<00:01:45.369> that<00:01:45.549> right<00:01:45.789> there<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.719> may

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
supplied it does that right there it may

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.469 
supplied it does that right there it may
seem<00:01:46.959> trivial<00:01:47.380> but<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.759> shows<00:01:48.999> that<00:01:49.030> they<00:01:49.299> put

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
seem trivial but it shows that they put

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.270 
seem trivial but it shows that they put
a<00:01:49.509> lot<00:01:49.719> of<00:01:49.749> thought<00:01:50.020> into<00:01:50.049> what<00:01:50.709> people<00:01:51.069> want

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
a lot of thought into what people want

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.099 
a lot of thought into what people want
so<00:01:51.850> I<00:01:51.909> tells<00:01:52.179> me<00:01:52.329> they<00:01:52.420> put<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.630> lot<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:52.840> thought

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
so I tells me they put a lot of thought

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.249 
so I tells me they put a lot of thought
into<00:01:53.759> how<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:54.819> make<00:01:54.999> a<00:01:55.030> power<00:01:55.329> supply<00:01:55.479> good

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
into how to make a power supply good

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.219 
into how to make a power supply good
enough<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.389> course<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.719> have<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.959> green

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
enough then of course you have the green

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.959 
enough then of course you have the green
status<00:01:59.560> light<00:01:59.859> on<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.069> back<00:02:00.249> and<00:02:00.429> then<00:02:00.850> the

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
status light on the back and then the

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.789 
status light on the back and then the
manual<00:02:01.359> tells<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:01.869> if<00:02:02.079> depend<00:02:02.380> on<00:02:02.469> what<00:02:02.590> color

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
manual tells you if depend on what color

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.019 
manual tells you if depend on what color
that<00:02:03.039> says<00:02:03.249> tells<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:03.609> if<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:03.729> have<00:02:03.819> a<00:02:03.850> ground

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:04.029 
that says tells you if you have a ground

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:07.109 
that says tells you if you have a ground
fault<00:02:04.389> or<00:02:04.659> or<00:02:05.020> sure<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.889> wasn't<00:02:06.249> turning<00:02:06.909> back

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
fault or or sure it wasn't turning back

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.710 
fault or or sure it wasn't turning back
off<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:07.600> mush<00:02:08.410> king<00:02:08.709> jewel<00:02:09.390> 1200<00:02:10.390> watt<00:02:10.479> power
