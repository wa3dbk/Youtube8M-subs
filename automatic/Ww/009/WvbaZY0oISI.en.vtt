00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
toes and you just keep doing that and if

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.289 
toes and you just keep doing that and if
you<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.340> get<00:02:38.519> some<00:02:38.640> on<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.790> side<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.000> your<00:02:39.060> toes

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.420 
you do get some on the side of your toes
like<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:40.200> just<00:02:40.230> go<00:02:40.590> around<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.280> put

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
like that you just go around and put

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.190 
like that you just go around and put
your<00:02:41.549> fingernail<00:02:41.970> right<00:02:42.269> where<00:02:42.510> as<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.690> nail<00:02:42.930> is

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
your fingernail right where as a nail is

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.440 
your fingernail right where as a nail is
and<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.709> can<00:02:43.799> get<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.100> off<00:02:44.220> but<00:02:44.760> don't<00:02:44.970> do<00:02:45.269> your

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
and you can get it off but don't do your

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.390 
and you can get it off but don't do your
fingernails<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.650> then<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:47.069> your<00:02:47.190> toes

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
fingernails and then do your toes

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.550 
fingernails and then do your toes
because<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:47.880> might<00:02:48.120> get<00:02:48.540> some<00:02:49.019> nail<00:02:49.200> polish

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
because you might get some nail polish

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.440 
because you might get some nail polish
on<00:02:49.709> your<00:02:50.010> manicure<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.000> won't<00:02:51.120> really

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
on your manicure so that won't really

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.410 
on your manicure so that won't really
make<00:02:52.079> any<00:02:52.290> sense<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.709> do<00:02:52.829> that<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:54.209> now<00:02:54.359> you

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
make any sense to do that so now you

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.750 
make any sense to do that so now you
want<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.780> continue<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.440> obviously<00:02:56.340> as<00:02:56.609> you

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
want to continue and obviously as you

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.030 
want to continue and obviously as you
can<00:02:56.940> see<00:02:57.209> when<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.959> keep<00:02:58.290> painting<00:02:58.500> your<00:02:58.829> toes

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
can see when you keep painting your toes

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.250 
can see when you keep painting your toes
as<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.730> go<00:02:59.910> down<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.510> next<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:00.959> it's<00:03:01.140> gonna

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
as you go down to the next so it's gonna

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.559 
as you go down to the next so it's gonna
get<00:03:01.500> smaller<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.760> then<00:03:02.879> you're<00:03:03.030> gonna<00:03:03.150> have<00:03:03.390> to

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
get smaller so then you're gonna have to

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.580 
get smaller so then you're gonna have to
do<00:03:03.720> less<00:03:04.080> and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
do less and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:29.780 
do less and
strokes<00:03:27.680> okay<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:28.739> now<00:03:29.099> we're<00:03:29.280> gonna<00:03:29.370> do<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.760> a

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
strokes okay so now we're gonna do is a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.180 
strokes okay so now we're gonna do is a
pinkie<00:03:30.120> toe<00:03:30.330> for<00:03:30.900> me<00:03:31.080> my<00:03:31.349> skin<00:03:31.709> kinda<00:03:32.040> goes

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
pinkie toe for me my skin kinda goes

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.830 
pinkie toe for me my skin kinda goes
over<00:03:32.580> better<00:03:32.790> my<00:03:32.970> pinkie<00:03:33.330> says<00:03:33.569> so<00:03:33.720> it's

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
over better my pinkie says so it's

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.530 
over better my pinkie says so it's
harder<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.379> do<00:03:34.760> really<00:03:35.760> what<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:35.940> like<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.299> do<00:03:36.420> is

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
harder to do really what I like to do is

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.390 
harder to do really what I like to do is
I<00:03:36.630> just<00:03:36.660> kind<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:36.989> like<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.230> dab<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.890> then

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
I just kind of like to dab it and then

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:51.710 
I just kind of like to dab it and then
the<00:03:38.519> excess<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.239> just<00:03:39.569> try<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.780> get<00:03:39.989> off<00:03:50.239> okay

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
the excess I just try to get off okay

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.670 
the excess I just try to get off okay
so<00:03:52.079> now<00:03:52.319> we're<00:03:52.650> done<00:03:52.890> with<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.549> first<00:03:53.760> foot

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.819 

okay

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
okay

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.289 
okay
so<00:03:59.099> now<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.370> we're<00:03:59.519> done<00:03:59.549> we're<00:03:59.879> gonna<00:03:59.970> take

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
so now that we're done we're gonna take

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.789 
so now that we're done we're gonna take
off<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.540> tissue<00:04:00.720> paper<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.379> you<00:04:01.440> need<00:04:01.680> to

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
off the tissue paper so you need to

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.100 
off the tissue paper so you need to
slowly<00:04:02.160> unwrap<00:04:02.849> it<00:04:02.879> from<00:04:03.299> each<00:04:03.480> end<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:03.930> try

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
slowly unwrap it from each end and try
