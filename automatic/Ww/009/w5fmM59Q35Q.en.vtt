00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
review so let's get to the unboxing

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.330 
review so let's get to the unboxing
today<00:00:29.750> this<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> pretty<00:00:31.019> neat<00:00:31.230> phone<00:00:31.500> it's

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
today this is a pretty neat phone it's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
today this is a pretty neat phone it's
got<00:00:32.489> actual<00:00:32.910> true<00:00:35.809> magnetic<00:00:36.809> compass<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.290> here

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
got actual true magnetic compass in here

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.310 
got actual true magnetic compass in here
so<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.579> GPS<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.690> actually<00:00:39.960> turn<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
so with the GPS you actually turn the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.779 
so with the GPS you actually turn the
phone<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:43.140> map<00:00:43.410> orientate<00:00:44.010> stuff<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
phone and the map orientate stuff to the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.639 
phone and the map orientate stuff to the
chart<00:00:45.030> way<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> phone<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.570> pointing<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.530> this

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
chart way the phone is pointing so this

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.220 
chart way the phone is pointing so this
is<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> six<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.250> ten<00:00:47.719> for<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:48.750> understand<00:00:49.170> I

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
is a six to ten for one understand I

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.330 
is a six to ten for one understand I
think<00:00:49.410> they<00:00:49.500> make<00:00:49.649> two<00:00:49.800> different<00:00:50.070> variants

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
think they make two different variants

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.180 
think they make two different variants
they<00:00:50.489> make<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> European<00:00:51.239> band<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> US

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
they make the European band and the US

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.750 
they make the European band and the US
band<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:53.969> does<00:00:54.300> not<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:54.629> 3G<00:00:55.070> but<00:00:56.070> from

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
band so this does not have 3G but from

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180 
band so this does not have 3G but from
what<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> understand<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> 3G<00:00:58.770> US

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
what I understand they do have a 3G US

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.279 
what I understand they do have a 3G US
version<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.000> we'll<00:01:00.660> take<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> look<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
version so we'll take a look at that

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.460 
version so we'll take a look at that
later<00:01:01.829> hopefully<00:01:02.600> but<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.899> 6210

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
later hopefully but this is a 6210
