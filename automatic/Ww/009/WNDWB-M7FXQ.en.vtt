00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
shingle and it actually does what we

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.490 
shingle and it actually does what we
call<00:01:09.460> bruising<00:01:10.180> it<00:01:10.360> or<00:01:10.510> it<00:01:10.690> puts<00:01:10.870> a<00:01:10.960> divot<00:01:11.380> in

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
the shingle and that's often hard to

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.230 
the shingle and that's often hard to
find<00:01:13.840> but<00:01:14.440> over<00:01:14.740> time<00:01:15.040> as<00:01:15.430> we<00:01:15.820> go<00:01:15.940> through<00:01:16.180> the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
find but over time as we go through the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.360 
find but over time as we go through the
seasons<00:01:16.660> here<00:01:16.780> in<00:01:16.870> Minnesota<00:01:17.320> that<00:01:17.890> divot

starts to break down and as moisture and
infiltrates<00:01:22.000> underneath<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.479> granules<00:01:22.900> of

down that shingle deteriorates very very

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.320 
down that shingle deteriorates very very
rapidly<00:01:26.410> let's<00:01:27.340> look<00:01:27.490> at<00:01:27.640> this<00:01:27.760> roof<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.210> what

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
rapidly let's look at this roof and what

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.859 
rapidly let's look at this roof and what
we've<00:01:28.479> marked<00:01:28.750> here<00:01:29.050> if<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:30.070> look<00:01:30.280> we've<00:01:30.550> got

we've marked here if you look we've got

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.270 
we've marked here if you look we've got
an<00:01:31.869> area<00:01:32.229> here<00:01:32.440> that<00:01:32.470> we've<00:01:32.680> circled<00:01:32.950> and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
an area here that we've circled and

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.920 
an area here that we've circled and
that's<00:01:33.430> probably<00:01:33.610> hard<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.300> see<00:01:34.510> but<00:01:34.720> you've

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
that's probably hard to see but you've
