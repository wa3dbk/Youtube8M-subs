pac-man the classic video game character

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.180 
pac-man the classic video game character
carrot<00:00:10.920> okay<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.580> pac-man<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:13.500> all<00:00:13.679> know<00:00:13.920> he

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
carrot okay so pac-man is we all know he

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.019 
carrot okay so pac-man is we all know he
is<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> circular<00:00:15.179> being<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.289> let<00:00:17.010> us<00:00:17.039> begin

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
is a circular being so let us begin

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.920 
is a circular being so let us begin
we<00:00:18.690> need<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> circle<00:00:19.529> object<00:00:20.390> to<00:00:21.390> get<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.750> right

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
we need a circle object to get the right

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.880 
we need a circle object to get the right
shape<00:00:22.430> this<00:00:23.430> circle<00:00:23.939> will<00:00:24.090> be<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.560> decor<00:00:25.560> of

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
shape this circle will be the decor of

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.820 
shape this circle will be the decor of
the<00:00:26.250> pac-man<00:00:26.570> next<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.720> need<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.019> surround<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the pac-man next we need to surround the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:38.150 
the pac-man next we need to surround the
core<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:30.410> several<00:00:31.410> other<00:00:32.070> items<00:00:35.630> yeah<00:00:37.160> this

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
core with several other items yeah this

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.560 
core with several other items yeah this
will<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:38.700> nicely<00:00:40.340> stack<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.520> all<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.910> as

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
will do just nicely stack it all up as

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.779 
will do just nicely stack it all up as
you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.730> have<00:00:44.730> arranged<00:00:45.390> every<00:00:46.110> item

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
you can see I have arranged every item

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.500 
you can see I have arranged every item
into<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> nice<00:00:48.149> circular<00:00:49.050> shape<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.850> center

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
into a nice circular shape in the center

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.470 
into a nice circular shape in the center
of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.020> table<00:00:52.289> okay<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:53.670> all<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
of the table okay so now all we have to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.830 
of the table okay so now all we have to
do<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.899> trace<00:00:55.350> around<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:57.300> circle<00:00:59.570> it's<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
do is trace around the circle it's the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.160 
do is trace around the circle it's the
so<00:01:04.700> now<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.330> circle<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> can

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
so now that we have the circle you can

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.920 
so now that we have the circle you can
clear<00:01:07.530> off<00:01:07.710> yeah<00:01:08.040> keep<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> drawing<00:01:09.659> book

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
clear off yeah keep the a drawing book

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.560 
clear off yeah keep the a drawing book
on<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> table<00:01:10.650> because<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.640> now<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.299> we

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
on the table because see now that we

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.950 
on the table because see now that we
have<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.320> perfect<00:01:13.890> circle<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
have this perfect circle we know what a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.219 
have this perfect circle we know what a
circle<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.950> supposed<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.670> look<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.540> just

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
circle is supposed to look like so just

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.980 
circle is supposed to look like so just
draw<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> smaller<00:01:20.310> version<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
draw it like a smaller version on the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.820 
draw it like a smaller version on the
page<00:01:22.759> okay<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:23.790> now<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.229> pac-man's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
page okay so now we have the pac-man's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.390 
page okay so now we have the pac-man's
body

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
body

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.560 
body
we<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.299> need<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:28.320> draw<00:01:28.619> his<00:01:29.070> sexy<00:01:29.670> mouth<00:01:29.909> this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
we just need to draw his sexy mouth this

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.410 
we just need to draw his sexy mouth this
is<00:01:30.630> different<00:01:31.320> from<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.890> usual<00:01:32.420> drawing

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
is different from my usual drawing

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.980 
is different from my usual drawing
technique<00:01:34.220> wherein<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.729> usually<00:01:36.420> start<00:01:36.840> with

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
technique wherein I usually start with

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.640 
technique wherein I usually start with
the<00:01:37.170> eyeballs<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.750> thing<00:01:39.990> about<00:01:40.020> pac-man

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the eyeballs but the thing about pac-man
