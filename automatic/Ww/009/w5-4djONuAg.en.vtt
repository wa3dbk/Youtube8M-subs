00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
a pretty solid valid storyline for

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
company for a few weeks now as I said

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
company for a few weeks now as I said
storyline<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.970> whole<00:01:30.090> thing<00:01:30.299> especially

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
storyline the whole thing especially

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.600 
storyline the whole thing especially
with<00:01:31.140> Brie<00:01:31.439> Bella<00:01:31.619> now<00:01:31.890> she's<00:01:32.100> home<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.369> Dana

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
with Brie Bella now she's home with Dana

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.660 
with Brie Bella now she's home with Dana
Bryan<00:01:33.000> she's<00:01:33.570> she's<00:01:34.259> fired<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:35.159> well<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:35.640> uh

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
Bryan she's she's fired as well but uh

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.660 
Bryan she's she's fired as well but uh
she<00:01:36.329> should<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.659> back<00:01:36.810> late<00:01:37.799> summer<00:01:38.130> probably

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
she should be back late summer probably

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.760 
she should be back late summer probably
so<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.509> could<00:01:39.720> possibly<00:01:40.229> write<00:01:40.500> Vickie

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
so this could possibly write Vickie

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.770 
so this could possibly write Vickie
Guerrero<00:01:41.100> off<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> little<00:01:42.000> while<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.540> home

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
get some solid things done so well

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.230 
get some solid things done so well
Vickie<00:01:45.869> Guerrero<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.560> seems<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.399> she<00:01:47.729> will

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
