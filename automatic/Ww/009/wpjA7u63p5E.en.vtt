taller model the only issue you may

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.420 
taller model the only issue you may
encounter<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.649> there's<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.979> little<00:02:05.189> bit

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
encounter is that there's a little bit

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.150 
encounter is that there's a little bit
of<00:02:05.520> crossover<00:02:06.240> between<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:07.160> lap/shoulder

buckle stock for this outboard seat that
could<00:02:12.900> be<00:02:12.989> an<00:02:13.080> issue

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
could be an issue

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.130 
could be an issue
if<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.370> two<00:02:14.640> adjacent<00:02:15.120> car<00:02:15.540> seats<00:02:15.870> or

passengers in the middle and outboard

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.300
