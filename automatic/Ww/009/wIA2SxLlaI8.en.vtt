00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
a gun on it so can shoot airborne

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.470 
a gun on it so can shoot airborne
enemies<00:00:46.570> as<00:00:46.750> well<00:00:47.130> so<00:00:48.130> on<00:00:48.400> this<00:00:48.610> one<00:00:48.850> you<00:00:49.180> sort

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
as well so these will reel in the shield

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.350 
as well so these will reel in the shield
your<00:01:02.770> shield<00:01:03.100> can<00:01:03.280> be<00:01:03.399> revealing<00:01:03.969> as<00:01:04.180> well

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
your shield can be revealing as well

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.830 
your shield can be revealing as well
even<00:01:04.629> if<00:01:04.719> you're<00:01:04.839> under<00:01:05.049> fire<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:07.090> other<00:01:07.570> thing

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
is you get like shock damage and I think

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.440 
is you get like shock damage and I think
the<00:01:12.159> actual<00:01:12.430> robot<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:12.969> can<00:01:13.090> actually<00:01:13.329> make

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
the actual robot you can actually make

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.419 
the actual robot you can actually make
it<00:01:13.600> do<00:01:14.399> different<00:01:15.399> sort<00:01:15.759> of<00:01:15.790> attacks<00:01:16.329> so<00:01:16.780> it's

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:17.429 
it do different sort of attacks so it's

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.459 
it do different sort of attacks so it's
one<00:01:18.429> of<00:01:18.549> them<00:01:18.789> attached<00:01:19.329> does<00:01:19.780> all<00:01:20.079> the

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
one of them attached does all the

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.630 
one of them attached does all the
attacks<00:01:20.829> those<00:01:21.280> like<00:01:22.030> corrosion

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:55.750 

that's
