00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:41.170 

that<00:00:59.219> way<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.429> lesser<00:00:59.789> pressure<00:01:00.149> buildup

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.560 

all<00:01:42.180> right<00:01:42.450> here's<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> tree<00:01:43.140> stop<00:01:44.570> not

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
all right here's the tree stop not

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.399 
all right here's the tree stop not
dugouts<00:01:45.990> around<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.830> much<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.340> could<00:01:47.400> so<00:01:48.409> big

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
dugouts around as much as I could so big

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.350 
dugouts around as much as I could so big
tree<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:53.070> we'll<00:01:53.190> get<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.400> chains<00:01:53.670> hooked<00:01:54.090> up

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
tree so we'll get the chains hooked up

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.770 
tree so we'll get the chains hooked up
and<00:01:54.950> move<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.040> backhoe<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.610> see<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:57.600> can't

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
and move the backhoe and see if we can't

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.370 
and move the backhoe and see if we can't
pull<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:57.960> out

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
pull it out

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.950 
pull it out
okay<00:01:59.310> for<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.700> start<00:01:59.940> I<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.180> expect<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.630> strap

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
okay for we start I do expect that strap

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:25.129 
okay for we start I do expect that strap
to<00:02:01.110> break

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.139 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:03:23.270

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.970 

the<00:03:24.280> tree-trunks<00:03:24.700> not<00:03:24.970> going<00:03:25.150> anywhere<00:03:28.980> we're

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
the tree-trunks not going anywhere we're

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.620 
the tree-trunks not going anywhere we're
going<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.190> try<00:03:30.340> it<00:03:30.400> four-wheel<00:03:31.180> drive<00:03:31.390> then

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
going to try it four-wheel drive then

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.120 
going to try it four-wheel drive then
we're<00:03:31.780> going<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:31.960> put<00:03:32.050> in<00:03:32.140> six<00:03:32.470> little<00:03:32.680> draft

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
we're going to put in six little draft

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:45.170

I<00:03:42.900> really<00:03:43.900> don't<00:03:44.020> think<00:03:44.110> it'll<00:03:44.380> pull<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.710> out

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
I really don't think it'll pull it out

00:03:45.180 --> 00:04:32.460 
I really don't think it'll pull it out
it's<00:03:46.180> crazy
