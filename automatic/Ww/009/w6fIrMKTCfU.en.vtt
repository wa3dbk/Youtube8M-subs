squeeze together like this they're

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.540 
squeeze together like this they're
spring-loaded<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.800> grabbed<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> lot<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
spring-loaded so I grabbed a lot of

different things with this stuff you can

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.710 
different things with this stuff you can
spread<00:01:05.040> them<00:01:05.189> open<00:01:05.339> wide<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> size<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
spread them open wide to the size of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.120 
spread them open wide to the size of
your<00:01:06.810> glasses

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.800 

they<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.310> go<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> grooves<00:01:12.030> inside<00:01:12.299> there

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
they just go in the grooves inside there

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.950 
they just go in the grooves inside there
you<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.140> use<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.060> in<00:01:15.060> those<00:01:15.210> holes<00:01:15.600> or

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you can use the in those holes or

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
you can use the in those holes or
whatever<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:17.040> seem<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> work<00:01:17.520> good<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.729> me

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
whatever they seem to work good for me

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.969 
whatever they seem to work good for me
also<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:19.229> end<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:21.350> right<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.680> can

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
also the end of it right there I can

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.249 
also the end of it right there I can
hang<00:01:24.799> this<00:01:25.799> after<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.369> done<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.479> tank<00:01:27.810> on

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
hang this after it's done in the tank on

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.010 
hang this after it's done in the tank on
a<00:01:28.320> one-inch<00:01:28.950> PVC<00:01:29.220> pipe<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.479> it'll<00:01:30.689> sit<00:01:30.840> right

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
a one-inch PVC pipe and it'll sit right

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.370 
a one-inch PVC pipe and it'll sit right
there<00:01:31.229> without<00:01:31.320> touch<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.860> anything<00:01:32.299> so

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
there without touch for anything so

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.230 
there without touch for anything so
that's<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.860> found<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.400> makes<00:01:35.880> life<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
that's just what I found it makes life a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
that's just what I found it makes life a
little<00:01:36.329> simpler<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:37.560> right<00:01:37.710> we're<00:01:37.829> gonna

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
little simpler all right we're gonna

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
little simpler all right we're gonna
readjust<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.150> camera

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
readjust the camera

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
readjust the camera
drop<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:41.840> rattlesnake-skin<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.829> here<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
drop this rattlesnake-skin in here and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.359 
drop this rattlesnake-skin in here and
see<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.670> come<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:45.229> again<00:01:46.250> I'm<00:01:47.250> not

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
see what we come up with again I'm not

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.980 
see what we come up with again I'm not
sure<00:01:47.700> about<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.119> technique<00:01:48.600> I'm<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.899> gonna

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
sure about the technique I'm just gonna

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.460 
sure about the technique I'm just gonna
go<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.350> real<00:01:49.530> slow

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.130 

just<00:01:54.920> go<00:01:55.040> straight<00:01:55.430> in<00:01:55.610> pretty<00:01:55.880> much<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.480> I'm

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
just go straight in pretty much and I'm

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.960 
just go straight in pretty much and I'm
gonna<00:01:57.230> get<00:01:57.440> some<00:01:57.710> sort<00:01:57.980> of<00:01:58.010> a<00:01:58.130> seam<00:01:58.430> up<00:01:58.640> on<00:01:58.820> the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
gonna get some sort of a seam up on the

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.390 
gonna get some sort of a seam up on the
top<00:01:59.300> edge<00:01:59.600> hopefully<00:02:00.440> on<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.680> back<00:02:00.920> edge<00:02:01.220> of

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
top edge hopefully on the back edge of

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.120 
top edge hopefully on the back edge of
this<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.970> right<00:02:02.810> across<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.410> top<00:02:03.680> here

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
this and right across the top here

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.010 
this and right across the top here
that's<00:02:04.850> what<00:02:05.030> I'm<00:02:05.120> thinking<00:02:05.540> might<00:02:05.720> be<00:02:05.900> the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
that's what I'm thinking might be the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.980 
that's what I'm thinking might be the
best<00:02:06.260> looking<00:02:06.910> for<00:02:07.910> a<00:02:07.940> single<00:02:08.390> dip<00:02:08.600> with<00:02:08.780> the

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
best looking for a single dip with the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.620 
best looking for a single dip with the
frames<00:02:09.470> on<00:02:09.770> them<00:02:09.920> or<00:02:10.580> they<00:02:10.700> got<00:02:10.850> arms<00:02:11.330> on<00:02:11.540> them

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
frames on them or they got arms on them

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.760 
frames on them or they got arms on them
anyway

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
anyway

00:02:12.770 --> 00:05:53.040 
anyway
hang<00:02:13.490> tight<00:02:13.760> let<00:02:13.940> me<00:02:14.000> adjust<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.330> camera

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.799 

anyway<00:05:54.430> let<00:05:55.430> me<00:05:55.460> twist<00:05:55.819> this<00:05:55.999> around<00:05:56.360> slowly

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:56.809 
anyway let me twist this around slowly

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:01.119 
anyway let me twist this around slowly
for<00:05:57.259> you<00:05:58.569> you<00:05:59.569> can<00:05:59.719> see<00:06:00.020> there's<00:06:00.499> really<00:06:00.830> not

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129 
for you you can see there's really not

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.429 
for you you can see there's really not
much<00:06:01.400> of<00:06:01.610> a<00:06:01.699> seam<00:06:01.999> on<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:02.360> top<00:06:02.599> up<00:06:02.900> there<00:06:03.199> let

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:03.439 
much of a seam on the top up there let

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:17.230 
much of a seam on the top up there let
me<00:06:03.469> turn<00:06:03.770> it<00:06:03.830> this<00:06:04.129> way<00:06:04.749> don't<00:06:05.749> really<00:06:06.110> see<00:06:06.379> it
