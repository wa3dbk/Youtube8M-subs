00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.680
 this after we always find things that are interesting to be able to 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:22.949
 explain by the east 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.259
 the announcement of good things one of them is the resistance to the advance 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.329
 the end of his internationally central parade 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.600
 this scourge that the resistance move in this direction 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.450
 and the best that is like the wing when the car that moved forward and we were going at speed 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.290
 and that lifts 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.250
 I know that if some tricks but in something so that it does not fly 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.550
 that's called paul johnson contributed little down but 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.410
 let's see here what they planted the resistance to the advance you have the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.170
 vehicle 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.220
 is facing the air the air has to open if the vehicle is 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.879
 penetrating is separating the air or that there it works like a pump 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.050
 it's a job and when the speed increases 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.540
 the amount of work and divided about evil calls you power in the b exists 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.540
 he says speed imagine he said a bomb although I carry liquid I assemble him 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.350
 he quoted pots inexorably 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.140
 the assaulted wants to move forward and now only more speed fits faster than me 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.170
 know the air 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.250
 more power directed up 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.730
 a vehicle with a frontal altaria a typical four by four a truck 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.950
 compared the area with a vehicle 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.950
 that is much closer than the unduly brutal difference 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.990
 look at the difference in resistance to the advance between one and the other 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.880
 it translates that of consumption smoothly and simply consumption 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.670
 for the same speed 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.219
 the one that has to overcome the resistance of the air 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.499
 because his way of seeing life is not the right one he will undoubtedly consume 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:48.770
 more fuel 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.700
 following these toys that eta to show you 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.710
 look here 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.869
 full tank 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.929
 of the high known section high vehicle resides from the villa 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.830
 full vehicle tank 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.180
 d low srebrenica mothers section 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.290
 we propose onan rotated let's see what happens but the way 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.819
 several talking 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.359
 this is that you do not see 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:15.459
 you as a visitor and what really happens and what you realize when 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.199
 the service station arrives 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.949
 the trend nowadays is to look for better aerodynamic shapes now it 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.820
 you will see the town, that is not seen so much 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.130
 I used to drive my mom to space a van in front of the car 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.889
 more than a car a ferrari 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.449
 highly stylized probably consume the bitch lic for a subject of 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.449
 engines and company but at low speed is that is not felt 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.229
 we anticipated over 80 to 100 kilometers per hour in more is done 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:44.229
 feel and there are many who feel 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:04.909
 Martin looking 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.099
 admiring 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.220
 about the crime 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.619
 carbon fiber 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:13.219
 I was a toyota lexus it's about that toyota united states and a presence 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.899
 very very very strong 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:18.809
 and the lexus that emblematic vehicles as always 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.749
 we find things like this that allows me to say that I like things from another 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:26.339
 way would be impossible in this case like in a sports vehicle 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.629
 it is established what the weights to see 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.590
 in an ideal vehicle 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.420
 pending approximately 55 percent before other 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.419
 and 45% deodorant assuming of course that this back action 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.639
 delia because purebred cars 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.289
 the rear-wheel drive formula one has certain will 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:50.380
 because this is rear-wheel drive and not front 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.400
 because if I do not submit the network to the effort of pulling and I want to talk about this 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.659
 complicating life 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.419
 3 in a high performance vehicle the rear wheel was seized opal 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.279
 exclusively to pull 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:02.480
 and in the front is 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.339
 I see we distribute the work the thing works 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.689
 but four by four can be achieved up to a certain speed past that not 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.270
 it serves if ciro essays in formula one of lasted four by four 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.730
 I carry with me and they turned out to be a failure 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.209
 I remember the back the boe the rapporteur pull 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.840
 the forward for dollar 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.249
 talking of course vehicle with rear-wheel drive 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:26.340
 see how he has managed to distribute in this case the prisoners observer 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.200
 engine 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.050
 Forward 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.569
 motor of razor-burn motor of formula 1 derived from a formula 1 not 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:33.860
 is of formula 1 but 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.009
 with looking at it you do not have to be a genius to realize that there is 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.509
 top-of-the-line technology 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.289
 16 cylinder engine casually 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.969
 per cent very similar to that of formula 1 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:48.199
 and the gearbox in the rear 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.400
 in that way all the weight of the armament would be agreed on the engine forward 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.409
 transferring weight the front train 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.150
 moves to the rear axle and that weight distribution is achieved 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.000
 is achieved in the race in the rear wheel in order to maximize 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.180
 The attraction 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.050
 He asked you to wear a similar cover width 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.740
 It is possible to treat and power sixty only if there is weight applied on the floor 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.930
 may also have denounced this announcement I have very wide memories the 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.960
 number of kilos per square centimeter built by stepping 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.020
 is low then yes I have I voted essentially I can not take advantage 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.250
 then it is necessary then the tractor train have weight corresponds to this 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.990
 way a constructive detail is achieved that burn 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.150
 I think that this day and it is not really the one that Adam is the container of 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.090
 cardan inside that 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.050
 there a hygienist supported with bank bearings st despair that 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.520
 face from said 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.720
 this is an engine that has the red zone at 9 and revolutions per minute if 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.400
 macri not that if you could connect directly is required to 9 thousand revolutions 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.389
 per minute 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.430
 and with that length it would be the same nightmare and the engineer 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.960
 tata solve it around here is a work in pieces that becomes the big one 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.630
 small reduction to lower the revolutions per minute still receive 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.570
 reasonable to face a fine that power is transferred directly to the 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.020
 gearbox was cashier are going to hit the wheels 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.619
 I have given you details 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:17.389
 that or another one of seville after taking a tank of fuel actually for 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.349
 cover your mouth this engine is a diesel engine and nautical tobÃ³n motor 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.040
 soto new virus and not per minute visit 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.330
 and you have to win it that's the silencer 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.280
 and a detail of sophistication as every vehicle must visit a handbrake 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.289
 where is the Romanesque and apply today that spoke nothing 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:35.600
 vega and I show it 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.120
 two brake caliper one very big pablino very small service from behind 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.110
 seemingly insignificant that which serves as the hand for that is 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:47.729
 toyota like all the cases 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.840
 when they get self-care formula 1 with bull cta 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.840
 salazar also very well things 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:19.649
 from the angels of california this cosmopolitan city 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.580
 and there will be a lot of people in Spanish and many of them were so good 

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:28.929
 so cute place with this beautiful moment that we have shared these 

00:07:28.929 --> 00:07:32.439
 vehicles I have nothing left but to send a kiss to the strong hug and not 

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:33.539
 we see the agent again
