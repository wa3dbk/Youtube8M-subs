00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
here it is through the demo it might be

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.470 
here it is through the demo it might be
a<00:02:19.380> little<00:02:19.560> bit<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:20.160> little<00:02:20.310> tiny<00:02:20.880> bit<00:02:21.030> laggy

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
a little bit a little tiny bit laggy

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.060 
a little bit a little tiny bit laggy
because<00:02:22.050> it's<00:02:22.200> kind<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.410> like<00:02:22.530> data<00:02:22.770> mode<00:02:22.920> from

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
because it's kind of like data mode from

because it's kind of like data mode from
them<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.340> be<00:02:23.430> three<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:23.880> i<00:02:23.970> said<00:02:24.120> before<00:02:24.240> and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
them to be three like i said before and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.850 
them to be three like i said before and
it's<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:24.990> look<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.650> see<00:02:25.680> how

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
it's going to look like this you see how

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.700 
it's going to look like this you see how
laggy<00:02:26.130> looks<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.790> stuff<00:02:26.940> like<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.470> but<00:02:28.470> it's

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
laggy looks and stuff like that but it's

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.940 
laggy looks and stuff like that but it's
good<00:02:28.950> if<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.460> wanna<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:30.180> know<00:02:30.230> share<00:02:31.230> some<00:02:31.470> if

seconds ago you know and yeah once you

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.210 
seconds ago you know and yeah once you
finish<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.940> demo<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:58.350> auto<00:02:58.620> finishes<00:02:59.040> by

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
finish the demo it auto finishes by

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.430 
finish the demo it auto finishes by
itself<00:02:59.550> at<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.000> end<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:01.050> will<00:03:01.140> say<00:03:01.260> lost

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
itself at the end and it will say lost

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.930 
itself at the end and it will say lost
connection<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.890> host<00:03:02.010> which<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.670> how<00:03:02.760> it's

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
connection to host which is how it's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.850 
connection to host which is how it's
supposed<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.209> be<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.600> then<00:03:04.170> boom<00:03:04.470> it's<00:03:04.680> right

want to stop Midway into the demo so I
load<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.450> back<00:03:18.570> up<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:19.019> same<00:03:19.260> demo<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.860> i'm

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
first i started back to demo as you can

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.199 
first i started back to demo as you can
see<00:03:28.500> it's<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> original<00:03:28.830> demo<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.580> then<00:03:29.940> /

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
see it's the original demo and then /

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.270 
see it's the original demo and then /
disconnect<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.200> could<00:03:31.380> disconnect<00:03:31.650> from

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
disconnect and you could disconnect from

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.100 
disconnect and you could disconnect from
the<00:03:32.370> demo<00:03:32.850> so<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.180> don't<00:03:33.420> have<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.660> watch<00:03:33.930> if

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
the demo so you don't have to watch if

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.750 
the demo so you don't have to watch if
you<00:03:34.260> don't<00:03:34.440> really<00:03:34.680> want<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.010> watch<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.340> now

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
you don't really want to watch it now

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.789 
you don't really want to watch it now

ability<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.530> what<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.799> have<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.070> do<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.340> you

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
ability to what you have to do is you

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.770 
ability to what you have to do is you
have<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.670> load<00:03:41.820> up<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.060> demo<00:03:42.269> like<00:03:42.480> i<00:03:42.570> showed

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
have to load up the demo like i showed

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.390 
have to load up the demo like i showed
you<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.170> then<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.739> record<00:03:44.100> over<00:03:44.220> a

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
you and then you have to record over a

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.949 
you and then you have to record over a
wood<00:03:44.610> recording<00:03:45.060> software<00:03:45.209> like<00:03:45.540> Benny<00:03:45.720> can

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
wood recording software like Benny can

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.780 
wood recording software like Benny can
perhaps<00:03:46.290> DX<00:03:46.830> storing<00:03:47.130> stuff<00:03:47.250> like<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.519> in

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
perhaps DX storing stuff like that in

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.220 
perhaps DX storing stuff like that in
this<00:03:47.940> case<00:03:48.150> i'm<00:03:48.330> using<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.660> x<00:03:48.840> or<00:03:48.989> y<00:03:49.049> which<00:03:49.200> is

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
this case i'm using the x or y which is

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.690 
this case i'm using the x or y which is
what<00:03:49.440> i<00:03:49.470> always<00:03:49.650> use<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:50.010> record<00:03:50.130> so<00:03:50.430> i<00:03:50.459> highly

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
what i always use to record so i highly

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.550 
what i always use to record so i highly
recommend<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.660> get<00:03:51.810> something<00:03:52.080> like<00:03:52.230> that

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
recommend you get something like that

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.130 
recommend you get something like that
you<00:03:52.830> have<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.040> use<00:03:53.280> one<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.519> those<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:54.140> record

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
you have to use one of those to record

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.330 
you have to use one of those to record
over<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.590> now<00:03:55.709> let<00:03:55.920> me<00:03:55.950> show<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.130> another

over it now let me show you another

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.580 
over it now let me show you another

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
example where the most actually do not

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.880

simple reason that i was using a

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.479 
simple reason that i was using a
particular<00:04:09.510> killstreak<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.440> is<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:11.310> does

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
particular killstreak that is that does

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.890 
particular killstreak that is that does
not<00:04:11.700> work<00:04:11.940> with<00:04:12.209> demos<00:04:12.570> now<00:04:12.720> let<00:04:12.870> me

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
not work with demos now let me

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.210

if you want to record demos do not run
here<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:18.750> if<00:04:18.810> you're<00:04:18.959> running<00:04:19.079> harriers<00:04:19.590> the

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
here so if you're running harriers the

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.250 
here so if you're running harriers the
demo<00:04:20.040> will<00:04:20.340> crash<00:04:20.669> also<00:04:21.539> some<00:04:21.750> demos<00:04:22.080> get

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
demo will crash also some demos get

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
up saving I am running windows 7 and

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.089 
up saving I am running windows 7 and
this<00:05:12.270> is<00:05:12.389> important<00:05:12.840> because<00:05:12.930> my<00:05:13.710> windows

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
this is important because my windows

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.379 
this is important because my windows

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
looks a little bit older because that's

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.760 
looks a little bit older because that's
the<00:05:15.539> theme<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.779> chose<00:05:16.110> I<00:05:16.229> chose<00:05:16.259> the<00:05:16.560> older

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
looking theme but windows 7 allows you

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:20.540
