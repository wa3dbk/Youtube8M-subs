00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
through is 95 degrees Celsius we will

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.399 
through is 95 degrees Celsius we will
then<00:01:32.460> move<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.030> 60<00:01:33.479> degrees<00:01:33.600> Celsius<00:01:34.290> or

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
then move on to 60 degrees Celsius or

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.440 
then move on to 60 degrees Celsius or
drop<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.829> down<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.460> ultimately<00:01:35.579> 72

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
drop it down and then ultimately 72

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.590 
drop it down and then ultimately 72
degrees<00:01:36.780> Celsius<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.700> 95<00:01:38.700> degrees<00:01:39.060> Celsius

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
degrees Celsius and 95 degrees Celsius

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.030 
degrees Celsius and 95 degrees Celsius
essentially<00:01:40.170> what<00:01:40.350> we're<00:01:40.500> doing<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.890> we're

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
essentially what we're doing is we're

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.800 
essentially what we're doing is we're
ripping<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.430> hydrogen<00:01:41.970> bonds<00:01:42.180> apart<00:01:42.630> between

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the two nitrogenous bases are the two

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
the two nitrogenous bases are the two
streams<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.710> also<00:01:46.710> what's<00:01:46.950> kind<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
streams and also what's kind of

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.429 
streams and also what's kind of
interesting<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.970> temperature<00:01:48.439> normal

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.069 
interesting at this temperature normal
DNA<00:01:50.369> polymerase<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.119> what<00:01:51.390> would<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.659> found<00:01:51.840> in

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
DNA polymerase or what would be found in

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.410 
DNA polymerase or what would be found in
us<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.590> example<00:01:52.680> would<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.610> denatured<00:01:54.060> are

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
us for example would be denatured are

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.789 
us for example would be denatured are
essentially<00:01:54.899> cooked<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.560> would<00:01:55.649> be

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
essentially cooked so it would be

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.550 
essentially cooked so it would be
non-functional<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.479> why<00:01:57.630> DNA

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
non-functional so this is why DNA

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.080 
non-functional so this is why DNA

this<00:02:08.429> temperature<00:02:08.970> will<00:02:09.179> allow<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.629> primers

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
this temperature will allow the primers

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.470 
this temperature will allow the primers

the real world normally we don't do PCR
just<00:02:38.019> for<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.319> sake<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.590> doing<00:02:38.800> pcr<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:40.120> let's

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
just for the sake of doing pcr so let's

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.420 
just for the sake of doing pcr so let's
say<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.480> was<00:02:40.630> interested<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.470> Wilson<00:02:42.099> disease

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
say I was interested in Wilson disease

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.370 
say I was interested in Wilson disease
this<00:02:42.880> is<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> disease<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:44.050> a<00:02:44.140> genetic

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
this is a disease it's a genetic

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.930 
this is a disease it's a genetic
disorder<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.980> prevents<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.610> body<00:02:45.760> from

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
disorder that prevents the body from

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.720 
disorder that prevents the body from
getting<00:02:46.450> rid<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.690> extra<00:02:47.170> copper<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.370> small

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
getting rid of extra copper so a small

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.400 
getting rid of extra copper so a small
amount<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.090> copper<00:02:49.420> obtained<00:02:49.780> from<00:02:49.959> your<00:02:50.110> food

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
amount of copper obtained from your food

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.130 
amount of copper obtained from your food
which<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:50.920> need<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.310> stay<00:02:51.519> healthy<00:02:52.140> becomes

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
which is need to stay healthy becomes

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.660 
which is need to stay healthy becomes
poisonous<00:02:53.530> because<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.100> aren't<00:02:54.280> able<00:02:54.489> to

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
poisonous because you aren't able to

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.270 
poisonous because you aren't able to
basically<00:02:55.269> get<00:02:55.750> rid<00:02:56.019> of<00:02:56.049> it<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.650> causes<00:02:56.950> a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
basically get rid of it so it causes a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.759 
basically get rid of it so it causes a
buildup<00:02:57.819> of<00:02:57.970> copper<00:02:58.299> levels<00:02:58.630> over<00:02:58.930> time<00:02:59.110> which

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
buildup of copper levels over time which

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.089 
buildup of copper levels over time which
can<00:03:00.040> cause<00:03:00.250> organ<00:03:00.880> damage<00:03:01.170> all<00:03:02.170> right<00:03:02.380> so

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
can cause organ damage all right so

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.670 
can cause organ damage all right so
let's<00:03:03.640> say<00:03:03.819> I've<00:03:03.940> obtained<00:03:04.420> samples<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.500> I've

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
let's say I've obtained samples so I've

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.770 
let's say I've obtained samples so I've
got<00:03:05.830> 100<00:03:06.459> patients<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.180> are<00:03:07.209> normal

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
got 100 patients that are normal

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.380 
got 100 patients that are normal
patients<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.440> 100<00:03:09.220> samples<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:09.849> would<00:03:10.030> be

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
patients and 100 samples that would be

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.839 
patients and 100 samples that would be
defined<00:03:10.989> as<00:03:11.110> having<00:03:11.260> Wilson's<00:03:11.860> disease<00:03:12.040> what

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
defined as having Wilson's disease what

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.729 
defined as having Wilson's disease what
I'm<00:03:12.970> very<00:03:13.180> interested<00:03:13.569> in<00:03:13.989> looking<00:03:14.170> at<00:03:14.530> is

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
I'm very interested in looking at is

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.320 
I'm very interested in looking at is
whether<00:03:15.160> there's<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.549> difference<00:03:16.000> in<00:03:16.150> their

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
whether there's a difference in their

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.599 
whether there's a difference in their
sequence<00:03:16.989> somewhere<00:03:17.680> within<00:03:17.859> their<00:03:18.160> genome

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
sequence somewhere within their genome

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.830 
sequence somewhere within their genome
that<00:03:19.299> may<00:03:20.049> indicate<00:03:20.709> where<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.190> problem<00:03:21.640> lies

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
that may indicate where the problem lies

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.810 
that may indicate where the problem lies
so<00:03:22.840> what<00:03:23.320> I<00:03:23.350> do<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.620> I've<00:03:23.920> obtained<00:03:24.340> their<00:03:24.519> DNA

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
so what I do is I've obtained their DNA

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.270 
so what I do is I've obtained their DNA
lessees<00:03:25.299> from<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.690> cheek<00:03:25.959> cell<00:03:26.260> but<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.040> need

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
lessees from the cheek cell but I need

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.460 
lessees from the cheek cell but I need
to<00:03:27.430> find<00:03:27.670> out<00:03:27.790> exactly<00:03:27.820> where<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.959> mutation

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
to find out exactly where the mutation

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.770 
to find out exactly where the mutation
is<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:30.130> I'm<00:03:30.310> going<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.549> do<00:03:30.760> some<00:03:31.060> work<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.450> try

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
is so I'm going to do some work and try

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.650 
is so I'm going to do some work and try
to<00:03:31.840> find<00:03:32.200> out<00:03:32.819> what<00:03:33.819> could<00:03:34.030> be<00:03:34.120> interesting

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
to find out what could be interesting

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.420 
to find out what could be interesting
for<00:03:34.690> me<00:03:37.109> all<00:03:38.109> right<00:03:38.170> since<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:39.010> have<00:03:39.040> all<00:03:39.400> of

for me all right since I have all of
their<00:03:39.640> genomic<00:03:40.000> DNA<00:03:40.569> I<00:03:40.810> could<00:03:41.470> sequence<00:03:42.340> all

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
their genomic DNA I could sequence all

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.509 
their genomic DNA I could sequence all
of<00:03:42.819> their<00:03:42.970> genomic<00:03:43.560> sequences<00:03:44.560> so<00:03:44.709> all<00:03:44.859> 23

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
of their genomic sequences so all 23

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.670 
of their genomic sequences so all 23
sets<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.940> chromosomes<00:03:46.299> but<00:03:47.109> unfortunately

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
sets of chromosomes but unfortunately

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.500 
sets of chromosomes but unfortunately
that<00:03:47.709> comes<00:03:48.040> out<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.370> be<00:03:48.400> about<00:03:48.609> 3<00:03:49.120> billion

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
that comes out to be about 3 billion

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.750 
that comes out to be about 3 billion
base<00:03:49.750> pairs<00:03:50.049> of<00:03:50.470> DNA<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:51.340> that's<00:03:51.549> not<00:03:51.700> very

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
base pairs of DNA and that's not very

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.879 
base pairs of DNA and that's not very
practical<00:03:52.180> it's<00:03:52.750> actually<00:03:53.170> quite<00:03:53.440> cost

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
practical it's actually quite cost

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.490 
practical it's actually quite cost
prohibitive<00:03:54.359> so<00:03:55.359> what<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.720> really<00:03:56.079> need<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.319> do

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
prohibitive so what I really need to do

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.500 
prohibitive so what I really need to do
is<00:03:56.530> narrow<00:03:57.190> down<00:03:57.400> my<00:03:57.459> search<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:58.030> little<00:03:58.329> bit

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
is narrow down my search a little bit

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.780 
is narrow down my search a little bit
further<00:03:58.750> so<00:03:59.650> if<00:03:59.799> I<00:03:59.920> look<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.280> little<00:04:00.459> bit<00:04:00.639> more

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
further so if I look a little bit more

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.660 
further so if I look a little bit more
into<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> research<00:04:01.569> I<00:04:01.900> notice<00:04:02.680> that<00:04:02.920> actually

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
into the research I notice that actually

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.090 
into the research I notice that actually
there's<00:04:04.000> been<00:04:04.060> some<00:04:04.630> studies<00:04:04.900> that<00:04:05.100> implicate

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
there's been some studies that implicate

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.280 
there's been some studies that implicate
chromosome<00:04:06.819> 13<00:04:08.040> into<00:04:09.040> Wilson's<00:04:09.670> disease<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:11.019> I

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
chromosome 13 into Wilson's disease so I

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.069 
chromosome 13 into Wilson's disease so I
could<00:04:11.590> sequence<00:04:11.950> chromosome<00:04:12.489> 13

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
could sequence chromosome 13

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.539 
could sequence chromosome 13
unfortunately<00:04:14.079> that's<00:04:14.590> about<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.010> hundred<00:04:15.160> and

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
unfortunately that's about a hundred and

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.509 
unfortunately that's about a hundred and
fourteen<00:04:16.060> million<00:04:16.419> base<00:04:16.780> pairs<00:04:16.930> still<00:04:17.829> quite

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
fourteen million base pairs still quite

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.610 
fourteen million base pairs still quite
large<00:04:18.880> so<00:04:19.539> I<00:04:19.570> need<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:19.930> narrow<00:04:20.200> this<00:04:20.380> down<00:04:20.440> a

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
large so I need to narrow this down a

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.070 
large so I need to narrow this down a
little<00:04:20.769> bit<00:04:21.100> further<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.330> did<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.659> little<00:04:22.720> bit

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
little bit further so I did a little bit

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.839 
little bit further so I did a little bit
more<00:04:23.260> research<00:04:23.470> in<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:23.919> area<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.340> found<00:04:24.460> that

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
more research in the area and found that

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.510 
more research in the area and found that
a<00:04:24.880> region<00:04:25.390> 13<00:04:25.990> q<00:04:26.460> 14.3

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
a region 13 q 14.3

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.460 
a region 13 q 14.3
has<00:04:27.789> been<00:04:28.030> implicated<00:04:28.569> in<00:04:28.720> Wilson's<00:04:29.289> disease

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
has been implicated in Wilson's disease

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.950 
has been implicated in Wilson's disease
so<00:04:30.310> I'll<00:04:30.639> further<00:04:30.879> look<00:04:31.120> at<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:31.389> region<00:04:31.810> and

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
so I'll further look at that region and

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.930 
so I'll further look at that region and
what<00:04:32.229> I<00:04:32.259> found<00:04:32.620> with<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.919> gene<00:04:33.340> called<00:04:33.780> atp7b

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
what I found with a gene called atp7b

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.170 
what I found with a gene called atp7b
which<00:04:36.940> is<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:37.840> copper<00:04:38.259> transport<00:04:38.889> protein<00:04:39.610> so

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
which is a copper transport protein so

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.790 
which is a copper transport protein so
this<00:04:40.479> is<00:04:40.509> definitely<00:04:40.900> where<00:04:41.229> I<00:04:41.289> want<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.620> look

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
this is definitely where I want to look

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.040 
this is definitely where I want to look
but<00:04:42.580> if<00:04:42.669> I<00:04:42.759> look<00:04:42.940> at<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.180> structure<00:04:43.509> I<00:04:43.659> noticed

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
but if I look at the structure I noticed

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.279 
but if I look at the structure I noticed
as<00:04:44.139> 21<00:04:44.770> exons<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.550> it's<00:04:45.940> transcript<00:04:46.599> or<00:04:46.750> mrna

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
as 21 exons and it's transcript or mrna

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.129 
as 21 exons and it's transcript or mrna
is<00:04:47.620> about<00:04:48.159> six<00:04:48.550> thousand<00:04:49.030> base<00:04:49.180> pairs<00:04:49.210> so<00:04:50.110> I

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
is about six thousand base pairs so I

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.510 
is about six thousand base pairs so I
don't<00:04:50.349> want<00:04:50.500> to<00:04:50.590> sequence<00:04:50.949> through<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.340> whole

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
don't want to sequence through the whole

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.999 
don't want to sequence through the whole
thing<00:04:51.780> but<00:04:52.780> I<00:04:52.810> look<00:04:53.020> further<00:04:53.229> to<00:04:53.500> sequence<00:04:53.889> and

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
thing but I look further to sequence and

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.189 
thing but I look further to sequence and
I<00:04:54.039> see<00:04:54.220> that<00:04:54.370> X<00:04:54.610> on<00:04:54.819> 18<00:04:55.449> seems<00:04:55.870> quite

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
I see that X on 18 seems quite

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.770 
I see that X on 18 seems quite
interesting<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:56.949> me<00:04:57.069> it's<00:04:57.430> about<00:04:57.520> 200<00:04:58.479> base

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
interesting to me it's about 200 base

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.740 
interesting to me it's about 200 base
pairs<00:04:59.069> so<00:05:00.069> this<00:05:00.430> is<00:05:00.580> doable<00:05:00.849> so<00:05:01.330> here's<00:05:01.690> my

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
pairs so this is doable so here's my

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.320 
pairs so this is doable so here's my
sequence<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.919> what<00:05:03.490> I'm<00:05:03.580> going<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:03.759> do<00:05:03.970> next

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
sequence and what I'm going to do next

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.909 
sequence and what I'm going to do next
is<00:05:04.659> kind<00:05:04.990> of<00:05:05.050> put<00:05:05.259> it<00:05:05.349> in<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.590> form<00:05:05.860> that

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
is kind of put it in the form that

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.909 
is kind of put it in the form that
you're<00:05:06.550> used<00:05:06.849> to<00:05:07.120> so<00:05:07.990> here's<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.380> five<00:05:08.590> prime

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
you're used to so here's the five prime

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.740 
you're used to so here's the five prime
to<00:05:08.979> three<00:05:09.130> prime<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.819> a<00:05:09.849> double<00:05:10.180> stranded<00:05:10.569> and

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
to three prime and a double stranded and

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.659 
to three prime and a double stranded and
now<00:05:11.440> we're<00:05:11.620> going<00:05:11.740> to<00:05:11.830> look<00:05:12.009> at<00:05:12.190> how<00:05:12.460> we're

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
now we're going to look at how we're

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.379 
now we're going to look at how we're
going<00:05:12.819> to<00:05:12.880> utilize<00:05:13.199> pcr<00:05:15.000> next<00:05:16.000> I<00:05:16.120> have<00:05:16.240> to

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
going to utilize pcr next I have to

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.719 
going to utilize pcr next I have to
design<00:05:16.690> two<00:05:16.870> primers<00:05:17.349> that<00:05:17.680> will<00:05:18.190> flank<00:05:18.550> the

design two primers that will flank the

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.689 
design two primers that will flank the
region<00:05:19.090> that<00:05:19.210> I'm<00:05:19.330> interested<00:05:19.690> in<00:05:19.990> amplifying

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
region that I'm interested in amplifying

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.610 
region that I'm interested in amplifying
please<00:05:21.699> notice<00:05:22.120> that<00:05:22.150> I<00:05:22.389> will<00:05:22.690> have<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:23.139> forward

the<00:05:28.810> sequences<00:05:29.469> are<00:05:29.590> also<00:05:30.150> complementary<00:05:31.150> to

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
the sequences are also complementary to

it as you please so hopefully you
learned<00:06:55.889> a<00:06:56.009> little<00:06:56.130> bit<00:06:56.280> about<00:06:56.520> pcr<00:06:57.090> I<00:06:57.300> will

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
learned a little bit about pcr I will

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.520 
learned a little bit about pcr I will
tell<00:06:58.259> you<00:06:58.380> that<00:06:58.410> PCR<00:06:59.280> is<00:06:59.310> a<00:06:59.840> very<00:07:00.840> widely<00:07:01.139> used

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
tell you that PCR is a very widely used

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.320 
tell you that PCR is a very widely used
protocol<00:07:02.070> using<00:07:02.490> a<00:07:02.520> number<00:07:02.639> labs<00:07:02.970> around<00:07:03.150> the

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
protocol using a number labs around the

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.120 
protocol using a number labs around the
world<00:07:03.389> and<00:07:03.780> there<00:07:04.380> are<00:07:04.440> many<00:07:04.620> different

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.340 
world and there are many different
varieties<00:07:05.250> of<00:07:05.699> pcr<00:07:06.270> so<00:07:06.690> what<00:07:06.930> I<00:07:06.960> have<00:07:07.139> given

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
varieties of pcr so what I have given

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.140 
varieties of pcr so what I have given
here<00:07:07.680> is<00:07:07.740> an<00:07:07.889> example<00:07:07.979> of<00:07:08.430> just<00:07:08.490> a<00:07:08.789> basic

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
here is an example of just a basic

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.560 
here is an example of just a basic
protocol<00:07:09.930> in<00:07:10.169> a<00:07:10.410> standard<00:07:10.800> pcr<00:07:11.190> reaction<00:07:11.759> but

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
protocol in a standard pcr reaction but

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.540 
protocol in a standard pcr reaction but
this<00:07:12.720> will<00:07:12.930> differ<00:07:13.320> in<00:07:13.530> terms<00:07:13.560> of<00:07:14.039> how<00:07:14.280> big<00:07:14.520> of

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
this will differ in terms of how big of

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.610 
this will differ in terms of how big of
a<00:07:14.669> piece<00:07:14.850> you<00:07:15.000> want<00:07:15.120> to<00:07:15.270> amplify<00:07:15.600> and<00:07:16.110> your

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 
particular perfect purpose so there are

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.870 
particular perfect purpose so there are
lots<00:07:19.530> of<00:07:19.710> different<00:07:20.070> types<00:07:20.220> out<00:07:20.430> there<00:07:20.490> and
