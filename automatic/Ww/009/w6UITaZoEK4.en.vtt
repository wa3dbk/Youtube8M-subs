00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.019 

all<00:00:03.179> right<00:00:03.300> we're<00:00:03.480> asked<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:04.250> express<00:00:05.250> 700

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
all right we're asked to express 700

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.610 
all right we're asked to express 700
meters<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.569> terms<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:07.109> yards<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:10.200> question

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
meters in terms of yards the question

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.339 
meters in terms of yards the question
actually<00:00:10.800> says<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> rectangular<00:00:12.240> field<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.719> 700

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
actually says a rectangular field is 700

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.160 
actually says a rectangular field is 700
meters<00:00:13.679> long<00:00:14.389> expressed<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.630> number<00:00:16.020> in

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
meters long expressed this number in

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.340 
meters long expressed this number in
yards<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.550> know<00:00:17.609> that's<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.150> too<00:00:18.900> small<00:00:19.050> for

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
yards and I know that's a too small for

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.950 
yards and I know that's a too small for
you<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> read<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> basically<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:21.570> we<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:21.840> to

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
you to read so basically what we have to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.340 
you to read so basically what we have to
do<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.289> written<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:23.060> bold<00:00:24.060> black<00:00:24.330> print<00:00:25.050> here

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
do is written in bold black print here

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.250 
do is written in bold black print here
in<00:00:26.250> order<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.699> do<00:00:26.880> these<00:00:27.420> conversions<00:00:28.109> you

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
in order to do these conversions you

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.070 
in order to do these conversions you
always<00:00:28.590> need<00:00:28.830> an<00:00:29.119> equivalent<00:00:30.119> see<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.869> need

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
always need an equivalent see you need

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.470 
always need an equivalent see you need
something<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.710> tells<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.520> relates

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
something that tells you that relates

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.620 
something that tells you that relates
meters<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.260> yards<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.160> case<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.390> you're

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
meters to yards in this case so you're

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.860 
meters to yards in this case so you're
gonna<00:00:36.719> want<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> refer<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.950> textbook

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
gonna want to refer to your textbook

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.530 
gonna want to refer to your textbook
it's<00:00:39.870> section<00:00:40.410> 111<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.370> again<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> know<00:00:42.270> this

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
it's section 111 and again I know this

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.350 
it's section 111 and again I know this
is<00:00:42.690> hard<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.020> read<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.590> video<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.149> in<00:00:45.149> your

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
is hard to read in video but in your

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.380 
is hard to read in video but in your
textbook<00:00:45.719> section<00:00:46.140> 111<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.730> then

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
textbook section 111 all right and then

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.900 
textbook section 111 all right and then
the<00:00:48.600> page<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.200> has<00:00:49.430> equivalencies<00:00:50.430> from

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the page that has equivalencies from

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.220 
the page that has equivalencies from
meters<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.300> yards<00:00:52.969> looks<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
meters to yards looks like this and that

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.600 
meters to yards looks like this and that
should<00:00:55.440> give<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.710> at<00:00:55.770> least<00:00:55.800> an<00:00:56.070> idea<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.489> what

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
should give you at least an idea of what

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.000 
should give you at least an idea of what
it<00:00:56.730> looks<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.739> need

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
it looks like and the one that we need

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:12.100 
it looks like and the one that we need
is<00:01:03.170> specifically<00:01:05.720> says<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.369> 10<00:01:09.920> yards<00:01:10.920> is

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
is specifically says that 10 yards is

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.249 
is specifically says that 10 yards is
approximately<00:01:13.110> equal<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.390> 9<00:01:15.439> meters<00:01:18.259> all

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
approximately equal to 9 meters all

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.780 
approximately equal to 9 meters all
right<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.979> equivalency<00:01:20.640> we're

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
right so this is the equivalency we're

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:34.490 
right so this is the equivalency we're
going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.210> use

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.130 

and<00:01:35.500> let's<00:01:35.980> see<00:01:36.250> all<00:01:37.210> right<00:01:37.360> so<00:01:37.570> again<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:37.990> is

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
and let's see all right so again this is

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.490 
and let's see all right so again this is
our<00:01:38.290> equivalency<00:01:41.160> ten-yard<00:01:42.160> is

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
our equivalency ten-yard is

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:53.940 
our equivalency ten-yard is
approximately<00:01:44.500> equal<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.030> nine<00:01:46.890> meters<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
approximately equal to nine meters the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.920 
approximately equal to nine meters the
reason<00:01:54.310> this<00:01:54.430> equivalency<00:01:55.090> is<00:01:55.210> important<00:01:55.780> is

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
reason this equivalency is important is

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.630 
reason this equivalency is important is
it<00:01:56.140> gives<00:01:56.350> us<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.800> relationship<00:01:57.460> between

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
it gives us the relationship between

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.370 
it gives us the relationship between
yards<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.390> meters<00:01:59.250> if<00:02:00.250> we<00:02:00.490> know<00:02:00.670> where<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:02.020> 10

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
yards and meters if we know where if 10

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.680 
yards and meters if we know where if 10
yards<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.040> same<00:02:03.280> as<00:02:03.460> 9<00:02:03.670> meters<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.300> can

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
yards is the same as 9 meters I can

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.650 
yards is the same as 9 meters I can
write<00:02:04.870> this<00:02:05.050> two<00:02:05.500> different<00:02:05.830> ways<00:02:05.979> now<00:02:06.250> I

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
write this two different ways now I

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:18.500 
write this two different ways now I
could<00:02:07.660> say<00:02:07.900> that<00:02:12.750> 10<00:02:14.010> yards<00:02:15.420> over<00:02:16.420> 9<00:02:17.250> meters

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
could say that 10 yards over 9 meters

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.230 
could say that 10 yards over 9 meters
this<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.570> equivalent<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.590> 1<00:02:20.980> if<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.120> have

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
this is equivalent to a 1 if you have

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.510 
this is equivalent to a 1 if you have
something<00:02:22.540> over<00:02:22.990> itself<00:02:23.380> that's<00:02:24.010> equivalent

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
something over itself that's equivalent

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.770 
something over itself that's equivalent
to<00:02:24.880> 1<00:02:25.090> or<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:26.940> can<00:02:27.940> say<00:02:28.230> 9<00:02:29.550> meters<00:02:30.550> is<00:02:30.970> equivalent

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
to 1 or I can say 9 meters is equivalent

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.660 
to 1 or I can say 9 meters is equivalent
to<00:02:32.709> 10<00:02:33.270> yards<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.770> again<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.340> equivalent

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
to 10 yards and again this is equivalent

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.280 
to 10 yards and again this is equivalent
to<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.150> 1<00:02:37.450> because<00:02:37.900> it's<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.260> same<00:02:38.530> length<00:02:39.250> okay

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
to a 1 because it's the same length okay

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.660 
to a 1 because it's the same length okay
we're<00:02:41.290> going<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.470> use<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.860> fact<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.400> do<00:02:42.550> our

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
we're going to use that fact to do our

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:53.760 
we're going to use that fact to do our
conversion<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:46.060> have<00:02:46.290> 700<00:02:47.290> meters

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.430 

and<00:02:54.460> you<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.240> need<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.630> remember<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.050> put

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
and you just need to remember to put

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.040 
and you just need to remember to put
that<00:02:56.710> over<00:02:58.950> a1<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:01.450> want<00:03:01.630> this<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.900> be<00:03:01.930> a

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
that over a1 you want this to be a

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.930 
that over a1 you want this to be a
fraction<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.560> we<00:03:02.800> can<00:03:02.830> cancel<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.550> unit's

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
fraction so we can cancel the unit's

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.850 
fraction so we can cancel the unit's
here<00:03:04.000> okay<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.320> now<00:03:05.560> we're<00:03:05.710> going<00:03:05.800> to

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
here okay and now we're going to

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.370 
here okay and now we're going to
multiply<00:03:06.430> this<00:03:07.050> times<00:03:08.050> something<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:10.380> we

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
multiply this times something and we

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.000 
multiply this times something and we
want<00:03:11.880> meters<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:13.240> be<00:03:13.390> on<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.840> bottom<00:03:14.050> so<00:03:14.830> the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
want meters to be on the bottom so the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.630 
want meters to be on the bottom so the
units<00:03:15.430> will<00:03:15.820> cancel<00:03:16.170> okay<00:03:17.170> if<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.950> select<00:03:18.460> this

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
units will cancel okay if I select this

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.340 
units will cancel okay if I select this
fraction<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:21.850> rational<00:03:22.510> expression<00:03:22.660> I

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
fraction this rational expression I

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.190 
fraction this rational expression I
would<00:03:23.830> have<00:03:24.010> yards<00:03:24.550> on<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.940> bottom<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:25.480> my

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
would have yards on the bottom and my

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.580 
would have yards on the bottom and my
units<00:03:26.620> would<00:03:26.800> not<00:03:27.040> cancel<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.140> don't<00:03:29.380> want

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
units would not cancel so I don't want

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.310 
units would not cancel so I don't want
this<00:03:29.830> one<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.570> want<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.630> one

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
this one I want this one

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:44.840 
this one I want this one
so<00:03:32.950> if<00:03:33.100> I<00:03:33.220> write<00:03:33.490> 10<00:03:35.190> yards<00:03:36.190> over<00:03:36.570> nine<00:03:38.790> meters

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:52.970 

then<00:03:45.850> meters<00:03:46.780> cancel<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:49.230> I'm<00:03:50.230> left<00:03:50.640> in<00:03:51.640> yards

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
then meters cancel and I'm left in yards

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.650 
then meters cancel and I'm left in yards
now<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.010> just<00:03:54.160> do<00:03:54.520> whatever<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.940> math<00:03:55.120> tells<00:03:55.420> me

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
now I just do whatever the math tells me

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.290 
now I just do whatever the math tells me
to<00:03:55.780> do<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:57.280> when<00:03:57.490> I<00:03:57.520> multiply<00:03:57.959> 700<00:03:58.959> times<00:03:59.380> 10<00:03:59.890> I

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
to do so when I multiply 700 times 10 I

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:08.100 
to do so when I multiply 700 times 10 I
get<00:04:02.940> 7,000<00:04:04.770> over<00:04:05.770> 9<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:07.150> know<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.750> kind<00:04:07.959> of

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
get 7,000 over 9 I know I kind of

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.510 
get 7,000 over 9 I know I kind of
shifted<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.620> down<00:04:08.800> a<00:04:08.830> little<00:04:09.070> but<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.370> was

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
shifted it down a little but I was

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.490 
shifted it down a little but I was
running<00:04:09.850> into<00:04:10.120> my<00:04:10.330> numbers<00:04:10.690> there<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:11.020> the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
running into my numbers there and the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.990 
running into my numbers there and the
unit's<00:04:11.830> left<00:04:12.130> are<00:04:13.120> yards<00:04:14.040> okay<00:04:15.040> depending<00:04:15.640> on

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
unit's left are yards okay depending on

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.460 
unit's left are yards okay depending on
what<00:04:16.120> you've<00:04:16.270> been<00:04:16.420> asked<00:04:16.720> for<00:04:16.840> this<00:04:17.080> may<00:04:17.320> or

what you've been asked for this may or
may<00:04:17.620> not<00:04:17.650> be<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.690> sufficient<00:04:19.690> answer<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:20.260> can't

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
may not be a sufficient answer I can't

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.110 
may not be a sufficient answer I can't
really<00:04:21.220> reduce<00:04:21.990> 7,000<00:04:23.220> over<00:04:24.220> 9<00:04:24.460> because<00:04:25.090> 9

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
really reduce 7,000 over 9 because 9

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.830 
really reduce 7,000 over 9 because 9

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
to have to change this to a mixed number

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.210 
to have to change this to a mixed number
in<00:04:38.380> order<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.830> do<00:04:38.980> that<00:04:40.080> this<00:04:41.080> is<00:04:41.220> 7,000

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
in order to do that this is 7,000

in order to do that this is 7,000
divided<00:04:42.640> by<00:04:42.790> 9<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:44.400> might<00:04:45.400> be<00:04:45.520> running<00:04:45.669> out<00:04:45.880> of

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
divided by 9 I might be running out of

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.400 
divided by 9 I might be running out of
room<00:04:46.210> here<00:04:46.240> little<00:04:46.660> so<00:04:46.780> I<00:04:46.810> have<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.080> push<00:04:47.290> up<00:04:49.410> so

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
room here little so I have to push up so

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.600 
room here little so I have to push up so
here<00:04:50.740> is

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.910 

7,000<00:04:55.050> divided<00:04:56.050> by<00:04:56.200> nine<00:04:56.500> goes<00:04:57.400> into<00:04:57.430> seventy

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
7,000 divided by nine goes into seventy

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.750 
7,000 divided by nine goes into seventy
six<00:04:59.920> times

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.740 

no<00:05:05.360> it<00:05:05.480> goes<00:05:05.600> in<00:05:05.840> seven<00:05:06.350> times<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.830> that's<00:05:06.920> 63

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
no it goes in seven times and that's 63

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.580 
no it goes in seven times and that's 63
so<00:05:08.750> it<00:05:08.870> goes<00:05:09.050> in<00:05:09.320> seven<00:05:09.830> times<00:05:10.690> 7<00:05:11.690> times<00:05:11.960> 9<00:05:12.260> is

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
so it goes in seven times 7 times 9 is

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.690 
so it goes in seven times 7 times 9 is
63<00:05:15.310> when<00:05:16.310> you<00:05:16.430> subtract<00:05:16.880> you<00:05:17.060> get<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.300> 7<00:05:18.700> you

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
63 when you subtract you get a 7 you

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.990 
63 when you subtract you get a 7 you
bring<00:05:19.940> down<00:05:20.120> your<00:05:20.180> next<00:05:20.630> digit<00:05:21.430> 9<00:05:22.430> goes<00:05:22.790> into

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.240 

77<00:05:26.000> times<00:05:26.800> gives<00:05:27.800> us<00:05:28.030> 63<00:05:30.790> 7<00:05:31.790> left<00:05:32.000> over<00:05:33.250> bring

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
77 times gives us 63 7 left over bring

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:46.580 
77 times gives us 63 7 left over bring
down<00:05:34.430> the<00:05:34.610> next<00:05:34.790> digit<00:05:35.800> 9<00:05:36.800> goes<00:05:37.100> into<00:05:38.740> 77<00:05:39.740> times

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.550 

seven<00:05:47.430> left<00:05:47.610> over<00:05:48.030> I've<00:05:48.480> used<00:05:49.200> up<00:05:49.350> all<00:05:49.530> my

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
seven left over I've used up all my

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.120 
seven left over I've used up all my
digits<00:05:50.190> right<00:05:50.730> and<00:05:51.410> they<00:05:52.410> want<00:05:52.590> a<00:05:52.800> mixed

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
digits right and they want a mixed

00:05:53.130 --> 00:06:02.690 
digits right and they want a mixed
number<00:05:53.460> so<00:05:53.690> that<00:05:54.690> means<00:06:00.800> this<00:06:01.800> seven<00:06:02.430> right

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
number so that means this seven right

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.310 
number so that means this seven right
here<00:06:02.730> we'll<00:06:03.389> see<00:06:03.600> if<00:06:03.660> we<00:06:03.780> can<00:06:03.960> make<00:06:04.110> that<00:06:04.260> a

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
here we'll see if we can make that a

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.390 
here we'll see if we can make that a
blue<00:06:04.710> seven<00:06:05.250> that<00:06:06.210> seven<00:06:06.990> is<00:06:07.169> the<00:06:07.770> remainder

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
blue seven that seven is the remainder

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.200 
blue seven that seven is the remainder
okay<00:06:09.120> you<00:06:09.840> write<00:06:10.020> that<00:06:10.290> as<00:06:10.669> your<00:06:11.669> numerator

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
okay you write that as your numerator

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.870 
okay you write that as your numerator
and<00:06:14.450> you<00:06:15.450> keep<00:06:15.810> this<00:06:16.169> nine<00:06:16.560> right<00:06:17.400> here

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
and you keep this nine right here

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.430 
and you keep this nine right here
that<00:06:18.180> you<00:06:18.300> were<00:06:18.419> divided<00:06:18.750> remember<00:06:19.080> this<00:06:19.200> was

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
that you were divided remember this was

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.400 
that you were divided remember this was
your<00:06:19.490> denominator<00:06:20.490> well<00:06:21.419> it's<00:06:21.600> still<00:06:21.930> the

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
your denominator well it's still the

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.530 
your denominator well it's still the
denominator

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
denominator

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.450 
denominator
okay<00:06:24.740> so<00:06:26.270> 777<00:06:27.270> and<00:06:27.419> seven<00:06:27.960> nine<00:06:28.200> is<00:06:28.560> the

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
okay so 777 and seven nine is the

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:45.570 
okay so 777 and seven nine is the
correct<00:06:30.000> answer<00:06:31.430> our<00:06:32.430> units<00:06:32.910> are<00:06:33.320> yards

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:57.730 

I'll<00:06:46.120> zoom<00:06:46.419> out<00:06:46.599> a<00:06:46.660> little<00:06:46.870> bit
