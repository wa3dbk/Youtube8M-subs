 many directors put on the needle 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.260
 but nobody hits the nerve 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.070

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.520

 the nerve as this movie they come 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.490
 just need to look out of the window 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.950

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:13.720

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.260
 times such a fine internat knows this 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.560
 boarding a distinguished internat 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.369
 In all respects, this is no longer an internat 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.369
 from a cadaver 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.980
 that she is to be 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.980
 absolute 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:42.760
 I want to have showered but with it 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.019
 Do you make the students crazy ? 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.120
