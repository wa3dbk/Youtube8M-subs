00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.510
 How are you 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.000
 today in whose version we are going 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.220
 to make a pinch with roasted garlic not 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.140
 It has a lot of fat on the inside 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.330
 of meat but has a capita of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.600
 fat on top that will help us 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.390
 taste with this recipe the first thing I go 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.510
 to do is to sound both garlic and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.179
 'cyclone' 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.340
 he blew himself with some salt in grain and 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:42.770
 thick pepper 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.680
 and now we are ready to move 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.870
 grilled before placing the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.400
 grill on the grill I will put some 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.170
 rosemary leaves the rosemary goes 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.390
 aromatize a little in our flesh 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.820
 can use it when they do not have chips 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.770
 wood these rosemary wands the sum 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.860
 zinc first with water so you do not 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.870
 burn so fast in the coal 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.870
 and now if I place on the grill 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.650
 I'm going to show the branch of the bouquets 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.890
 direct fire 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.680
 this cut brings a thickness of an inch 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.360
 and a half and once we have sealed it 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.690
 I will pass it to indirect fire 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.380
 together with the cyclone I'm going to put the garlic 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.380
 who resists 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.100
 and we cover 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.050
 now 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.900
 when you have studied on both sides 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:45.120
 I'm going to say it in indirect fire and the 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.120
 I'm going to leave it in the direct fire 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.570
 here I have a little butter that 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.740
 melt 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.799
 I'm going to crush it with these garlic 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.100
 and I'm going to add a little bit of vinegar 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.100
 balsamic 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.530
 he crushed them and turned it around very well 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.810
 already last before serving I'll 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.030
 take a rosemary wand and I'm going to 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.780
 rub as if you were congenial 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.220
 evil plan ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.620
 I'll give you some oil 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.250
 olive 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.780
 and I'm going to use it to varnish my meat 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.480
 You can leave it here at the time of 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.819
 plating just to remind someone to 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.220
 he's going to eat it that was smoked with 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.140
 rosemary I will place some of the 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.500
 butter mixture with garlic on the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.500
 strong 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.910
 today we leave the cut almost fine 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.890
 cooked to please people who do not 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.890
 he likes red meat 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.620
 despite being well cooked look at what 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.620
 soft that are 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.060
 succulent so you already know for your 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.280
