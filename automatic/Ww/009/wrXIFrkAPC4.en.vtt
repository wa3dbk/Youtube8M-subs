00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.330
 hello and welcome one more day to the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.430
 tutorials for 13 records in this 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.530
 occasion we are going to make some spotlights with 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.360
 Energy saving lamps and a simple 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.760
 planter that you would put 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.680
 your plants at home do some 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.240
 focuses so that you can see yourself better in the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.280
 videos that you do at your home or 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.460
 for interviews and documentaries under 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.460
 budget 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.760
 well we will start by marking the 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.500
 position of the caps we will measure with 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.000
 a rule to set their centers and with 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 the help of the closing thread of one of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.899
 they will mark where we will 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.460
 cut this process you can do it with 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.590
 a knife or with scissors with some 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.770
 pliers the case is that in the end you 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.630
 adjust tested this one we will give tail 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.670
 all the inside of the pot to paste 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.320
 albal paper and thus reflect all the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.490
 possible light towards the person who 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 put forward 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.790
 with aluminum tape we will complete the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 edges and interiors that have 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.020
 cracked to prevent the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.310
 light escape we will open the holes the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.869
 caps and we'll put them back 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.789
 then we will do electrical installation 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.590
 for this we will cut the little chubs 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.200
 of cable and we will put each one in its 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.060
 cap made this we will place the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.850
 bulbs that are no longer going to hit 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.439
 because they are protected and we will do 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.179
 exterior installation we will put a box 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.979
 of light with the connections and the schÃ¼co 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:43.289
 end of the cable and that's it, this is 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.179
 the result as you can see the spotlights give very 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.369
 good light have cost us very little 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.679
 money and now we can do our 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.060
 videos with better quality and enjoying 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.429
 an illumination that will allow us 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.679
 really enjoy the power of our 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.420
 video camera so nothing if it has 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.340
 I like the video, I only remember you 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.069
 you can subscribe to my channel and give me 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.729
 like for this to keep moving forward 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.439
 luck in all your projects 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.439
