00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:14.690
 meditation of thoughts we begin the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.690
 our meditation as usual 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.609
 bringing attention to the breath e 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.269
 following the sensations of the breath 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.269
 moment by moment 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.530
 moment by moment 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.080
 and when the mind vaguely notes where it is 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.160
 mind and then bring them attention 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.160
 to the breath 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.930
 therefore expand the field 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.890
 attention to include everything 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.890
 the body the body that breathes 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:44.680
 and when the mind vague to notice where 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:48.869
 is the mind and then bring back 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.869
 attention to the body that breathes 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.350
 moment by moment 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:24.200
 we can therefore still expand the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.440
 field of attention to include i 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.440
 sounds 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:46.560
 then then focus on 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:48.329
 sounds as much as possible by noticing the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.079
 tendency of the mind to attribute a 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:03:02.459
 meaning to each sound a 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:03:05.939
 label the sounds by trying a 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.989
 hear the sounds as you sound like 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.989
 was a music 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:29.150
 a sound has its timbre its break 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:38.270
 its intensity 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:42.400
 its duration the sounds of the body the sounds 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:46.790
 of the room the sounds outside the room 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.340
 they mix in a sound environment that 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:55.370
 you can follow moment by moment how 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:57.489
 a concert of lending sounds 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.489
 caution 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.810
 of sounds 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.810
 moment by moment 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.290
 and when the mind vague to notice where 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:20.940
 is the mind and then bring back 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:27.590
 attention to the sounds for theirs 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.590
 sound quality as it sounds 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.449
 the sounds emerge 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.200
 and then they dissolve 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.880
 in the same way that sounds emerge 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.270
 and they are so resolved also i 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.270
 thoughts 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.720
 then then now bring your attention 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:26.510
 right on the thoughts you can put to 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.510
 center of your attention thoughts 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.980
 you kept in the center of yours 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.790
 attention the breath 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.440
 the body sounds now you can keep to 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:45.830
 center of attention precisely i 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:45.830
 thoughts each thought emerges 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.440
 and then dissolves 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:07.710
 it can help you imagine you have 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:13.090
 in front of you a big white screen 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:15.430
 where thoughts are projected thoughts 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.909
 can be made of images of 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.909
 words 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:42.030
 and if you 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:44.360
 think that you have no thoughts this is 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.360
 your thought 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:07.039
 if a thought becomes particularly 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:07.039
 intrusively 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:22.169
 engaging you can choose to bring 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.169
 attention to the breath 

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:30.550
 only time to get out of 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:36.090
 involvement and then resume at 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:36.090
 explore the emergence of thoughts 

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:59.129
 therefore to conclude this meditation 

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:06.059
 choosing the appropriate time for 

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.059
 open the eyes
