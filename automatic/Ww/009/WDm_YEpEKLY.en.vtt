00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.720
 how many hostages 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.820
 Saturday 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.750
 later 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.270
 suddenly they appeared 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.630
 but why 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.030
 why bother besides if it has to be done to achieve it 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.489
 to attend 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.870
 the signing of the agreement 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.940
 the export 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.430
 let's see let's listen 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.490
 with everything has wanted public dear public tranquility we had 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.510
 early some of them I just wanted to do 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.580
 inside the temple of the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.810
 but what is the isolation we can lose the stirrups of people who 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.230
 allow they were he I'm talking 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.200
 we can lose our temper we can put them wrong to get us wrong in many 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.730
 Sometimes we have very difficult times but I think this is a 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.740
 they are in a hammock to be able to go on stage to sing and do it well I think that 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.700
 it is a chain of more where you learn what is the tower the tolerance 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.910
 what is the conviviality what is the respect what is this area some that 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.830
 united to the others then I think dani that this really is unforgivable 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.510
 what you did is unforgivable, you also have a minor in front of you 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.739
 please allow you please quiet guys please that is not even 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.750
 minor in front of you and even less doubt who else has capabilities 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.939
 different I understand that they can lose their sanity 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.939
 but never your weekend 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.370
 Well, no teacher 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.090
 first of all I think it's human to make mistakes is for men to ask 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.080
 apologize and I apologize to my friend edgar because I fix this 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.139
 problem the week of production insisted on getting this out 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.139
 however this was something we talked about is about it 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.769
 I apologize because I really lost my sanity and I think that in two 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.539
 months of confinement and everything that has happened to me 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:53.609
 this until hard and good but an apology my friend edgar about everything 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.100
 that also has to be applauded in western Libya with Gaddafi 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.779
 indoor pyrané 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:01.959
 in front of this hour 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.419
 effectively what I think is true 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.419
 the production was told not to put that video 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.030
 because we arranged it was requested to the director of the idu but he was asked 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:16.819
 to the production that is not true listen to me the coast the director I'm 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.529
 asking me 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:20.500
 is being asked because 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.860
 because I need them to show because I need to understand that I 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.389
 I do not tolerate this kind of attitude 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.519
 neither in the house nor in the academy is disrespected 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.669
 You understand 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.479
 yes, if they do, they have to learn 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.629
 what is this 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.519
 that's why he's going to see 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.829
 so a reaction 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.400
 before such action there is a reaction is clear was that good that you ask 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.989
 sorry how good it was fixed but it was not you look neither he nor 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.849
 nobody to say that it does not take place if I ask it 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.930
 they put on the concert that was clear 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.570
 and this does not happen again guys please you are the next figures 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.570
 international and must have tolerance 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.579
 that is a value 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.309
 it is clear and you have to learn it goes away thank you very much 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:05.679
 thanks to you 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.989

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.620
 but now Asturian team 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.239
 but problems both with the best disposition up the hearts 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.590
 arrived on stage and the audience gives him a round of applause Daniel Ríolobos who is coming 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.020
 to face in the third instance 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.550

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.249

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.269
