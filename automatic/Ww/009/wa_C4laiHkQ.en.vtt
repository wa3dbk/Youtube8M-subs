00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
hands together slowly but then I'll play

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.540 
hands together slowly but then I'll play
it<00:00:32.430> through<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> metronome<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.899> 120<00:00:34.739> along

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550

that<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.360> exactly<00:00:39.540> where<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> make<00:00:40.290> my

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
that you can see exactly where I make my

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.260 
that you can see exactly where I make my
students<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:40.980> with<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.340> before<00:00:41.850> they<00:00:41.969> move<00:00:42.149> on

to the next exercise

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.010 
to the next exercise
so<00:00:44.070> are<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.610> ready<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:47.870> here<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.899> go

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
so are you ready here we go here we go

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.470 
so are you ready here we go here we go
stepping<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.920> skipping<00:00:50.039> first<00:00:51.000> let<00:00:51.239> me<00:00:51.270> show

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
stepping and skipping first let me show

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.029 
stepping and skipping first let me show
you<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> pattern<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.649> very

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
you the pattern and it's just very

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
you the pattern and it's just very
simple<00:00:53.370> somehow<00:00:54.000> stepping<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.629> skipping

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
simple somehow stepping and skipping

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.099 
simple somehow stepping and skipping
thus<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.070> name<00:00:56.329> put<00:00:57.329> your<00:00:57.510> right<00:00:57.690> hand<00:00:57.719> thumb

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
thus the name put your right hand thumb

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.200 
thus the name put your right hand thumb
on<00:00:58.260> middle<00:00:58.530> C<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.280> goes<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.059> do

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
on middle C and it goes like this you do

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.140 
on middle C and it goes like this you do
the<00:01:00.359> stepping<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:03.019> stepping<00:01:04.019> back<00:01:04.500> down<00:01:05.150> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the stepping up stepping back down and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.929 
the stepping up stepping back down and
then<00:01:06.420> skip<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> note<00:01:07.080> skip<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> note<00:01:08.100> skipping

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
then skip a note skip a note skipping

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.390 
then skip a note skip a note skipping
over<00:01:09.030> back<00:01:09.720> down<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> pattern

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
over back down and that is the pattern

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.219 
over back down and that is the pattern
now<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> go<00:01:12.540> ahead<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.900> put<00:01:13.049> that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
now I'm going to go ahead and put that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.859 
now I'm going to go ahead and put that
pattern<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.799> simple<00:01:14.250> pattern<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.270> 120

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
pattern that simple pattern up to 120

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.990 
pattern that simple pattern up to 120
with<00:01:16.380> both<00:01:16.650> hands<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.369> I'm<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> move<00:01:17.820> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
with both hands and I'm going to move it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.760 
with both hands and I'm going to move it
up<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.330> put<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.020> reverse<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.320> move<00:01:19.530> it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
up and put it in reverse and move it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.990 
up and put it in reverse and move it
back<00:01:19.890> down<00:01:19.920> that's<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.759> these

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
back down that's what all these

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.749 
back down that's what all these
exercises<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.799> fingers<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.670> your

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
exercises do and your fingers and your

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.340 
exercises do and your fingers and your
hands<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.299> brain<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.509> learning<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> lot

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
hands and your brain are learning a lot

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.289 
hands and your brain are learning a lot
so<00:01:25.680> let's<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.189> do<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> I'll<00:01:26.670> show<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.150> you

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
so let's just do it I'll show it to you

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.090 
so let's just do it I'll show it to you
and<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.049> work<00:01:28.200> your<00:01:28.259> way<00:01:28.409> up<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.710> 120

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and then you can work your way up to 120

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.670 
and then you can work your way up to 120
those<00:01:29.880> certainly<00:01:30.329> shouldn't<00:01:30.689> start<00:01:31.020> at<00:01:31.140> 120

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
those certainly shouldn't start at 120

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.039 
those certainly shouldn't start at 120
it<00:01:31.799> should<00:01:31.950> take<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.520> 2<00:01:33.090> 1<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.630> 2<00:01:33.780> weeks

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
it should take you about 2 1 or 2 weeks

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.200 
it should take you about 2 1 or 2 weeks
to<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.350> all<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> way<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.979> 120<00:01:35.159> starting<00:01:36.119> at

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
to get all the way up to 120 starting at

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.870 
to get all the way up to 120 starting at
about<00:01:36.299> 72<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:37.020> 80<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.430> at<00:01:38.700> 120

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
about 72 or 80 but here it is at 120

00:01:38.880 --> 00:02:36.300 
about 72 or 80 but here it is at 120
followed<00:01:39.659> by<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.110> other<00:01:40.350> stuff

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.800 

now<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.370> put<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:37.910> reverse<00:02:38.120> start<00:02:38.630> on<00:02:38.720> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
now you put it in reverse start on the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:03:08.260 
now you put it in reverse start on the
top<00:02:38.990> note

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.690 

Oh
