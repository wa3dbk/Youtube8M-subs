00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.860

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:59.149

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.149
 pigments and controls them on the packs 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.439
 it is enough 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.580
 i can now put away these pigments 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.340
 I'm in again 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:24.220

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:27.340

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:33.900

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.940
 by shaking or thereby the 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.130
 brush and if the nail polish too 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.940
 viscous is next to the easy 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.700
 bit of nail polish remover and does one 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.500
 few pots in here then it is very 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.780
 nice here 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.870

 You can also choose how intense 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.950
 the color is so you get when you the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.310
 want to have color very intense then 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.870

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.580
 eyeshadows Rhine energy but a bit 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.940
 Wanted to have water like me here 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.890

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.040

 I do not have the color too intense 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.840

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.800
 glittering pigments that give them the paten 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.750

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.370
