experience<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.310> alder<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:13.190> it's<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.550> most

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
experience of alder and it's the most

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
for that happens and that's why he's

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:25.720 
for that happens and that's why he's
going<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.890> win<00:02:23.110> for<00:02:24.110> me<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.459> best

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
going to win for me this is the best

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.680 
going to win for me this is the best
driving<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.420> other<00:02:26.660> three<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:29.150> no<00:02:29.330> Phil's

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
driving to other three so no Phil's

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.830 
driving to other three so no Phil's
performance<00:02:30.230> now

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
performance now

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.479 
performance now
if<00:02:32.319> I'm<00:02:32.470> honest<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:32.890> drove<00:02:33.099> it<00:02:33.160> down<00:02:33.250> from

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
if I'm honest I drove it down from

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.670 
if I'm honest I drove it down from
London<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.510> was<00:02:34.599> a<00:02:34.629> complete<00:02:35.200> pain<00:02:35.440> in<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
London and it was a complete pain in the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.199 
London and it was a complete pain in the
ass<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.830> come<00:02:36.129> down<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:36.640> mean<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.879> was<00:02:36.940> noisy

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
ass to come down and I mean it was noisy

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.170 
ass to come down and I mean it was noisy
the<00:02:38.019> gearing<00:02:38.290> ratios<00:02:38.830> are<00:02:38.950> too<00:02:39.099> sure<00:02:39.459> had<00:02:40.090> to

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
the gearing ratios are too sure had to

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.430 
the gearing ratios are too sure had to
stop<00:02:40.390> every<00:02:40.629> five<00:02:40.810> minutes<00:02:40.989> from<00:02:41.110> you

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
stop every five minutes from you

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.930 
stop every five minutes from you
but<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.130> when<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.310> get<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.550> rotate

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
but it's just when you get to rotate

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.700 
but it's just when you get to rotate
this<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.540> all<00:02:44.690> comes<00:02:44.840> together<00:02:45.080> just<00:02:45.530> all

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
this that it all comes together just all

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.650 
this that it all comes together just all
make<00:02:45.980> sense<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:46.850> can't<00:02:47.120> be<00:02:47.240> four<00:02:47.510> wheel

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
make sense and you can't be four wheel

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.350 
make sense and you can't be four wheel
drive<00:02:48.250> there's<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.340> reason<00:02:49.550> why<00:02:49.850> rally<00:02:50.090> cars

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
drive there's a reason why rally cars

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.670 
drive there's a reason why rally cars
are<00:02:50.510> four<00:02:50.750> wheel<00:02:50.900> drive<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.380> can<00:02:51.500> really

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
are four wheel drive and you can really

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.830 
are four wheel drive and you can really
feel<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:51.980> on<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.190> road<00:02:52.370> exactly<00:02:58.840> first

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
feel it on the road exactly first

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.550 
feel it on the road exactly first
