that<00:01:24.460> was<00:01:24.640> kind<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.030> strange<00:01:25.360> so<00:01:25.840> what<00:01:26.380> we<00:01:26.470> have

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
that was kind of strange so what we have

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.410 
that was kind of strange so what we have
to<00:01:26.650> do<00:01:26.800> is<00:01:26.920> due<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.130> drug<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.370> RC<00:01:27.820> bonded<00:01:28.270> over

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
to do is due to drug the RC bonded over

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.120 
to do is due to drug the RC bonded over
to<00:01:28.720> each<00:01:28.870> tank<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:30.840> explode<00:01:31.840> each<00:01:32.140> tank<00:01:32.560> with

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
to each tank and explode each tank with

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.490 
to each tank and explode each tank with
the<00:01:33.340> bandits<00:01:33.760> and<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:34.540> is<00:01:34.690> very<00:01:34.960> much<00:01:35.200> like

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
the bandits and this is very much like

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.500 
the bandits and this is very much like
the<00:01:35.800> mission<00:01:36.340> for<00:01:36.580> dice

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
the mission for dice

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.150 
the mission for dice
I<00:01:37.540> think<00:01:37.810> it's<00:01:37.930> called<00:01:38.110> Twyman<00:01:38.650> a<00:01:38.740> derp<00:01:38.800> yeah

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
I think it's called Twyman a derp yeah

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.680 
I think it's called Twyman a derp yeah
toy<00:01:39.729> mater<00:01:39.970> from<00:01:40.180> gta3<00:01:40.800> so<00:01:42.540> they've<00:01:43.540> never

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
toy mater from gta3 so they've never

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.420 
toy mater from gta3 so they've never
been<00:01:43.930> shy<00:01:44.140> about<00:01:44.290> repeating<00:01:44.890> mission<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:45.400> I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
been shy about repeating mission so I

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.830 
been shy about repeating mission so I
don't<00:01:45.610> think<00:01:45.760> that<00:01:45.880> was<00:01:46.240> why<00:01:46.390> they<00:01:46.540> took<00:01:46.660> this

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
don't think that was why they took this

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.870 
don't think that was why they took this
out<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.200> final<00:01:47.560> game<00:01:47.740> um<00:01:48.160> there<00:01:48.700> was

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
out of the final game um there was

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.760 
out of the final game um there was
supposed<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.300> be<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.509> proper<00:01:49.960> cutscene<00:01:50.470> there

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
supposed to be a proper cutscene there

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.160 
supposed to be a proper cutscene there
or<00:01:51.130> at<00:01:51.190> least<00:01:51.310> cutscene<00:01:52.060> audio<00:01:52.479> but<00:01:52.810> it's<00:01:53.020> not

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
or at least cutscene audio but it's not

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.600

in<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.440> mod<00:01:53.680> for<00:01:53.920> some<00:01:54.040> reason<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.430> don't<00:01:54.490> know

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.450 
there we go got him good so yeah so
you're<00:02:04.869> like<00:02:05.020> seven<00:02:05.410> bandits<00:02:05.800> in<00:02:05.920> there<00:02:06.070> five

you're like seven bandits in there five

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.900 
you're like seven bandits in there five
times<00:02:06.880> over<00:02:07.360> we<00:02:07.990> can<00:02:08.140> afford<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.700> cock<00:02:09.700> up

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.600 
times over we can afford to cock up
twice<00:02:10.270> I<00:02:10.570> guess<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.080> there<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.560> go<00:02:11.770> but<00:02:12.460> I'm

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.810 
that there was like a battery for each
one<00:04:17.230> instead<00:04:17.530> of<00:04:17.680> like<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:17.830> battery<00:04:18.220> constantly

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
one instead of like a battery constantly

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.250 
one instead of like a battery constantly
going<00:04:18.970> down<00:04:19.270> I<00:04:19.299> don't<00:04:19.570> know<00:04:19.690> what<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:19.989> means

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
going down I don't know what that means

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.350 
going down I don't know what that means
but<00:04:20.650> yeah<00:04:21.690> there<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:22.810> go<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.050> guess<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:25.060> I'm

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
but yeah there you go I guess so I'm

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.210 
but yeah there you go I guess so I'm
just<00:04:25.540> trying<00:04:25.690> like<00:04:25.930> hypothesize<00:04:26.770> as<00:04:26.980> to<00:04:27.100> why

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
just trying like hypothesize as to why

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.220 
just trying like hypothesize as to why
they<00:04:27.460> weren't<00:04:27.610> taking<00:04:28.090> this<00:04:28.270> out<00:04:28.570> of<00:04:28.930> the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
they weren't taking this out of the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.380 
they weren't taking this out of the
final<00:04:29.620> game<00:04:29.860> but<00:04:30.130> really<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:30.970> think<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.300> was

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
final game but really I think it was

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.700 
final game but really I think it was
just<00:04:31.540> again<00:04:31.840> just<00:04:32.200> you<00:04:32.320> know<00:04:32.410> space

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
just again just you know space

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.920 
just again just you know space
constraints<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.670> probably<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.720> still

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
constraints and probably you still

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.450 
constraints and probably you still
didn't<00:04:35.110> want<00:04:35.200> to<00:04:35.350> make<00:04:35.560> serious<00:04:35.830> missions<00:04:36.340> any

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
didn't want to make serious missions any

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.680 
didn't want to make serious missions any
longer<00:04:36.880> because<00:04:36.970> they<00:04:37.180> could<00:04:37.330> imagine<00:04:37.510> that

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
longer because they could imagine that

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.840 
longer because they could imagine that
people<00:04:38.380> were<00:04:38.530> probably<00:04:38.830> fed<00:04:39.190> up<00:04:39.340> with<00:04:39.460> them<00:04:39.640> by

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
people were probably fed up with them by

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.390 
people were probably fed up with them by
fed<00:04:40.750> up<00:04:40.930> with<00:04:41.140> them<00:04:41.440> by<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.710> time<00:04:42.010> that<00:04:42.280> they

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
fed up with them by the time that they

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.430 
fed up with them by the time that they
had<00:04:42.610> completed<00:04:43.600> them<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:45.010> yeah<00:04:45.490> I'm<00:04:45.730> not<00:04:45.790> gonna

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
had completed them so yeah I'm not gonna

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.420 
had completed them so yeah I'm not gonna
complete<00:04:47.440> this<00:04:47.650> so<00:04:47.800> I'm<00:04:47.920> just<00:04:48.040> gonna<00:04:48.160> like

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
complete this so I'm just gonna like

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.050 
complete this so I'm just gonna like
give<00:04:48.640> up<00:04:48.790> now<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:50.070> like<00:04:51.070> yeah<00:04:51.280> I'll<00:04:51.700> just<00:04:51.850> blow

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
give up now and like yeah I'll just blow

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.550 
give up now and like yeah I'll just blow
up<00:04:52.090> all<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.420> bandits<00:04:52.810> now<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.170> I'll<00:04:53.350> call

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
up all the bandits now and I'll call

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.610 
up all the bandits now and I'll call
ahead<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.800> power<00:04:54.130> walls<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.900> now<00:04:56.080> I'm<00:04:56.230> doing<00:04:56.440> a

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
ahead to power walls so now I'm doing a

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.320 
ahead to power walls so now I'm doing a
lot<00:04:56.830> better<00:04:57.040> as<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:57.430> can<00:04:57.610> see<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.090> I've<00:04:58.180> got

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
lot better as you can see so I've got

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.090 
lot better as you can see so I've got
over<00:04:58.570> half<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.930> battery<00:04:59.260> left<00:04:59.500> with<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.920> two

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
over half the battery left with the two

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.910 
over half the battery left with the two
tigers<00:05:00.640> left<00:05:01.000> so<00:05:01.360> yeah<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.080> guess<00:05:02.260> just<00:05:02.410> depends

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
tigers left so yeah I guess just depends

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.530 
tigers left so yeah I guess just depends
on<00:05:03.010> which<00:05:03.190> way<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.460> go<00:05:03.850> with<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.210> beginning

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
on which way you go with the beginning

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.850 
on which way you go with the beginning
and<00:05:04.780> I<00:05:04.840> went<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.110> different<00:05:05.230> way<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.800> time

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
and I went a different way this time

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.830 
and I went a different way this time
like<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:06.640> I<00:05:06.700> got<00:05:06.850> different<00:05:07.270> tanks<00:05:07.660> and

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
like and I got different tanks and

actually it's not as hard as the other
two<00:05:35.470> or<00:05:36.010> maybe<00:05:36.160> they<00:05:36.520> could<00:05:36.670> have<00:05:36.790> like<00:05:36.970> taken

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570
