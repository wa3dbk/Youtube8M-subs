parked off the chicken in the expedited
way<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.670> start<00:00:18.090> by<00:00:18.270> removing<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.990> wings<00:00:19.230> of

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
way so we start by removing the wings of

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.260 
way so we start by removing the wings of
bird<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.310> easiest<00:00:20.670> way<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> do<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.210> is

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
bird and the easiest way to do that is

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.750 
bird and the easiest way to do that is
simply<00:00:21.689> lift<00:00:22.020> bird<00:00:22.320> by<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.590> wing<00:00:22.830> cut<00:00:23.550> from

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
simply lift bird by the wing cut from

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.880 
simply lift bird by the wing cut from
the<00:00:23.850> back<00:00:24.029> towards<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> front<00:00:24.810> through<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the back towards the front through the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.370 
the back towards the front through the
joint<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.400> come<00:00:26.550> right<00:00:26.730> off<00:00:26.990> extra<00:00:27.990> legs<00:00:28.199> and

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
joint and come right off extra legs and

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.290 
joint and come right off extra legs and
thighs<00:00:28.439> start<00:00:29.130> by<00:00:29.279> pulling<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> leg<00:00:29.849> out<00:00:30.000> like

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
thighs start by pulling the leg out like

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.999 
thighs start by pulling the leg out like
they<00:00:30.449> did<00:00:30.480> here<00:00:30.660> you're<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.830> cut<00:00:31.980> along

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
they did here you're going to cut along

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.389 
they did here you're going to cut along
the<00:00:32.219> back<00:00:32.520> along<00:00:32.969> roughly<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.750> line<00:00:34.399> you'll

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
the back along roughly that line you'll

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
the back along roughly that line you'll
see<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.940> there's<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.329> bone<00:00:36.510> which<00:00:36.870> easily

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
see here there's the bone which easily

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.490 
see here there's the bone which easily
pops<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.040> its<00:00:38.160> socket<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:40.170> easiest

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
pops out of its socket and the easiest

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200 
pops out of its socket and the easiest
way<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.739> cut<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.219> from<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> back<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:41.969> front

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
way to cut is from the back to the front

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.049 
way to cut is from the back to the front
following<00:00:42.840> contour<00:00:43.530> occurred<00:00:43.950> sometime<00:00:44.789> you

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
following contour occurred sometime you

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.549 
following contour occurred sometime you
got<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> go<00:00:45.329> back<00:00:45.450> around<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.170> did<00:00:46.350> there

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
got to go back around like I did there

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.590 
got to go back around like I did there
but<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.860> comes<00:00:47.039> right<00:00:47.250> off<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.059> again<00:00:48.300> from<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
but it comes right off so again from the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.260 
but it comes right off so again from the
front<00:00:48.899> pop<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.590> open<00:00:49.770> you'll<00:00:50.640> feel<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> bone

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
front pop it open you'll feel the bone

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.389 
front pop it open you'll feel the bone
pop<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.780> joint<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.410> then<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:53.160> cut<00:00:53.370> right

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
pop out of joint and then just cut right

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.459 
pop out of joint and then just cut right
along<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.910> contour<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.329> bird<00:00:54.690> keeping<00:00:55.379> as

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the very edge of the wishbone down to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.999 
the very edge of the wishbone down to
the<00:01:19.380> top<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.759> birds<00:01:21.210> sternum<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> throw

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the top of the birds sternum so I throw

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.590 
the top of the birds sternum so I throw
the<00:01:23.130> knife<00:01:23.280> along<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> wishbone<00:01:24.060> there<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the knife along the wishbone there and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
the knife along the wishbone there and
then<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.320> simply<00:01:25.560> follow<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> sternum

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
then you just simply follow the sternum

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.420 
then you just simply follow the sternum
line<00:01:26.670> along<00:01:27.000> one<00:01:27.720> graceful<00:01:27.990> cut<00:01:28.500> takes<00:01:29.220> off

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
line along one graceful cut takes off

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.149 
line along one graceful cut takes off
the<00:01:29.670> breast<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.110> again<00:01:32.040> you're

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the breast you have it again you're

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.830 
the breast you have it again you're
going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> make<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> cut<00:01:32.820> where<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.329> breast

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
going to make a cut where the breast

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.140 
going to make a cut where the breast
meets<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.439> body<00:01:34.650> down<00:01:35.369> where<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> thigh<00:01:35.909> was

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
meets the body down where the thigh was

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.090 
meets the body down where the thigh was
so<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.259> what<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.590> did<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> other

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
so this is what we just did on the other

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.270 
so this is what we just did on the other
side<00:01:38.400> we're<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.329> peel<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> breast<00:01:40.110> back

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
side we're going to peel the breast back

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.950 
side we're going to peel the breast back
that<00:01:41.640> cuff<00:01:41.909> will<00:01:42.119> simply<00:01:42.450> make<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.690> easy<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that cuff will simply make it easy to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.210 
that cuff will simply make it easy to
work<00:01:43.080> your<00:01:43.229> fingers<00:01:43.409> along<00:01:43.680> we're<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> only

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
work your fingers along we're the only

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.010 
work your fingers along we're the only
contender<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.909> there<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.750> you're<00:01:45.810> going<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020
