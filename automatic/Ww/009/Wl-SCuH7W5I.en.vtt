00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
so what's it like to drive well compared

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.670 
so what's it like to drive well compared
to<00:03:50.910> many<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.450> sloped<00:03:51.720> nosed<00:03:51.989> Aero<00:03:52.350> truck

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
to many of the sloped nosed Aero truck

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.470 
to many of the sloped nosed Aero truck
so<00:03:52.830> I've<00:03:52.920> driven<00:03:53.160> lately<00:03:53.610> it's<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:54.060> bit<00:03:54.209> like<00:03:54.360> an

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
so I've driven lately it's a bit like an

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.720 
so I've driven lately it's a bit like an
ocean<00:03:54.810> liner<00:03:55.130> which<00:03:56.130> are<00:03:56.310> nice<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.580> get<00:03:56.670> back

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
ocean liner which are nice to get back

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.900 
ocean liner which are nice to get back
out<00:03:57.060> here<00:03:57.239> behind<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.660> hood<00:03:57.870> but

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
out here behind a hood but

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.090 
out here behind a hood but
I'm<00:03:59.210> telling<00:03:59.540> ya<00:03:59.630> it's<00:03:59.750> been<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.930> while<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.470> I

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
I'm telling ya it's been a while and I

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.430 
I'm telling ya it's been a while and I
hey<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:02.210> have<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.570> admit<00:04:02.870> I've<00:04:03.050> gotten<00:04:03.320> pretty

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
hey I have to admit I've gotten pretty

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.390 
hey I have to admit I've gotten pretty
much<00:04:03.710> used<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.010> those<00:04:04.160> little

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
much used to those little

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.380 
much used to those little
short-wheelbase<00:04:06.490> turn<00:04:07.490> down<00:04:07.730> hoods<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.180> see

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
short-wheelbase turn down hoods you see

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.320 
short-wheelbase turn down hoods you see
now<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.810> more<00:04:09.470> aerodynamic<00:04:10.190> models<00:04:10.520> this

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
now on the more aerodynamic models this

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.830 
now on the more aerodynamic models this
big<00:04:11.570> ol<00:04:11.690> hood<00:04:11.900> gets<00:04:12.140> in<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.350> way<00:04:12.470> sometimes

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
big ol hood gets in the way sometimes

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.180 
big ol hood gets in the way sometimes
obviously<00:04:14.840> with<00:04:14.990> the<00:04:15.110> big<00:04:15.290> push<00:04:15.530> towards<00:04:15.740> more

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
obviously with the big push towards more

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.400 
obviously with the big push towards more
aerodynamic<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:17.239> therefore<00:04:17.600> fuel-efficient

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
aerodynamic and therefore fuel-efficient

limited it will eventually go away but
judging<00:04:23.900> by<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.170> demand<00:04:24.590> for<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:24.920> truck<00:04:25.220> and
