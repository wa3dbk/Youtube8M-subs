00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:14.580
 well that's it everyone knows where 35 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.490
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.860
 new video a video park opening 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 riga the pack to 100000 credit we get 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.490
 remember last year where I had 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.490
 nab Lewandowski therefore there was no 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.090
 easter opening 7.7 this week for the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.680
 bundesliga 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.570
 just because I had done a 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.850
 dual pack opening with the crime mine 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.660
 but unfortunately it works 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.880
 and I do not know what happened 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.050
 that my video file he at hilla he has 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.309
 been corrupt finally I do not know what 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.020
 happened in any case you did not 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.610
 could not see the two hundred thousand credit 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.620
 that I opened for the bundesliga tax 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.700
 you did not miss a thing 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.950
 guys from just because I had 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.930
 I just had a little boost aaron 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.340
 hunt that I sold eleven thousand credit 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.260
 so much to say that you have nothing 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.910
 miss the reaction and finally it was 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.620
 a boost 1 it was already great but the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.050
 reaction was not great so the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.969
 we are going to get the pack at 100k 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.370
 who is in the shop this is the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.650
 bundesliga lewandowski it is there the year 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.090
 last I had it 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.620
 you saw that I gave ex near the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.540
 same logo the logo of notts county 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.670
 it was exactly the same so we're going 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.360
 pick pack guys 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.620
 do not go we'll get 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.060
 in the shop I will do like 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.460
 last year I'm going to close my eyes 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.070
 I'm not going to look I'm not going 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.630
 to watch gepi the 320 I arranged 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.460
 to have it 300 miles so that's it 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.900
 100 million - I will not look I have 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.080
 sold a lot of players to get to 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.420
 his cows op all these credits 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.110
 so here it is there the pack the guys on 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.580
 will go get it 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.320
 last year we had a player 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.700
 it was joe hart so I 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.560
 remember that we had done 5 times the trick 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.060
 to see it we see there bim we go 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.930
 it's really anything so I 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.130
 not going to look at the guys I want 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.740
 open the hundred thousand christian pack 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.360
 we go there oh there I do not believe that I 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.920
 will once again spend 100 miles 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.200
 I'm not looking I'm watching 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.160
 I do not look at it I'm not waiting 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.619
 that I expect it to be done 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.750
 I listen I listen to the sound of my TV 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.550
 these are the credits that have been that have 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.170
 have been removed from my account 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.250
 I have the impression that it turns in 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.459
 lhasa now turn I'm not watching 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.480
 I do not look, I do not want to see that 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.730
 there is left the lions can 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.320
 see again I hope we did not get 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.480
 of the sea does not resist a vase already so 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.590
 it's pretty good to recover 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.450
 some credits even though often not 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.700
 very expensive boosket tonight we have a boost 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.070
 boost chile guys boost o'shea 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.640
 it may not be over it looks 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.959
 to be finished 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.450
 oh well it does not matter people who have not 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.250
 boosts his whores cavani sympathy pack 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.040
 so frankly it's a pack 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.159
 rather nice 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.230
 o'shea boost I would have preferred to have 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.819
 have a legend or have a top but 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.560
 this is frankly good guys we're not going 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.379
 recover 100 1000 credits but that's 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.689
 not there is worse honestly guys yes 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.459
 it's good a little boost here's a hundred 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.799
 a thousand good credit it's not it's not no 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.090
 more exceptional but now we had no 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.769
 bad duplicates interesting that we're going 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.019
 able to sell 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.400
 cavani that I managed to catch so 87 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.379
 even if they do not go very expensive it is 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.989
 it's a shame in 2 terabits 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.579
 martinez vxl saw that selanne want that 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.959
 it's the bundesliga 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.120
 me it's going honestly guys it's okay 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.269
 I saw I saw some of the worst packs 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.280
 that's so yeah yeah that's okay I'm 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.799
 happy we had a taste serna born 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.840
 in milan version I do not know if this is 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.099
 sells a lot john o'shea in the end what 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.239
 so that's a shame that the cut 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.519
 saint patrick is past because he 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.409
 could have been worth a little a little 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.180
 money packet 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.669
 so that's pretty fun 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.139
 so rui patricio guy so that's selling 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.879
 not this cartel either philippe and 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.590
 louise maybe girl since maybe 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.230
 leave since he is at the boosket atletico 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.690
 it's not selling at all, so it's 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.919
 what is clear is the garbage you 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.479
 maybe not to sell a little bit and 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.970
 you too a rebel adler as it is there 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:42.260

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.220
 we're going to throw everything away 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.690
