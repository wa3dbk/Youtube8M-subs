00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.769
 I am the second blood plus a video 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.230
 from buback for the channel and galley on video 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.269
 today to show you the attacks 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.550
 that the branch did not do against my life and 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.180
 folks it was very difficult 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.100
 it was very difficult to decide whether to defend 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.680
 there because he had many pesos 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.599
 heavy and attacked with many lucas then 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.400
 Let's go with the fee to see what 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.099
 happened on my medal I had to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 change the layout three times and let's go 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.350
 see whether or not it works 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.170
 It worked 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.059
 So let's go guys, let's follow the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.239
 first tac in the layout that I always 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.860
 I use neither my normal milk nor these 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.210
 can see the amount of heavyweights 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.460
 is already arriving here as the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 doctors also the heavyweights trade 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.840
 take method of generators and there are many 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.149
 troops have many troops and keep them in pain 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.010
 I will not be able to do anything because of 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.600
 Truth was, there really are a lot of troops. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.620
 And now more troops are arriving. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.420
 how can you see there? 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.030
 on the other landing craft and now 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
 my goal defense and the shock burst 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 trying to do something else is 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.030
 come more heavyweights so will stay 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.340
 quite complicated edit and defend 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.770
 because in many troops arriving then 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.900
 prices to destroy the defenses 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.520
 are the first cannon type and the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.670
 machine gun also take your defenses 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.560
 are advancing on my base and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.970
 more heavy and 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.430
 some lucas started arriving too 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.110
 so let's see what we are going to follow 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.450
 What is going to happen for now? 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.329
 more landing craft arriving more 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.979
 the gang loses the exchange until 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.689
 catching a little bit my screen 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.100
 It is predicted that there is so much that I was 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.740
 happening that is locking here a 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.630
 Little the game but there's a lot 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.460
 happening then we'll see japan in 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.079
 half of my base also a bottom so 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.759
 absolutely destroyed everything and not 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.740
 it seems that this time there will not be any 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.740
 chance for my base to defend these 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.600
 troops and looks look at the amount of jucÃ¡s 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.820
 who are now coming there to try 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.979
 destroy my base in many 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.680
 will have chance in my base to defend 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.200
 10 of these heavyweights and mad 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.439
 so let's follow the lawsuit in 40 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.119
 the 2nd even then these imagines the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.730
 What happened when my life was? 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.830
 completely destroyed by all 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.360
 the troops are coming here too 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.640
 her that the last buildings of the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.400
 last defenses these dogs trying 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.010
 do something but it's difficult 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.120
 were coming here in the last part 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.360
 from my village a rocket launcher 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.220
 is trying to do one thing but looks at 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.080
 amount of troops looking 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.260
 amount of troops you have will be 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.210
 very difficult to defend because yo 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.710
 neither are we trying to get out more 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.660
 now it 's getting close to the 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.100
 headquarters and all lucas of weight 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.770
 Heavy volleyball future headquarters in 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.860
 321 cable destroyed a headquarters 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.330
 lost is the first first the first 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.580
 branch attack could not defend 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.620
 So let's see what happened. 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.260
 in the second attack of the sister branch 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.790
 good guys the second renan attack is 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.620
 which will be practically the same 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.110
 strategy display that I changed a little 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.630
 layout I put the constructions here 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.790
 more closer to the prep try 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.410
 disrupt the troops but it will 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.660
 that this worked will be that 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.100
 worked so let's follow the 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.050
 heavyweights are coming and together with 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.050
 doctor there to heal the heavyweights 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.180
 now more heavyweights as it is so 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.070
 arriving there on my base to destroy 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.590
 totally my base so let's go 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.390
 to take up here a defense that is 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.030
 helping to destroy some heavyweights 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.010
 but the guys have a lot of heavyweights 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.080
 then probably died will not 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.480
 able to destroy all these troops 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.360
 then have heavier weight coming here 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.820
 with some lucas too and there they are 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.459
 in question are arriving there is every time 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.170
 closer to the headquarters of our 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.330
 predicts that the game also has 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.040
 a lot of things going on there have a lot 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.120
 of troops arriving near the 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.890
 barrack general defense animal lance bobo 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.440
 of shock trying to do one more thing 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.750
 is not working guys because you have 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.760
 a lot as already said a lot of time 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.970
 In this video there is a lot of evidence and carioca. 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.709
 and now another chaos to do more damage 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.600
 in my base then guys 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.790
 This is very difficult to defend there. 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.160
 this attack probably would not 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.260
 only 30 seconds remaining 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.080
 replay and I probably will not be able to 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.060
 with you probably imagine that I did not 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.440
 I'm going to get the victory here, right? 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.000
 are getting closer and closer to 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.830
 that no defense is able to stop 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.110
 all troops not coming there not 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.620
 catch me from shock is succeeding 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.510
 to the people who are here and now 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.699
 travel from shocks and destroy 321 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.190
 ended up being destroyed and now I'm 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.320
 coming totally to destroy my 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.680
 headquarters in a matter of seconds 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.270
 in the galley in 1987 will end now let's go 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.990
 have a headquarters in a few 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.070
 seconds, just over now 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.320
 destroying the headquarters plus one 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.060
 Well then guys, it's really hard now. 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.210
 I only had one more chance to defend myself 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.310
 because you know that the pomegranate is you have 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.260
 three chances to defend against the 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.720
 So let's see what happened in the 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.300
 third good offense in the pass on the attack 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.699
 model layout again I put my friend 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.050
 instructions to the left is by the side 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.270
 left of the island and we'll see what 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.370
 Let's see what happened. 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.580
 the same strategy will arrive with the 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.800
 heavy weights and a doctor and more weight 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.580
 So heavy, people, let's see what 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.800
 It happened 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.690
 so it seems that we want benefits 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.490
 trying to extract some troops there but 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.050
 is not working the launch of 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.669
 shock bombs trying to do some 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.919
 thing and is not working either 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.740
 so let's follow here we have 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.229
 heavy songs even trying to destroy 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.690
 their defenses and defenses not taking 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.610
 destroy all the troops because 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.760
 people are getting there and now 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.700
 blue that are coming too and it seems 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.639
 that this seems like it will be 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.110
 difficult to defend from all troops 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.120
 they arrive 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.150
 Lucas looks amounts to coming here 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.530
 destroy all buildings are 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.880
 coming closer and closer to the 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.430
 headquarters for those who do not have 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.919
 defense that looks like the troops in my 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.930
 base then also getting closer and closer I 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.880
 put me up a little further 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.010
 to see if it helps a little closer 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.840
 but it seems that it is not 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.789
 advance because the troops do not 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.789
 stop the troops do not stop coming each 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:14.050
 closer and faster there has 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.880
 some traps in me is not 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.860
 helping a lot and many heavyweights 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.750
 they have many lucas and now they are almost 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.900
 arriving there in the last layer of the other 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.660
 a layer of defense coming out of my base 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.370
 and now they will reach us have a lot of exchange 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.419
 There's a lot of change even on the debut now. 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.440
 at headquarters 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:34.060
 no i did not destroy it 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.820
 this new headquarters then galera 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.890
 I could not defend myself from the branch then 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.180
 This time I could not handle everything better. 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.100
 times happens 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.480
 Let's see if I can get a layout 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.460
 even though the best for me to defend 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.940
 the next attacks then let me 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.200
 back to my base 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.060
 So people, I hope you have 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.580

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.720
 no videos because I have videos all 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.490
