00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.400 
but how can mirrors not be real if our
eyes<00:03:52.580> are<00:03:52.940> real<00:03:53.240> but<00:03:53.780> they<00:03:53.870> can't<00:03:54.080> be<00:03:54.230> real

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
eyes are real but they can't be real

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:02.500 
eyes are real but they can't be real
because<00:03:54.590> mirrors<00:03:55.010> aren't<00:03:55.220> real

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.540 

Oh
