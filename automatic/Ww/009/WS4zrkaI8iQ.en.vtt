have<00:00:59.809> dark<00:01:00.809> roots<00:01:01.219> obviously<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:02.940> easier

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
have dark roots obviously so it's easier

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.679 
have dark roots obviously so it's easier
to<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.930> them<00:01:04.400> like<00:01:05.400> say<00:01:05.640> my<00:01:05.850> hair<00:01:06.090> blows<00:01:06.450> in
