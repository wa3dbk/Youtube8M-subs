00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
so we're actually doing a little bit of

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.310 
so we're actually doing a little bit of
field<00:00:38.800> test<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:40.450> fishing<00:00:40.810> partner<00:00:40.990> and

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
field test my fishing partner and

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.170 
field test my fishing partner and
longtime<00:00:41.500> friend<00:00:41.740> Tommy<00:00:42.250> akin<00:00:42.640> grew<00:00:42.850> up<00:00:42.940> just

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
longtime friend Tommy akin grew up just

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.420 
longtime friend Tommy akin grew up just
a<00:00:43.270> few<00:00:43.450> miles<00:00:43.690> from<00:00:43.810> here<00:00:43.930> and<00:00:44.290> he<00:00:44.710> knows<00:00:45.010> how

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
a few miles from here and he knows how

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.670 
a few miles from here and he knows how
to<00:00:45.490> fish<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.790> West<00:00:46.150> Tennessee<00:00:46.390> lake<00:00:46.840> but<00:00:47.530> I<00:00:47.560> do

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
so there's a little competition to see

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.740 
so there's a little competition to see
who<00:00:50.200> gets<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.530> first<00:00:50.830> one<00:00:51.100> first<00:00:52.060> legal<00:00:52.390> fish
