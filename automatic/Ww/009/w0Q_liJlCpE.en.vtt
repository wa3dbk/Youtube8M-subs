00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:41.000
 It has an on and off switch here 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:45.979
 the first and here is the usb device for 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.530
 the charging station overloaded so that one 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.530
 the headset to the carton 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:59.360
 Of course it would be all cables 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:01.100
 he also needs it 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.439
 this is where the notebook is supposed to go 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:12.260
 one I can also zoom in already 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:16.280
 shown now I'll show you how to do that 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.340
 at the playstation 3 would install 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:28.250
 Then I now the camera tripod 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:29.810
 First you take the cable 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.290
 was delivered away 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:47.540
 the same size connects it with 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:51.920
 this charging station to back here if 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.200
 the first one in the back and before 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.970
 you that is hardly the charging cable that is 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.480
 be with us whenever you play 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.480
 So you want the charger and then 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.750
 if you take the cable what if 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.170
 When connected, it is also included 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:17.090
 it's her audio audio here 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:22.670
 sounded music so long did you turn on 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:26.260
 and you hear the sound of the playstation 3 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.260
 and TV over this would have 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:41.959
 so now to the charging cable 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:49.880
 that is also well known included 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:54.709
 It is the standard USB cable in front 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:59.900
 short and wide back end stuck here 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:08.330
 in the docking station and the other 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:13.190
 end to the headset and we have 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:17.060
 it's because of that comic that bit 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:20.450
 open and then plug in 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.760
 have to do this station and then 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.050
 It takes two to three hours to load it 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.210
 is full again when he brought 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.729
 Even the three hours until it's full again 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.520
 but i think so should a few 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.050
 hours is enough 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.930
 everything really depends on me long 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:44.419
 counted how long it works 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:48.530
 but it is already some time as it is 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:56.840

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.870

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.140

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.010

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:35.110

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.690
