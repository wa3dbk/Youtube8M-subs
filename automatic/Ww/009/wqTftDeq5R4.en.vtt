the<00:01:37.300> reason<00:01:37.599> why<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.750> picked<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:38.050> monitor<00:01:38.470> is

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
the reason why I picked a monitor is

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.800 
the reason why I picked a monitor is
because<00:01:38.979> if<00:01:39.220> you're<00:01:39.700> really<00:01:39.910> gonna<00:01:40.149> invest<00:01:40.599> in

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
because if you're really gonna invest in

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.779 
because if you're really gonna invest in
competitive<00:01:41.349> gaming<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:42.220> need<00:01:42.399> to<00:01:42.490> go<00:01:42.640> with<00:01:42.729> a

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
competitive gaming you need to go with a

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.490 
competitive gaming you need to go with a
monitor<00:01:43.179> all<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.660> top<00:01:43.869> players<00:01:43.899> right<00:01:44.470> now

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
monitor all the top players right now

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.949 
monitor all the top players right now
have<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:44.890> monitor<00:01:45.250> except<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:45.729> think<00:01:46.090> Saints<00:01:46.840> I

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
have a monitor except I think Saints I

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.660 
have a monitor except I think Saints I
think<00:01:47.259> he<00:01:47.380> actually<00:01:47.410> still<00:01:47.950> plays<00:01:48.160> on<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.369> box

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
think he actually still plays on a box

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.180 
think he actually still plays on a box
TV<00:01:49.000> but<00:01:49.899> regardless<00:01:50.050> of<00:01:50.470> that<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.679> rest<00:01:51.009> of

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
TV but regardless of that the rest of

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.770 
TV but regardless of that the rest of
the<00:01:51.250> pros<00:01:51.520> have<00:01:51.789> monitors<00:01:52.270> that's<00:01:52.479> what<00:01:52.660> they

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
the pros have monitors that's what they

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.479 
the pros have monitors that's what they
plan<00:01:53.080> on<00:01:53.110> it's<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.470> really<00:01:53.679> good<00:01:53.770> quality<00:01:54.280> and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:54.489 
plan on it's a really good quality and

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.760 
plan on it's a really good quality and
has<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.910> very<00:01:55.239> good<00:01:55.390> response<00:01:55.690> rate<00:01:55.989> because

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
has a very good response rate because

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.740 
has a very good response rate because
well<00:01:57.310> obviously<00:01:57.849> you<00:01:58.209> need<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.420> see<00:01:58.569> what's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
well obviously you need to see what's

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.499 
well obviously you need to see what's
happening<00:01:59.170> faster<00:01:59.770> on<00:01:59.950> a<00:01:59.979> unlike<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.910> computer

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
happening faster on a unlike a computer

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.180 
happening faster on a unlike a computer
screen<00:02:01.630> because<00:02:01.989> like<00:02:02.170> for<00:02:02.349> example<00:02:02.440> uni<00:02:03.009> see

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
screen because like for example uni see

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.100 
screen because like for example uni see
where<00:02:03.369> your<00:02:03.489> mouse<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.970> every<00:02:04.330> single<00:02:04.660> time<00:02:04.840> so

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
where your mouse is every single time so

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.680 
where your mouse is every single time so
a<00:02:05.289> computer<00:02:05.979> screen<00:02:06.130> is<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.550> monitor<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.509> can

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
a computer screen is a monitor you can

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.359 
a computer screen is a monitor you can
actually<00:02:07.869> use<00:02:08.229> those<00:02:08.410> with<00:02:08.590> your<00:02:08.739> xbox<00:02:09.009> by

5<00:07:24.220> millisecond<00:07:25.000> response<00:07:25.150> times<00:07:25.810> so<00:07:26.320> you<00:07:26.350> can

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
5 millisecond response times so you can

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.260 
5 millisecond response times so you can

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:30.670 
lot faster a lot more accurate so you

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.220 
lot faster a lot more accurate so you
know<00:07:31.030> maybe<00:07:31.330> it'll<00:07:31.570> help<00:07:31.600> you<00:07:31.810> win<00:07:31.990> some<00:07:32.140> more
