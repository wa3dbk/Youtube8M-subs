GM now we're able to do that with a
universal<00:00:50.140> programmer<00:00:50.560> in<00:00:50.770> this<00:00:50.890> case<00:00:51.070> we're

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
universal programmer in this case we're

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.070 
universal programmer in this case we're
using<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.640> pass-through<00:00:52.600> Pro<00:00:53.140> now<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:53.950> is<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.220> J

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
using the pass-through Pro now it is a J

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.370 
using the pass-through Pro now it is a J
2534<00:00:56.080> and<00:00:56.980> you<00:00:57.460> can<00:00:57.580> get<00:00:57.730> a<00:00:57.760> J<00:00:58.060> 2534<00:00:58.720> there's<00:00:59.320> a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
2534 and you can get a J 2534 there's a

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.320 
2534 and you can get a J 2534 there's a
lot<00:00:59.620> of<00:00:59.770> companies<00:01:00.040> to<00:01:00.280> make<00:01:00.430> them<00:01:00.610> you<00:01:01.180> can

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
local tool truck will have one and then

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.679 
local tool truck will have one and then
you<00:01:06.189> look<00:01:06.400> at<00:01:06.460> your<00:01:06.520> computer<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:07.210> that

PCM<00:05:11.720> we're<00:05:11.810> going<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:11.990> try<00:05:12.139> that<00:05:12.169> me<00:05:13.180> now<00:05:14.180> let's

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
PCM we're going to try that me now let's

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.040 
PCM we're going to try that me now let's
get<00:05:14.419> a<00:05:14.479> little<00:05:14.630> program<00:05:15.970> so<00:05:16.970> now<00:05:17.150> it<00:05:17.599> says<00:05:17.840> free

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
get a little program so now it says free

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.020 
get a little program so now it says free
programming<00:05:18.500> complete
