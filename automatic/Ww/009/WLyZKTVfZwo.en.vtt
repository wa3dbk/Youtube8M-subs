00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello my name is vadim hares i 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.280
 dentist clinic oxford medical 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.660
 the clinic provide a wide range 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.929
 dental services 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.150
 one of which is such 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.510
 procedure as installing direct veneers 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.910
 There are two types of veneers. There are straight veneers. 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.279
 There is no direct veneers than they differ 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.210
 straight veneers from each other prepare 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.029
 directly in the chair at the dentist 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.940
 24 teeth can be made in 1 hour not straight 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.219
 Veneers are prepared in the laboratory and for 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.320
 it takes time and teeth grinding 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.200
 with indirect venus 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.210
 grind almost half straight teeth 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.640
 veneers do not dissect teeth 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.610
 respectively not damaged and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.219
 no pain came 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.949
 the patient sat in the chair for an hour 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.550
 two to four teeth can be made 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.230
 because 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.390
 this pair is enough to achieve 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.640
 aesthetic result to whom would I 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.800
 advised the technology of direct veneers 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.580
 First of all, people who want to keep 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.920
 your native tooth is intact because 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.909
 what is needed for this technology 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.380
 saw off 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.090
 tooth and damage and secondly it's like 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.930
 alternative to cermet 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.299
 crown third is an alternative for 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.159
 orthodontic treatment because 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.320
 long- term orthodontic treatment 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.080
 long and takes 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.510
 plenty of time and effort when 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.670
 staging direct veneers can be done 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.580
 almost the same straight veneers 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.620
 shown for major damage with 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.660
 old restorations ah which are already 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.520
 impossible to replace 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.800
 those that need to be changed on the crown 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.810
 but straight veneers can be like 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.869
 alternative crown long distance 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.970
 wedge teeth large defects which are not 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.259
 give in 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.910
 the usual restoration of my which will be 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.380
 visible straight veneers will help for 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.780
 uncover these defects 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.020
 straight veneers are not contraindicated 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.240
 serve for many years do not require replacement by 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.820
 other designs and additional 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.560
 care for them 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.120
 besides it is absolutely painless 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.860
 it's very important that I can 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.810
 show final 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.500
 result immediately before the start 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.500
 work 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.280
 I suppose it's just air open 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.710
 will play because saliva should not be 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.810
 so we can adjust 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.620
 color in shape when polished color 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.270
 becomes even brighter and richer to 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.940
 start the procedure we can 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.220
 correct with patient 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.870
 color and shape our clinic works without 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.850

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.420
