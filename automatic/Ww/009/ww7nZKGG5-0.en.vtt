00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
successive counter it is time you know

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.389 
successive counter it is time you know
twenty<00:01:49.869> three<00:01:50.110> don't<00:01:50.380> take<00:01:50.650> your<00:01:50.680> time<00:01:50.890> too

on the thigh again he gets step alright
one<00:02:48.970> more<00:02:49.030> time<00:02:49.329> you<00:02:49.510> hit<00:02:50.700> now<00:02:51.700> very<00:02:52.299> important

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
one more time you hit now very important

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.819 
one more time you hit now very important
factor<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:52.959> consider<00:02:53.049> when<00:02:53.350> doing<00:02:53.620> this

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
factor to consider when doing this

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.940 
factor to consider when doing this
counter<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:54.970> absolutely<00:02:55.450> must<00:02:55.989> step

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
counter is that I absolutely must step

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.280 
counter is that I absolutely must step
forward<00:02:57.459> with<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.150> attack<00:02:58.540> if<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.900> just<00:02:59.109> move

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
forward with the attack if I just move

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.860 
forward with the attack if I just move
laterally<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.220> he<00:03:00.400> hooks<00:03:00.670> alright<00:03:01.600> there's<00:03:01.810> a

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
laterally and he hooks alright there's a

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.930 
laterally and he hooks alright there's a
really<00:03:02.049> high<00:03:02.200> probability<00:03:02.859> am<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.609> going<00:03:03.850> to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
really high probability am I going to

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.240 
really high probability am I going to
miss<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.239> technique<00:03:04.720> or<00:03:05.350> i'm<00:03:05.709> just<00:03:05.739> going<00:03:06.190> to

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
miss it technique or i'm just going to

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.580 
miss it technique or i'm just going to
smash<00:03:06.730> my<00:03:07.000> foot<00:03:07.329> on<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:07.690> he's<00:03:07.810> playing<00:03:08.109> a<00:03:08.170> decaf

and some personal experience you can
really<00:03:11.320> get<00:03:12.130> injured<00:03:12.489> very<00:03:12.730> easily<00:03:12.970> doing

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
really get injured very easily doing

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.330 
really get injured very easily doing
that<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:13.900> always<00:03:14.170> make<00:03:14.320> sure<00:03:14.500> when<00:03:14.920> performing

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
that so always make sure when performing

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.069 
that so always make sure when performing
this<00:03:15.400> counter<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.359> you<00:03:16.510> really<00:03:16.780> step

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
this counter that you really step

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.930 
this counter that you really step
forwards<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.799> can<00:03:17.950> close<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.370> distance<00:03:18.549> and

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
forwards it can close the distance and

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.699 
forwards it can close the distance and
strike<00:03:19.720> with<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.930> upper<00:03:20.230> portion<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
strike with the upper portion of the

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:21.960 
strike with the upper portion of the
shin<00:03:20.980> it's<00:03:21.190> going<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.489> maximum<00:03:21.820> damage

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
shin it's going to do maximum damage

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.220
