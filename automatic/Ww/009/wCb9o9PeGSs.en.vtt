00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.450
 good today we are going to use the future usb is 

00:00:04.289 --> 00:00:09.360
 the test screen 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.030
 the initial menu to begin the first 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.030
 they have to turn on the equipment that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.910
 is connected to 12 volts you know one 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.560
 matter of the self ignite the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.370
 team 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.240
 then give 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.240
 start 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:33.880
 he has to indicate green and the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.430
 equipment that has to appear connected 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.820
 these are the functions of the team but 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.430
 to order butterfly motorized generator 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.100
 Pulse analysis lifts simulates 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.710
 sensors tests ignition modules and 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.739
 rifle test we start with the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.810
 first function a course tester 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.150
 this is the test menu where 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.230
 we will choose the brand in this case 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.230
 we will choose from peugeot 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.970
 will load all the systems 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.970
 possible 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.079
 we selected one of 206 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.480
 a motorcycle nica mp 7.2 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.840
 we double click 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.000
 is the test screen where the side 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.580
 left you are going to have all the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.290
 that returns the computer to us 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.270
 signs that we finally 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.390
 we generate in the panel on the right side 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.250
 for example contact revolutions 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.800
 Engine temperature 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.870
 air the vacuum of the auto probe 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.560
 lambda the percentage value of the 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.899
 butterfly the tps in this case 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.899
 we connect the computer 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.920
 7.2 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.100
 we already have the first armada for 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.399
 facilitate the test connect connector 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.399
 one 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.000
 Male and female can not be wrong 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.580
 we contact 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.510
 notice as being the main oak 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.480
 we have the 5 goal of the computer 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.210
 we have the Czech witnesses of masses 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.180
 depending on the case, the consumption that is 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.010
 having the computer indicates the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.640
 battery attention and when giving it 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.640
 revolutions 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.520
 see how the pump relay is activated 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.140
 we have on- time we have 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.030
 injection time 1000 seconds 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.220
 we can generate a test 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.950
 acceleration 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.840
 in this case type 4 that is progressive and 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.660
 descending at the same speed 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.910
 see how time is changing and 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.030
 address the ignition time and it 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.920
 are modifying the rpm parameters the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.860
 empty of the car and the tps all at the same 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.340
 time simulating a normal acceleration 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.340
 of the car
