00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 The episode of Bath Sweat Name is 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.310
 doing something that I do not do already 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.569
 time a vlog on the outside outside the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.849
 office I'm here to show you 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.440
 You 're the one behind the car that finally 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.000
 the company has a few months I speak 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.530
 on twitter on my fan site page is 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.440
 I really wanted to buy a stranger. 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.660
 and I finally bought this fucking thing 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.270
 absurd desire to have this car started 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.949
 to dj but started in 2007 when 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.840
 I watched the Transformers movie that a 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.640
 of the characters one of the o'barry cars 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.779
 that the police car in a mustang 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.320
 sally mustang 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.149
 I think in 2007 even 2007 and since 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.739
 So I got mixed up with this damn thing. 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.090
 of this car and I finally meet and 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.040
 Today is a day off to do this. 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.649
 video because we are in the beginning that the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.510
 doctor and how can you see the leaves 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 South personal drought is very well 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.129
 finalized with this phenomenon of 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.020
 seasons is the leaves turn yellow and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.700
 The staff of my northeast is not the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.899
 kind of thing that they come every day but 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.030
 finally going back to the car and showing 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.440
 that quickly some car tapes 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.180
 Why are you asking me since you own me? 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.129
 the first picture was a movie in a hurry 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.870
 or view that one of the characteristics 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.609
 cool this car is as you can see in 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.320
 door and 30 brito in keeping the car 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:12.119
 I always dreamed of working with 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.260
 car suddenly from here that happens here 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.659
 with you 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.570
 when you open the door will he 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.670
 does not have that metallic frizz around 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.990
 the window as you can see there is not only 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 Glass here right? 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.830
 happens to create the perfect seal 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.159
 so let's say when you close the door 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.840
 interesting you close and there he just 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.680
 She lived alone but there again I was shaking 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.320
 that a little until then do not knock on the door 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.340
 it rises up alone to create the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.500
 seal to protect against rain snow the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.840
 things that asked me to open the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.850
 hood of the car to show the engine these 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.070
 I do not fucking handle things. 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.009
 old car but absolutely nothing but 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.380
 with people wanted this shit that shows 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.909
 you suddenly you tell me more 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.450
 on the car than I could even 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.450
 to know only seeing the business here the key 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.670
 the request made this with the pet boot 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.270
 camera lost this fucking before 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.470
 start shooting around there 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:22.320
 ok so far is 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.250
 this is the v6 engine I heard it all 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.580
 What do I have to talk about the car? 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.020
 why not sports horse mange 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.210
 stop not imagining old on a journey 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.260
 of meat without anything year I do not know that 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.390
 I do not know what he likes there. 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.950
 red you so I know you have a 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.270
 drawing still to understand 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.980
 I do not know that I'm here I know you have to 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.940
 coin do not catch I do not understand why 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.080
 not by car with staff simply 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.790
 by appearance 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.650
 this part is complicated to shoot because 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.060
 Do not you want to show the car plate I know? 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.530
 that no one makes much difference is not 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.540
 much car plate information that you 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.190
 Show everyone publicly if you are in the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.170
 the street but rather by the will not 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.530
 hide the crazy ones that watch my 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.810
 channel 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.990
 so I broke the car trunk 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.940
 around having a king direction 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.640
 this is the poet mado show much 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.590
 increased much more comfortable than is the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.160
 I imagined that the camera tripod that 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.420
 end up needing a sports car 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.989
 I found the suitcase to be very spacious 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:24.540
 I was waiting for it here because now we're going 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:27.209
 see inside the car here in la roque 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.700
 as any sports car is the car 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.840
 most comfortable in the world is a little 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.700
 tight right 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.220
 The back seat, then, we do not even talk. 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.140
 I'm sorry for those who need to walk in 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.780
 seat back will be very 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.209
 frequent so because the question has 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.100
 No one behind is my speedometer. 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.959
 blood well d type 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.610
 but the guy from the 60's 70's and such because 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.640
 There's nothing special about this. 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.440
 here the dashboard of the car to be as is the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.120
 name of that business to pass the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.010
 marched but denied that this margin as 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.040
 You can see an automatic car's right 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.300
 with promotion 16 automatic because open 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.070
 a second hand car business 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.959
 because it says in the snow it's complicated enough 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.580
 without the need to get past 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.989
 march and third because I'm pilot 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.500
 I'm going to drive on the 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.970
 the heavy traffic going back and forth 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.620
 I will not be able to work 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.539
 the people who like to know how to stay 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.739
 testing 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.209
 push-push not we have right 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.430
 Would you like to experiment? 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.770
 with the car and force the engine to the 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.360
 capacity of his potential 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.680
 It's not the kind of thing I'm going to do. 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.389
 When you're driving home from the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.340
 work things colleges then for me 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.669
 It's a lot I did, I'd rather 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.349
 comfort in practicality to the 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.509
 car do what I know it 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.120
 but the automatic car is a mean thing 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.979
 perhaps contradictory but do what 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.419
 personal preference for staff 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.560
 wanted to show if the engine snore now 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.569
 as you can see another in the area 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.690
 residential area has a condominium 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.370
 Otherwise, I will not be able to stay. 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.810
 forcing the engine here because here 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.909
 knows who to call the police but does not 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.590
 I'm making a mess in his street. 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.970
 is the nec in brazil can do 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.099
 basically want to stay for this 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.470
 even because the place where you will shoot 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.729
 The police there I found it better, I do not know. 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.940
 there I get the attention of the police an 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.470
 car there is a very harmless stop 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.630
 But I'm paranoid so I'll call the 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.340
 car that was asking there I thought 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.590
 also because the cars here they have 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.389
 usually this lever here and right 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.919
 there are some cars that 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.300
 you pass the march that you must have 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.729
 seen in the movies right? 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.650
 and this car has only one night that 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.639
 immanent economy this here but then you 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.729
 controls that the a certain nor the hamas says 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.229
 the next cleaning the congratulations anyway I 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.219
 I find it very strange because all the 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.930
 cars I've driven 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.639
 generally have all functions that 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.889
 you see here they were divided between 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.000
 one next and the other on the side of 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.380
 What do you have then I found a little 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.759
 I'm going to have to get used to 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.759
 but it is bound to address a 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.530
 but that's how you can see that he 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.150
 has 25 and deleted in 25 thousand kilometers or 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.090
 either it's not a zero kilometer car 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.949
 2012 mustang that relatively well 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.030
 but it is not a zero car 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.310
 to whoever was asking 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.919
 and for those who want to know a car too 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.590
 It costs the price of it on the site 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.710
 The concessionaire was $ 22,000 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.750
 As far as I know, it's about 50 thousand 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.610
 only with the options I bought the 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.800
 we buy things that protect the bodywork 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.689
 the bottom of the car lot of thing 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.659
 protect against errors with the study 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:23.580
 in total the price of the car stayed for 27 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:26.250
 thousand dollars that is not a price 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.810
 exorbitant price at a good price to play 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.849
 same interesting feature average 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.800
 from a stranger this side mirror 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.810
 edson are two rear-view mirrors 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.610
 As you can see it has the biggest one here 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.439
 little that corner only context 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.629
 the following until you change the 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:41.969
 You gotta have a look over your shoulder. 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:43.560
 OA small window but that the tanks 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:44.849
 much less however can not have 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.979
 a very good view as you are looking 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:49.020
 back so I can change lanes then 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.729
 He offers you two mirrors here to 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.650
 you can see two different angles 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.719
 so you can make your change of 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.159
 play a little safer track is still 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:57.690
 a good one and we should give an 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.610
 port as a matter of habit is a 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.169
 habit that you must maintain for reasons of 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.479
 but if you get lost it makes 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.550
 easy to change lanes in a car that 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:07.080
 rear visibility is not so good and 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.120
 basically I do not know exactly how 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.190
 I finished this video because I never did 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.080
 a review of a car that is not a 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.089
 review as one can see well stopped is the 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.770
 superficial view of a face that does not 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:18.629
 It takes a lot of car driving but 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.889
 I always wanted to have a certain car and then 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:21.599
 work a lot 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:23.219
 Wow, I think I have a good one today. 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:25.710
 time on the purchase of this post 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:27.360
 vehicle and bought it, I'm happy to 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.889
 Cock because as I said in the car of 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.330
 My claw dreams that I always wanted to have 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:31.650
 I put it in my head that I spend your 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.360
 money with any other car and I 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.490
 Repent for me in my head and 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.500
 It would have been a waste then this is it 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.419
 This is my mustang I hope you have. 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.039
 tanned to undress in making this video 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.699
 because I know that not burn a signal 

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.080
 that this announcement 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:46.819
 but the staff asked so much that I solved it 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.819
