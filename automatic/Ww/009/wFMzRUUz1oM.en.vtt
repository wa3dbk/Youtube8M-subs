stop that so how do we get rid of this
Russian<00:00:49.110> fleet<00:00:49.379> well<00:00:49.649> I've<00:00:49.860> looked<00:00:50.010> at

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
Russian fleet well I've looked at

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.130 
Russian fleet well I've looked at
various<00:00:50.460> combinations<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.449> read<00:00:51.629> around<00:00:51.899> for

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
various combinations and read around for

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.340 
various combinations and read around for
move<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.949> don't<00:00:53.430> find<00:00:53.789> any<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.059> them

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
move one and I don't find any of them

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.290 
move one and I don't find any of them
feasible<00:00:55.489> perhaps<00:00:56.489> by<00:00:56.670> move<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:58.609> 1902<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.090> can

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
feasible perhaps by move to 1902 you can

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.260 
feasible perhaps by move to 1902 you can
construct<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.440> maybe<00:01:02.010> maybe<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.120> has

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
construct this maybe maybe this has

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
construct this maybe maybe this has
gotten<00:01:03.570> maybe<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.930> hasn't<00:01:04.080> moved<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.680> maybe

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
gotten maybe it hasn't moved one maybe

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.980 
gotten maybe it hasn't moved one maybe
turkeys<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:08.360> hopefully<00:01:09.360> you've<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:09.930> an

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
turkeys here and hopefully you've got an

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.170 
turkeys here and hopefully you've got an
army<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.409> Romania<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.040> Russia<00:01:11.280> rather<00:01:12.000> than

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
army in Romania as Russia rather than

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.210 
army in Romania as Russia rather than
the<00:01:12.299> flee<00:01:12.540> armies<00:01:12.990> much<00:01:13.229> more<00:01:13.590> useful<00:01:13.799> because

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the flee armies much more useful because

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.460 
the flee armies much more useful because
you<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.520> look<00:01:14.790> inwards<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.420> Austria<00:01:15.869> who's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
you can look inwards to Austria who's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.920 
you can look inwards to Austria who's
going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.830> your<00:01:17.009> natural<00:01:17.460> enemy

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
going to be your natural enemy

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.550 
going to be your natural enemy
think<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> other<00:01:19.950> way<00:01:20.130> around<00:01:21.560> maybe

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
think of it the other way around maybe

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800 
think of it the other way around maybe
that<00:01:22.770> kind<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.070> thing<00:01:23.220> happened<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.689> this

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
that kind of thing happened and all this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.950 
that kind of thing happened and all this
can<00:01:24.990> do<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.259> stay<00:01:25.979> put<00:01:26.360> maybe<00:01:27.360> that's<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:27.810> way

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
can do is stay put maybe that's one way

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.330 
can do is stay put maybe that's one way
you<00:01:28.020> keep<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> juggernaut<00:01:28.740> happy<00:01:29.070> maybe

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you keep the juggernaut happy maybe

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.469 
you keep the juggernaut happy maybe
Russia's

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
Russia's

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.069 
Russia's
proved<00:01:30.869> ineffective<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.500> way<00:01:31.909> but<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:34.020> I

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
proved ineffective that way but so I

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.410 
proved ineffective that way but so I
read<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.520> best<00:01:35.700> way<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.210> rid<00:01:36.390> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
read and the best way is to get rid of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.260 
read and the best way is to get rid of
the<00:01:36.540> fleet<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> you've<00:01:38.040> got<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.460> construct

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the fleet so you've got to construct

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.899 
the fleet so you've got to construct
some<00:01:39.689> kind<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.990> way<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.890> Turkey<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.490> push

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
some kind of way for Turkey to push

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.170 
some kind of way for Turkey to push
Russia<00:01:42.299> out<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.750> somewhere<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:44.159> you're<00:01:45.090> going

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
Russia out of somewhere if you're going

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.969 
Russia out of somewhere if you're going
to<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.479> maybe<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.750> move<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.470> turkey<00:01:46.860> in

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
to do it maybe a move to we turkey in

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.710 
to do it maybe a move to we turkey in
the<00:01:47.100> Black<00:01:47.310> Sea<00:01:47.570> there<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.130> then<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:51.450> dies

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the Black Sea there and then that dies

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
the Black Sea there and then that dies
and<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.290> support<00:01:53.100> yourself<00:01:53.159> back<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.759> but

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and you support yourself back in but

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.990 
and you support yourself back in but
there's<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.299> lot<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.540> trust<00:01:54.840> here<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:56.000> think

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
there's a lot of trust here I think

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.490 
there's a lot of trust here I think
probably<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.360> easiest<00:01:57.630> way<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.170> certainly

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
probably the easiest way and certainly

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.929 
probably the easiest way and certainly
very<00:01:58.770> hard<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.040> prefer<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.340> play<00:01:59.700> is<00:02:00.649> just<00:02:01.939> keep

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
very hard to prefer to play is just keep

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.410 
very hard to prefer to play is just keep
the<00:02:03.439> Black<00:02:04.439> Sea<00:02:04.649> neutral<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.240> keeps

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the Black Sea neutral and it keeps

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.809 
the Black Sea neutral and it keeps
