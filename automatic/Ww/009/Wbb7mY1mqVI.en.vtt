00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
footage i shot for the tutorial now

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.010 
footage i shot for the tutorial now
there's<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.160> lot<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.580> camera<00:01:44.180> motion<00:01:44.360> in<00:01:44.780> this

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
there's a lot of camera motion in this

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.350 
there's a lot of camera motion in this
shot<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.560> i<00:01:45.890> put<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.399> top<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.790> couch<00:01:47.000> in

shot and i put the top of the couch in

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.510 
shot and i put the top of the couch in
the<00:01:47.600> foreground<00:01:47.990> just<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:48.890> could<00:01:49.009> get<00:01:49.310> a

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
the foreground just so you could get a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.170 
the foreground just so you could get a
little<00:01:49.790> more<00:01:50.000> sense<00:01:50.330> of<00:01:50.479> depth<00:01:51.790> here<00:01:52.790> i<00:01:52.820> just

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
little more sense of depth here i just

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.150 
little more sense of depth here i just
made<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.390> quick<00:01:53.750> target<00:01:54.200> in<00:01:54.380> adobe<00:01:54.860> photoshop

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
made a quick target in adobe photoshop

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.820 
made a quick target in adobe photoshop
to<00:01:55.850> display<00:01:56.240> on<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.509> TV<00:01:56.930> for<00:01:57.410> tracking

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
to display on the TV for tracking

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.300 
to display on the TV for tracking
purposes<00:01:58.869> now<00:01:59.869> you<00:02:00.320> could<00:02:00.560> track<00:02:00.830> this<00:02:01.069> shot

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
purposes now you could track this shot

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.240 
purposes now you could track this shot
without<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.880> target<00:02:02.270> but<00:02:03.229> having<00:02:03.560> one<00:02:03.740> really

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
without a target but having one really

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.240 
without a target but having one really
just<00:02:04.490> makes<00:02:04.700> life<00:02:04.819> easier<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:06.619> get<00:02:06.740> started

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
just makes life easier to get started

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.630 
just makes life easier to get started
we'll<00:02:07.670> need<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.149> create<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.479> new<00:02:08.569> composition

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
we'll need to create a new composition

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.730 
we'll need to create a new composition
will<00:02:10.640> drag<00:02:10.970> our<00:02:11.150> TV<00:02:11.600> footage<00:02:11.870> onto<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.620> new

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
will drag our TV footage onto the new

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.420 
will drag our TV footage onto the new
comp<00:02:13.069> button<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.660> before<00:02:14.660> we<00:02:14.690> track<00:02:15.140> this

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
comp button and before we track this

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.250 
comp button and before we track this
will<00:02:16.430> go<00:02:16.580> ahead<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.120> create<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.540> new<00:02:17.690> null

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
will go ahead and create a new null

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.120 
will go ahead and create a new null
object<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.010> apply<00:02:19.340> our<00:02:19.520> tracking<00:02:19.819> data<00:02:20.180> to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
object to apply our tracking data to

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.080 
object to apply our tracking data to
right<00:02:22.130> click<00:02:22.340> new<00:02:23.060> null<00:02:24.020> object<00:02:24.880> next<00:02:25.880> we'll

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
right click new null object next we'll

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.900 
right click new null object next we'll
select<00:02:26.360> our<00:02:26.720> video<00:02:27.110> footage<00:02:27.440> go<00:02:28.370> over<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.880> our

tracker track motion and make sure that

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.730 
tracker track motion and make sure that

I'm<00:02:38.080> going<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.170> put<00:02:39.380> our<00:02:39.410> tracker<00:02:40.099> points<00:02:40.760> on

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
I'm going to put our tracker points on

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.860 
I'm going to put our tracker points on

either side of this cross opening them
up<00:02:44.900> quite<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> bit<00:02:45.950> since<00:02:46.940> there's<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.240> lot<00:02:47.480> of
