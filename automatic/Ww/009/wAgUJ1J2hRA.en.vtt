right now I really wanted a mango and so
I<00:00:25.800> went<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> grocery<00:00:26.400> store<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.970> they<00:00:27.930> did

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
I went to the grocery store and they did

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.040 
I went to the grocery store and they did
have<00:00:28.410> some<00:00:28.680> mangos<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.400> they<00:00:29.550> were<00:00:29.609> all

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
have some mangos but they were all

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.600 
have some mangos but they were all
rotten<00:00:31.050> they<00:00:31.590> were<00:00:31.650> disgusting<00:00:32.369> they're<00:00:32.489> all

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610

wrinkled and mushy and run and I think

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.139 
wrinkled and mushy and run and I think
it's<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.070> they<00:00:38.370> were<00:00:38.430> hidden<00:00:38.820> behind

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
it's because they were hidden behind

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.479
