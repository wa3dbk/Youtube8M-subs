we've got various nips and cranes to
hide<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:19.640> as<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.820> approached<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.420> red<00:03:21.600> base

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
hide in and as I approached the red base

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.569 
hide in and as I approached the red base
kind<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.200> want<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.350> show<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.560> their<00:03:23.190> layout

looks<00:03:23.700> like<00:03:23.910> it's<00:03:24.269> very<00:03:24.570> similar<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:26.329> coal

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
looks like it's very similar to the coal

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.759 
looks like it's very similar to the coal
teams<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:28.620> there's<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.860> hot<00:03:29.070> teams<00:03:29.310> base<00:03:29.670> and

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
teams so there's a hot teams base and

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.960 
teams so there's a hot teams base and
like<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:31.799> said<00:03:31.950> nooks<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.610> crannies

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
like I said nooks and crannies

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.270 
like I said nooks and crannies
everywhere<00:03:33.720> how<00:03:34.470> we've<00:03:34.680> got<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.860> couple<00:03:35.100> of

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
gonna show you a couple the mechanics I

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.220 
gonna show you a couple the mechanics I
wish<00:04:33.420> I<00:04:33.570> could<00:04:33.750> show<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:33.990> with<00:04:34.830> opponents<00:04:35.550> but

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
so I could show you where the mechanics

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.950 
so I could show you where the mechanics
but<00:04:38.550> about<00:04:39.510> myself<00:04:39.660> so<00:04:40.260> I<00:04:41.660> want<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:42.690> talk<00:04:42.840> about

the fogging ability able to bring that
back<00:04:45.510> as<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:46.380> can<00:04:46.500> see<00:04:46.710> when<00:04:46.889> I<00:04:46.919> peak<00:04:47.250> this

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
back as you can see when I peak this

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.030 
back as you can see when I peak this
corner<00:04:47.760> here<00:04:47.910> it<00:04:48.150> gets<00:04:48.510> revealed<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.410> it's

corner here it gets revealed and it's
sort<00:04:50.310> of<00:04:50.400> lingers<00:04:50.639> actually<00:04:51.630> I'm<00:04:52.200> able<00:04:52.410> to

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
sort of lingers actually I'm able to

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.560 
sort of lingers actually I'm able to
