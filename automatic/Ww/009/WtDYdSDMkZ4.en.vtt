welcome back at the moment of truth is

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.900 
welcome back at the moment of truth is
very<00:00:10.019> nearly<00:00:10.380> upon<00:00:10.530> us<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:11.400> woods<00:00:11.580> cooling

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
very nearly upon us the woods cooling

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.700 
very nearly upon us the woods cooling
system<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.360> now<00:00:12.540> all<00:00:12.780> sorted<00:00:13.320> out<00:00:13.440> there<00:00:13.620> are

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
system is now all sorted out there are

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.609 
system is now all sorted out there are
two<00:00:13.920> jobs<00:00:14.219> I've<00:00:14.429> got<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.700> do<00:00:14.849> one<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.440> to<00:00:16.440> put<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
two jobs I've got to do one is to put a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.070 
two jobs I've got to do one is to put a
bit<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.830> oil<00:00:17.039> into<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.090> bores<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.690> make<00:00:18.930> sure

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
bit of oil into the bores to make sure

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.870 
bit of oil into the bores to make sure
they're<00:00:19.289> not<00:00:19.350> too<00:00:19.590> dry<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> spark<00:00:20.640> plugs

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
they're not too dry so the spark plugs

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.120 
they're not too dry so the spark plugs
are<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.260> little<00:00:22.260> squirt<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.710> each<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:23.039> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
are out little squirt in each one of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.470 
are out little squirt in each one of
these<00:00:23.720> it<00:00:24.720> will<00:00:24.869> burn<00:00:25.109> off<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.920> oil<00:00:26.480> like

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
these it will burn off this oil like

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.979 
these it will burn off this oil like
that<00:00:29.210> okay<00:00:31.940> there<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.030> go<00:00:33.059> sorted<00:00:33.690> out<00:00:33.840> now

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
that okay there we go sorted out now

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.860 
that okay there we go sorted out now
before<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.290> put<00:00:34.440> spark<00:00:34.770> plugs<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.309> next<00:00:35.880> job<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
before I put spark plugs in next job is

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.660 
before I put spark plugs in next job is
to<00:00:37.140> check<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.649> we've<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:37.980> got<00:00:38.219> some

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
to check that we've actually got some

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.860 
to check that we've actually got some
oil<00:00:39.360> pressure<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.530> sump<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.950> full<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:42.540> you

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
oil pressure the sump is full so you

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.510 
oil pressure the sump is full so you
switch<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.410> ignition<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.250> hey

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
switch the ignition on like that and hey

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.729 
switch the ignition on like that and hey
presto<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.360> light<00:00:45.870> comes<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.379> overhead

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
presto this light comes on overhead

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.560 
presto this light comes on overhead
lights<00:00:47.100> obviously<00:00:47.730> some<00:00:47.940> kind<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.270> warning

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
lights obviously some kind of warning

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.930 
lights obviously some kind of warning
lights<00:00:49.050> well<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.469> says<00:00:49.680> ignition<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> there

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
lights well it says ignition on it there

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.490 
lights well it says ignition on it there
but<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> little<00:00:51.360> quirk<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.079> these<00:00:52.260> old

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
but it's a little quirk of these old

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170 
but it's a little quirk of these old
Jaguars<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:53.879> actually

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
Jaguars but that's not actually

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180 
Jaguars but that's not actually
connected<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.629> alternator<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.680> connected

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
connected the alternator it is connected

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
connected the alternator it is connected
to<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.430> oil<00:00:56.670> pressure<00:00:57.210> warning<00:00:57.690> light<00:00:57.930> switch

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
to the oil pressure warning light switch

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.260 
to the oil pressure warning light switch
so<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.920> goes<00:00:59.190> out<00:00:59.399> when<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.640> turn<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> key

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
so if that goes out when I turn the key

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.479 
so if that goes out when I turn the key
over<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:01.230> I've<00:01:01.500> got<00:01:01.710> oil<00:01:01.949> pressure<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.370> here

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
over then I've got oil pressure so here

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.270 
over then I've got oil pressure so here
goes<00:01:04.670> please<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.680> don't<00:01:07.680> press<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
goes please go out don't press the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.600 
goes please go out don't press the
button

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.880 

but<00:01:17.610> first<00:01:17.910> I<00:01:18.240> have<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.420> put<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:19.050> spark<00:01:19.500> plugs

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
but first I have to put the spark plugs

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.980 
but first I have to put the spark plugs
in<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.220> course<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.120> put<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.479> five<00:01:21.690> this<00:01:21.930> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
in of course I do I put in five this is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.120 
in of course I do I put in five this is
the<00:01:22.110> sixth<00:01:22.440> one<00:01:22.880> just<00:01:23.880> slot<00:01:24.300> it<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.600> there

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
the sixth one just slot it in there

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.410 
the sixth one just slot it in there
they're<00:01:26.130> quite<00:01:26.370> easy<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.670> cross<00:01:26.970> thread<00:01:27.210> these

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
they're quite easy to cross thread these

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:41.410 
they're quite easy to cross thread these
so<00:01:28.190> that's<00:01:29.190> it<00:01:29.400> gone<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.910> tree

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:54.160 

didn't<00:01:42.420> plug<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.179> coil<00:01:45.179> connected<00:01:46.250> sorted

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.840 

it's<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> very<00:01:55.380> tense<00:01:55.649> moment<00:01:55.799> silence<00:01:56.579> I'm

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it's a very tense moment silence I'm

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.490 
it's a very tense moment silence I'm
trying<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.539> now<00:01:57.899> bit<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.890> chunk<00:02:01.700> go

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
trying to think now bit of chunk go

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.289 
trying to think now bit of chunk go
mission<00:02:04.500> key<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.159> turned<00:02:05.490> at<00:02:05.819> the<00:02:05.850> choke

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
mission key is turned at the choke

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:18.440 
mission key is turned at the choke
warning<00:02:06.899> light<00:02:07.110> comes<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.459> go

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.450 

yeah
