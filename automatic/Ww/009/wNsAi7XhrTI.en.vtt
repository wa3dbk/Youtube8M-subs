all<00:05:40.740> there<00:05:40.830> is<00:05:40.889> to<00:05:41.009> doing<00:05:41.669> this<00:05:41.759> again<00:05:41.820> it's<00:05:42.180> a

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
all there is to doing this again it's a

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.469 
all there is to doing this again it's a
it<00:05:43.620> is<00:05:43.740> a<00:05:43.800> sixteen<00:05:44.460> by<00:05:44.490> five<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:45.030> a<00:05:45.090> half<00:05:45.150> inch
