00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.929
 that there has been in the channel until 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.910
 moment 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.090
 previously luck catchers and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.850
 others and the truth that there were people 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.220
 who was very happy to be able to have 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.930
 the opportunity of then to have has 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.400

 has always accompanied me until good 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.530
 I made another but really, I already 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.479
 I'm not going to use it just for the sake of 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.690
 which are totally incompatible for the 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.420
 new generation 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.490

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.880
 opportunity to someone who can not have 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.870
 one because it can not be paid 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.140
 because simply maybe because he has not 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.190

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.110
