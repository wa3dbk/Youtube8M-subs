00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.860
 hello how about good friends I'm going to teach 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.610
 to configure what a gordon pym is 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.740
 a gamecube and wii emulator to be able to 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.279
 we have the fish market called in the tuning 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.720
 I should have the scary stick just like 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.119
 I leave the screen so you have the 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.330
 very active fluidity for example 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.370
 configuration should leave it as 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.540
 is here 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.600
 here 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.600
 remember that this is for pin 3.5 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:53.220
 367 here the last version that took out 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.220
 interface can as it is 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.100
 in the audio 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.100
 in gamecube 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.440
 just as it is here it is put to jump 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.910
 plane and change the Spanish language 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.160
 in the same way it is changed in the language 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.610
 Spanish something and for the game to come out 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.610
 in Spanish 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.740
 and this is left as it is 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.369
 eye is an important part of this 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.259
 the graphics I'm going to leave you a blow 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.329
 already modified with those from which 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.979
 they are missing so they can emulate 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.680
 very well what I will feel key and the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.340
 direct before tower team 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.600
 build your vision for graphics and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.990
 leaving as it is here in the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.990
 screen 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.050
 we are going to improve 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.440
 the interactive solution we leave everything such 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.440
 and how is 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.530
 a taxi and walt alcohol and as it is 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.530
 all this here is left 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.400
 and the advanced 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.400
 I have to sativa is to cut 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.910
 after this is for the last 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.850
 version that I will leave business and 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.580
 updated made by me 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.200
 and the one who does not take 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.010
 for 9/11 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.560
 to 32 bits because it is 4 bits has 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.510
 many problems 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.569
 and less any bull or anything for the 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.569
 style 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.970
 for example and I can put it here 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.970
 in what is properties 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.800
 and how can my operating system see 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.170
 64 bits 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.210
 I have this for 32 bits and it runs 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.920
 very good is 24 bits I do not know what 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.530
 problem still have but still 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.900
 find the way to run 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:10.049
 in a very nice way 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:13.650
 that would be all teach how you see everything 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:17.689
 type of digital video cameras how to 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.689
 go playing then emulating not 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.600
 here it will look a little slow so 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.290
 same as I am recording much consumption 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.290
 memory this 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.190
 let's make it work 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.780
 we are in the control of play 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.120
 and I can give you complete material that 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.120
 you use 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.780
 t 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.780
 as you can see they do not lock the police 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.540
 do not 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.349
 here sra 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.699
 like without playing very well 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.300
 two 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.170
 i 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.009
 but after dinner as seen in 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.680
 good video the cinemas and then they take out 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.460
 they look very good they are not worked 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.460
 nothing like that 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.810
 soon I'll show you how it looks 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.810
 playing playable 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.370
 and you can wait for punches 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:31.839
 good as you can see here you see 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.090
 very well moves excellent good me 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:36.910
 like very well 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:41.050
 and if it's a computer for me 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:44.230
 say is that it is not a computer 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.920
 Well I do not know what 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.920
 OK 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.770
 and well that would be all commented after
