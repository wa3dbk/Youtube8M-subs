00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:05.360 
in this video we'll go over some of the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.129 
in this video we'll go over some of the
training<00:00:05.840> options<00:00:06.230> on<00:00:06.470> your<00:00:06.500> forerunner<00:00:07.190> 405

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:08.139 
training options on your forerunner 405

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.709 
training options on your forerunner 405
specifically<00:00:09.139> Auto<00:00:09.499> lap<00:00:09.889> and<00:00:10.160> auto<00:00:10.910> pause<00:00:11.269> in

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
specifically Auto lap and auto pause in

specifically Auto lap and auto pause in
order<00:00:11.869> to<00:00:12.230> get<00:00:12.860> to<00:00:13.039> them<00:00:13.190> we<00:00:13.579> just<00:00:13.789> hold<00:00:13.969> down

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
order to get to them we just hold down

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.320 
order to get to them we just hold down
the<00:00:14.360> bezel<00:00:14.719> on<00:00:15.259> the<00:00:15.709> menu<00:00:16.160> and<00:00:16.790> we'll<00:00:16.970> go<00:00:17.120> down

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
the bezel on the menu and we'll go down

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.730 
the bezel on the menu and we'll go down
to<00:00:17.780> training<00:00:19.270> and<00:00:20.270> we'll<00:00:20.480> go<00:00:20.630> down<00:00:20.810> go<00:00:21.350> up<00:00:21.530> I

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
to training and we'll go down go up I

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.970 
to training and we'll go down go up I
should<00:00:22.100> say<00:00:22.250> to<00:00:22.310> options<00:00:23.380> and<00:00:24.380> from<00:00:24.620> there<00:00:24.830> we

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
should say to options and from there we

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.500 
should say to options and from there we
can<00:00:25.070> see<00:00:25.310> a<00:00:25.340> bunch<00:00:25.640> of<00:00:25.760> our<00:00:25.850> training<00:00:26.180> options

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
can see a bunch of our training options

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.660 
can see a bunch of our training options
here's<00:00:27.050> our<00:00:27.230> auto<00:00:27.350> pause<00:00:27.710> it's<00:00:28.070> currently<00:00:28.370> set

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
here's our auto pause it's currently set

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.970 
here's our auto pause it's currently set
to<00:00:28.700> auto<00:00:29.120> stop<00:00:29.539> whether<00:00:30.260> you<00:00:30.440> can<00:00:30.530> take<00:00:30.710> a<00:00:30.740> look

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
to auto stop whether you can take a look

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.420 
to auto stop whether you can take a look
here<00:00:31.610> our<00:00:31.820> options<00:00:32.360> we<00:00:32.450> can<00:00:32.570> turn<00:00:32.750> it<00:00:32.870> off<00:00:33.430> stop

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
here our options we can turn it off stop

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.750 
here our options we can turn it off stop
and<00:00:34.880> custom<00:00:35.180> pace<00:00:35.420> this<00:00:35.900> is<00:00:35.960> a<00:00:36.140> good<00:00:36.440> feature

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
and custom pace this is a good feature

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.300 
and custom pace this is a good feature
when<00:00:37.760> on<00:00:38.420> your<00:00:38.690> route<00:00:38.900> you<00:00:38.930> have<00:00:39.140> stop<00:00:39.980> lights

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
when on your route you have stop lights

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.030 
when on your route you have stop lights
or<00:00:40.640> crosswalks<00:00:41.630> anything<00:00:42.410> that<00:00:42.560> might<00:00:42.739> slow

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
or crosswalks anything that might slow

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.650 
or crosswalks anything that might slow
you<00:00:43.100> down<00:00:43.400> any<00:00:43.730> but<00:00:43.970> you<00:00:44.000> don't<00:00:44.270> want<00:00:44.420> it<00:00:44.510> to

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
you down any but you don't want it to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.139 
you down any but you don't want it to
affect<00:00:44.780> your<00:00:45.320> overall<00:00:45.829> pace<00:00:46.430> for<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.820> run<00:00:47.000> or

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
affect your overall pace for the run or

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.660 
affect your overall pace for the run or
for<00:00:47.360> your<00:00:47.480> lap<00:00:47.720> so<00:00:48.290> this<00:00:48.530> is<00:00:48.680> a<00:00:48.710> good<00:00:48.950> one<00:00:49.100> to

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
for your lap so this is a good one to

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.210 
for your lap so this is a good one to
have<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.960> is<00:00:51.200> assuming<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:51.680> you're<00:00:51.890> doing

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
have this is assuming that you're doing

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.920 
have this is assuming that you're doing
a<00:00:52.370> straight<00:00:52.790> run<00:00:53.090> you're<00:00:53.329> not<00:00:53.510> doing<00:00:53.780> any

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
a straight run you're not doing any

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.250 
a straight run you're not doing any
interval<00:00:54.500> or<00:00:54.829> advanced<00:00:55.130> workouts<00:00:55.720> so<00:00:56.720> that's

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
interval or advanced workouts so that's

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.760 
interval or advanced workouts so that's
Auto<00:00:57.559> pause<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.370> Auto<00:00:59.090> lap<00:00:59.570> is<00:00:59.870> when<00:01:00.530> you're

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
Auto pause and Auto lap is when you're

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.410 
Auto pause and Auto lap is when you're
doing<00:01:00.920> a<00:01:01.100> straight<00:01:01.280> run<00:01:01.670> you're<00:01:01.969> not<00:01:02.000> doing

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
doing a straight run you're not doing

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.270 
doing a straight run you're not doing
any<00:01:02.630> walk<00:01:02.930> brakes<00:01:03.320> but<00:01:03.649> you<00:01:03.770> do<00:01:03.920> want<00:01:04.159> a

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
any walk brakes but you do want a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.120 
any walk brakes but you do want a
breakdown<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:05.420> each<00:01:05.870> lap<00:01:06.200> either<00:01:06.860> by

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
breakdown of each lap either by

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.780 
breakdown of each lap either by
kilometer<00:01:07.850> by<00:01:08.060> mile<00:01:08.330> or<00:01:08.750> by<00:01:09.520> position<00:01:10.520> so

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
kilometer by mile or by position so

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.050 
kilometer by mile or by position so
here's<00:01:11.150> our<00:01:11.360> other<00:01:11.510> lap<00:01:12.130> we<00:01:13.130> see<00:01:13.460> some<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:13.729> our

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
here's our other lap we see some of our

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.090 
here's our other lap we see some of our
options<00:01:14.630> here<00:01:15.110> we<00:01:15.229> can<00:01:15.320> turn<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:15.619> off<00:01:15.770> by

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
options here we can turn it off by

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.480 
options here we can turn it off by
distance<00:01:16.790> for<00:01:17.090> my<00:01:17.180> position<00:01:17.630> my<00:01:18.590> position<00:01:19.159> is

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
distance for my position my position is

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.060 
distance for my position my position is
by<00:01:20.119> doing<00:01:20.420> certain<00:01:20.659> actions<00:01:21.320> on<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.920> watch

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
by doing certain actions on the watch

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.880 
by doing certain actions on the watch
you<00:01:22.280> can<00:01:22.430> hit<00:01:22.580> lap<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.780> will<00:01:23.960> mark<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.740> lab

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
you can hit lap that will mark the lab

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.130 
you can hit lap that will mark the lab
you<00:01:25.280> can<00:01:25.430> hit<00:01:25.880> start<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.360> lap<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:26.869> can<00:01:26.990> do

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
you can hit start and lap you can do

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.840 
you can hit start and lap you can do
those<00:01:27.590> different<00:01:27.950> combinations<00:01:28.580> but

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
those different combinations but

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.039 
those different combinations but
probably<00:01:29.780> for<00:01:29.840> most<00:01:30.110> runners<00:01:30.409> you<00:01:30.860> will<00:01:32.049> set

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
probably for most runners you will set

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.469 
probably for most runners you will set
it<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.490> distance<00:01:35.260> and<00:01:36.260> here<00:01:36.830> I<00:01:36.860> have<00:01:37.040> it<00:01:37.159> set<00:01:37.369> to

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
it to distance and here I have it set to

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.070 
it to distance and here I have it set to
one<00:01:38.479> mile<00:01:38.689> or<00:01:38.720> 1.6<00:01:39.560> kilometers<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:41.720> once<00:01:41.990> you

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
one mile or 1.6 kilometers and once you

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.929 
one mile or 1.6 kilometers and once you
have<00:01:42.229> that<00:01:42.380> set<00:01:42.439> up<00:01:42.860> they're<00:01:43.430> ready<00:01:43.549> to<00:01:43.729> do

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
have that set up they're ready to do

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.609 
have that set up they're ready to do
your<00:01:44.090> workout<00:01:44.450> this<00:01:44.810> could<00:01:45.049> be<00:01:45.170> just<00:01:45.320> be<00:01:45.590> a

Garmin Connect this is a five mile or
eight<00:02:06.409> kilometer<00:02:06.979> run<00:02:07.189> that<00:02:07.880> had<00:02:08.390> auto<00:02:08.780> pause

eight kilometer run that had auto pause
and<00:02:09.709> auto<00:02:09.950> lap<00:02:10.250> enabled<00:02:10.789> so<00:02:10.940> let's<00:02:11.150> scroll

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
and auto lap enabled so let's scroll

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.360 
and auto lap enabled so let's scroll
down<00:02:11.540> here<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:11.840> take<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.050> look<00:02:12.319> at<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:13.130> first

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
down here and take a look at the first

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.050 
down here and take a look at the first
thing<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.760> will

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
thing that will

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.809 
thing that will
see<00:02:14.270> which<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.020> auto<00:02:15.200> lap<00:02:15.550> aspect<00:02:16.550> which

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
see which is the auto lap aspect which

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.580 
see which is the auto lap aspect which
is<00:02:16.849> here<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.330> left<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.840> can<00:02:18.200> see<00:02:18.410> here

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
is here on the left you can see here

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.490 
is here on the left you can see here
that<00:02:18.620> I've<00:02:18.880> set<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.270> distance<00:02:20.720> for<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.349> auto

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
that I've set the distance for the auto

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.000 
that I've set the distance for the auto
lap<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:22.010> be<00:02:22.130> one<00:02:22.459> mile<00:02:22.700> or<00:02:22.970> 1.6<00:02:23.959> kilometers<00:02:24.170> you

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
lap to be one mile or 1.6 kilometers you

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.490 
lap to be one mile or 1.6 kilometers you
can<00:02:25.160> see<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.400> breakdown<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:27.050> you

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
can see the breakdown of that and you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.140 
can see the breakdown of that and you
can<00:02:27.650> also<00:02:27.770> notice<00:02:27.950> here<00:02:28.459> on<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.760> bottom<00:02:28.790> right

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
can also notice here on the bottom right

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.690 
can also notice here on the bottom right
that<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:30.020> did<00:02:30.230> have<00:02:30.440> Auto<00:02:30.769> pause<00:02:31.069> enabled

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
that I did have Auto pause enabled

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.270 
that I did have Auto pause enabled
because<00:02:32.269> you<00:02:32.720> can<00:02:32.840> see<00:02:33.050> during<00:02:33.290> my<00:02:33.440> run<00:02:34.099> my

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
because you can see during my run my

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.259 
because you can see during my run my
heart<00:02:34.580> rate<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:35.480> had<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.709> part<00:02:37.700> here<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.120> was

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
heart rate I had a part here that was

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.540 
heart rate I had a part here that was
dipped<00:02:38.870> pretty<00:02:39.319> low<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.160> was<00:02:40.250> because<00:02:40.519> I

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
dipped pretty low and that was because I

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.330 
dipped pretty low and that was because I
was<00:02:40.640> stopped<00:02:40.970> at<00:02:41.269> a<00:02:41.450> stoplight<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.470> that

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
was stopped at a stoplight and that

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.460 
was stopped at a stoplight and that
allowed<00:02:43.580> my<00:02:43.700> heart<00:02:43.940> rate<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.209> drop<00:02:44.390> lower<00:02:45.170> than

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
allowed my heart rate to drop lower than

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.680 
allowed my heart rate to drop lower than
than<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.250> rest<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:47.450> was<00:02:47.569> the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
than the rest of it so that was the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.660 
than the rest of it so that was the
indication<00:02:48.140> there<00:02:48.290> but<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.739> can<00:02:48.890> see<00:02:49.160> here<00:02:49.519> on

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
indication there but you can see here on

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.620 
indication there but you can see here on
my<00:02:49.700> laps<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.959> didn't<00:02:51.470> affect<00:02:52.630> that

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
my laps that it didn't affect that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.320 
my laps that it didn't affect that
particular<00:02:53.989> lap<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:55.310> that's<00:02:55.700> because<00:02:56.030> when<00:02:56.299> I

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
particular lap and that's because when I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.339 
particular lap and that's because when I
did<00:02:56.450> stop<00:02:56.870> at<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.140> light<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:58.370> timer<00:02:58.670> stopped

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
did stop at the light the timer stopped

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.199 
did stop at the light the timer stopped
so<00:03:00.349> anyway<00:03:00.620> that's<00:03:00.769> how<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.069> do<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.400> auto

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
so anyway that's how you do it auto

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.670 
so anyway that's how you do it auto
pause<00:03:02.599> and<00:03:03.019> all<00:03:03.110> lap<00:03:03.349> on<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:04.069> Garmin<00:03:04.549> Forerunner
