consists of a frame with a washer on top

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.800 
consists of a frame with a washer on top
all<00:00:20.340> thread<00:00:21.080> nut<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:23.340> puck<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> these

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
pucks are sized appropriately for

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.470 
pucks are sized appropriately for
whatever<00:00:28.170> cylinder<00:00:29.039> sleeve<00:00:29.330> dimension<00:00:30.330> that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
whatever cylinder sleeve dimension that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.400 
whatever cylinder sleeve dimension that
you've<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:30.900> now<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.250> case<00:00:33.020> it's<00:00:34.020> cut<00:00:34.260> off

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
you've got now in this case it's cut off

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.459 
you've got now in this case it's cut off
on<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.670> of<00:00:35.670> two<00:00:35.940> sides<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.989> slips

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
on the of two sides so that it slips

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.920 
on the of two sides so that it slips
into<00:00:37.950> place<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> little<00:00:38.460> easier<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.270> this

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
into place a little easier in this

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.580 
into place a little easier in this
particular<00:00:40.649> case<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.820> bottom<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
particular case the bottom of the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.459 
particular case the bottom of the
sleeves<00:00:43.590> are<00:00:43.969> chamfered<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:46.230> puck

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
sleeves are chamfered so that this puck

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.340 
sleeves are chamfered so that this puck
didn't<00:00:46.739> work<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:46.950> well<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.520> guy<00:00:47.670> made<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.350> nice

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
didn't work so well the guy made a nice

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.860 
didn't work so well the guy made a nice
round<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.489> little<00:00:51.360> bit<00:00:51.480> larger

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
round one with a little bit larger

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
round one with a little bit larger
contact<00:00:52.379> area<00:00:52.710> down<00:00:52.920> there<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> works

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
contact area down there and it works

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.069 
contact area down there and it works
just<00:00:54.390> great<00:00:54.949> so<00:00:56.149> all<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.390> need<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.989> in

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
just great so all you need to do and in

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.529 
just great so all you need to do and in
this<00:00:58.199> case<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.590> already<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.250> oil<00:01:00.180> pan<00:01:00.510> off

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
this case I already have the oil pan off

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.080 
this case I already have the oil pan off
so<00:01:01.379> I've<00:01:01.469> got<00:01:01.649> access<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.070> underside<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
so I've got access to underside of the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.590 
so I've got access to underside of the
cylinders<00:01:03.570> i<00:01:04.729> rotated<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.030> crankshaft

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
cylinders i rotated the crankshaft

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840 
cylinders i rotated the crankshaft
around<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.470> I've<00:01:07.710> got<00:01:07.920> easier<00:01:08.400> access

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
around so that I've got easier access

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.690 
around so that I've got easier access
under<00:01:09.119> there<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.510> inserted<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> puck<00:01:10.700> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
under there and inserted the puck the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.600 
under there and inserted the puck the
first<00:01:11.909> thing<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.299> want<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.920> is<00:01:16.369> press<00:01:17.369> the

first thing I want to do is press the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.660 
first thing I want to do is press the
puck<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.240> into<00:01:18.600> place<00:01:19.009> while<00:01:20.009> dropping<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
puck up into place while dropping the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.420 
puck up into place while dropping the
all-thread<00:01:21.090> down<00:01:21.560> making<00:01:22.560> contact<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
all-thread down making contact with the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.289 
all-thread down making contact with the
threads<00:01:23.869> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.500> puck<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:28.759> just<00:01:29.759> screwing<00:01:30.210> it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
threads in the puck and just screwing it

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.469 
threads in the puck and just screwing it
into<00:01:30.479> place<00:01:33.170> screw<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> all<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.680> way<00:01:34.770> down

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
into place screw it all the way down

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.120 
into place screw it all the way down
till<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.630> bottoms<00:01:36.869> out<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.470> puck<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.979> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
till it bottoms out in the puck and that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.940 
till it bottoms out in the puck and that
way<00:01:38.310> you've<00:01:38.430> got<00:01:38.460> maximum<00:01:39.350> thread<00:01:40.350> contact

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
way you've got maximum thread contact

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.740 
way you've got maximum thread contact
down<00:01:41.159> there<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.240> don't<00:01:42.390> want<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> strip

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
down there you don't want to strip

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.289 
down there you don't want to strip
anything<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.610> simply<00:01:45.000> take<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
anything out and then simply take the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.039 
anything out and then simply take the
frame<00:01:45.540> set<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.590> over<00:01:46.799> top<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> all<00:01:47.369> thread

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
frame set it over top of the all thread

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.980 
frame set it over top of the all thread
now<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.350> put<00:01:49.649> grease<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.720> top<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
now I like to put grease on top of the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.999 
now I like to put grease on top of the
on<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.070> threads<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.000> also<00:01:54.770> on<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
on the threads up here and also on the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.819 
on the threads up here and also on the
net<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.369> washer<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.290> easier<00:01:58.680> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
net and washer so that it it's easier to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.569 
net and washer so that it it's easier to
turn<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.450> extracts<00:02:00.649> much<00:02:01.649> nicer<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.549> I

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
turn and extracts much nicer so I

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.569 
turn and extracts much nicer so I
already<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.180> greased<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:04.399> where<00:02:05.399> some

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
already have that greased up where some

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.340 
already have that greased up where some
rubber<00:02:05.790> gloves<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.719> helps<00:02:07.020> keep<00:02:07.140> your
