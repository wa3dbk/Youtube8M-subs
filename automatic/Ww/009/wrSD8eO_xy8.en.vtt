 application to get credits or 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.680
 whether you 're downloading this app 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.320
 what on your cell phone 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.410
 is to get two thousand and 280 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:19.850
 it would be a scoring mode there 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.980
 the offers 2 in the 3 offers are these 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.930
 first three are usually the ones that give 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.330
 more points so it was like 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.800
 recommended the lowest r 200 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.440
 it's the same application it can happen in 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.110
 you download the application and you do not 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.190
 earn points on the hour but then you 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.010
 wins 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.830
 it happened to me that bass o 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.170
 application was up to 10,000 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.770
 Galley lowers the odd - scale application 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.830
 downloaded when you tried with 20 thousand 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:57.470
 but I still have 10 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:03:00.130
 then spent ten minutinhos there had already 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.110
 about 18 thousand 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.050
 joining together every April opening 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.640
 apps and 64 points a kiss kiss 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.580
 follow you around 162 thousand and I changed 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:23.870
 with 10 dollars in American dollars 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:31.549
 Worked to change what works with 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:34.549
 660 thousand and that there is also a 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:40.430
 code places again it becomes 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:45.980
 on duty in history 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.110
 it left store and then it's low, not you 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.570
 puts the code in the playstation store and 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.430

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.049
 when you start with 2,400 you 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.530
 low will change in offers to download 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.150
 the application downloads the application from the 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.699
 application back 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.080

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:33.479

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:06.630
 It is to believe and even if not 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.250
 I imagined that there were such things 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.250
