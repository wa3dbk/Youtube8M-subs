00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello very good we are all here in 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.309
 this second tutorial of word edit and 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.500
 good to start we need to have the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.130
 ax in this tutorial we're going to create 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.530
 walls or floors 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.810
 good stuff those walls and pieces 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.599
 The first thing to have is the ax 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.869
 The second thing is to choose a material that 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.869
 like 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.210
 if we want to make an apartment 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.530
 we do not need anything else we need 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.600
 so he squeezed and said it feels good 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.600
 so 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.750
 click 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.750
 left 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.530
 r 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.630
 wallace 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.590
 7 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:15.090
 and objective in the air of the stone 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.090
 then here he offers us 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.150
 then if we want to make a juice that 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.620
 this origin and everything else 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.940
 we put like this 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.000
 here we put any material 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.660
 then here with you 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.660
 above 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.020
 yes and right 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.159
 and set 81 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.159
 and here he offers us 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.490
 yd 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.850
 and then if we want to be a wall 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.720
 but without being recent or anything 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.720
 they can put well 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:12.489
 bullets left 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.260
 89 and here is the wall made for example 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.920
 if we want to make a house we do what 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.920
 same but so 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.150
 Y 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.180
 and so on until we live 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.180
 789 we have the wall 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.720
 with this 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.620
 89 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.780
 for the roof we press here 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.290
 here 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.290
 set 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.730
 yes this block and things 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.010
 the glass wears 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.420
 as I do not want this part to happen 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.200
 I'm crazy here that this was going to 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.690
 convert 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.880
 and a block here 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.060
 that is where we are going 7 20 and here 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.060
 we have 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.470
 in the case of the desire or clay 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.720
 for example that there are many colors 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.730
 it's always going to be the same but the 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.630
 difference is that talking about the idea and 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.630
 another number 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.630
 one 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.770
 agent 2 the sky blue 3 is like that 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.510
 we are going to be able to be if we put here 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.510
 we press here for the floor 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.770
 75 and I want to put the blue for example 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.520
 I'm going to look like the white one because it's a 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.190
 first you have 35 for example has 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.810
 35 11 then to change that can 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.639
 we put 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.639
 left click right click 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.480
 35 2 points 11 what would it be for 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.800
 add to wool color 11 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.800
 since we do not have to see 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.810
 best 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.639
 button 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.449
 good with this is much easier I wanted 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.389
 some houses and all that why 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.689
 tighten in two places and you create everything 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.689
 single 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.810
 this is good of giant constructions 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.810
 or adventure maps 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.240
 it was a bit 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.910
 a little too low to see what I'm going to come back and 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.350
 make it up 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.670
 here 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.500
 to go back we put 70 that would be the idea 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.680
 of no block then how is it not 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.979
 no place 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.560
 we finish and 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.730
 here 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.730
 yes, here 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.120
 I said 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.139
 720 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.349
 Yes now 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.349
 and 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:49.040
 we had looked weird so good here is 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.040
 the roof thanks 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:58.780
 are these animals and here leave a small 

00:05:53.899 --> 00:06:00.760
 space so that it does not stop 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.730
 and here we have our house we are going to 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.840
 put tnt and we will tighten all the 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.690
 another day I was making a map 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.760
 adventures just started makes everything tnt 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.230
 and everything fell down so I recommend them 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.230
 that do not put everything tnt 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.289
 and the 146 would be the sector 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.379
 here 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.379
 and here 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:37.780
 46 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.930
 it looks all wrong I'm stuck like april 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:44.970
 in tnt and here is all good 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.970
 let's try everything 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.260

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:55.820

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.820
 it is not used so much 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.180
 but it is 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.800
