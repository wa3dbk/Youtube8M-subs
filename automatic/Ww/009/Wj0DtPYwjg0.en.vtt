oh<00:00:32.130> yeah<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.730> game<00:00:32.910> plays<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> 42<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.840> oh<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
oh yeah this game plays a 42 and oh it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.880 
oh yeah this game plays a 42 and oh it
is<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> 30<00:00:35.370> let's<00:00:35.820> see<00:00:35.910> nucular<00:00:36.239> obviously<00:00:36.899> but

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
is a 30 let's see nucular obviously but

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.500 
is a 30 let's see nucular obviously but
then<00:00:38.010> plus<00:00:38.309> he<00:00:38.430> gets<00:00:38.520> 12<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:38.940> top<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.360> so

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
then plus he gets 12 on top of that so

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.660 
then plus he gets 12 on top of that so
it<00:00:39.600> must<00:00:39.719> be<00:00:39.840> 12<00:00:40.079> unstoppable<00:00:40.860> metals<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.309> am

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
attitude yet they can still perform but

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.140 
attitude yet they can still perform but
actually<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.920> second<00:01:26.670> thought<00:01:26.850> Prince

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
actually on second thought Prince

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.310 
actually on second thought Prince
Fielder<00:01:27.450> has<00:01:27.510> been<00:01:27.630> doing<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.170> too<00:01:28.290> long

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
Fielder has been doing that for too long

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.570 
Fielder has been doing that for too long
and<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.740> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:29.010> caught<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.400> him<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
and it's kind of caught up to him it

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.980 
and it's kind of caught up to him it
seems<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.030> right<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:30.630> he's<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
seems like right now he's on the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.800 
seems like right now he's on the
disabled<00:01:31.500> list<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.369> think<00:01:32.400> he<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.450> gonna<00:01:33.600> be

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
disabled list and I think he is gonna be

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.120 
disabled list and I think he is gonna be
out<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> season<00:01:34.350> I'm<00:01:34.590> pretty<00:01:34.920> sure<00:01:35.100> about

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
out for the season I'm pretty sure about

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.340 
out for the season I'm pretty sure about
correct<00:01:35.700> me<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.850> I'm<00:01:35.940> wrong<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.720> when<00:01:37.110> he<00:01:37.229> was

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
Detroit and I thought that was really

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.390 
Detroit and I thought that was really
funny<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.560> he<00:01:52.830> just<00:01:52.979> didn't<00:01:53.189> want<00:01:53.220> to

the end of the day they're very they're
both<00:03:21.850> very<00:03:22.120> dangerous<00:03:22.750> sports<00:03:23.080> but<00:03:23.260> if<00:03:23.350> you

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
both very dangerous sports but if you

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.800 
both very dangerous sports but if you
compare<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.890> two<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.850> know<00:03:25.209> football<00:03:25.660> with

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
compare the two you know football with

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.930 
compare the two you know football with
11<00:03:26.200> minutes<00:03:26.319> of<00:03:26.530> actual<00:03:26.920> play<00:03:27.280> time<00:03:27.549> with<00:03:27.819> the

11 minutes of actual play time with the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.960 
11 minutes of actual play time with the
NHL<00:03:28.510> which<00:03:29.080> has<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.680> have<00:03:29.860> 60<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.730> let<00:03:30.880> me

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
NHL which has to have 60 and let me

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.360 
NHL which has to have 60 and let me
explain<00:03:31.329> that<00:03:31.570> when<00:03:32.230> there's<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.769> whistle<00:03:33.250> in

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
explain that when there's a whistle in

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.920 
explain that when there's a whistle in
football<00:03:33.820> obviously<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.540> clock<00:03:34.750> keeps

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
football obviously the clock keeps

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.960 
football obviously the clock keeps
running<00:03:35.470> when<00:03:35.920> there's<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.130> whistle<00:03:36.519> in<00:03:36.640> hockey

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
running when there's a whistle in hockey

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.390 
running when there's a whistle in hockey
the<00:03:37.090> clock<00:03:37.299> stops<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:37.989> in<00:03:38.260> football<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.100> clock

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
the clock stops so in football the clock

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.220 
the clock stops so in football the clock
can<00:03:39.549> keep<00:03:39.760> running<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.450> you're<00:03:40.810> not<00:03:40.930> playing

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
can keep running and you're not playing

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.440 
can keep running and you're not playing
in<00:03:41.650> hockey<00:03:42.160> you<00:03:42.370> know<00:03:42.549> clock<00:03:42.910> stops<00:03:43.180> obviously

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
in hockey you know clock stops obviously

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.110 
in hockey you know clock stops obviously
you're<00:03:44.200> not<00:03:44.290> playing<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:45.700> because<00:03:46.090> of

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
you're not playing and so because of

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.599 
you're not playing and so because of
that<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.660> have<00:03:46.900> 60<00:03:47.650> minutes<00:03:47.799> of<00:03:48.010> action<00:03:48.370> and

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
that you have 60 minutes of action and

11 minutes a game for 16 games now which

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.920 
11 minutes a game for 16 games now which
one<00:04:05.019> is<00:04:05.410> more<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.880> know<00:04:07.000> more<00:04:07.239> violent<00:04:07.750> here<00:04:07.900> I

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
one is more you know more violent here I

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.020 
one is more you know more violent here I
think<00:04:08.230> hockey<00:04:08.859> clearly<00:04:09.250> wins<00:04:09.489> but<00:04:09.790> at<00:04:09.940> the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
think hockey clearly wins but at the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.090 
think hockey clearly wins but at the
same<00:04:10.209> time<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:11.019> sheer<00:04:11.260> amount<00:04:11.350> of<00:04:11.560> contact

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
same time the sheer amount of contact

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.440 
same time the sheer amount of contact
hits<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:12.579> stuff<00:04:12.760> like<00:04:12.910> that<00:04:13.090> obviously

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
hits and stuff like that obviously

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.520 
hits and stuff like that obviously
footballs<00:04:13.870> gonna<00:04:14.049> have<00:04:14.200> more<00:04:14.380> of<00:04:14.440> them

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
footballs gonna have more of them

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.660 
footballs gonna have more of them
because<00:04:14.799> that's<00:04:14.920> what<00:04:15.130> it's<00:04:15.250> all<00:04:15.340> about

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
because that's what it's all about

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.539 
because that's what it's all about
however<00:04:16.419> I<00:04:16.539> would<00:04:16.750> also<00:04:16.780> argue<00:04:17.229> that<00:04:17.680> in

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
however I would also argue that in

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.340 
however I would also argue that in
hockey<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.060> can<00:04:19.479> get<00:04:19.630> up<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.750> speed<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:20.109> lot

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
hockey you can get up to speed a lot

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.320 
hockey you can get up to speed a lot
faster<00:04:20.890> you're<00:04:21.220> on<00:04:21.340> skates<00:04:21.729> you<00:04:21.850> can<00:04:22.060> travel

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
faster you're on skates you can travel

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.090 
faster you're on skates you can travel
well<00:04:22.600> over<00:04:22.840> 20<00:04:23.139> miles<00:04:23.289> an<00:04:23.440> hour<00:04:23.590> on<00:04:23.800> skates

which is faster than you can run I'm
pretty<00:04:26.440> sure<00:04:26.760> then<00:04:27.760> you<00:04:28.240> know<00:04:28.330> without<00:04:28.630> a

pretty sure then you know without a

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.969 
pretty sure then you know without a
doubt<00:04:28.780> you<00:04:29.050> can<00:04:29.200> skate<00:04:29.410> faster<00:04:29.680> than<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:29.860> can

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.670 
harder in hockey than they are in
football<00:04:37.599> but<00:04:37.810> there's<00:04:37.960> more<00:04:38.140> frequent<00:04:38.560> ones

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
football but there's more frequent ones

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.590 
football but there's more frequent ones
in<00:04:38.830> football<00:04:39.250> but<00:04:39.669> then<00:04:39.849> again<00:04:39.970> you<00:04:40.270> mix

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
in football but then again you mix

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.590 
in football but then again you mix
with<00:04:41.140> more<00:04:41.590> frequent<00:04:42.040> games<00:04:42.310> 82<00:04:43.150> games<00:04:43.360> for

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
with more frequent games 82 games for

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.100 
with more frequent games 82 games for
hockey<00:04:43.900> with<00:04:44.560> 60<00:04:45.040> minutes<00:04:45.220> per<00:04:46.000> game<00:04:46.630> of

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
hockey with 60 minutes per game of

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.530 
hockey with 60 minutes per game of
actual<00:04:47.500> play<00:04:47.740> or<00:04:48.070> 16<00:04:48.550> games<00:04:48.820> with<00:04:49.150> 11<00:04:49.450> minutes

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
actual play or 16 games with 11 minutes

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.240 
actual play or 16 games with 11 minutes
per<00:04:49.690> play<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:49.900> still<00:04:50.290> think<00:04:50.500> hockey<00:04:50.770> wins<00:04:51.010> in

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
per play I still think hockey wins in

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.490 
per play I still think hockey wins in
