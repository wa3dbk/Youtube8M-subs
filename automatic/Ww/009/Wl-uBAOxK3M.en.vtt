00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
actually needs it's also rich in gamma

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.009 
actually needs it's also rich in gamma
linolenic<00:03:04.170> acid<00:03:04.579> GLA<00:03:05.579> which<00:03:06.360> helps<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.900> reduce

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
linolenic acid GLA which helps to reduce

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.539
