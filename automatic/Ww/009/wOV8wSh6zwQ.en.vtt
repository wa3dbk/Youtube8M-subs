I<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.579> always<00:01:02.760> railed<00:01:03.239> against<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
I have always railed against the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.210 
I have always railed against the
distribution<00:01:04.470> process<00:01:04.650> when<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:04.979> comes<00:01:05.129> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
distribution process when it comes to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.740

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
film and television I have always

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.420 
film and television I have always
believed<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> distribution<00:01:08.130> was<00:01:08.189> about

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
believed that the distribution was about

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.310 
believed that the distribution was about
getting<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:09.390> film<00:01:09.689> or<00:01:09.840> television<00:01:09.900> show<00:01:10.290> out

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
getting your film or television show out

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.630 
getting your film or television show out

to as many people as possible and then

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.820 
to as many people as possible and then
then<00:01:12.180> making<00:01:12.570> money<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.470> process

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
then making money in the process

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.399

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
realized that they have to get things

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.780 
realized that they have to get things
out<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.390> people<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.470> format<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.100> makes

out to people in a format that makes

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.640 
out to people in a format that makes
sense<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.420> them<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.690> that<00:03:22.049> it's<00:03:22.170> cheap<00:03:22.410> enough

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
sense to them and that it's cheap enough

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.160 
sense to them and that it's cheap enough
for<00:03:22.980> them<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:24.150> want<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.420> buy<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.840> it

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
for them to to want to buy it and it

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.270 
for them to to want to buy it and it
needs<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.350> be<00:03:25.440> available<00:03:25.650> everywhere<00:03:26.010> where

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
order to get it was used to be that it

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.890 
order to get it was used to be that it
was<00:03:28.950> easier<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.489> get<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.760> pirated<00:03:30.360> version<00:03:30.420> of

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
legitimate version and you then even

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:35.900 
legitimate version and you then even
then<00:03:34.920> you'd<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.220> buy<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.370> entire<00:03:35.700> album

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
then you'd have to buy the entire album

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.160 
then you'd have to buy the entire album
instead<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.329> just<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.510> couple<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.810> songs<00:03:36.989> that

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170

environment that we live in now so there

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.370 
environment that we live in now so there

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
you go I you know I mean it sounds so

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.530 
you go I you know I mean it sounds so
obvious<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:35.520> know<00:04:35.820> a<00:04:35.850> definition<00:04:36.420> like

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
obvious that you know a definition like

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.780 
obvious that you know a definition like
that<00:04:36.750> but<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.140> is<00:04:37.260> amazing<00:04:37.770> how<00:04:37.800> that<00:04:38.100> that

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
that but it is amazing how that that

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.170 
that but it is amazing how that that
changes<00:04:39.270> your<00:04:39.360> perception<00:04:39.720> on<00:04:40.730> on<00:04:41.730> the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
process I mean I I it was always a bit

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.020 
process I mean I I it was always a bit
of<00:04:44.340> a<00:04:44.400> mystery<00:04:44.640> to<00:04:44.730> me<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:44.910> it's<00:04:45.000> been

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
of a mystery to me and it's been

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.160 
of a mystery to me and it's been
interesting<00:04:45.420> talking<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.720> people<00:04:45.840> about<00:04:46.020> it

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
interesting talking to people about it

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.830 
interesting talking to people about it
and<00:04:46.320> discovering<00:04:47.100> that<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.640> we<00:04:48.510> need<00:04:48.720> to

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
and discovering that that we need to

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.540 
and discovering that that we need to
basically<00:04:49.200> figure<00:04:49.530> out<00:04:49.740> another<00:04:50.010> way<00:04:50.220> of

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
basically figure out another way of

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
basically figure out another way of
