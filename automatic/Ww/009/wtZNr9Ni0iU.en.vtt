00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.479 
would get like two or three of the same
side<00:00:39.540> dish<00:00:39.809> when<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.079> thought<00:00:40.290> yeah<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.280> row

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
side dish when I thought yeah in a row

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.160 
side dish when I thought yeah in a row
yeah<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.090> if<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.210> kind<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.480> mix<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
yeah but if you kind of mix it up and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.580 
yeah but if you kind of mix it up and
just<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:44.010> them<00:00:44.160> as<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.430> feel<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.469> think<00:00:46.469> I

but is basically killing tons of aliens
with<00:04:48.479> like<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.750> computer<00:04:49.140> like<00:04:49.890> commanding<00:04:50.490> a

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
with like a computer like commanding a

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.840 
with like a computer like commanding a
huge<00:04:51.169> flight<00:04:52.169> or<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.590> huge<00:04:53.340> fleet<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:55.850> fighter

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
so she playing starcraft and it's

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.190 
so she playing starcraft and it's
actually<00:04:59.820> happening<00:05:00.330> basically<00:05:00.870> like<00:05:01.050> he

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
actually happening basically like he

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.750 
actually happening basically like he
thinks<00:05:01.500> he's<00:05:01.620> doing<00:05:01.770> a<00:05:01.950> training<00:05:02.190> simulator

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
but spoilers it's real yeah so I just

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.520 
but spoilers it's real yeah so I just
probably<00:05:05.880> ruined<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:06.330> book<00:05:06.479> because<00:05:07.289> you

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
probably ruined the book because you

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.409 
probably ruined the book because you
find<00:05:07.890> out<00:05:08.070> in<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.250> last<00:05:08.490> couple<00:05:08.850> minutes<00:05:09.270> of

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
find out in the last couple minutes of

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.750 
find out in the last couple minutes of
the<00:05:09.479> book<00:05:09.690> oh<00:05:09.900> really<00:05:10.350> yeah<00:05:10.590> but<00:05:11.039> you<00:05:11.190> kind<00:05:11.669> of

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
the book oh really yeah but you kind of

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.090 
the book oh really yeah but you kind of
like<00:05:11.970> figure<00:05:12.780> it<00:05:12.930> out<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.590> should<00:05:13.860> at<00:05:14.070> least

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
like figure it out you should at least

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.560 
like figure it out you should at least
oh<00:05:15.440> well<00:05:16.440> that's<00:05:16.590> an<00:05:16.680> old<00:05:16.800> book<00:05:17.070> anyway<00:05:17.669> so<00:05:17.729> you

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
oh well that's an old book anyway so you

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.750 
oh well that's an old book anyway so you
have<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:18.870> collect<00:05:19.200> for<00:05:19.650> little<00:05:20.340> chips<00:05:20.580> from

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
have to collect for little chips from

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.670 
have to collect for little chips from
the<00:05:20.820> spy<00:05:21.180> drones<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.840> for<00:05:22.380> whatever<00:05:22.530> reason

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
the spy drones and for whatever reason

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.279 
the spy drones and for whatever reason
or<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:23.970> what<00:05:24.270> happens<00:05:24.570> is<00:05:24.720> it<00:05:24.900> tells<00:05:25.110> you<00:05:25.200> where

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
or so what happens is it tells you where

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.529 
or so what happens is it tells you where
the<00:05:25.320> first<00:05:25.590> three<00:05:26.010> are<00:05:26.220> those<00:05:27.150> are<00:05:27.270> kind<00:05:27.479> of

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
the first three are those are kind of

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.659 
the first three are those are kind of
easy<00:05:27.690> to<00:05:27.810> get<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.289> that<00:05:29.190> tells<00:05:29.430> you<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:29.610> have

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
easy to get and that tells you you have

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.790 
easy to get and that tells you you have
to<00:05:29.760> get<00:05:29.940> a<00:05:29.970> fourth<00:05:30.270> and<00:05:30.539> the<00:05:31.200> fourth<00:05:31.440> one<00:05:31.650> is

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
to get a fourth and the fourth one is

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.500 
to get a fourth and the fourth one is
supposed<00:05:31.950> to<00:05:32.250> like<00:05:32.700> fly<00:05:33.000> into<00:05:33.419> the<00:05:33.510> water

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
supposed to like fly into the water

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.810 
supposed to like fly into the water
mm-hmm<00:05:35.510> even<00:05:36.440> though<00:05:36.620> that<00:05:37.070> one<00:05:37.250> didn't<00:05:37.610> and

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
mm-hmm even though that one didn't and

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
exploded hmm like it didn't work or

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.530 
exploded hmm like it didn't work or
glitched<00:05:43.730> out<00:05:43.850> or<00:05:44.030> something<00:05:44.210> like<00:05:44.240> that<00:05:44.330> oh

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
glitched out or something like that oh

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.690 
glitched out or something like that oh
this<00:05:45.110> is<00:05:45.260> kind<00:05:45.410> of<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.530> cool<00:05:45.620> trick<00:05:45.920> that<00:05:46.100> I<00:05:46.280> did

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
this is kind of a cool trick that I did

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.910 
this is kind of a cool trick that I did
not<00:05:46.730> know<00:05:47.030> about<00:05:47.180> until<00:05:47.530> posting<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:48.620> videos

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
not know about until posting the videos

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.360 
not know about until posting the videos
and<00:05:49.040> I<00:05:49.100> got<00:05:49.250> some<00:05:49.370> comments<00:05:49.790> about<00:05:49.880> it<00:05:50.650> if<00:05:51.650> like

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
and I got some comments about it if like

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.670 
and I got some comments about it if like
if<00:05:52.970> you<00:05:53.180> drain<00:05:53.480> electricity<00:05:54.080> from<00:05:54.200> something

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
if you drain electricity from something

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.950 
if you drain electricity from something
mm-hmm<00:05:55.130> and<00:05:55.250> there's<00:05:55.970> no<00:05:56.120> other<00:05:56.270> electricity

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
mm-hmm and there's no other electricity

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.560 
mm-hmm and there's no other electricity
clothes<00:05:57.290> mm-hmm<00:05:57.980> you<00:05:58.580> can<00:05:58.850> charge<00:05:59.360> it

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
clothes mm-hmm you can charge it

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.590 
clothes mm-hmm you can charge it
yourself<00:06:00.290> and<00:06:00.590> then<00:06:00.830> drain<00:06:01.130> it<00:06:01.310> huh<00:06:02.000> which<00:06:02.390> it

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
yourself and then drain it huh which it

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.600 
yourself and then drain it huh which it
kind<00:06:03.200> of<00:06:03.260> doesn't<00:06:03.530> logically<00:06:04.130> make<00:06:04.310> sense

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
kind of doesn't logically make sense

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.160 
kind of doesn't logically make sense
which<00:06:04.790> is<00:06:04.910> probably<00:06:05.090> why<00:06:05.480> I<00:06:05.510> didn't<00:06:05.870> think<00:06:05.900> of

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
which is probably why I didn't think of

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.200 
which is probably why I didn't think of
it<00:06:06.260> in<00:06:06.380> the<00:06:06.440> first<00:06:06.680> place<00:06:06.770> yeah<00:06:07.280> cuz<00:06:07.640> why<00:06:07.940> can't

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
it in the first place yeah cuz why can't

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.790 
it in the first place yeah cuz why can't
just<00:06:08.390> like<00:06:08.540> shoot<00:06:09.020> yourself<00:06:09.380> in<00:06:09.470> the<00:06:09.530> foot

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
just like shoot yourself in the foot

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.300 
just like shoot yourself in the foot
literally<00:06:11.260> so<00:06:12.260> yeah<00:06:12.530> what<00:06:12.710> happened<00:06:12.830> there<00:06:13.130> is

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
literally so yeah what happened there is

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.000 
literally so yeah what happened there is
I<00:06:13.580> shot<00:06:14.390> down<00:06:14.540> another<00:06:14.750> spy<00:06:15.110> drone<00:06:15.410> flew<00:06:15.830> into

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
I shot down another spy drone flew into

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.800 
I shot down another spy drone flew into
the<00:06:16.100> water<00:06:16.280> and<00:06:16.580> then<00:06:17.030> they<00:06:17.180> say<00:06:17.360> go<00:06:17.630> kill

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
the water and then they say go kill
