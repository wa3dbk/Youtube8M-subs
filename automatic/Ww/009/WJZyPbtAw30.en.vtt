00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.490
 greetings guardians welcome to another 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.930
 destination armory video this time 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.059
 I bring a weapon that I got in the 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.390
 crete root at level 33 and I think the 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.960
 it's really a lot of game and it's a 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.710
 automatic rifle he decides what to be 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.840
 defiant abysmal 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.339
 with fire damage that is very very very well 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.160
 we will not leave without fighting for clear that 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.190
 does not have a very high impact rate 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.089
 little but you'll see what it brings because 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.920
 it improves a little bit then he what 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:41.690
 is the normal range not fusible 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.239
 automatic stability and very recharge 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.290
 very fast after weapon skills 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.850
 we have the possibility that the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.409
 projectiles mislead the brands of 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.300
 the hive that's very good when using 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.680
 the zoom this gun shoots more slowly 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.050
 to cause more damage as well as to the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.110
 southern regime and bonus to the 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.890
 accuracy when firing from the hip 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.890
 we'll see 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.589
 he shoots instinctively check 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.600
 as we talked about the trigger of the 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.409
 hip 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.000
 it causes more damage the offensive improvement 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.200
 after the punctual selection change 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.159
 the fastest and fastest death 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.710
 Perfect balance and light weight and 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.270
 ich whip is possibility that 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.090
 sun projectiles integrates the sleeves of 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.560
 the worst offensive hive and especially the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.750
 Hive switch increases the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.280
 greater damage against the hive 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.740
 improvement materials as always 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.049
 we have hero metal and the odious energy 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.349
 radiant that we will only get 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.359
 find I have here kept there are still 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:40.520
 a few little bit is not going to get me 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:44.050
 for the last but good I hope that of 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.550
 here to that then you can improve the and 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.770
 and the truth is a weapon that goes quite 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.740
 well how little I could try it 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.020
 I liked it a lot and 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.060
 it's going to give a lot of good so I hope that 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.870
 like the video a little hello and see you 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.870
