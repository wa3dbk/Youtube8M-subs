there's<00:01:49.439> people<00:01:49.740> everywhere<00:01:49.890> behind<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.880> in

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
there's people everywhere behind you in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.069 
there's people everywhere behind you in
front<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> left<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.990> right

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
front of you to the left to the right

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.929 
front of you to the left to the right
just<00:01:52.829> everywhere<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.579> got<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
just everywhere so you got to be on a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.910 
just everywhere so you got to be on a
swivel<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> whole<00:01:54.930> game<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.890> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
swivel like the whole game but I

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.530 
swivel like the whole game but I
personally<00:01:56.430> do<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:57.030> map<00:01:57.270> when

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
personally do not like this map when

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.209 
personally do not like this map when
it's<00:01:57.689> changed<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.380> when<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.770> call<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
it's changed so when you do call in the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.520 
it's changed so when you do call in the
chem<00:01:59.430> strikes<00:01:59.790> or<00:02:00.060> even<00:02:00.750> if<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.930> teammate<00:02:01.320> gets

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
chem strikes or even if a teammate gets

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.590 
chem strikes or even if a teammate gets
one<00:02:01.740> out<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.070> care<00:02:02.280> package<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.479> do

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
one out of a care package I really do

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.060 
one out of a care package I really do
not<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.140> change<00:02:04.350> map<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.890> really

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
not like to change map it's really

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.130 
not like to change map it's really
confusing<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.759> me<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
confusing to me so I just like it the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.600 
confusing to me so I just like it the
way<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.469> without<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.129> kem<00:02:08.340> strike

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
way it is without the kem strike

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.490 
way it is without the kem strike
changing<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> map<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.989> guys<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.349> played

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
changing the map the guys have played

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.140 
changing the map the guys have played
strike<00:02:10.830> zone<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.370> when<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.610> call<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.940> kem

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
strike zone and when you call in a kem

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.410 
strike zone and when you call in a kem
strike<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.629> does

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
strike it does

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.970 
strike it does
alter<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.870> map<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.349> I<00:02:14.440> personally<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:14.950> not

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
alter the map and I personally do not

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.650 
alter the map and I personally do not
like<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:16.060> let<00:02:16.270> me<00:02:16.300> know<00:02:16.360> what<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.569> guys
