00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:24.840
 I would show you today we show 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:28.230
 Expressing emotions with the help of eyes 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.699
 can and indeed in small comic now so 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.009
 it's not about really great 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.829
 sign training but just the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.540
 use of comic eyes and then 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.170
 fast a certain emotions too 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.570
 demonstrate 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.850
 I have no idea if this is to death and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.320
 but the helpful somehow totally 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.440
 Feel like that and that is actually 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.420
 So funny , just look like that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.879
 you live there we are already and what 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.230
 you see here are leg length that have 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.449
 I just thought up just now 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.030
 that's basically smileys so smileys 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.440
 faces on two legs and this one 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.239
 I would like leg lengths now 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.369
 give certain facial expressions 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.340
 and only in that one each 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.640
 certain eye couple adding catch 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.260
 Let's start with the first one in the series 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.299
 before I can show you how special 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.040
 eyes look or what special 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.479
 it is capable of provoking emotions 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.549
 Of course, first of all very helpful too 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.130
 I know how to even have eyes 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.640
 comics always draw and it always looks 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.640
 so with me I make a circle first 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.430
 Now we have painted two large circles 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:43.829
 and in this circle I'm doing now 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:44.759
 lower end still a circle in and 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.100
 then a little bit more 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.530
 I still sat down to make it more realistic 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.360
 here so constituency into it 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.770
 that is later the circle for the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.780
 Reflection of light falling on the eye 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.759
 that this the second circle mw painted 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.909
 have now simply painted 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.909
 and already 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.410
 have left with the first two link 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.390
 made my eyes richer my 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.600
 Camera has a bit of fixation 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.860
 fixation focusing problem i hope 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.150
 that settles down but you can 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.300
 Nevertheless, recognize what it is about 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.410
 So that's our first leg link with 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.850
 normal eyes 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.160
 then we take the right again 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.530
 second two left in front of that I want 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.180
 now I paint angry eyes 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.430
 want that binding angry 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.560
 looks like without me my mouth or 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.270
 Fists once looked only with his eyes and 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.850
 that gives with a little trick 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.920
 I use the eyebrows once 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.920
 So first normal eyes 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:01.540
 and then I paint here in the middle 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:08.350
 simply a v and you are with our 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.460
 left pretty sour from something like that 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.670
 does that work if you have one 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.870
 would like to paint sad binding so 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.190
 not necessarily sad but 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.710
 maybe too scared or 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.480
 desperately, however, one uses there 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.430
 the eyebrows a little bit 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.890
 different and how that I show you now 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.780
 it depends on me again 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.950
 my normal comic eyes like me 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.950
 just showed 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.940
 and instead of eyebrows like that now 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.280
 Let's make them on the left and 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:44.910
 So right off the nose edge of the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:47.040
 eyes like that and already are ours 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.260
 little binding somehow sad 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.660
 dreamy and a little bit scared 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.340
 poor so now we want where we are 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.870
 already a bit depressed left 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.180
 Of course you also have one painted 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.280
 who is in such a good mood and just like that 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.530
 laugh that his eyes are watering 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.360
 shoot and I always do that in the 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.360
 I just paint three small strokes 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.200
 these narrowed eyes 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.900
 that could be natural now 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.459
 be good it could be mourning 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.720
 that could be a lot too 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.090
 difficult employment on the 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.560
 toilet are therefore if someone 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.860
 laughs best in the case 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.870
 exceptionally still a laughing mouth 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.490
 then the whole thing looks like 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.710
 would have made him a lot more funnier 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.300
 joke, the tears, the eyes he pushed 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.520
 Close your eyes because he does it 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.440
 finds it incredibly funny or he comes 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.370
 from China 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.230
 On the other hand, if you want the 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.570
 narrowed eyes grief 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.520
 Of course you can also suggest that 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.020
 imply a reverse dog by 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.990
 then you just a very dissatisfied 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.480
 the mouth adds yes such a right 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.970
 we have a lively little binding baby 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.340
 Now here and I hate my camera 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.669
 for not being angry 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.669
 camera 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.509
 now we want the sweetest of all the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.030
 Paint service only around the world 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:13.690
 there and how that works I show you 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:20.930
 now we need something special first 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:23.569
 big eyes as beautiful far out at 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.639
 the circles and then you just want 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:29.229
 in the corner could also the other corner 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.880
 take a big light reflex rhine 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.800
 should be as equal as possible and 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.470
 right next to it a bit offset 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.539
 down to the right another small 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.400
 light reflex and everything that remains 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.690
 next to the ring light reflect you mean 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.690
 now just off 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.350
 because I'm cute 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.510
 one of our leg length is today 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.850
 unfortunately it was not quite as good yesterday 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.490
 freytag and unfortunately has a bit much 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.800
 drunk that's why we add now 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:22.790
 Eyes one closest to his condition 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:25.340
 definitely come the best eyes for 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.200
 katerstimmung yes here we still see them 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.460
 time our little wine left family 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:34.130
 the normalo the aggro binding of 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.380
 Depressed binding of the laughing binding 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.390
 the howling leg link the sugar sweetener 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.669
 binding and binding with 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.690
 katerstimmung 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.240
 I know that was not like that now 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.770
 insanely interesting is dead tutorial 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.840
 but maybe one or the other has 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.700
 yes take a small tip 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.620
 can and can now be bored in 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.810
 school or college a funny little one 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.330
 comic leg lengths in the folder of his 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.010
 sideline narrow alone has for it 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.350
 maybe the work is worth it 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.730
 you had a bit of fun is quite 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.350
 soon finally came again a video 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.090
 Unfortunately I had problems which 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.950
 upload because youtube always one 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.450
 error message has given now it works 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:13.479
 a little bit better and it comes 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:13.479
 sure soon more bite soon
