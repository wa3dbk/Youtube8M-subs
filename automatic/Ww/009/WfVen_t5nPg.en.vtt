00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.160
 hello very good to all friends of gts 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.350
 I am him his brother to the new here in the 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.670
 challenge section of call of duty where we see 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.669
 the changes that our 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.290
 favorite delivery weapons today 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.450
 we are with a sniper not very 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.460
 loved and used but that in real life 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.830
 it is known as the precision ak 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.230
 due to its great effectiveness and simplicity 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.460
 of use we go there with the dragon auto 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.970
 friends welcome to 2007 friends call of 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.690
 duty 4 first installment of modern warfare 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.460
 where the dragon op 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.489
 makes its own appearance for the first time 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.320
 in the saga with a medium high damage is the 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.300
 only sniper that we can use if 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.010
 the strength advantage violates without fear of 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.270
 do less damage since the 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.210
 damage multipliers of this 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.100
 sniper are that weird here 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.620
 we see a dragon or that kills in one go 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.030
 chest head but that does not convince like 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.460
 others like the barret r700 or m-40 3 its 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.300
 Design is quite elegant and its version 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.789
 in gold camouflage simply great 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.800
 It has a very large 10 bullet charger 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.830
 and we have more ammunition when we start 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.690
 that with the rest of snipers 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.790
 and that these details together with that 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.040
 has a very good lack and with 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.710
 a decent recharge time make 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.870
 this delivery of dra 1 the best 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.660
 version of all 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.490
 we are in black ops second time 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.610
 we see the dragon or in the multiplayer of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.940
 a call of duty and in this delivery I feel 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.920
 tell you friends that disappoints and a lot in 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.330
 first place the problem of pointing that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.800
 they have the snipers in black ops 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.640
 makes it extremely difficult 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.530
 kill without aiming continuously and in 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.210
 second place the damage of the drabono that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.970
 in this installment it is slightly lower 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.270
 to others we will only kill with one shot the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.940
 30% of the occasions which incite us 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.300
 to shoot and take our time 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.670
 usually two shots design is 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.280
 something more sober with details in wood and 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.810
 a superior view instead of the lateral 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.790
 has the least recharge time of your 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.010
 class and although we will suffer enough for 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.180
 being able to control it is one more option to 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.740
 keep in mind within 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.740
 low damage snipers 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.160
 and we got to modern warfare three friends 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.350
 this delivery where the trauma is reborn 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.180
 his ashes created in black ops for 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.550
 resurface timidly in this installment 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.240
 until a patch released in spring of 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.310
 2012 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.350
 the dragon open modern warfare 3 had 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.810
 a pretty big kick 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.300
 so point it with him and he looks at it 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.460
 did not deviate was all but a whole 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.620
 odyssey but once improved the 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.420
 recoil with such update the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.460
 dragon ops has become a great 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.720
 option if we want an assault rifle 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.180
 great damage as the m every 14 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.830
 the damage of the dragon is still low with 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.230
 with respect to the rest of snipers 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.180
 but in this delivery to the recoil and the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.560
 cadence are so good that really 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.410
 wins over their previous 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.570
 versions still does not reach the level of 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.690
 quality that has your version of call of 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.480
 duty 4 and its design is somewhat less robust 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.880
 that in other versions is to say that the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.560
 dragon is not a real pain of 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.360
 head all of you who are 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.270
 snipers you are always going to opt for 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.350
 use a barret an intervention a 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.540
 msr or any other type of 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.100
 sniper but hey there's no need 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.930
 leave it aside since it can be done 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.370
 great things with these as it can be 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.410
 watching the clips and even if they are not very 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.350
 large games can be drawn and so on 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.140
 things up here all I do not want to finish 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.760
 this before without after without introducing 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.650
 I more formally than I always do 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.870
 in a very fast way and tell you that 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.430
 I am from your brother I am a collaborator dgt 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.110
 I have a personal channel and all 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.810
 that you want to pass, I welcome you 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.910
 I invite placidly and it is easy 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.680
 through my channel to see a little bit everything 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.810
 what can you see around here 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.520
 ends this before and after 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.520
 only in people
