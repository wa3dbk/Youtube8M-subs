00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.429
 hi friends today we are going to learn to play 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.490
 give me back friends 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.590
 a classic of men that and in 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.050
 this video I'll show you the chords 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.170
 the rhythms and the tricks needed to 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.939
 play this song perfectly what 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.939
 first thing we're going to learn are the 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.380
 chords of the verse begins with a do 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.380
 sustained minor this 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.650
 this lady walks in my little friend and 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.680
 after this step to a sustained sun 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.270
 minor that is equal but a low agreement 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.270
 each finger and lifting from the heart 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.120
 returns to the lowest sustained all in 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.570
 a 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.670
 and are sustained less 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.820
 and here gives sun sustained less towards 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.820
 down drag a fret under the sun with a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.540
 minor and another one behind from below has sustained 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.080
 less 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.230
 she went with a child held sharp 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.460
 less 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.460
 I go back to step 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.380
 ah 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.380
 and domino 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.909
 and well we already have the whole chords and 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.700
 the whole progression now what we have 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.890
 what to do is touch them together 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.569
 new so that it stays fixed and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.939
 we are simply going to give once below 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.420
 for each chord we play it come 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.420
 we started 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.650
 my good friend 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:45.929
 everything is clouded my sharp 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.690
 step she left with a sharp c 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.590
 less 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.590
 step 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.890
 and when the first verse that is 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.390
 so the second one begins with it's already the same 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.390
 the same chords but with the rhythm 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.049
 and good to apply learn the rhythm 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.750
 of this second stanza we are going to put the 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.730
 chord of C sharp minor and we're going to 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.819
 relax your fingers and let's do that 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.310
 Sounds like that to us and then we're going to give 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.099
 down and when we see up we press 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.859
 the fingers to sound and now down 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.569
 again without sounding and up is saying 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.019
 they are four strokes and only the 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.019
 second vera 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.810
 easy truth what we are going to do is 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.239
 play the stanza again but this time 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.170
 with the rhythm and slowly so that 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:03:17.300
 practice this rhythm well let's go there 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:17.300
 to spend 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.870
 and well as you have seen here how are we going 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.120
 taking this pace because the steps are not 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.860
 we can do them but basically it 's 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.099
 give the same chords as we have 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.230
 done now and once we finish in the 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.310
 second stanza where we arrived then to 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.310
 chorus that are like that 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.660
 sure you know him and in the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.210
 chorus uses only four 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.750
 chords the first one is the biggest 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.860
 it came out 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.860
 good size 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.460
 again and now sustained less than 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.280
 already know between pica dust and now 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.549
 he comes so we do his and his two is worth 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.980
 pica pica and repeat again 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:30.000
 mamÃ³n and the second time we arrived like this 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:32.490
 you do and 2 2 and go back to stanza vale 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.170
 easy good I know maybe you are 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.790
 costing a bit but what are we going to 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.460
 do then is play together the 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.440
 refrain but this time learning and 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.340
 touching it with the rhythm the rhythm that 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.340
 apply is this look 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.450
 let's put the first agreed that is the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.450
 greater and we are going to give two blows down 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:08.470
 and we change my senior and we do top 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.470
 up down up up 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.940
 slowly 

00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:21.799
 here 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.150
