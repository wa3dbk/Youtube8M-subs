00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
much better just a kickstart kind of a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.330 
much better just a kickstart kind of a
jump<00:00:40.379> start<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:40.920> we're<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.219> much

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
jump start to it so we're that much

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.350
