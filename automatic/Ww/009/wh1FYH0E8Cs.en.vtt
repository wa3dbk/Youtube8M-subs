 earbuds in invoice ear appear 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.970
 quite good with obviously the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.890
 remote control and finally there is also one 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.890
 8 gigabyte micro sd 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.850
 but we take the device we don't give to 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:36.830

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:40.210
 removable we put the micro sd in the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 battery compartment ok 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.650
 as you see dual sim 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.630
 both in both sims in format 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.340

 we close the cover ok 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.890
 in the meantime, we turn on and talk to me 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.470
 some of the features of the device 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.399
 we have a 5 inch screen with 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.430
 1080 x 720 pixel resolution therefore a 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.900
 hd 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.240
 at the front we have three soft keys 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.890
 touch with 2 megapixel camera then 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.550
 definitely the 10 and 8 camera 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.250
 megapixel with LED flash microphone for the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.680
 suppression of the loudspeaker noise in 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.680
 high 3 mm jack and half micro usb port 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.710
 volume rocker at the bottom instead 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.590
 completely free with only the 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.880
 main microphone here instead on the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.340
 right we have power button stand 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.130

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.450
 as mentioned, we talk about a device 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.190
 interesting as it is a quad core 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.990
 mediatek put 65 89 from 1.2 gigahertz 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.690
 one gigabyte round then from 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.570
 enough hardware features 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.090

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.660

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.560
