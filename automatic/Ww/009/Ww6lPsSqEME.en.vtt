00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
 but should be 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.300
 Radost like that 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.300
 and the show again 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.300
 it scales neither 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.399
 make out with big ones out of the landscape 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.369
 it took Burkhalter evenings, of course, get deeper 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.529
 I go for it now in Denver is just going on 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.659
 Kicker does not turn out to be a celebration 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.320
 I can not do any coherent 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.370
 Contain contiguous areas from the center as a key below zero 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.010
 fell 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.800
 on the surfaces 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.160
 and now I'm here one click 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950
 Winter will have 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.950
 here in between stuck behind the circle 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
 now I extrude this one for real 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.120
 and she's down 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.690
 but otherwise our moat 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.680
 now make some materials on it so that a little bit counts 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.410
 in the old days the floor was supposed to be looking for 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.390
 Green or brown will have to be in the morning 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.650
 that often react 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.950
 Dr 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.530
 Button has to be all animals 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.530
 through the disclosure 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 have created new material with it we come soon 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.020
 Bodenmann 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.910
 here in the foot 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.090
 the former footballer 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.730
 Click in and look for green maybe not quite like that 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.560
 extremely green 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.960
 once again 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.960
 and makes it even darker 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.870
 Grace usually does not light up that much 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.870
 so 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.569
 I only need water we urgently 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.749
 the castle was in the field 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.749
 for that I go back to an object mode 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.539
 Shift ran 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.539
 the plans were enough in the case 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.629
 if it's just a square 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.629
 the quadrangular area 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:36.429
 push the piece down 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.289
 then I am always on materials 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.289
 added surface and new material 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.059
 but what says 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.359
 and gives the garbage the doormat 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.209
 Percent the footballers 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.209
 through the blue 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.429
 Now we are adding materials for the wall and for 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.479
 For the guests 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.519
 Ben with the right mouse button I want my wall out 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.439
 the new calls 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.889
 medium gray 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.069
 Get in the lead 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.659
 wants a man national 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.769
 Everybody does not get up to me this time - and I'm out of breath 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.769
 Montreal continues 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.039
 Belimo off 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.369
 get it now 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:50.809
 there it would be 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:53.959
 have cloned objects 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.389
 even just a tower setting all mouth 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.649
 if automatically 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.729
 the same settings 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.809
 the roofs need their own material which should be red 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.799
 but it could not be the result of that, that's it 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:12.369
 connected with the shoes 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:14.839
 here are the blues 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:17.839
 Ine's roof 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.459
 scrolls move 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.270
 center 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.270
 with old and right mouse button 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.400
 daily between 2 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.529
 So now the top of the roof is selected 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.189
 you can still switch to the perspective view 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.659
 Now Kolmer is zoomt when I roughen again and you thought 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.189

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.639
 I have to be up here with all that he only one point above 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.569
 Now is to select points Trygg mints 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.949
 right-click Munich points on the ZOW 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.479
 not all 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.449
 by selected 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.569
 Sole Mio the our farmers for our tours the forum in ZVEI the material 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.569
 for the object 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.229
 had copied the wall 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.419
 Swarm not in the case 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.169
 Sagan is pushing me here 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.529
 go often 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.139
 Datalliance blocks off 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.180
 Zolder 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.490
 created with a copy of it 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.490
 that is possible weak 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.200
 unerring 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.650
 and Stellmann proteins 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.650
 beautiful carmine or Source 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.969
 when not 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:51.449
 dark 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:52.749
 and backlog 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:54.360
 with the chosen roof 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.539
 on statements 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.960
 Now I have been the red material for the selected surfaces 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.740
 so that wheat is not too simple model 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.680
 Warburg 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.960
 for beginners 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.240
 He gave it a lot to learn he shone 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.240
 it was so rare and so bad 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.210
 interested in me 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.050
 what she thinks about it 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.710
 next year is supposed to be Real 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.110
 with 6 0 4 0 2 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.110
 those of the VR 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.680
 Thrustmaster still people 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.789
 so are themselves is not very exciting 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.129
 August in Berlin 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.189
 from Stephan had so 

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:46.280
 they are writing 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.759
 the taskforce 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.249
 Sports event Paris 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:53.240
 that is 1 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.240
