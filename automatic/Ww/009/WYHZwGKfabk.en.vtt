businesses<00:01:05.920> love<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.430> rallies<00:01:06.759> because<00:01:06.910> they

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
businesses love the rallies because they

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.270 
businesses love the rallies because they

because they barely survive during May

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.290 
because they barely survive during May
it<00:01:11.560> really<00:01:11.950> comes<00:01:12.190> down<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.460> a<00:01:12.700> color<00:01:13.030> not

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
it really comes down to a color not

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.850 
it really comes down to a color not
black<00:01:13.330> or<00:01:13.720> white<00:01:13.869> but<00:01:13.899> green<00:01:14.380> if<00:01:14.619> a<00:01:14.680> business

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
black or white but green if a business

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.260 
black or white but green if a business
is<00:01:15.100> making<00:01:15.430> money<00:01:15.580> from<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.820> rallies<00:01:16.149> they

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
is making money from the rallies they

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.999 
is making money from the rallies they
tend<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.479> like<00:01:16.660> them<00:01:16.810> if<00:01:17.110> a<00:01:17.289> business<00:01:17.470> isn't

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
tend to like them if a business isn't

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.560 
tend to like them if a business isn't
making<00:01:18.160> money<00:01:18.490> then<00:01:18.759> they<00:01:18.850> tend<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.149> shun<00:01:19.390> them

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
making money then they tend to shun them

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.270 
making money then they tend to shun them
and<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:20.080> think<00:01:20.140> what<00:01:20.500> most<00:01:20.679> businesses<00:01:20.920> have

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
and I think what most businesses have

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.889 
and I think what most businesses have
recognized<00:01:21.820> as<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.090> city<00:01:22.300> is<00:01:22.450> going<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.690> take

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.190 
the rallies obviously that's prompted a
lot<00:01:27.430> of<00:01:27.549> debate<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.060> will<00:01:28.180> continue<00:01:28.689> to<00:01:28.810> do<00:01:28.960> so

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
to a large degree and that's going to

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.140 
to a large degree and that's going to
take<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> concerted<00:02:47.070> action<00:02:47.460> not<00:02:47.700> only<00:02:48.000> with

them this is one of those issues that we

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.020 
them this is one of those issues that we

recognize that not everybody's going to

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.630 
recognize that not everybody's going to
agree<00:03:24.200> but<00:03:25.200> there<00:03:25.350> are<00:03:25.500> businesses<00:03:26.130> local

solution and I think the challenge for

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.690 
solution and I think the challenge for
us<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.510> we've<00:03:33.930> got<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.320> manage<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.800> well<00:03:35.070> not

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
us is we've got to manage this well not

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.670 
us is we've got to manage this well not
penalize<00:03:36.300> any<00:03:36.570> money<00:03:36.810> certainly<00:03:37.050> not<00:03:37.350> punish

penalize any money certainly not punish
them<00:03:37.860> unfairly<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:38.850> also<00:03:39.209> look<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.750> what

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
them unfairly but also look to what

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.780 
them unfairly but also look to what
