 go the champions for 7 part in the 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.160

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.920
 champions today 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.119
 lisandra the ice witch the tips 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.280
 of today come from the hand of eresma 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.160
 viking 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.580
 let's analyze the enemy 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.529
 we go with their strengths their damage is 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.939
 bestial ending up with a rival 1 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.890
 against 1 at certain times of the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.390
 split your skills have a lot 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.619
 adversary control can leave 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.230
 still a rival for many 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.879
 seconds with his claw is very difficult 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.010
 redeem which makes it a 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.449
 pretty sure champion serves so much 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.090
 to hunt down a rival to defend 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.790
 an ally with your skill kit 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.199
 now the weak have to approach 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.350
 a lot to get the most out of your 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.690
 skills which makes it exposed a lot 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.430
 w and definitively has a lot 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.320
 cooling so they do not have many 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.850
 tools to do harm without your 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.829
 definitive not only has damage to 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.360
 end an opponent effectively the 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.579
 damage that you can get to do stays 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.430
 pretty short at the end of the game 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.500
 finally the tips 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.820
 the ice fragments of lisandra so 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.350
 they only slow down the first goal that 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.670
 they hit but they still hurt the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.590
 that are behind it seems pretty 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.330
 obvious but online try not to 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.860
 be placed behind the subjects since 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.500
 Fragments explode 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.120
 quite more distance all the lists 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.860
 they will try to punish our last 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.090
 blows with ice shards think 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.460
 that to dodge them and even 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.570
 punish him back it's true that the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.640
 Claw is a very good skill for 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.590
 escape but it has its weaknesses is 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.330
 you have a knockout a silence or a stud 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.760
 try to use the mind be it use its claw 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.680
 since that way you will not be able to use it again 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.300
 sukkur will always have it but its 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.710
 frost ring not always what 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.440
 use in the wrong way try 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.759
 punish the since it does not have so much damage 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.619
 lisandra has one of the best 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.600
 skills to hunt rivals we will put 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.910
 wards to know where it moves and so 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.830
 prevent it kills our allies that 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.930
 we will play against lisandro the air the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.450
 medium will be by the target distance for its 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.830
 endurance and ropes so it sure has 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.930
 the top anything that cut the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.170
 claw is good so it will be bad cai and 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.430
