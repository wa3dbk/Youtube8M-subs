mud if the mother is exposed and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.090 
mud if the mother is exposed and
contracts<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.689> disease<00:01:27.719> then<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.829> can

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
contracts the disease then it can

transfer to the fetus all right and the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.910 
transfer to the fetus all right and the
way<00:01:32.070> issue<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:33.149> is<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.140> no<00:01:34.439> reason<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
way issue here is there is no reason to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.779 
way issue here is there is no reason to
