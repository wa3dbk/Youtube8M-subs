 in total 310 km 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.179
 eight high speed sections 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.800
 three slow curves 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.689
 two are the ideal ones to launch 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.169
 maximum speed 297 kilometers per hour 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.779
 we started the round here in the Malaysian Grand Prix with the simulator of 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.579
 formula one of renault with a long straight in the front of the circuit 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:34.610
 very very broad 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.530
 we brake hard at the first corner 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.500
 with a lot of grip while entering the first turn immediately after 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.290
 curve 1 we enter the second one that is a closed fork comes from 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.620
 lefts and embassies 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.480
 we accelerate decisively from there until we reach a long fault of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.470
 right we enter the fernando rise very strong for a right curve 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.570
 very closed that is a good place to overtake 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.750
 where it is important to get a good exit speed 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.360
 we enter a fast curve of the left and immediately a right 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.550
 which is very hard for the car because it is incredibly fast 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.180
 happening with some linked of rights that were made a little the vertex 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.460
 we accelerated strongly when leaving there 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.160
 entering turn 9 which is almost a huge stop 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.250
 the attraction in your life that always problematic to get out of here 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.390
 we move away accelerating to enter the truly difficult area of ​​the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.390
 track with long and open bumpy curves 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.240
 through a brief with a very fast left and then a combination 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.850
 complicated to do anything and enter the penultimate turn curve 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.140
 the pilot can relax a bit in this long straight in the back 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.130
 of the circuit 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.110
 with a fantastic grandstand on the left side before the aforementioned 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.850
 strongly for the last turn 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.060
 what is a very closed hairpin currently the best point for forward 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.150
 It is very important to dine with decision but we need a perfect outlet 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.070
