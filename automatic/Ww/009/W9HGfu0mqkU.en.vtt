00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.969 
to all of the apps so that's something
to<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.960> careful<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.619> then

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
to be very very careful of and then

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.249 
to be very very careful of and then
finally<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.549> there's<00:01:35.820> something<00:01:36.180> called<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
finally there there's something called a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.319 
finally there there's something called a
resistive<00:01:38.100> touch<00:01:38.369> screen<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.729> lot<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
resistive touch screen a lot of the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.499 
resistive touch screen a lot of the
cheaper<00:01:39.630> tablets<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.350> say<00:01:40.729> it<00:01:41.729> required<00:01:42.210> it

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
cheaper tablets just say it required it

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.420 
cheaper tablets just say it required it
has<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> resistive<00:01:43.439> touch<00:01:43.619> screen<00:01:43.890> which<00:01:44.310> is

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
has a resistive touch screen which is

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.800 
has a resistive touch screen which is
you<00:01:44.670> mean<00:01:44.909> which<00:01:45.180> means<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.509> actually<00:01:45.630> have

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
you mean which means you actually have

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.840 
you mean which means you actually have
to<00:01:46.020> press<00:01:46.259> harder<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.920> order<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
to press harder in order for it to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.420 
to press harder in order for it to
respond<00:01:48.509> why<00:01:49.020> would<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.409> why<00:01:49.950> would<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.159> want

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
respond why would you why would you want

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.950 
respond why would you why would you want
a<00:01:50.640> resistive<00:01:51.149> touch<00:01:51.299> screen<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
a resistive touch screen and that's the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.480 
a resistive touch screen and that's the
thing<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.140> actually<00:01:52.530> don't<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.340> is

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
thing you actually don't want it it is

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.950 
thing you actually don't want it it is
frustrating<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.180> use<00:01:54.479> they<00:01:54.720> yeah

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
frustrating to use they yeah

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.620 
frustrating to use they yeah
manufacturers<00:01:55.799> use<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.000> it's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
manufacturers use it because it's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.929 
manufacturers use it because it's
cheaper<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.890> that's<00:01:59.070> how<00:01:59.219> they<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.549> put

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
cheaper and so that's how they can put

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.300 
cheaper and so that's how they can put
it<00:02:00.060> under<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> sub<00:02:00.509> 100<00:02:00.869> price<00:02:00.990> points<00:02:01.380> okay<00:02:01.710> -

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it under the sub 100 price points okay -

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.590 
it under the sub 100 price points okay -
so<00:02:02.549> I've<00:02:02.759> got<00:02:02.790> my<00:02:03.030> three<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.509> I'm

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
so I've got my three that I'm

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.300 
so I've got my three that I'm
recommending<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:04.229> terms<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.530> okay<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.219> you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
recommending in terms of okay and you

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.920 
recommending in terms of okay and you
brought<00:02:05.490> them<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.850> brought<00:02:06.090> them<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.360> yes<00:02:06.600> let's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
brought them I brought them so yes let's

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.419 
brought them I brought them so yes let's
hold<00:02:07.110> them<00:02:07.200> up<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> today<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.039> can't<00:02:08.250> read<00:02:08.340> their

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
hold them up to today I can't read their

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.410 
hold them up to today I can't read their
spoke<00:02:08.640> can't<00:02:08.819> see<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.090> we're<00:02:09.179> talking<00:02:09.390> about
