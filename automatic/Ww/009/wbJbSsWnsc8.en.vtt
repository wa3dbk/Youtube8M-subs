00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.160 
for those for those teachers who may not
have<00:01:44.610> looked<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.329> these<00:01:45.479> kind<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.930> games

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
have looked at these kind of games

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.620 
have looked at these kind of games
before<00:01:46.549> there's<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.640> series<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.149> games<00:01:48.509> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
before there's a series of games that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.990 
before there's a series of games that
require<00:01:49.110> our<00:01:49.409> larger<00:01:50.070> group<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.460> smaller

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
require our larger group and smaller

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.910 
require our larger group and smaller
group<00:01:51.240> improvisation<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.799> it's

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
group improvisation and I think it's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.260 
group improvisation and I think it's
sometimes<00:01:53.130> really<00:01:53.670> great<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.149> be

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
sometimes really great to just be

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.899 
sometimes really great to just be
reminded<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.229> how<00:01:55.619> much<00:01:55.770> fun<00:01:56.100> these<00:01:56.310> games<00:01:56.670> can

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
reminded of how much fun these games can

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.450 
reminded of how much fun these games can
be<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.329> how<00:01:57.750> much<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:59.040> really

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
be and how much they can be really

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.060 
be and how much they can be really
useful<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.909> teach<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.509> idea<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.229> accepting

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
useful to teach that idea of accepting

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.789 
useful to teach that idea of accepting
offers<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:03.240> idea<00:02:03.570> behind<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.990> DVD<00:02:04.469> was<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
offers the idea behind this DVD was to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.709 
offers the idea behind this DVD was to
give<00:02:04.950> teachers<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.340> practical<00:02:06.030> demonstration

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
give teachers a practical demonstration

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.660 
give teachers a practical demonstration
on<00:02:07.020> how<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.259> play<00:02:07.560> games<00:02:07.829> because<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.250> know<00:02:08.310> how

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
on how to play games because I know how

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.620 
on how to play games because I know how
hard<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.270> read<00:02:09.660> them<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.080> a

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
hard it is to read them in a

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.210 
hard it is to read them in a
sometimes<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.530> hope<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.800> find<00:02:11.950> them<00:02:12.160> useful

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
sometimes so I hope you find them useful

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.130 
sometimes so I hope you find them useful
I<00:02:12.700> think<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:13.180> there's<00:02:13.360> some<00:02:13.480> great<00:02:13.720> stuff<00:02:13.990> in

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
I think that there's some great stuff in

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.780 
I think that there's some great stuff in
there<00:02:14.320> stuff<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:15.040> I've<00:02:15.130> been<00:02:15.280> using<00:02:15.490> for<00:02:15.640> the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
there stuff that I've been using for the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.010 
there stuff that I've been using for the
last<00:02:15.880> 10<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.360> 15<00:02:16.480> years<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.380> hope<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.710> enjoy
