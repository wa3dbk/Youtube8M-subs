of the display and allows me to type and

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.510 
of the display and allows me to type and
interact<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.140> more<00:00:44.129> natural<00:00:44.730> way<00:00:46.370> like<00:00:47.370> you

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
interact in a more natural way like you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.889 
interact in a more natural way like you
would<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> physical<00:00:49.200> keyboard<00:00:49.879> so

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
would on a with a physical keyboard so

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.720 
would on a with a physical keyboard so
what<00:00:51.899> sort<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.110> applications<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:53.160> your

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
what sort of applications you see your

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.299 
what sort of applications you see your
overlay<00:00:54.329> being<00:00:54.570> used<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:55.129> sure<00:00:56.129> well

certainly<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.120> really<00:00:57.719> describe

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
certainly you know we really describe

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.049 
certainly you know we really describe
this<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.620> tool<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.160> provide<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.760> device

this as a tool that we provide to device

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.209 
this as a tool that we provide to device
manufacturers<00:01:00.780> they<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.469> implement<00:01:01.770> this

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
manufacturers they can implement this

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.219 
manufacturers they can implement this
dynamic<00:01:02.820> surface<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.719> sorts<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
dynamic surface and all sorts of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.690 
dynamic surface and all sorts of
different<00:01:04.530> ways<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.519> we're<00:01:05.670> showing

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
different ways I'm here we're showing

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
different ways I'm here we're showing
the<00:01:06.030> keyboard<00:01:06.570> QWERTY<00:01:06.869> keyboard<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.770> can

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the keyboard QWERTY keyboard but you can

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.880 
the keyboard QWERTY keyboard but you can
imagine<00:01:08.040> gaming<00:01:08.640> controls<00:01:09.060> dial<00:01:09.450> pad<00:01:09.890> really

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
imagine gaming controls dial pad really

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.890 
imagine gaming controls dial pad really
any<00:01:11.250> layout<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.060> they<00:01:12.180> want<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.630> on

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
any layout that they want to have on

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.770 
any layout that they want to have on
this<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.920> surface<00:01:14.299> but<00:01:15.299> certainly<00:01:15.689> in

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this on the surface but certainly in

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.420 
this on the surface but certainly in
terms<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.080> form<00:01:16.290> factor<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.680> think<00:01:16.710> tablet<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
terms of form factor we think tablet is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.510 
terms of form factor we think tablet is
a<00:01:17.759> really<00:01:18.180> great<00:01:18.420> market<00:01:19.350> very<00:01:20.310> little

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
a really great market very little

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.130 
a really great market very little
differentiate<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.360> would<00:01:21.479> say<00:01:21.600> today<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
differentiate and I would say today and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.620 
differentiate and I would say today and
in<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.619> space<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.330> they're<00:01:24.479> going

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
in that space you know they're going

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.350 
in that space you know they're going
thinner<00:01:25.280> going<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> little<00:01:26.430> bit<00:01:26.610> lighter<00:01:26.850> but

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
thinner going a little bit lighter but

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.200 
thinner going a little bit lighter but
you<00:01:28.110> know<00:01:28.229> there's<00:01:28.710> only<00:01:28.860> only<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.640> compelling

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
you know there's only only so compelling

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.569 
you know there's only only so compelling
that<00:01:30.390> those

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
that those

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.880 
that those
can<00:01:32.579> become<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.380> adding

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
can become so we think really adding

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.859 
can become so we think really adding
this<00:01:34.979> dynamic<00:01:35.520> layer<00:01:35.729> dynamic<00:01:36.479> surface

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
this dynamic layer dynamic surface

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.710 
this dynamic layer dynamic surface
technology<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.770> improving<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.759> interfaces

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
technology and improving the interfaces

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.590 
technology and improving the interfaces
as<00:01:40.229> interesting<00:01:41.070> place<00:01:41.310> okay<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.450> course

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
as interesting place okay so of course

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.609 
as interesting place okay so of course
the<00:01:42.869> first<00:01:42.899> thing<00:01:43.200> people<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the first thing people are going to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.760 
the first thing people are going to
wonder<00:01:43.710> about<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.280> durability<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:46.020> after

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
wonder about the durability of the after

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.800 
wonder about the durability of the after
of<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.130> panel<00:01:47.369> itself<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:48.600> talked<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
of the panel itself so and we talked a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.179 
of the panel itself so and we talked a
little<00:01:48.930> bit<00:01:49.079> about<00:01:49.200> some<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.009> testing

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
little bit about some of the testing

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.260 
little bit about some of the testing
you've<00:01:50.430> done<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:50.880> maybe<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.149> could

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
you've done so if maybe you could

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.209 
you've done so if maybe you could
explain<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.630> yeah<00:01:51.869> sure<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.470> we<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> full

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.899 

rehabilitation<00:01:56.219> facilities<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
rehabilitation facilities and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.389 
rehabilitation facilities and
characterization<00:01:57.570> lab<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> lot<00:01:59.369> of

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
characterization lab so we do a lot of

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.300 
characterization lab so we do a lot of
testing<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:01.649> make<00:02:01.799> sure<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.189> it's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
testing on this to make sure that it's

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.310 
testing on this to make sure that it's
going<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.549> very<00:02:02.700> robust<00:02:03.149> visit<00:02:04.020> cycle

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
going to be very robust visit cycle

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.590

testing<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.159> keys<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.670> us<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.390> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
testing is one of the keys for us it's a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.199 
testing is one of the keys for us it's a
unique<00:02:07.079> test<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:08.039> our<00:02:08.069> type<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.459> technology

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
unique test for our type of technology

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.270 
unique test for our type of technology
that<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:10.080> don't<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.440> either<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.979> keyboard

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
that you don't have either on a keyboard

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.130 
that you don't have either on a keyboard
you<00:02:11.730> know

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
you know

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.440 
you know
on<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.290> standard<00:02:12.560> touchscreen<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:14.270> we're

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
on a standard touchscreen so and we're

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.080 
on a standard touchscreen so and we're
seeing<00:02:14.660> very<00:02:14.870> good<00:02:14.930> results<00:02:15.530> many<00:02:16.070> years<00:02:16.400> life

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
seeing very good results many years life

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.820 
seeing very good results many years life
on<00:02:17.330> this<00:02:17.570> we<00:02:17.960> tested<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:18.830> failure<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:20.530> I'm<00:02:21.530> very

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
on this we tested a failure and I'm very

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.620 
on this we tested a failure and I'm very
happy<00:02:22.010> with<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> results<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:22.910> far<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.360> have

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
happy with the results so far and have

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.000 
happy with the results so far and have
what<00:02:23.750> impact<00:02:24.050> on<00:02:24.170> battery<00:02:24.290> life<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:24.770> the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
what impact on battery life so the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.830 
what impact on battery life so the
device<00:02:25.340> yeah<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.030> what's<00:02:26.270> interesting<00:02:26.450> is

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
device yeah so what's interesting is

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.510 
device yeah so what's interesting is
this<00:02:26.960> is<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.110> bi-stable<00:02:27.590> system<00:02:28.100> meaning<00:02:28.430> that

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
this is a bi-stable system meaning that

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.730 
this is a bi-stable system meaning that
once<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.030> buttons<00:02:29.330> are<00:02:29.450> activated<00:02:30.080> for<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
once the buttons are activated for the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.990 
once the buttons are activated for the
less<00:02:30.920> than<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.160> second<00:02:31.490> that<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.670> takes<00:02:31.820> to

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
less than a second that it takes to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.370 
less than a second that it takes to
bring<00:02:32.120> those<00:02:32.300> up<00:02:32.450> that's<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.750> only<00:02:32.780> time<00:02:33.350> that

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
bring those up that's the only time that

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.860 
bring those up that's the only time that
the<00:02:33.920> power<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.610> actually<00:02:34.730> being<00:02:35.030> consumed<00:02:35.450> for

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
the power is actually being consumed for

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.420 
the power is actually being consumed for
example<00:02:36.200> right<00:02:36.380> now<00:02:36.410> there's<00:02:36.770> no<00:02:36.950> additional

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
example right now there's no additional

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.360 
example right now there's no additional
power<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.880> maintain<00:02:38.270> this<00:02:38.510> state<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:39.410> very

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
power to maintain this state so very

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.990 
power to maintain this state so very
efficient<00:02:40.910> very<00:02:41.090> little<00:02:42.080> less<00:02:42.410> than<00:02:42.620> 1%<00:02:43.370> far

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
efficient very little less than 1% far

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.840 
efficient very little less than 1% far
less<00:02:44.150> than<00:02:44.180> 1%<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.959> daily<00:02:45.860> use<00:02:45.890> all<00:02:46.580> right<00:02:46.760> hey

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
less than 1% of daily use all right hey

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.580 
less than 1% of daily use all right hey
thank<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.180> very<00:02:47.300> much<00:02:47.450> again<00:02:47.630> this<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.080> Shana
