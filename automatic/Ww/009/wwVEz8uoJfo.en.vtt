involves<00:00:26.180> a<00:00:26.329> few<00:00:26.540> simple<00:00:26.810> tools<00:00:26.989> and<00:00:27.470> this<00:00:27.860> is

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
involves a few simple tools and this is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.470 
involves a few simple tools and this is
awesome<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:28.400> really<00:00:28.550> speed<00:00:28.759> up<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:28.939> process

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
awesome to really speed up the process

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
or just totally neglect their hydraulic

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.880 
or just totally neglect their hydraulic
clutch<00:00:34.700> it<00:00:35.630> doesn't<00:00:35.899> matter<00:00:36.020> what<00:00:36.530> model<00:00:36.860> you

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
clutch it doesn't matter what model you

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.979 
clutch it doesn't matter what model you
have<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.880> principles<00:00:38.469> are<00:00:39.469> the<00:00:39.590> same<00:00:39.910> so<00:00:40.989> you

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
have the principles are the same so you

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.720 
have the principles are the same so you
can<00:00:42.140> use<00:00:42.260> one<00:00:42.469> of<00:00:42.500> two<00:00:42.620> methods<00:00:42.920> you<00:00:43.430> could

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
can use one of two methods you could

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.729 
can use one of two methods you could
either<00:00:43.940> work<00:00:44.660> from<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:44.960> top<00:00:44.989> down<00:00:45.170> and

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
either work from the top down and

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.880 
either work from the top down and
basically<00:00:46.550> what<00:00:46.850> you're<00:00:46.969> going<00:00:47.149> to<00:00:47.210> use<00:00:47.449> is

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
basically what you're going to use is

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.630 
basically what you're going to use is
your<00:00:48.890> good<00:00:49.399> old<00:00:49.519> friend<00:00:49.760> gravity<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:50.420> help<00:00:50.719> and

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
your good old friend gravity to help and

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.669 
your good old friend gravity to help and
let<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.789> fluid<00:00:53.000> actually<00:00:53.269> flow<00:00:53.750> from<00:00:54.109> the<00:00:54.469> top

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
let the fluid actually flow from the top

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.360 
let the fluid actually flow from the top
to<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.829> bottom

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
to the bottom

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.979 
to the bottom
or<00:00:55.850> what<00:00:56.089> a<00:00:56.120> lot<00:00:56.269> of<00:00:56.359> people<00:00:56.570> do<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:56.839> they'll

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
or what a lot of people do is they'll

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.200 
or what a lot of people do is they'll
just<00:00:57.170> suck<00:00:58.070> it<00:00:58.190> all<00:00:58.309> out<00:00:58.519> or<00:00:58.820> just<00:00:58.850> let<00:00:59.120> it

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
just suck it all out or just let it

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.910 
just suck it all out or just let it
drain<00:00:59.359> out<00:00:59.539> and<00:00:59.809> then<00:00:59.989> use<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:00.199> syringe<00:01:00.620> and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
drain out and then use a syringe and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.540 
drain out and then use a syringe and
then<00:01:01.039> push<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.089> fluid<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:03.220> along<00:01:04.220> with<00:01:04.400> it

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
then push the fluid and along with it

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.030 
then push the fluid and along with it
all<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.820> air<00:01:04.940> out<00:01:04.970> through<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.480> top<00:01:05.830> both<00:01:06.830> are

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
all the air out through the top both are

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.710 
all the air out through the top both are

going to do is make sure that our master
cylinder<00:02:34.780> is<00:02:35.230> full<00:02:36.570> check<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:39.010> a

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
cylinder is full check it's just a

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.610 
cylinder is full check it's just a
little<00:02:39.430> down<00:02:39.550> but<00:02:39.760> that's<00:02:39.910> no<00:02:40.060> worries<00:02:40.360> but<00:02:40.630> so

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
little down but that's no worries but so

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.660 
little down but that's no worries but so
we<00:02:41.710> need<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.920> do<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.340> take<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:43.080> crack<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.670> so

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
we need to do is take in crack this so

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.270 
we need to do is take in crack this so
as<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.940> do<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.050> you<00:02:47.140> could<00:02:47.260> see<00:02:47.890> fluid

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
as you do is so you could see fluid

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.560 
as you do is so you could see fluid
starting<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.610> come<00:02:48.730> out<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:49.209> that's<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.450> good

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
starting to come out so that's a good

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.750 
starting to come out so that's a good
sign<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.170> as<00:02:50.770> they<00:02:50.980> usually<00:02:51.100> sometimes<00:02:51.430> it

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
sign so as they usually sometimes it

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.170 
sign so as they usually sometimes it
takes<00:02:51.940> two<00:02:52.270> terms<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.990> get<00:02:53.140> gallon<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:55.000> then

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
takes two terms to get gallon and then

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.580 
takes two terms to get gallon and then
what<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.450> do<00:02:55.600> is<00:02:55.720> come<00:02:55.900> up<00:02:55.930> here<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.500> watch

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
what to do is come up here and watch

little trick makes it quick and easy
using<00:03:55.239> our<00:03:55.390> friend<00:03:55.630> gravity<00:03:55.840> here<00:03:56.260> make<00:03:56.500> make

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
using our friend gravity here make make

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.250 
using our friend gravity here make make
it<00:03:56.950> quick

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
it quick

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.340 
it quick
so<00:03:59.260> that's<00:03:59.410> good<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:01.150> this<00:04:01.330> one<00:04:01.510> might<00:04:01.750> take
