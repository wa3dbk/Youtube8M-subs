time<00:02:58.180> here's<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.840> 49cc<00:02:59.410> part<00:02:59.860> if<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.730> ever<00:03:00.880> get

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
time here's a 49cc part if you ever get

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.990 
time here's a 49cc part if you ever get
the<00:03:01.209> bike<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.200> looks<00:03:02.320> like<00:03:02.380> I'm<00:03:02.590> right<00:03:02.709> here

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
the bike so it looks like I'm right here

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.410 
the bike so it looks like I'm right here
and<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.590> think<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.830> come<00:03:06.010> right<00:03:06.190> here<00:03:06.459> I'm

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
and I think you come right here I'm

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.920 
and I think you come right here I'm
pretty<00:03:08.290> sure<00:03:09.030> that's<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.239> governor<00:03:10.690> part

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
pretty sure that's the governor part

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.680 
pretty sure that's the governor part
right<00:03:11.110> there<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.350> think<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:13.000> little<00:03:13.180> screws

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
right there I think that little screws

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.350 
right there I think that little screws
you<00:03:14.140> can<00:03:14.290> see<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:14.709> silver<00:03:14.980> part<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.640> think

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
you can see that silver part I think

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.140 
you can see that silver part I think
that's<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.930> governor<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:18.519> just<00:03:18.820> threw<00:03:19.030> that

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
that's the governor you just threw that

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.310 
that's the governor you just threw that
in<00:03:19.360> there<00:03:21.299> um<00:03:22.299> yeah<00:03:22.870> like<00:03:23.049> right<00:03:23.200> there<00:03:23.440> I

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
in there um yeah like right there I

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.039 
in there um yeah like right there I
think<00:03:26.320> that's<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.530> governor<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.930> once<00:03:28.930> you

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
think that's the governor and once you

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.910 
think that's the governor and once you
do<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.820> goes<00:03:30.820> 47<00:03:31.830> XP<00:03:33.840> after<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:35.049> you<00:03:35.739> want

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
do that goes 47 XP after that you want

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
and it will go like really really fast

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.380 
and it will go like really really fast
twice<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:50.170> speed<00:03:50.440> of<00:03:50.620> 47<00:03:51.160> like<00:03:51.610> 60<00:03:52.180> miles

twice the speed of 47 like 60 miles

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.699 
twice the speed of 47 like 60 miles
maybe<00:03:52.690> four<00:03:53.049> hour<00:03:53.140> or<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.810> if<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.260> can't<00:03:56.500> find
