if you are familiar with the Cibola is
I've<00:00:49.570> removed<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.500> pinpoint<00:00:50.950> button<00:00:51.340> and

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
I've removed the pinpoint button and

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.880 
I've removed the pinpoint button and
installed<00:00:52.060> a<00:00:52.270> ten<00:00:52.630> turn<00:00:52.900> ground<00:00:53.590> balance

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
installed a ten turn ground balance

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.840 
installed a ten turn ground balance
control<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:56.550> I've<00:00:57.550> installed<00:00:57.970> a<00:00:59.730> lot<00:01:00.730> of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
control and I've installed a lot of

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.330 
control and I've installed a lot of
toggle<00:01:01.060> trigger<00:01:01.780> switch<00:01:02.110> here<00:01:02.410> to<00:01:03.070> switch

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
from all metal to discriminate and I've

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.200 
from all metal to discriminate and I've
also<00:01:08.049> added<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:10.259> volume<00:01:11.259> control<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.939> at<00:01:13.119> the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
also added a volume control and at the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.630 
also added a volume control and at the
butt<00:01:13.359> end<00:01:13.570> here<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.590> don't<00:01:14.859> blow<00:01:15.249> my<00:01:15.429> ears

up so I could have some clean ground to

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.849 
up so I could have some clean ground to
test<00:01:47.469> in<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.590> what<00:01:50.799> I<00:01:50.829> do<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.039> I<00:01:51.340> take<00:01:51.850> my<00:01:52.859> since

this is a modded unit this is not going
to<00:01:56.259> apply<00:01:56.439> to<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:57.329> standard<00:01:58.329> Cibola<00:01:59.369> but<00:02:00.369> what

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
to apply to the standard Cibola but what

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.209 
to apply to the standard Cibola but what
i<00:02:00.880> did<00:02:01.119> is<00:02:01.270> i<00:02:01.359> just<00:02:01.389> switched<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:01.959> all<00:02:02.859> metal

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
i did is i just switched it to all metal

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.870 
i did is i just switched it to all metal
and<00:02:03.389> I<00:02:04.389> just<00:02:04.600> advanced<00:02:04.929> the<00:02:05.079> control

and I just ground balance until I get a

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.190
