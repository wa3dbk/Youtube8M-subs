raise they were gonna do about eight to
ten<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.670> these<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.410> bought<00:00:13.920> these<00:00:14.719> for<00:00:15.719> a

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
ten of these and so I bought these for a

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.880 
ten of these and so I bought these for a
hundred<00:00:17.190> bucks<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> pair<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:19.680> had

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
hundred bucks for the pair and I had

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.830 
hundred bucks for the pair and I had
somebody<00:00:20.220> else<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:21.029> was<00:00:21.150> trying<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.570> design

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
somebody else that was trying to design

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.470 
somebody else that was trying to design
a<00:00:21.900> three-way<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.560> these<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.910> off<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.240> mat<00:00:24.449> a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
a three-way with these and off the mat a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.970 
a three-way with these and off the mat a
sound<00:00:24.869> bulletin<00:00:25.529> board

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.490 
sound bulletin board
I<00:00:26.250> bought<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.539> equivalent<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.109> about<00:00:28.289> two

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
I bought the equivalent of about two

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.769 
I bought the equivalent of about two
thousand<00:00:29.429> dollars<00:00:29.490> worth<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.119> drivers<00:00:30.599> for

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
thousand dollars worth of drivers for

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.160 
thousand dollars worth of drivers for
300<00:00:31.289> bucks

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
300 bucks

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.900 
300 bucks
these<00:00:34.170> would<00:00:34.559> retail<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.399> neighborhood

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
these would retail in the neighborhood

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.750 
these would retail in the neighborhood
of<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.180> 40<00:00:36.600> apiece<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.559> these<00:00:38.070> about<00:00:38.399> 200

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
of to 40 apiece and these about 200

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.100 
of to 40 apiece and these about 200
except<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> would<00:00:42.210> probably<00:00:42.809> cost<00:00:42.960> me

laminated with construction e.t.c to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.200 
laminated with construction e.t.c to
build<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> most<00:01:07.470> inner<00:01:08.040> cabinet<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.700> can

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.990 

Clank<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> concrete<00:01:13.260> brick<00:01:13.970> what<00:01:14.970> I

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
Clank I like a concrete brick what I

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.390 
Clank I like a concrete brick what I
have<00:01:15.210> found<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.869> my<00:01:16.409> speaker<00:01:16.680> design<00:01:16.950> more

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
have found is my speaker design more

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.480 
have found is my speaker design more
inert<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> cabinet<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.710> no<00:01:19.860> coloration

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
inert the cabinet you get no coloration

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.969 
inert the cabinet you get no coloration
to<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.880> driver<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.080> whatever<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to the driver so you get whatever the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.300 
to the driver so you get whatever the
driver<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.880> itself<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:25.130> just<00:01:26.130> some

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
driver can do in itself and just some

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.429 
driver can do in itself and just some
information<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.939> ceramic<00:01:27.479> comes<00:01:27.720> there

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
information on ceramic comes there

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
information on ceramic comes there
one-third<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.070> weight<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:30.000> silk<00:01:30.240> dome

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
one-third the weight of a silk dome

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.039 
one-third the weight of a silk dome
tweeter

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
tweeter

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.450 
tweeter
so<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.640> get<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.299> rise<00:01:33.810> time<00:01:34.460> approaching

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
so you get the rise time approaching

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.770 
so you get the rise time approaching
that<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.869> electrostatic<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.450> they<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.600> quite

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that of electrostatic so they are quite

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.190 
that of electrostatic so they are quite
fast<00:01:40.229> very<00:01:40.619> detailed<00:01:41.299> if<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.479> look<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:42.930> any<00:01:43.110> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
fast very detailed if you look at any of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
fast very detailed if you look at any of
the<00:01:43.259> top<00:01:43.470> end<00:01:43.770> speakers<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> world<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.880> see

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the top end speakers in the world to see

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.889 
the top end speakers in the world to see
a<00:01:45.060> lot<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.450> packet<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.500> drivers<00:01:46.920> out<00:01:47.130> there<00:01:47.369> so

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
a lot of packet on drivers out there so

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.539 
a lot of packet on drivers out there so
they<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:48.960> pretty<00:01:49.229> well<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.829> their<00:01:50.040> for

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
they do pretty well for their for

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.999 
they do pretty well for their for
science<00:01:50.880> how<00:01:51.030> old<00:01:51.270> are<00:01:51.360> these<00:01:51.479> tweeters<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
science how old are these tweeters the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:04.399 
science how old are these tweeters the
tweeters<00:01:53.430> are<00:01:53.670> probably<00:01:54.479> 18<00:01:55.409> years<00:01:55.439> old<00:02:03.409> but

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
tweeters are probably 18 years old but

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.649 
tweeters are probably 18 years old but
yeah<00:02:05.040> these<00:02:05.219> were<00:02:05.490> eight<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:05.969> there<00:02:06.390> they're

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
yeah these were eight on there they're

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.700 
yeah these were eight on there they're
all<00:02:06.780> six<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.290> them

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
all six of them

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.590 
all six of them
let's<00:02:08.039> put<00:02:08.250> out

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.840 

no<00:02:14.600> no<00:02:14.930> is<00:02:15.230> well<00:02:16.690> see<00:02:17.690> how<00:02:17.720> deep<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.850> so

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
no no is well see how deep it is so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.820 
no no is well see how deep it is so
you're<00:02:20.120> building<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.480> lot<00:02:20.660> more<00:02:20.930> spacing<00:02:21.740> there

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
you're building a lot more spacing there

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.120 
you're building a lot more spacing there
and<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> ported<00:02:22.819> design
