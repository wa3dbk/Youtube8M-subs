unique<00:01:33.150> thing<00:01:33.509> between<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.049> Dallas<00:01:34.320> Stars

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409

unique thing between the Dallas Stars
the<00:01:35.009> Minnesota<00:01:35.340> Wild<00:01:35.490> well<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.509> think<00:01:36.930> fans

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the Minnesota Wild well I think fans

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.840
