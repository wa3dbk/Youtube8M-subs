 It 's not the place on the booklet so the fire is gone, so I can do it anew 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.180
 If you can't collect items properly 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.760

 1 Anyway I was allowed to spawn away from the gust 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.010
 Because there were two fortresses near the spawn point , I made a way with the excess cobble stone 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.189
 The 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.189

 The sudden chest of the day 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.180
 Because there was a diamond in it and it was in the back side, let's start looking from there 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.530
 Suddenly this can be expected 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:32.200

 I have found Blazesponner so I can control it 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.030

 It's an ordinary lucky box 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.470
 Wow ah ah

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.790
 Record kiter 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.790
 Let's ask a little 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.509
 me 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:37.250
 Yes there was a discovery 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.250
 Experience Uhouho Kitakore 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:46.269
 What is the contents of the chest? 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:48.629
 Why there are so many horseshoes so half of the chest is filled with good horses 

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:48.629
 I will 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.330
 The recording file ended here 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:02.560
 Why go bought 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.560

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.230
 aname 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:24.770
 I lost all the contents of the tory chest I got 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:35.510
 The cause was trying to go to the multiplayer, I entered the world in the usual song 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:40.250
 It is the plight of so the error 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:44.200
 It is no bother to stop here in the play-by-play for the future by say 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:51.190
 I think that I decided to the audience 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:54.090
 Give 1 diamond 11 children and start again with diamond 11 that lucky box 5 pieces 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.090
 Grant and restart 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:02.469
 Time loss is avoided because it is bad that the store of the movie is slower than that of the movie shop 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.469
 is 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.910
