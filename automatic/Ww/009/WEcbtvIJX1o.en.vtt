00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.620
 the ingredients for this salad are 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.800
 a medium celery medium mango sprig 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.260
 half a red apple a cucumber sugar 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.270
 taste salt to taste four drops of 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.279
 extra virgin olive oil and medium 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.770
 small lemon if the fourth is large 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.320
 part the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.690
 filming ar or let's put as in 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.369
 hatch all the ingredients like 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.500
 you can see me I love more 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.460
 this presentation since it gives them a touch 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.530
 as a restaurant food of all 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.440
 the restaurants that I mostly 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.780
 they have this is this cut in all 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.850
 vegetables and vegetables as there 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.400
 I'm showing all the ingredients 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.530
 they are quite natural remember that 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.540
 all the ingredients have to be 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.239
 extremely cool so they have a 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.330
 touch as well as toast now what 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.580
 let's do is mix everything without 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.290
 no specific order because of 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.570
 allways always at the end we 're going 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.479
 to mix well this we are going to apply 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.240
 everything and we 're going to stir it up or 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.700
 We are going to mix it with a spoon 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.770
 vegetables or a spoon that you have 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.930
 Now what we are going to do is apply 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.149
 a little sea ​​salt the sea salt to 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.820
 I like to use it usually in 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.259
 all meals or meals 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.630
 because the sea salt even if we put 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.960
 a little bit but when it gets undone 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.259
 always brings as a touch more a 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.899
 little saladito or with a very rich flavor 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.030
 we will also apply brown sugar 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.819
 since it is the most natural that to me 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.860
 like to cook or to do 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.869
 any soda, let's apply 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.130
 also olive oil oil 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.409
 Olive what he's going to do is that he's going to 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.080
 accelerate digestion like the 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.299
 celery and it will protect the intestine from 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.369
 any vegetable that can make us 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.429
 constipation as for example the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.739
 apple peel we are going to apply 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.959
 also the lemon as we can see and what 

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:04.149
 let's mix quite remember that 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.899
 this salad is going to have a touch like 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.369
 bittersweet is neither salty nor 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.650
 sweet then what we're going to do is 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.959
 that we're going to mix it pretty well 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.209
 do not worry and the sea salt does not 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.889
 undoes at the moment a 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.080
 little bit but in the end you will have a 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.220
 very rich flavor 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.560
 now the trick is that we're going to 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.380
 Mix everything very well and the trick 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.050
 It's something I do not know if you know it 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.180
 but what I do with this salad is 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.670
 the following as you can see to 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.110
 she is extremely mixed now let's go 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.450
 to find a container to put it or 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.190
 apply everything there we will put all the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.560
 mix doctor salad in the bowl 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.510
 we are going to cover it very well and we are going to 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.550
 leave 15 to 20 minutes in the 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.010
 refrigerator for salt and sugar 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.320
 finish undoing and do that 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.150
 very bittersweet touch I hope you have them 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.680
 liked this video we will be watching 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.680
