00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.400
 Hello 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.650
 Today's video is about the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.450
 value table 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.400
 big numbers like me up here times 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.070
 wrote down as two examples 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.980
 can be better understood if you 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.500
 she enters into a white board 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.170
 and then for example tried in the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.660
 size to compare or just to 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.710
 read or number in words 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.600
 write 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.250
 we'll do that in the first time 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.370
 the present value table already here 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.440
 have prepared below fill 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.170
 the coming is certainly already known 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.780
 like these, the table filled out 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.600
 we will catch myself here on the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.460
 right side with one's teeth 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.460
 and the hundreds 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.250
 and then we have three in the next one 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:03.960
 block the thousands and also have there 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:09.720
 a scene of hundreds in the next 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:13.710
 We also have the millions in the block 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:22.740
 again a scene 100 m come the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:30.329
 billions of a scene then hundreds 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:34.950
 come the trillions of a scene 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:38.750
 hundreds and millions 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.750
 the billions 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.820
 you can do that now infinitely 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.799
 continue this table after the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.890
 thanks to the region 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.930
 trillions and so on but with so 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.590
 We do not want to pay huge numbers at first 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.360
 count 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.180
 and they will become one later 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.729
 mathematics be of less importance 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.290
 and maybe it's nice you 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.810
 heard and seen 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.200
 but we limit ourselves today 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.270
 on the numbers until the elections 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.220
 so we want the two above 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.660
 Example pay to look at and hagen 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.450
 are the values table 1 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.300
 we know that right at the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.819
 Number one is a place and catch so 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.480
 We are also in the table altogether 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.680
 right 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.840
 to enter our number namely the 918 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.019
 and gt dig just one after the other 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.019
 there 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.890
 so now i'm ready for me 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.140
 my number can easily be read in 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.080
 I always give three packs for three 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.910
 packet reading and although I have about 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.380
 the million a 3 stand as if I am 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:05.760
 three million 403 billion 208 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:07.770
 million 124 1819 so that I have a number 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.440
 if I only write them in numbers 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.650
 we can just as easily read up here 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.040
 I also share them in a pack of three 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:22.250
 by looking here from the right 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.840
 always make 1 point after three digits 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.390
 and so i can i am not even this one 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.550
 See the number immediately , but here it is 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.300
 three packages for one here 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.090
 the thousands 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.170
 we are the million billion and here 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.190
 is the trillion stelle 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.080
 we try again with the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.790
 second line there for me completely 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:48.000
 Right before that was the number now 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:04:00.480
 comes the numbers w and write now 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:06.500
 I pay here 1 182 3006 10,400 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.940
 Thousands and two of a million 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:15.979
 I can count that number too 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:18.560
 just read two million 463 1281 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:22.350
 I find that interesting now as 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:26.539
 Write on there would like to write there 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:32.430
 I support the millions as a support namely 2 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:34.410
 then comes the unit millions and off 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.660
 the thousands the 1000 ones the one 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.130
 I write as a single number 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.130
 in a long word we try the x 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.130
 400 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:58.309
 now it goes on 63,000 and now 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:12.379
 I do not make a new word but it 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:15.109
 goes into a second 281 yes if you do 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:17.599
 This band bon looks then you know 

00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:20.539
 why would you prefer to pay those in 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.919
 digits is much faster and faster 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.779
 you have a better overview how 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:29.539
 big but the number is also this text 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:32.559
 version I can abbreviate something else 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:39.079
 For example, you can pay for words 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:39.919
 write as numbers 2 then the unit 

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:47.299
 millions 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:55.899
 then comes 463,000 I describe it that way 

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:55.899
 on that I also have her four 63,000 here 

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:07.509
 463,000 now I am writing the last one 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:10.899
 rest simply as the number behind 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:13.219
 So I can write the number on 

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:20.059
 and I can make it a little shorter 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:24.819
 by millions and millions of units 

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:33.429
 house again abbreviation while I can 2 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:33.429
 Write millions for millions and 463 thousand 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:42.349
 4281 these are all three possibilities 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:47.239
 how can i write this number and 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:49.069
 then later on you can read very well 

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:51.259
 that 's how you pay in 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:53.959
 a value of the wave 1 carries and she 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:55.789
 can read again and in the 

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:56.900
 next video is about it what 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:01.060
 still with the values 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.060
 can do light to equal
