it<00:05:58.320> is<00:05:58.590> launched<00:05:59.430> so<00:06:00.240> that's<00:06:00.540> a<00:06:00.660> look<00:06:00.810> at<00:06:01.020> what

i think is maybe a killer feature for
some<00:06:03.450> people<00:06:03.750> support<00:06:04.680> for<00:06:04.910> google<00:06:05.910> documents
