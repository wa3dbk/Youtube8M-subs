looks good in the bathroom in style
might<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.420> start<00:00:45.629> off<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.899> some<00:00:46.050> dips<00:00:46.700> set<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
might we start off with some dips set to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.639 
might we start off with some dips set to
twelve<00:00:48.120> sets<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.480> fifteen<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.260> then<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.469> moved

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
twelve sets of fifteen and then we moved

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.979 
twelve sets of fifteen and then we moved
on<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.950> some<00:00:50.160> cable<00:00:50.520> rows<00:00:50.730> except<00:00:51.600> two<00:00:51.719> twelve

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
on to some cable rows except two twelve

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.479 
on to some cable rows except two twelve
sets<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.289> fifteen<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:53.039> when<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
sets of fifteen because when you do a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.670 
sets of fifteen because when you do a
compound<00:00:54.000> movement<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.899> helps<00:00:55.230> warm<00:00:55.500> up

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
compound movement there helps warm up

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.959 
compound movement there helps warm up
the<00:00:55.829> smaller<00:00:56.160> muscles<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.730> want<00:00:56.910> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
the smaller muscles that we want to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.240 
the smaller muscles that we want to
isolate<00:00:57.090> later<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.590> how<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.859> warmed<00:00:59.160> up

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
isolate later so that's how we warmed up

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.040 
isolate later so that's how we warmed up
with<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> compound<00:00:59.940> movement<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.629> kind<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.899> get

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
with a compound movement to kind of get

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.599 
with a compound movement to kind of get
the<00:01:01.170> blood<00:01:01.320> flowing<00:01:01.680> because<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.370> don't<00:01:02.489> want

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the blood flowing because you don't want

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.490 
the blood flowing because you don't want
to<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.820> jump<00:01:02.879> right<00:01:03.149> into<00:01:03.570> doing<00:01:03.930> isolation

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to just jump right into doing isolation

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.530 
to just jump right into doing isolation
movements<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.040> might<00:01:05.159> pull<00:01:05.430> something

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
movements but you might pull something

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.060 
movements but you might pull something
so<00:01:06.540> that's<00:01:06.720> why<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.900> did<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> dips<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
so that's why we did the dips that the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.609 
so that's why we did the dips that the
rows<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.270> our<00:01:09.390> first<00:01:09.659> exercise<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.470> did

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
presses and that's when you take the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.640 
presses and that's when you take the
dumbbell<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:25.110> elbow<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.619> line

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
like this and this is a exercise that is

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.840 
like this and this is a exercise that is
directly<00:01:31.110> gonna<00:01:31.740> benefit<00:01:32.220> me<00:01:32.280> because<00:01:32.700> this

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
directly gonna benefit me because this

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.450 
directly gonna benefit me because this
helps<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.420> lock<00:01:33.659> out<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.530> my<00:01:35.009> locked<00:01:35.280> out

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
helps out with lock out so my locked out

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.370 
helps out with lock out so my locked out
sucks<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.119> get<00:01:36.240> anything<00:01:36.479> off<00:01:36.720> my<00:01:36.960> chest

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
sucks I can get anything off my chest

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.950 
sucks I can get anything off my chest
however<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.799> soon<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.189> gets<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:38.840> most<00:01:39.840> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
however as soon as it gets here most of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.300 
however as soon as it gets here most of
the<00:01:40.020> driving<00:01:40.409> movement<00:01:41.040> now

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the driving movement now

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.460 
the driving movement now
is<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.090> extension<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.960> locking<00:01:43.380> out

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
is in the extension and the locking out

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.800 
is in the extension and the locking out
of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> arms<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.180> see<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.600> tape

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
of the arms so as you can see the tape

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.080 
of the arms so as you can see the tape
press<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.290> directly<00:01:46.829> mimics<00:01:47.310> static<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.909> when

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
press is directly mimics static so when

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.429 
press is directly mimics static so when
you're<00:01:48.180> when<00:01:48.390> I'm<00:01:48.479> doing<00:01:48.659> skull<00:01:48.899> Crusher's<00:01:49.290> or

you're when I'm doing skull Crusher's or
what<00:01:49.530> I'm<00:01:49.619> doing<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> rope<00:01:50.159> tricep<00:01:50.700> extension

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.279 
what I'm doing the rope tricep extension
thingymajig<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.810> when<00:01:51.930> you're<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.170> like

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
thingymajig is when you're going like

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.649 
thingymajig is when you're going like
this<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:53.549> do<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> lot<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> weight<00:01:54.180> because<00:01:54.509> my

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
this I can do a lot of weight because my

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.870 
this I can do a lot of weight because my
elbows<00:01:55.110> very<00:01:55.470> strong<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.220> flexing<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.700> this

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
elbows very strong and flexing in this

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.249 
elbows very strong and flexing in this
direction<00:01:58.520> but<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.000> direction<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:01.140> not

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
direction but in this direction it's not

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.320 
direction but in this direction it's not
that<00:02:01.619> strong<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.369> now<00:02:02.580> I'm<00:02:02.970> gonna<00:02:03.179> be

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
that strong so now I'm gonna be

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.940 
that strong so now I'm gonna be
practicing<00:02:03.539> tape<00:02:04.079> presses<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.710> I'm<00:02:04.770> actually

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
practicing tape presses and I'm actually

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.679 
practicing tape presses and I'm actually
incorporating<00:02:05.789> it<00:02:05.909> into<00:02:06.090> my<00:02:06.270> accessory

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
incorporating it into my accessory

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.930 
incorporating it into my accessory
movements<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.530> hopefully<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.340> my<00:02:08.519> lockout

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
movements to hopefully get my lockout

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.059 
movements to hopefully get my lockout
stronger<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.110> one<00:02:10.319> other<00:02:10.530> thing<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.890> I

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
stronger and then one other thing that I

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.500 
stronger and then one other thing that I
was<00:02:11.160> messing<00:02:11.310> around<00:02:11.519> with<00:02:11.730> waz<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.239> super

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
was messing around with waz up super

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.750 
was messing around with waz up super
training<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:13.140> pin<00:02:13.500> presses<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.340> Mark<00:02:14.549> Bell

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
training is pin presses what Mark Bell

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.880 
training is pin presses what Mark Bell
told<00:02:15.000> me<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.450> most<00:02:15.930> people's<00:02:16.350> lockout

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
told me is that most people's lockout

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.009 
told me is that most people's lockout
problem<00:02:17.549> isn't<00:02:18.150> really<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.660> they're<00:02:18.930> not

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
problem isn't really that they're not

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.330 
problem isn't really that they're not
strong<00:02:19.410> enough<00:02:19.440> cuz<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:19.920> you're<00:02:20.100> strong

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
strong enough cuz if you're strong

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.160 
strong enough cuz if you're strong
enough<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:20.970> off<00:02:21.060> your<00:02:21.209> chest<00:02:21.269> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
enough to get it off your chest you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.900 
enough to get it off your chest you
should<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.709> strong<00:02:23.040> enough<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.310> finish<00:02:23.640> it

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
should be strong enough to finish it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.550 
should be strong enough to finish it
throughout<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.299> entire<00:02:24.330> movement<00:02:24.989> he<00:02:25.380> says

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
throughout the entire movement he says

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.949 
throughout the entire movement he says
why<00:02:25.709> people<00:02:26.010> can't<00:02:26.250> lockout<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.970> because<00:02:27.420> as

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
why people can't lockout is because as

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.650 
why people can't lockout is because as
they're<00:02:28.349> benching<00:02:28.890> they<00:02:29.310> lose<00:02:29.549> momentum<00:02:29.790> when

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
they're benching they lose momentum when

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
they're benching they lose momentum when
your<00:02:30.810> elbows<00:02:31.200> are<00:02:31.380> going<00:02:31.650> from<00:02:31.920> an<00:02:32.040> inside

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
your elbows are going from an inside

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.910 
your elbows are going from an inside
position<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.209> an<00:02:33.330> outside<00:02:33.750> position<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.709> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
position to an outside position so the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.740 
position to an outside position so the
cool<00:02:35.130> thing<00:02:35.160> about<00:02:35.370> pin<00:02:35.730> presses<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.480> that

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
cool thing about pin presses is that

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.930 
cool thing about pin presses is that
it's<00:02:36.959> putting<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.709> barbra<00:02:38.099> exactly<00:02:38.760> where

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
it's putting the barbra exactly where

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.400 
it's putting the barbra exactly where
that<00:02:39.150> transition<00:02:39.420> begins<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.290> you're

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
that transition begins so you're

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.470 
that transition begins so you're
learning<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.830> accelerate<00:02:41.549> through<00:02:41.730> from<00:02:42.360> a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
learning to accelerate through from a

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.960 
learning to accelerate through from a
weak<00:02:42.660> elbow<00:02:43.049> position<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:44.220> I'm<00:02:44.310> also<00:02:44.519> gonna<00:02:44.880> be

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
weak elbow position so I'm also gonna be

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.479 
weak elbow position so I'm also gonna be
incorporating<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.799> then<00:02:47.010> we<00:02:47.130> finish

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
incorporating that and then we finish

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.500 
incorporating that and then we finish
off<00:02:47.700> with<00:02:48.269> some<00:02:48.540> cable<00:02:49.220> bicep<00:02:50.220> curls<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.299> then

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
off with some cable bicep curls and then

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.910 
off with some cable bicep curls and then
some<00:02:51.720> cable<00:02:52.230> tricep<00:02:53.180> curl<00:02:54.230> kickback<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.500> try

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
some cable tricep curl kickback to try

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.759 
some cable tricep curl kickback to try
tricep<00:02:56.609> things<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.150> then<00:02:57.989> my<00:02:58.410> arms<00:02:58.680> are

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
tricep things and then my arms are

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.140 
tricep things and then my arms are
really<00:02:58.799> pumped<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.340> know<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.670> feels<00:02:59.880> really

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
really pumped I know that feels really

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.140 
really pumped I know that feels really
good<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:01.250> sometimes<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.609> just<00:03:02.640> want<00:03:02.940> an<00:03:03.000> easy

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
good and sometimes you just want an easy

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.720 
good and sometimes you just want an easy
workout<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.500> still<00:03:04.769> want<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:04.980> workout<00:03:05.310> go

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
workout but you still want to workout go

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.900 
workout but you still want to workout go
on<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.940> gym<00:03:06.180> smash<00:03:06.840> your<00:03:07.049> arms<00:03:07.410> because<00:03:08.190> arms

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
on the gym smash your arms because arms

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
can never be too big and arms big arms

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:21.080 
can never be too big and arms big arms
are<00:03:12.810> always<00:03:13.170> good<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:13.799> you

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.729 

we<00:03:22.090> still<00:03:22.360> went<00:03:22.870> up<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.170> weight<00:03:23.319> started

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
we still went up and weight started

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.170 
we still went up and weight started
adding<00:03:23.890> more<00:03:24.130> kettlebells<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.849> each<00:03:24.970> side<00:03:25.150> and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
adding more kettlebells to each side and

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.940 
adding more kettlebells to each side and
you<00:03:25.330> could<00:03:25.450> actually<00:03:25.599> do<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.080> in<00:03:26.590> your<00:03:26.709> home

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
you could actually do this in your home

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.130 
you could actually do this in your home
gym<00:03:27.250> but<00:03:27.489> make<00:03:27.790> sure<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.120> get<00:03:28.330> a<00:03:28.390> spot<00:03:28.810> with

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
gym but make sure you get a spot with

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.050 
gym but make sure you get a spot with
the<00:03:29.290> bamboo<00:03:29.739> bar<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.250> thing<00:03:30.430> shakes<00:03:30.700> way

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
the bamboo bar that thing shakes way

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.910 
the bamboo bar that thing shakes way
more<00:03:31.330> than<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> barbell<00:03:31.959> though<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.739> had<00:03:32.890> a

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
more than a barbell though and I had a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.620 
more than a barbell though and I had a
really<00:03:33.160> good<00:03:33.400> time<00:03:33.610> using<00:03:33.880> it<00:03:34.030> because<00:03:34.360> after

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
really good time using it because after

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.880 
really good time using it because after
about<00:03:34.989> 3<00:03:35.260> sets<00:03:35.530> all<00:03:35.800> of<00:03:36.160> my<00:03:36.280> joints
