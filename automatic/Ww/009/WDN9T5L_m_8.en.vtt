00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
Oakland who they both feet in

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.150 
Oakland who they both feet in
consecutive<00:03:53.080> weeks<00:03:53.380> it's<00:03:53.860> unbelievable

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
consecutive weeks it's unbelievable

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.280 
consecutive weeks it's unbelievable
because<00:03:54.790> they<00:03:55.060> started<00:03:55.450> out<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.690> season<00:03:55.900> and

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
because they started out the season and

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.410 
because they started out the season and
I<00:03:56.470> think<00:03:56.710> they<00:03:56.860> were<00:03:56.920> at<00:03:57.190> a<00:03:57.250> negative<00:03:57.760> 80<00:03:58.000> point

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
I think they were at a negative 80 point

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.960 
I think they were at a negative 80 point
point<00:03:59.110> differential<00:03:59.590> in<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.640> first<00:04:00.790> three
