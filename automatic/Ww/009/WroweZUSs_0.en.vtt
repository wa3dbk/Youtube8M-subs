00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
the price no I don't think so if you're

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.660 
the price no I don't think so if you're
paying<00:02:54.660> 20<00:02:55.230> each<00:02:56.660> that's<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.840> MSRP<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.920> if<00:02:59.490> you

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
paying 20 each that's the MSRP so if you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.210 
paying 20 each that's the MSRP so if you
really<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.360> set<00:03:00.630> then<00:03:00.930> go<00:03:01.560> for<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:01.830> but
