I just I really like tinted moisturizer
I<00:02:27.240> think<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.780> lot<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:29.250> smooth<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.970> don't

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
I think it's a lot like smooth I don't

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.970 
I think it's a lot like smooth I don't
have<00:02:30.240> like<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.510> cream<00:02:30.900> person<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.650> look<00:02:31.800> good

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
have like a cream person and look good

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.950 
have like a cream person and look good
then<00:02:32.160> like<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> powder<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.360> kind<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.810> like

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
then like a powder so I kind of like

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.510 
then like a powder so I kind of like
this<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.140> little<00:02:34.470> better<00:02:34.620> than<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.130> bronzer

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
this a little better than the bronzer

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.190 
this a little better than the bronzer
bronzer<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.420> little<00:02:36.660> bit<00:02:36.780> quicker<00:02:36.960> if

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
bronzer is a little bit quicker if

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.720 
bronzer is a little bit quicker if
you're<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.680> rush<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:38.310> sleep<00:02:38.550> it

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.850 
don't know why I have all this mediums
up<00:02:59.160> let's<00:02:59.730> see<00:02:59.880> it<00:02:59.970> comes<00:03:00.210> out<00:03:00.420> just<00:03:00.720> white<00:03:01.020> but
