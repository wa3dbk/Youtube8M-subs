00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.090
 only city in which they have been 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.280
 threatened this way then we 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.619
 the only thing that is possible is to repeat the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.420
 concert when there is a free date and 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.110

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.850
 both in Ecuador and in Spain as in

 germany that's not right that's 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.890
 professional

 guarded by the police to Spanish not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.500
 he had another to address the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.500
 public 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.610
 although yes, it will be the outcome 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.550
 of this controversy 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.940
 today wizard of öz has another contract and

 bbva for the moment that can be opened 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.980
 of a musician's life there is no more strength 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.380
 greater established in all contracts 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.140
 transform us is likely to 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.450
 also television dares the organization 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.590
 there are many people on many levels 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.350
 if you were performing the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.390
 new sounds 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.760
 there are secrets because there is also 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.600
 true your equipment 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.240
 but we can not do anything 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.240
 altamirano faranduleros that is 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:24.020
 of the band that they could go back to him 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.420
 the accounts to the teams are unequal 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.860

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.740
 flight time I can do it 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.260
 to say is that at the beginning I did not have very 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.190
 clear the movie but now seeing what 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.280
 what happened 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.770
 I think the group had the decency of 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.350
 talk to people the group does not know 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.940
 presented for causes that came out of the 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.180
 hands I think it 's as much of them as 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.040
 of the organizers of the event although 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.459
 knowing that we are in winter they said 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.230
 have foreseen that it could rain 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.780
 friends to look for ways to 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.120
 safeguard teams that are very 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.120
 expensive now we sign with him
