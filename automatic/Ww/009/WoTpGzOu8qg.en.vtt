so half and half water and PVA and then

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.810 
so half and half water and PVA and then
this<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.420> chemical<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.620> called<00:00:59.160> borax

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
so much thing that no more will dissolve

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.650

so we've got our borax we've got our PVA

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.500 
so we've got our borax we've got our PVA
and<00:02:12.080> we<00:02:12.350> need<00:02:12.500> some<00:02:12.770> ordinary<00:02:13.240> cornflour<00:02:14.240> I

and we need some ordinary cornflour I

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.780 
and we need some ordinary cornflour I

you to mix in we need 5 spoons of PVA
and<00:02:26.410> 2<00:02:27.410> spoons<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.830> borax<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.880> then<00:02:29.060> some

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
and 2 spoons of borax and then some

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.200 
and 2 spoons of borax and then some
cornflour<00:02:30.350> maybe<00:02:30.950> 2<00:02:31.310> maybe<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.700> few<00:02:32.060> more

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
cornflour maybe 2 maybe a few more

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.360 
cornflour maybe 2 maybe a few more
teaspoons<00:02:32.630> of<00:02:32.720> corn<00:02:32.990> flour<00:02:33.230> but<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.190> would

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
teaspoons of corn flour but that would

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.510 
teaspoons of corn flour but that would
be<00:02:34.400> white<00:02:34.670> which<00:02:35.210> would<00:02:35.390> be<00:02:35.510> very<00:02:35.870> boring<00:02:36.110> so

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
be white which would be very boring so

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.710 
be white which would be very boring so
we<00:02:37.520> need<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:37.910> pick<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.090> color<00:02:38.330> I've<00:02:38.540> brought

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
we need to pick a color I've brought

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.780 
we need to pick a color I've brought
some<00:02:38.959> blue<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.680> some<00:02:39.740> four<00:02:40.220> or<00:02:40.250> five<00:02:40.430> drops<00:02:40.610> of

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
some blue and some four or five drops of

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.020 
some blue and some four or five drops of
blue<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.900> would<00:02:42.080> put<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.350> into<00:02:43.070> when<00:02:43.880> you

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
blue and I would put that into when you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.990 
blue and I would put that into when you
measure<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.300> PVA<00:02:44.660> out<00:02:45.290> okay<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:46.280> over<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.970> you

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
measure the PVA out okay so over to you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.570 
measure the PVA out okay so over to you
there<00:02:47.690> we<00:02:47.750> go<00:02:47.930> all<00:02:48.200> right<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:48.680> do<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.130> say<00:02:49.310> 5

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
there we go all right so do you say 5

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.890 
there we go all right so do you say 5
out<00:02:49.910> 5<00:02:50.240> about<00:02:50.570> 5<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.840> those<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:53.330> again<00:02:53.630> don't

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
out 5 about 5 of those and again don't

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.870 
out 5 about 5 of those and again don't
worry<00:02:54.350> too<00:02:54.800> much<00:02:54.830> about<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.340> measurements

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
worry too much about the measurements

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.210 
worry too much about the measurements
because<00:02:56.709> it's<00:02:57.709> not<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.100> accurate<00:03:00.220> yeah

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
because it's not that accurate yeah

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.020 
because it's not that accurate yeah
that's<00:03:01.550> fine

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
that's fine

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.000 
that's fine
and<00:03:03.020> then<00:03:03.170> we'll<00:03:03.260> put<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.440> little<00:03:03.560> bit<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.770> color

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
and then we'll put a little bit of color

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.520 
and then we'll put a little bit of color
in<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.310> think<00:03:04.520> so<00:03:05.240> 4<00:03:05.450> or<00:03:05.540> 5<00:03:05.660> drops<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.080> that's

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
in I think so 4 or 5 drops so that's

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.310 
in I think so 4 or 5 drops so that's
just<00:03:06.890> food<00:03:07.250> coloring<00:03:07.640> yes<00:03:08.450> just<00:03:08.930> ordinary

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
just food coloring yes just ordinary

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.590 
just food coloring yes just ordinary
food<00:03:09.500> coloring<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:10.730> use<00:03:11.090> them<00:03:11.239> in<00:03:11.360> squeezy

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
food coloring I use them in squeezy

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.020 
food coloring I use them in squeezy
bottles<00:03:11.989> it's<00:03:12.140> really<00:03:12.440> useful<00:03:12.860> yes<00:03:13.070> is<00:03:13.280> easy

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.620 

that's<00:03:17.030> brilliant

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
that's brilliant

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.440 
that's brilliant
and<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.350> then<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.680> couple<00:03:18.980> of<00:03:19.040> spoons<00:03:19.610> of<00:03:19.850> the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
and and then a couple of spoons of the

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.180 
and and then a couple of spoons of the
borax<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:21.110> don't<00:03:21.320> need<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.680> get<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:21.890> crystals

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
borax you don't need to get the crystals

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.100 
borax you don't need to get the crystals
from<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.370> bottom<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:23.209> know<00:03:23.239> you<00:03:23.450> just<00:03:23.720> want

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
from the bottom you know you just want

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.750 
from the bottom you know you just want
the<00:03:24.200> lid<00:03:24.350> really<00:03:26.860> now<00:03:27.860> you<00:03:27.890> could<00:03:28.220> just<00:03:28.580> mix

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
the lid really now you could just mix

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.420 
the lid really now you could just mix
that<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.420> you'd<00:03:29.510> have<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.660> slime<00:03:30.130> but<00:03:31.130> we're

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
that and you'd have a slime but we're

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.970 
that and you'd have a slime but we're
doing<00:03:31.519> bouncy<00:03:31.910> custard<00:03:32.300> so<00:03:32.840> we'll<00:03:32.989> add<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.440> good

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
doing bouncy custard so we'll add a good

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.759 
doing bouncy custard so we'll add a good
couple<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.610> spoons<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:36.200> cornflour<00:03:38.769> well

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
couple of spoons of the cornflour well

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.979 
couple of spoons of the cornflour well
we<00:03:40.220> give<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.519> go<00:03:40.670> if<00:03:41.209> it's<00:03:41.420> too<00:03:41.570> sticky<00:03:41.780> we'll

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
we give it a go if it's too sticky we'll

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.930 
we give it a go if it's too sticky we'll
have<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.140> put<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.290> bit<00:03:42.410> more<00:03:42.440> in<00:03:42.620> try<00:03:43.459> those<00:03:43.700> too

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
have to put a bit more in try those too

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.620 
have to put a bit more in try those too
it's<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.540> bit<00:03:44.660> like<00:03:44.780> cookery<00:03:45.170> really

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
it's a bit like cookery really

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.300 
it's a bit like cookery really
so<00:03:47.630> give<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.900> really<00:03:48.290> good<00:03:48.320> stir<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:49.130> she's

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
so give it a really good stir and she's

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.280 
so give it a really good stir and she's
quite<00:03:49.610> thick<00:03:49.940> which<00:03:50.750> is<00:03:50.959> it's<00:03:51.170> getting

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
quite thick which is it's getting

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:01.980 
quite thick which is it's getting
thicker<00:03:52.269> quite<00:03:53.269> nothing<00:03:53.630> yes<00:03:55.299> children

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.710 

that's<00:04:02.990> a<00:04:03.140> bit<00:04:03.290> sticky<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.090> yeah<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:05.450> shall<00:04:05.690> I

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.200 
teaspoon and we'll see how that goes you
need<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.370> come<00:04:10.520> together<00:04:10.670> so<00:04:10.940> that<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.120> can

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
need it to come together so that you can

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.539 
need it to come together so that you can
get<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.480> into<00:04:11.630> your<00:04:11.810> hand<00:04:12.080> like<00:04:13.300> so<00:04:14.710> yes<00:04:15.710> a<00:04:16.220> bit

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
get it into your hand like so yes a bit

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.500 
get it into your hand like so yes a bit
like<00:04:16.700> that<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:19.310> looks<00:04:19.430> better<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.120> me<00:04:20.150> do<00:04:20.450> you

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
like that that looks better to me do you

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.580 
like that that looks better to me do you
think<00:04:20.570> you<00:04:20.750> could<00:04:20.900> get<00:04:20.989> that<00:04:21.140> into<00:04:21.320> your<00:04:21.440> hand

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
think you could get that into your hand

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.410 
think you could get that into your hand
and<00:04:21.739> sort<00:04:22.160> of<00:04:22.220> need<00:04:22.400> it<00:04:22.670> yeah<00:04:22.940> are<00:04:23.360> you

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
and sort of need it yeah are you

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
and sort of need it yeah are you
prepared<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.870> get<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.110> know<00:04:24.550> okay<00:04:26.260> all<00:04:27.260> right

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
prepared to get you know okay all right

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.900 
prepared to get you know okay all right
you<00:04:27.680> can<00:04:27.830> see<00:04:27.980> how<00:04:28.100> your<00:04:28.280> class<00:04:28.460> would<00:04:28.610> love

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
you can see how your class would love

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.280 
you can see how your class would love
this<00:04:29.120> it's<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:29.690> messy

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
this it's so messy

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.070 
this it's so messy
yeah<00:04:31.100> so<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.520> get<00:04:31.730> it<00:04:31.850> out<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.420> you<00:04:32.780> need

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
yeah so you get it out and you you need

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.730 
yeah so you get it out and you you need
it<00:04:33.380> okay<00:04:34.220> now<00:04:35.150> what<00:04:35.300> you're<00:04:35.510> doing<00:04:35.540> is<00:04:36.080> you<00:04:36.710> are

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
it okay now what you're doing is you are

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.950 
it okay now what you're doing is you are
doing<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:37.820> chemical<00:04:37.940> reaction<00:04:38.510> between<00:04:38.630> the

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
doing a chemical reaction between the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.110 
doing a chemical reaction between the
PVA<00:04:39.290> which<00:04:39.980> is<00:04:40.130> sort<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.310> like<00:04:40.370> long<00:04:40.730> strings

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
PVA which is sort of like long strings

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.150 
PVA which is sort of like long strings
of<00:04:41.270> spaghetti<00:04:41.390> if<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:42.050> like<00:04:42.230> and

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
of spaghetti if you like and

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.120 
of spaghetti if you like and
cross-linked<00:04:44.030> bits<00:04:44.390> from<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.750> borax<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:45.830> two

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
cross-linked bits from the borax so two

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.730 
cross-linked bits from the borax so two
liquids<00:04:46.460> becoming<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:46.910> solid<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.900> cornflour

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
liquids becoming a solid the cornflour

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.470 
liquids becoming a solid the cornflour
adds<00:04:49.040> a<00:04:49.280> little<00:04:49.640> bit<00:04:49.790> more<00:04:49.880> oomph<00:04:50.240> from

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
adds a little bit more oomph from

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.390 
adds a little bit more oomph from
texture<00:04:50.960> in<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.230> and<00:04:51.590> eventually<00:04:52.220> will<00:04:52.370> make

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
texture in it and eventually will make

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.570 
texture in it and eventually will make
it<00:04:52.730> bouncy<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:54.230> more<00:04:54.410> you<00:04:54.530> bounce<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:55.190> more

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
it bouncy the more you bounce the more

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.600 
it bouncy the more you bounce the more
you<00:04:55.700> need<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:56.360> better<00:04:56.540> so<00:04:57.530> let's<00:04:58.310> see<00:04:58.430> if<00:04:58.490> it's

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
you need the better so let's see if it's

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.730 
you need the better so let's see if it's
a<00:04:58.700> splatter<00:04:58.970> or<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.210> bounce<00:05:01.330> okay<00:05:02.710> back<00:05:03.710> there

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
a splatter or a bounce okay back there

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.020 
a splatter or a bounce okay back there
yeah<00:05:05.169> not<00:05:06.169> bad

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
yeah not bad

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.930 
yeah not bad
here's<00:05:08.030> one<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.240> made<00:05:08.360> earlier<00:05:09.520> now<00:05:10.520> this<00:05:10.730> one

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
here's one I made earlier now this one

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.970 
here's one I made earlier now this one
has<00:05:11.090> been<00:05:11.270> sat<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:11.780> it's<00:05:11.930> gone<00:05:12.169> all<00:05:12.440> large

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
has been sat and it's gone all large

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.920 
has been sat and it's gone all large
almost<00:05:13.220> like<00:05:13.400> a<00:05:13.430> puddle<00:05:13.700> which<00:05:14.330> is<00:05:14.479> brilliant

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
almost like a puddle which is brilliant

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.920 
almost like a puddle which is brilliant
if<00:05:15.169> you<00:05:15.400> squeeze<00:05:16.400> it<00:05:16.580> together<00:05:16.760> now<00:05:17.510> have<00:05:17.900> a

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
if you squeeze it together now have a

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.080 
if you squeeze it together now have a
feel<00:05:18.320> at<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.590> texture<00:05:19.010> of<00:05:19.040> that<00:05:19.250> it's<00:05:19.520> really

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
feel at the texture of that it's really

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.400 
feel at the texture of that it's really
smooth<00:05:20.479> you<00:05:20.510> said<00:05:20.810> that<00:05:20.930> one<00:05:21.050> was<00:05:21.169> getting

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
smooth you said that one was getting

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.680 
smooth you said that one was getting
smoother<00:05:21.830> but<00:05:22.460> that<00:05:22.640> yeah<00:05:22.910> that's<00:05:23.390> lovely

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
smoother but that yeah that's lovely

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.300 
smoother but that yeah that's lovely
that's<00:05:23.930> a<00:05:24.050> couple<00:05:24.229> of<00:05:24.350> days<00:05:24.530> old<00:05:24.770> it's<00:05:25.160> been

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
that's a couple of days old it's been

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.550 
that's a couple of days old it's been
played<00:05:25.850> with<00:05:26.060> a<00:05:26.090> lot<00:05:26.330> it's<00:05:26.690> really<00:05:27.140> lovely<00:05:27.260> and

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
played with a lot it's really lovely and

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.909 
played with a lot it's really lovely and
smooth<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.610> I<00:05:29.090> bet<00:05:30.080> it<00:05:30.200> bounces<00:05:30.530> better<00:05:30.740> than

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
smooth and I bet it bounces better than

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.370 
smooth and I bet it bounces better than
yours

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.690 

oh<00:05:37.960> yes<00:05:39.130> there<00:05:40.130> we<00:05:40.250> go
