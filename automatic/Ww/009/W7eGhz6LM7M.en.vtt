uniform<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.920> then<00:03:17.490> I<00:03:17.520> guess<00:03:17.880> I'd<00:03:18.270> never<00:03:18.480> put

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
uniform and then I guess I'd never put

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.240 
uniform and then I guess I'd never put
the<00:03:18.840> ps2<00:03:19.260> version<00:03:19.290> but<00:03:19.830> I<00:03:19.860> think<00:03:20.130> they

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
the ps2 version but I think they

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.450 
the ps2 version but I think they
integrated<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.660> costumes<00:03:22.560> into<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.100> so

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
integrated the costumes into this so

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.550 
integrated the costumes into this so
hopefully<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.420> can<00:03:24.450> dress<00:03:24.990> up<00:03:25.140> as<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.320> gangster
