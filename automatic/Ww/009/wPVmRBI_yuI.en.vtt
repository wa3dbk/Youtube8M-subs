haven't peeled yet and that's because
every<00:02:07.920> time<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.340> try<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.670> peel<00:02:09.000> it

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
every time I try to peel it

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.990 
every time I try to peel it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
it if it crack is not well-defined

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.230 
it if it crack is not well-defined
between<00:02:12.780> two<00:02:13.080> edges<00:02:13.700> classic<00:02:14.700> dip<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:14.910> awesome

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
between two edges classic dip is awesome

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.310 
between two edges classic dip is awesome
because<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.510> peel<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.750> off<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.110> wherever

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
because you peel it off and wherever

because you peel it off and wherever
there's<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.530> crack<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:17.010> has<00:02:17.130> kind<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.400> weakness

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
there's a crack it has kind of weakness

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.360 
there's a crack it has kind of weakness
it<00:02:17.940> gives<00:02:18.120> white<00:02:18.270> boom<00:02:18.540> if<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.800> have<00:02:20.010> some

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
that don't have a well-defined edge or

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.480 
that don't have a well-defined edge or
you<00:02:22.380> either<00:02:22.500> spray<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.830> thick<00:02:23.040> enough<00:02:23.250> that

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
you either spray it thick enough that

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.820 
you either spray it thick enough that
that<00:02:23.700> edge<00:02:23.910> starts<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.540> blend<00:02:24.720> together<00:02:24.900> it'll

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
that edge starts to blend together it'll

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.350 
that edge starts to blend together it'll
want<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> pull<00:02:26.220> up<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:27.000> you'll<00:02:27.120> have<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.270> little

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
want to pull up so you'll have a little

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.260 
want to pull up so you'll have a little
bubbling<00:02:27.840> over<00:02:28.080> here<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.910> that's<00:02:30.090> why<00:02:30.240> I

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
bubbling over here and so that's why I

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.710 
bubbling over here and so that's why I
said<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> detailed<00:02:30.870> work<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.800> can<00:02:32.040> see

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.900 
said the detailed work so you can see
I've<00:02:33.720> got<00:02:34.080> come<00:02:34.740> on<00:02:34.890> see<00:02:35.490> if<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.610> can<00:02:35.700> get<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.850> to

had to redo this grill three times such
a<00:04:03.480> pin<00:04:03.720> well<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.410> third<00:04:04.590> try<00:04:04.800> the

a pin well this is the third try the

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.540 
a pin well this is the third try the
first<00:04:06.030> try<00:04:06.440> everything<00:04:07.440> went<00:04:07.560> well<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.040> then

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
first try everything went well and then

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.070 
first try everything went well and then
I<00:04:08.640> got<00:04:08.790> too<00:04:08.910> close<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.210> I<00:04:09.450> just<00:04:09.630> bubbled<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:09.990> up

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
I got too close and I just bubbled it up

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.130 
I got too close and I just bubbled it up
in<00:04:10.200> places<00:04:10.620> like<00:04:10.800> right<00:04:11.700> an<00:04:11.850> obvious<00:04:12.450> big<00:04:12.780> flat

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
in places like right an obvious big flat

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.450 
in places like right an obvious big flat
spot<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:14.280> peel<00:04:14.550> it<00:04:14.580> off<00:04:14.790> and

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
spot so I peel it off and

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.340 
spot so I peel it off and
in<00:04:15.550> because<00:04:16.390> I<00:04:16.420> saw<00:04:16.660> worried<00:04:16.840> about<00:04:16.930> bubbling

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
in because I saw worried about bubbling

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.690 
in because I saw worried about bubbling
I<00:04:17.530> backed<00:04:17.980> it<00:04:18.130> off<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.460> I<00:04:18.520> was<00:04:18.610> probably

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
I backed it off and I was probably

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.430 
I backed it off and I was probably
shooting<00:04:19.030> from<00:04:19.210> 10<00:04:19.420> to<00:04:19.510> 12<00:04:19.750> inches<00:04:20.020> away<00:04:20.140> and

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
shooting from 10 to 12 inches away and

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:29.150 
shooting from 10 to 12 inches away and
it<00:04:20.830> made<00:04:21.010> this<00:04:21.190> weird<00:04:21.640> dusty<00:04:23.340> look<00:04:24.340> like<00:04:26.670> this

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
it made this weird dusty look like this

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.800 
it made this weird dusty look like this
and<00:04:30.330> I<00:04:31.650> read<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:33.120> little<00:04:34.120> more<00:04:34.270> about<00:04:34.420> it<00:04:34.630> and

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
and I read a little more about it and

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.030 
and I read a little more about it and
figured<00:04:34.990> out<00:04:35.050> sure<00:04:35.320> enough<00:04:35.530> that's<00:04:35.770> what

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
figured out sure enough that's what

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.140 
figured out sure enough that's what
happens<00:04:36.340> when<00:04:36.460> you<00:04:36.550> spray<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.820> you're<00:04:36.970> far

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
happens when you spray to you're far

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.610 
happens when you spray to you're far
away<00:04:37.240> so<00:04:37.950> but<00:04:39.450> there<00:04:40.450> it<00:04:40.600> is

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
away so but there it is

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.990 
away so but there it is
I<00:04:42.870> like<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:45.070> I<00:04:45.190> seriously<00:04:45.400> did<00:04:45.760> all<00:04:45.970> of

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
I like it and I seriously did all of

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.810 
I like it and I seriously did all of
this<00:04:46.300> for<00:04:46.540> while<00:04:47.110> I<00:04:47.140> redid<00:04:47.410> that<00:04:47.580> grill<00:04:48.580> so

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
this for while I redid that grill so

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.840 
this for while I redid that grill so
many<00:04:48.850> times<00:04:49.210> so<00:04:49.420> to<00:04:49.570> extra<00:04:49.930> cans<00:04:50.170> but<00:04:50.500> oh

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
probably about six seven cans and then

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.890 
probably about six seven cans and then
about<00:04:54.190> six<00:04:54.640> seven<00:04:54.820> dollars<00:04:55.000> a<00:04:55.180> piece<00:04:55.360> so<00:04:55.660> less

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
about six seven dollars a piece so less

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
about six seven dollars a piece so less

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
on their windows it's probably because

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.730 
on their windows it's probably because
they<00:05:12.370> know<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.730> pain<00:05:13.690> in<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.870> butt<00:05:14.080> it<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.440> to

referrals forget about those so and

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.870 
referrals forget about those so and
