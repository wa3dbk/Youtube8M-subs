my favorite juicer and I just wanted to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.550 
my favorite juicer and I just wanted to
show<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.800> guys<00:00:20.160> over<00:00:20.609> here<00:00:21.109> we<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.289> some

show you guys over here we have some

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.730 
show you guys over here we have some
wheatgrass<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.609> Nova<00:00:24.150> grew<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:25.350> how<00:00:25.470> did<00:00:25.650> you

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
wheatgrass that Nova grew so how did you

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.769 
wheatgrass that Nova grew so how did you
grow<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.039> wheatgrass<00:00:26.220> Nova<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:27.090> grew<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.539> in

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
grow the wheatgrass Nova we grew it in

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.290 
grow the wheatgrass Nova we grew it in
trays<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:28.710> use<00:00:28.830> cafeteria<00:00:29.609> trays<00:00:29.910> or

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
trays and you can use cafeteria trays or

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.999 
trays and you can use cafeteria trays or
any<00:00:30.510> kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> these<00:00:30.990> are<00:00:31.140> actually<00:00:31.619> from<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
any kind of these are actually from the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.270 
any kind of these are actually from the
planters<00:00:32.430> store<00:00:32.700> but<00:00:33.380> with<00:00:34.380> rock<00:00:34.739> mineral

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
planters store but with rock mineral

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.069 
planters store but with rock mineral
dust<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.820> an<00:00:35.969> experiment<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.719> wanted<00:00:37.020> to

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
dust as an experiment so we wanted to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.479 
dust as an experiment so we wanted to
see<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> wheatgrass<00:00:37.890> would<00:00:38.280> taste

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
see if the wheatgrass would taste

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.350 
see if the wheatgrass would taste
sweeter<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.930> was<00:00:40.200> more<00:00:41.160> mineralized<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
sweeter if it was more mineralized and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.840 
sweeter if it was more mineralized and
so<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.960> sprinkled<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> rock<00:00:44.070> mineral<00:00:44.370> dust<00:00:44.610> in

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so we sprinkled the rock mineral dust in

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.510 
so we sprinkled the rock mineral dust in
soil<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.140> put<00:00:46.320> those<00:00:46.469> wheat<00:00:47.280> berry

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
soil and just put those wheat berry

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.180 
soil and just put those wheat berry
seeds<00:00:47.850> from<00:00:48.329> any<00:00:49.140> health<00:00:49.440> food<00:00:49.739> store<00:00:49.980> from

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
seeds from any health food store from

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
seeds from any health food store from
the<00:00:50.219> vault<00:00:50.489> bins<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.090> watered<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.899> every<00:00:52.170> day

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the vault bins and watered it every day

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.110 
the vault bins and watered it every day
and<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> keep<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.430> dark<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and you have to keep it dark for the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.389 
and you have to keep it dark for the
first<00:00:54.390> couple<00:00:54.780> days<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.620> put<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> second

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
first couple days so you put a second

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.910 
first couple days so you put a second
tray<00:00:56.670> over<00:00:56.910> top<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.140> soon<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.620> start

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
tray over top but as soon as you start

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.410 
tray over top but as soon as you start
seeing<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.520> straps<00:00:59.789> come<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.239> then

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
seeing the little straps come up then

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.869 
seeing the little straps come up then
you<00:01:00.539> take<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.960> tray<00:01:01.199> off<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.609> sunlight

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
you take that tray off and that sunlight

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.030 
you take that tray off and that sunlight
so<00:01:03.629> nice<00:01:03.809> emphasis<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.739> stuff<00:01:05.010> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
so nice emphasis all that stuff that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.190 
so nice emphasis all that stuff that
grass<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.790> sprouts<00:01:06.210> right<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:06.930> great

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
grass just sprouts right up it's great

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.760 
grass just sprouts right up it's great
Oh<00:01:07.970> easy<00:01:08.970> yeah<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.960> another<00:01:10.170> way<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.500> can

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
Oh easy yeah and another way you can

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.859 
Oh easy yeah and another way you can
grow<00:01:10.979> wheatgrass<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.330> actually

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
grow wheatgrass is you can actually

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.499 
grow wheatgrass is you can actually
start<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.500> wheat<00:01:13.680> berry<00:01:13.950> seeds<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:15.240> sprout

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
start the wheat berry seeds in a sprout

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.630 
start the wheat berry seeds in a sprout
bag<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> hen<00:01:16.200> sprout<00:01:16.530> bag<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.040> then<00:01:17.430> once

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
bag and a hen sprout bag and then once

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.920 
bag and a hen sprout bag and then once
they<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.150> tail<00:01:18.360> then<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.780> can

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
they have a little tail then you can

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.050 
they have a little tail then you can
spread<00:01:19.200> them<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> tray<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.400> either<00:01:20.700> way<00:01:20.909> it's

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
spread them on a tray so either way it's

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.850 
spread them on a tray so either way it's
fine<00:01:21.270> wheatgrass<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.020> actually<00:01:22.409> pretty<00:01:22.619> easy

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
fine wheatgrass is actually pretty easy

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.620 
fine wheatgrass is actually pretty easy
to<00:01:23.070> grow<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.759> inexpensive<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to grow and it's inexpensive you that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.359 
to grow and it's inexpensive you that
don't<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.110> about<00:01:25.229> some<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> benefits<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
don't know about some of the benefits of

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.249 
don't know about some of the benefits of
wheatgrass<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:27.299> really<00:01:27.689> high<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:27.990> magnesium

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
wheatgrass it's really high in magnesium

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.249 
wheatgrass it's really high in magnesium
and<00:01:28.950> chlorophyll<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.390> blood<00:01:30.750> builder

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and chlorophyll it's a blood builder

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.880 
and chlorophyll it's a blood builder
it's<00:01:31.619> full<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.070> enzymes<00:01:32.390> it's<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.710> it's<00:01:34.710> a
