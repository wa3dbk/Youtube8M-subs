00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.179
 I used to decorate an oscar 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.099
 page also of banana and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.410
 flavor combination is really 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.450
 I hope that 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.310
 you are at home because it is very easy and 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.310
 sure you will love it here you have it 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.710
 to prepare a banana frosting 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:36.830
 we will need 75 grams of butter 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.850
 60 grams of sugar glas 75 grams of 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:43.280
 cream cheese and a crushed Catalan 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.269
 to prepare the frosting we will begin 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.269
 adding the butter 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.410
 of sugar glas 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.880
 although that cremated 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.220
 and we beat everything well 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.030
 we add the crushed banana 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.960
 and we beat it again 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.140
 Well, as you can see, we have the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.240

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.130
 What I'm going to do is leave a refrigerator 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.560
 I'm just a little bit harder because 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.720
 it is very liquid will be very difficult 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.039

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.590
