00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.280
 c 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.049
 ed 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.139
 amsterdam man here I am if gary is still there I must find him 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.470
 I come from belgium and the greatest attention my project all these people who 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.279
 follow us 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.630
 but gives it I feel very small 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.310
 all alone with my backpack in the crowd of this huge airport 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.810
 but I take my place 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.000
 as if I were a traveler like any other 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.320
 nobody knows that I have another purpose 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.220
 it's a funny feeling 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.440
 I wonder if among all these people there are others who pretend 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
 to be the ones who are not 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.540
 in fact it is the case of the warrior 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.000
 I had a little break outside 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.830
 alas it's almost too good to be real incredible 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.120
 a little time register returns to the near suburbs of los angeles for the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.749
 make 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:02.740
 I think dsk denies 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.070
 frankly the french i am traveling to amsterdam this morning i 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.330
 took back my credit card I do not know anyone here 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.590
 like everyone 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.810
 the counter-offensive by showing earlier if you want to help me I respect 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.070
 the fact that our sport at the beginning I had as early as Tuesday 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.350
 but according to his lawyer, you have to take advantage of it 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.890
 but percent 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.890
 it's the percentage 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.250
 the price supervisor of nine-car housing 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.270
 and why you do not make a pronounced judgment the password it's 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.080
 beautiful 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.910
 it's like that 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.660
 what I saw a lot of trust 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.130
 the judges 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.810
 it's also stronger and stronger why not 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.240
 when a president very good exercise 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.820
 it's obvious 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.700
 then 12 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.740
 already weak why 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.300
 conducted percent 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.820
 in this second period 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.990
 like that 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.880
 president of human relations 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.880
 the first to know it hurts me 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.739
 this case meet at 4 pm your socialist opponent 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.029
 I do not know if it is him who for the moment is gifted 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.029
 or it's me who knows better how to do it 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.039
 but I remain convinced that we can not take the risk of refusing 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.039
 help someone who really needs it 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.340
 at 6 o'clock 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.689
 I'm not going to default 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.479
 for the simple and good reason 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.859
 than looking at the cafes at the airport 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.129
 through a window 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.129
 I see someone who looks to me to be terrible 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:40.049
 my heart is going to 100 per hour
