check<00:05:15.880> out<00:05:16.180> this<00:05:16.360> catch<00:05:16.750> man<00:05:17.080> for<00:05:17.980> a<00:05:18.010> touchdown

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
check out this catch man for a touchdown

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.270 
check out this catch man for a touchdown
so<00:05:18.910> a<00:05:19.150> lot<00:05:20.020> of<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.169> lot<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:20.590> these<00:05:20.680> players<00:05:20.919> play

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
so a lot of a lot of these players play

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.700 
so a lot of a lot of these players play
exactly<00:05:21.640> like<00:05:21.910> me<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.330> then<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:23.500> only<00:05:23.620> thing

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
exactly like me and then the only thing

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.890 
exactly like me and then the only thing
they<00:05:23.919> lack<00:05:24.130> is<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.340> rocket<00:05:24.760> catch<00:05:24.970> so<00:05:25.300> you

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
they lack is the rocket catch so you

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.170 
they lack is the rocket catch so you
know<00:05:26.020> he<00:05:26.230> right<00:05:26.740> there<00:05:26.770> he<00:05:26.980> tried<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.760> do<00:05:28.060> with

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
know he right there he tried to do with

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.790 
know he right there he tried to do with
the<00:05:28.270> rocket<00:05:28.570> catch<00:05:28.780> thing<00:05:29.110> he'd<00:05:29.320> he's

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
the rocket catch thing he'd he's

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.409 
the rocket catch thing he'd he's
probably<00:05:30.070> does<00:05:30.280> not<00:05:30.460> know<00:05:30.640> the<00:05:30.669> rules<00:05:31.030> of

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
probably does not know the rules of

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.270 
probably does not know the rules of
rocket<00:05:31.840> catching<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:32.500> and<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:32.919> rules<00:05:33.190> of

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
rocket catching and and the rules of

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.620 
rocket catching and and the rules of
rocket<00:05:33.610> catching<00:05:33.940> are<00:05:34.060> actually<00:05:34.360> in<00:05:34.450> the

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
rocket catching are actually in the

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.960 
rocket catching are actually in the
rocket<00:05:35.410> catching<00:05:35.740> 101<00:05:36.220> I<00:05:36.250> think<00:05:36.610> it's<00:05:36.760> in<00:05:36.880> the

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
rocket catching 101 I think it's in the

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.240
