these<00:03:55.440> are<00:03:55.500> my<00:03:55.740> display<00:03:56.190> adapters<00:03:56.730> my

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
these are my display adapters my

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.230 
these are my display adapters my
controllers<00:03:58.280> every<00:03:59.280> piece<00:03:59.550> of<00:03:59.580> hardware<00:04:00.030> my

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
controllers every piece of hardware my

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.290 
controllers every piece of hardware my
computer<00:04:00.630> was<00:04:00.810> scanned<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:01.950> imagine<00:04:02.670> if<00:04:03.060> you

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
computer was scanned so imagine if you

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.760 
computer was scanned so imagine if you
wanted<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.660> have<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.960> most<00:04:04.140> updated<00:04:04.410> version

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
wanted to have the most updated version

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.680 
wanted to have the most updated version
of<00:04:05.100> your<00:04:05.250> driver<00:04:05.520> you<00:04:06.120> would<00:04:06.240> actually<00:04:06.390> have

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
of your driver you would actually have

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.990 
of your driver you would actually have
to<00:04:06.750> type<00:04:07.080> this<00:04:07.290> into<00:04:07.560> Google<00:04:07.770> and<00:04:08.310> search

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
to type this into Google and search

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.180 
to type this into Google and search
through<00:04:09.240> each<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.750> every<00:04:09.900> device<00:04:10.380> this

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
through each and every device this

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.660 
through each and every device this
program<00:04:11.940> does<00:04:12.300> it<00:04:12.480> for<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.780> automatically

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
program does it for you automatically

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
program does it for you automatically
imagine<00:04:14.670> if<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.850> had<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.060> do<00:04:15.240> it<00:04:15.360> you'd<00:04:15.510> have

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
imagine if you had to do it you'd have

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.780 
imagine if you had to do it you'd have
to<00:04:15.840> download<00:04:16.260> each<00:04:16.410> driver<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.950> then<00:04:17.400> install

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
to download each driver and then install

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.530 
to download each driver and then install
it<00:04:17.820> now<00:04:18.150> some<00:04:19.110> of<00:04:19.200> these<00:04:19.290> drivers<00:04:19.709> are<00:04:19.860> from

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
it now some of these drivers are from

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.420 
it now some of these drivers are from
2008<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:22.140> know<00:04:22.170> I<00:04:22.260> haven't<00:04:22.650> updated<00:04:22.980> this

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
2008 you know I haven't updated this

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.820 
2008 you know I haven't updated this
driver<00:04:23.700> since<00:04:23.970> 2008<00:04:24.690> there's<00:04:25.230> a<00:04:25.320> version<00:04:25.650> that

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
driver since 2008 there's a version that

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
driver since 2008 there's a version that
was<00:04:25.950> released<00:04:26.040> on<00:04:26.610> October<00:04:27.540> 25th<00:04:28.250> 2010<00:04:29.250> that's

was released on October 25th 2010 that's

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.720 
was released on October 25th 2010 that's
over<00:04:30.390> two<00:04:30.630> years<00:04:31.100> imagine<00:04:32.100> how<00:04:32.280> much<00:04:32.490> better

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
over two years imagine how much better

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.850 
over two years imagine how much better
this<00:04:33.090> hardware<00:04:33.510> is<00:04:33.660> now<00:04:33.900> with<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> newer

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
this hardware is now with a newer

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.020 
this hardware is now with a newer
version<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.430> driver

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
version of the driver

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.900 
version of the driver
no<00:04:36.390> security<00:04:36.780> loopholes<00:04:37.320> no<00:04:37.590> problems<00:04:38.040> I<00:04:38.250> bet

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
no security loopholes no problems I bet

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.970 
no security loopholes no problems I bet
you<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.720> new<00:04:39.930> driver<00:04:40.200> would<00:04:40.500> make<00:04:40.710> this

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
you the new driver would make this

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.280 
you the new driver would make this
Hardware<00:04:41.430> run<00:04:41.700> a<00:04:41.880> lot<00:04:42.300> faster<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.140> lot

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
Hardware run a lot faster and a lot

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.070 
Hardware run a lot faster and a lot
better<00:04:43.670> so<00:04:44.670> as<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:44.880> can<00:04:44.970> see<00:04:45.210> there's<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.840> lot

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
better so as you can see there's a lot

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.350 
better so as you can see there's a lot
of<00:04:46.230> different<00:04:46.500> hardware<00:04:46.830> devices<00:04:47.130> I<00:04:47.550> bet<00:04:48.240> you

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
of different hardware devices I bet you

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.350 
of different hardware devices I bet you
that<00:04:48.540> your<00:04:48.690> computer<00:04:49.170> has<00:04:49.680> 24<00:04:50.550> drivers<00:04:51.180> or

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360
