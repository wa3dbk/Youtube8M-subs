okay<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.429> video<00:00:11.880> I'm<00:00:12.150> going<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.450> do<00:00:12.900> a

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
okay so in this video I'm going to do a

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.589 
okay so in this video I'm going to do a
rendering<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.099> drawing<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.580> did<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.790> a

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
rendering of a drawing I did of a

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.910 
rendering of a drawing I did of a
portrait<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.440> maya<00:00:16.980> angelou<00:00:17.880> okay<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:19.230> pretty

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
portrait of maya angelou okay I pretty

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980 
portrait of maya angelou okay I pretty
much<00:00:20.010> like<00:00:20.279> drew<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.390> pencil<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.869> can

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
much like drew it out in pencil you can

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.359 
much like drew it out in pencil you can
see<00:00:22.199> some<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.529> guidelines<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:23.160> still

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
see some of the guidelines are still

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.339 
see some of the guidelines are still
there<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.810> I'm<00:00:24.810> thinking<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:26.039> using<00:00:26.580> a

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
there and I'm thinking of using a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.279 
there and I'm thinking of using a
stippling<00:00:28.730> method<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.880> time<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> last

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
stippling method this time in the last

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.560 
stippling method this time in the last
video<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:32.009> think<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.120> did<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:35.570> scribbles

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
video I think I did it with scribbles

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.990 
video I think I did it with scribbles
I'm<00:00:36.780> not<00:00:36.899> sure<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.829> mentioned<00:00:38.610> before<00:00:38.730> that

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
I'm not sure but I mentioned before that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.229 
I'm not sure but I mentioned before that
I'm<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.840> doing<00:00:40.610> each<00:00:41.610> portrait

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
I'm going to be doing each portrait

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.060 
I'm going to be doing each portrait
video<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> different<00:00:43.500> technique<00:00:43.800> I've

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
video with a different technique I've

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.770 
video with a different technique I've
used<00:00:44.340> hatching<00:00:44.850> before<00:00:45.210> I've<00:00:45.329> used<00:00:45.539> cross

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
used hatching before I've used cross

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.639 
used hatching before I've used cross
hatching<00:00:46.260> before<00:00:46.620> views<00:00:46.950> um<00:00:47.420> scribbles<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
hatching before views um scribbles and

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.880 
hatching before views um scribbles and
in<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.160> am<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.890> stippling

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
in this one I am going to do a stippling

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.360 
in this one I am going to do a stippling
effect<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.940> think<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:55.340> I'll<00:00:56.340> just

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
effect so I think from here on I'll just

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
effect so I think from here on I'll just
try<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.879> experiment<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.780> different

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
try to experiment with different

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.860 
try to experiment with different
techniques<00:00:58.920> each<00:00:59.190> time<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.670> this<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.660> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
techniques each time and this one is to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.830 
techniques each time and this one is to
show<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.199> how<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> render<00:01:01.980> an<00:01:02.160> entire<00:01:02.840> portrait

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
show you how I render an entire portrait

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.190 
show you how I render an entire portrait
using<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.559> staples<00:01:05.400> alright<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.020> can

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
using just staples alright so as you can

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.960 
using just staples alright so as you can
see<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> outlined<00:01:07.710> some<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> spaces

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
see that I outlined some of the spaces

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.510 
see that I outlined some of the spaces
already<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> basic<00:01:10.890> feel<00:01:11.310> for

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
already and just to get a basic feel for

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.850 
already and just to get a basic feel for
where<00:01:11.670> things<00:01:12.000> are<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.200> I'm<00:01:13.560> just

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
where things are right now so I'm just

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.380 
where things are right now so I'm just
going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.030> I'm<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
going to go in and now I'm going to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.460 
going to go in and now I'm going to
start<00:01:17.240> putting<00:01:18.240> down<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> guidelines

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
start putting down like the guidelines

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.320 
start putting down like the guidelines
and<00:01:19.799> stuff<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.280> alright<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.060> then

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
and stuff like that alright and then

00:01:21.330 --> 00:02:55.350 
and stuff like that alright and then
we'll<00:01:21.479> begin

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:04:15.050 

you

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.920 

you<00:04:16.060> know<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.180> think<00:04:16.239> that's<00:04:16.510> pretty<00:04:16.600> much<00:04:16.780> it

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
you know I think that's pretty much it

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.569 
you know I think that's pretty much it
so<00:04:16.959> if<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.230> notice<00:04:17.500> like<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.829> actually<00:04:18.040> do<00:04:18.400> the

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
so if you notice like I actually do the

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.129 
so if you notice like I actually do the
outline<00:04:19.000> before<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.389> go<00:04:19.540> in<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:19.840> start<00:04:20.079> doing

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
outline before I go in and start doing

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.290 
outline before I go in and start doing
like<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:21.070> renderings<00:04:21.549> from<00:04:21.639> light<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:22.060> dark

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
like the renderings from light to dark

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.110 
like the renderings from light to dark
and<00:04:22.480> I<00:04:22.840> start<00:04:23.139> with<00:04:23.320> really<00:04:23.919> light<00:04:24.610> values

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
and I start with really light values

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.300 
and I start with really light values
first<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.570> then<00:04:25.690> I<00:04:25.780> go<00:04:25.930> deeper<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:26.470> of<00:04:27.100> course

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
first and then I go deeper and of course

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.100 
first and then I go deeper and of course
this<00:04:27.460> could<00:04:27.610> be<00:04:27.760> developed<00:04:28.000> even<00:04:28.419> further<00:04:28.810> but

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
this could be developed even further but

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.960 
this could be developed even further but
this<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.500> just<00:04:29.710> an<00:04:29.830> example<00:04:29.950> to<00:04:30.370> show<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.700> how

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
this is just an example to show you how

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.740 
this is just an example to show you how
you<00:04:31.030> could<00:04:32.190> develop<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.520> portrait<00:04:34.300> in<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.540> same

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
you could develop a portrait in the same

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.830 
you could develop a portrait in the same
way<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:36.340> really<00:04:36.730> takes<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.180> lot<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.360> patience

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
way it really takes a lot of patience

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.310 
way it really takes a lot of patience
and<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:39.310> have<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.700> be<00:04:39.880> careful<00:04:40.720> not<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.110> rush

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
and you have to be careful not to rush

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.370 
and you have to be careful not to rush
it<00:04:41.700> because<00:04:42.700> the<00:04:43.000> thing<00:04:43.180> is<00:04:43.210> when<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:44.020> tend<00:04:44.260> to

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
it because the thing is when you tend to

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.010 
it because the thing is when you tend to
rush<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.800> what<00:04:44.980> happens<00:04:45.340> is<00:04:45.520> that<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:46.570> staples

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
rush it what happens is that the staples

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.530 
rush it what happens is that the staples
or<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.290> dots<00:04:47.530> start<00:04:48.190> becoming<00:04:48.550> marks<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.300> not

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
or the dots start becoming marks and not

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.100 
or the dots start becoming marks and not
dots<00:04:50.110> okay<00:04:50.590> so<00:04:51.220> you<00:04:51.790> want<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.270> keep<00:04:52.810> the

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
dots okay so you want to keep the

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.520 
dots okay so you want to keep the
pressure<00:04:53.590> really<00:04:53.950> even<00:04:54.430> on<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.669> pen<00:04:54.880> so<00:04:55.530> that

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
pressure really even on the pen so that

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.640 
pressure really even on the pen so that
all<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:57.010> points<00:04:57.220> are<00:04:57.580> even<00:04:58.000> as<00:04:58.230> you<00:04:59.230> develop

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
all the points are even as you develop

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.870 
all the points are even as you develop
them<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:01.169> it<00:05:02.169> will<00:05:02.290> just<00:05:02.490> naturally<00:05:03.490> create

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
them and it will just naturally create

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.040 
them and it will just naturally create
that<00:05:04.120> sense<00:05:04.600> of<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.550> line<00:05:06.760> and<00:05:07.120> structure

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
that sense of of a line and structure

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.629 
that sense of of a line and structure
and<00:05:08.200> value<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:10.240> also<00:05:11.130> what<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:12.160> do<00:05:12.250> is<00:05:12.520> in

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
and value so and also what I do is in

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.670 
and value so and also what I do is in
the<00:05:12.729> areas<00:05:13.030> that<00:05:13.060> are<00:05:13.210> lighter<00:05:13.450> I<00:05:13.720> just<00:05:13.960> spaced

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
the areas that are lighter I just spaced

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.920 
the areas that are lighter I just spaced
out<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:15.190> dots<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.669> little<00:05:15.970> bit<00:05:16.060> more<00:05:16.300> I<00:05:16.510> keep

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
out the dots a little bit more I keep

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.540 
out the dots a little bit more I keep
them<00:05:17.080> more<00:05:17.260> dense<00:05:17.500> in<00:05:17.710> areas<00:05:18.040> where<00:05:18.250> I'm

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
them more dense in areas where I'm

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.790 
them more dense in areas where I'm
indicating<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.240> lot<00:05:19.390> of<00:05:19.510> shadow<00:05:19.720> and<00:05:19.990> that<00:05:20.530> just

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
indicating a lot of shadow and that just

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:30.300 
indicating a lot of shadow and that just
pretty<00:05:21.160> much<00:05:21.310> takes<00:05:21.520> care<00:05:21.610> of<00:05:21.760> itself

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.509 

yep<00:05:31.340> that's<00:05:31.789> pretty<00:05:32.180> much<00:05:32.300> it
