see what that fall cool it is
okay<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:15.980> finally<00:03:16.220> got<00:03:16.490> that<00:03:16.640> paper<00:03:16.940> clip<00:03:17.240> in

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
okay I finally got that paper clip in

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.700 
okay I finally got that paper clip in
didn't<00:03:17.840> take<00:03:17.990> too<00:03:18.170> long

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
didn't take too long

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.350 
didn't take too long
just<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.340> little<00:03:19.550> bit<00:03:19.670> too<00:03:19.820> neat<00:03:20.000> limb<00:03:20.210> because

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
just a little bit too neat limb because

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.380 
just a little bit too neat limb because
of<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.750> angle<00:03:21.050> but<00:03:21.200> it's<00:03:21.350> in<00:03:21.500> there<00:03:21.680> now

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
of the angle but it's in there now

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:40.930 
of the angle but it's in there now
enough<00:03:23.390> stick<00:03:24.230> up<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.560> cold<00:03:37.870> c28<00:03:39.580> and<00:03:40.580> since

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
enough stick up the cold c28 and since

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.730 
enough stick up the cold c28 and since
I've<00:03:41.090> I've<00:03:41.240> done<00:03:41.450> some<00:03:41.630> research<00:03:41.780> on<00:03:42.200> this<00:03:42.410> I

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
I've I've done some research on this I

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.870 
I've I've done some research on this I
know<00:03:43.070> that's<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.580> secondary<00:03:44.440> throttle<00:03:45.440> valve

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
know that's the secondary throttle valve

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.920 
know that's the secondary throttle valve
actuator<00:03:46.880> they're<00:03:47.600> too<00:03:48.110> close<00:03:48.350> for<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.930> going

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
actuator they're too close for so going

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.570 
actuator they're too close for so going
straight<00:03:51.380> from<00:03:51.560> here<00:03:51.770> I'm<00:03:51.950> going<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.220> proceed

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
straight from here I'm going to proceed

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:00.550 
straight from here I'm going to proceed
to<00:03:53.980> I'm<00:03:55.360> going<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.510> proceed<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.670> opening<00:03:58.670> it<00:03:59.560> up

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
to I'm going to proceed to opening it up

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.600 
to I'm going to proceed to opening it up
and<00:04:01.060> looking<00:04:02.060> at<00:04:02.240> my<00:04:02.450> second<00:04:03.290> my<00:04:03.610> my

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
and looking at my second my my

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.980 
and looking at my second my my
butterflies<00:04:05.150> my<00:04:05.360> secondary<00:04:05.810> throttle

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
butterflies my secondary throttle

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.380 
butterflies my secondary throttle
actuator<00:04:06.740> and<00:04:07.340> look<00:04:07.459> at<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:07.640> butterflies<00:04:08.150> and

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
actuator and look at the butterflies and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.870 
actuator and look at the butterflies and
make<00:04:08.510> sure<00:04:08.720> your<00:04:09.320> cycling<00:04:09.830> properly<00:04:10.340> and

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
make sure your cycling properly and

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.490 
make sure your cycling properly and
that's<00:04:11.540> something<00:04:11.690> too<00:04:11.840> right<00:04:11.870> now<00:04:12.140> I'm<00:04:12.320> going

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
that's something too right now I'm going

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.539 
that's something too right now I'm going
to<00:04:12.590> start<00:04:13.010> by<00:04:13.250> taking<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:15.020> tank<00:04:15.709> up<00:04:15.980> right

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
to start by taking the tank up right

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.880 
to start by taking the tank up right
here<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:17.980> believe<00:04:18.980> this<00:04:19.359> this<00:04:20.359> these<00:04:21.350> two<00:04:21.650> right

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
here I believe this this these two right

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.720 
here I believe this this these two right
here<00:04:21.919> I<00:04:22.430> have<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.570> pick<00:04:24.020> up<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:25.010> I<00:04:25.160> got<00:04:25.490> the

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
here I have to pick up and I got the

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.659 
here I have to pick up and I got the
feet<00:04:26.570> up<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.320> I<00:04:27.650> believe<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:28.010> just<00:04:28.040> tilt<00:04:28.490> it

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
feet up and I believe I just tilt it

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.490 
feet up and I believe I just tilt it
straight<00:04:29.120> up<00:04:29.150> so<00:04:29.630> we're<00:04:29.900> going<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.110> find<00:04:30.320> out

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
straight up so we're going to find out

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.400 
straight up so we're going to find out
here<00:04:30.620> in<00:04:30.740> a<00:04:30.770> second<00:04:31.280> that's<00:04:31.640> Houston

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
here in a second that's Houston

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.710 
here in a second that's Houston
so<00:04:34.040> you<00:04:34.460> have<00:04:34.580> after<00:04:34.760> taking<00:04:35.120> these<00:04:35.390> two

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
so you have after taking these two

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.060 
so you have after taking these two
screws<00:04:36.110> off<00:04:36.350> right<00:04:36.650> there

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
screws off right there

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.160 
screws off right there
which<00:04:37.250> we're<00:04:38.030> on<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.240> tank<00:04:38.480> light<00:04:38.720> right

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
which we're on the tank light right

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.500 
which we're on the tank light right
there<00:04:39.200> right<00:04:39.950> there<00:04:40.190> just<00:04:40.850> two<00:04:41.000> screws<00:04:41.150> at<00:04:41.480> the

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
there right there just two screws at the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.440 
there right there just two screws at the
top<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:43.160> know<00:04:43.280> that's<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.700> little<00:04:44.270> stick

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
top and you know that's a little stick

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.490 
top and you know that's a little stick
to<00:04:44.570> hold<00:04:44.720> tank<00:04:45.020> up<00:04:45.730> got<00:04:46.730> that<00:04:46.910> up<00:04:47.060> now<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:48.320> now

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
to hold tank up got that up now so now

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.620 
to hold tank up got that up now so now
I'm<00:04:48.620> looking<00:04:48.770> at<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:51.020> air<00:04:51.200> box<00:04:52.060> air<00:04:53.060> box<00:04:53.330> right

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
I'm looking at the air box air box right

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.540 
I'm looking at the air box air box right
here<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.080> I<00:04:54.590> want<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.860> get<00:04:54.950> that<00:04:55.160> out<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.520> way
