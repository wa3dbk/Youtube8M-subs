00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.140
 for a 40 event dying fashion diner 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.780
 before 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.040
 held in this beautiful 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.250

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.310
 railway station 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.980
 I think of what was once a 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.840
 scanning at the station is opposite and here 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.370
 behind me is this event that 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.620
 precisely it is called modaprima there are 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.110
 all these exhibitors who are part 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.930
 of the international fast mesh market 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.100

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.380
 parts of the world is a very thing 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.180
 interesting for lovers 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.550
 fashionistas for fashion ahead and 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.740
 that I will show you in super anti 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.560
 very early spring collections 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.920
 summer 2014 and I know there is also some 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.190
 high level piece 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.509
 let's look at why there are so many things 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.790
 all beautiful concerning fashion with 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.899
 lots of new features concerning 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.899
 spring Summer Autumn Winter 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.009
 no 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.149
 here are a lot of clothes 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.200
 details because it will change a color 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.060
 under 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.060
 so it's a dress on my variants 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.160
 gets tired 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.670
 slight exposure 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.670
 Sunglasses 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.930
 change colour 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.870
 no 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.010
 then I was recently in Japan 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.019
 in short, literally in love with them 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.760
 of their culture and their estimates 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.950
 so I just saw this stand and I have 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.700
 read about this union between two cultures 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.870
 Italian and Japanese 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.459
 what can you tell us about this mango 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.739
 I guess it unites these two cultures 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.980
 then this line was born 15 years ago 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.140
 from passion for my happiness such as 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.650
 for their culture 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.930
 obviously 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.310
 it is a passion that has it 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.410
 through 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.660
 fashion is the fashion tradition of 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.310
 I bought books in Japan 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.709
 socket 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.570
 in japan I was able to admire the 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.010
 beauty of art 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.440
 tradition of their traditional clothes 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.710
 who came in kimono 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.680
 z but for the summer season they use 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.450
 and therefore from my passion for fashion 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.740
 and for Japanese culture we have 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.350
 thought to combine these two 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.410
 features of this brand that makes 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.060
 the culture of style and in italy con 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.490
 against the Japanese therefore we have 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.169
 started this line where there are gods 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.120
 Western accountants obviously 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.460
 the massacre, however, with these inserts 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.409
 they are all made of cotton fabric 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.999
 the goods papa therefore precisely the fabric 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.639
 that use japan for the 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:57.620
 delicate rehabilitation have been 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.510
 directly from 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.280
 so in effect a made in 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.620
 italy participates as it uses to cut 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.889
 but this is a couple of rituals 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.560
 game fabric 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.389
 obviously in Italy they resume the 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.400
 traditional culture this shirt for 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.039
 example to this insert below the 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.110
 breast to remind certain lobby that 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.990
 belt that closes with a kimono 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.330
 it's here 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.550
 designed with the woman in mind but not 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.940
 only 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.650
 superimposed and fall very well indeed 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.569
 kimono never hit without feet 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.909
 then do the vestina 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.659
 it's a princess we always have 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.659
 updated to impest 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.870
 we have created this effect and the 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.729
 kimono and killed 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.569
 east black west merging 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.569
 together with the aggressor 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.680
