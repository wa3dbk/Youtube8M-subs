00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
you're pretty much invulnerable OG when

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.280 
you're pretty much invulnerable OG when
when<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:53.910> are<00:02:54.090> chain<00:02:54.420> saw<00:02:54.660> somebody<00:02:54.930> until

of cool in there we found that they

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.979 
of cool in there we found that they
change<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.000> glitz<00:03:00.270> where<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.510> can<00:03:00.660> just<00:03:00.690> run

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
change so glitz where you can just run

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.360 
change so glitz where you can just run
straight<00:03:01.140> through<00:03:01.320> somebody<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.040> break<00:03:02.220> away

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
straight through somebody to break away

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.759 
straight through somebody to break away
from<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.610> chainsaw<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.360> are<00:03:03.780> ruined<00:03:04.230> while

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
from the chainsaw and are ruined while

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.500 
from the chainsaw and are ruined while
the<00:03:04.950> sequences<00:03:05.430> go<00:03:05.550> I'm<00:03:05.670> in<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.090> much<00:03:06.120> stuffing

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
the sequences go I'm in so much stuffing

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.900 
the sequences go I'm in so much stuffing
here's<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.959> world<00:03:07.170> one<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.530> we<00:03:07.890> used<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
here's the world one that we used the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.520 
here's the world one that we used the
glitz<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.300> export<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.930> like<00:03:10.170> if<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.380> been

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
glitz and export like I like if you been

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.750 
glitz and export like I like if you been
around<00:03:10.769> since<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.130> first<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.519> that<00:03:11.550> are

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
around since the first is that are

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.460 
around since the first is that are
sliding<00:03:12.269> care<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.600> stuff<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.959> all<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.110> shit
