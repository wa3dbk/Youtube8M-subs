00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.930
 read the instructions here comes 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.400
 everything they are going to do as well as I just 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.370
 I'm going to do 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.980
 this tutorial now 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.290
 I'm going to close this good first thing 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.430
 let's do as it says here is to install 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.830
 the rectal crack 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.830
 good string we copy 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.570
 the crack 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.220
 we wait for him to escape 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.240
 we give you a copy to replace 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.320
 so that it works for them and does not give them any 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.350
 Type of problem 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.990
 delete the gta san andreas that has the 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.770
 gta 5 that have 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.189
 and unzip it again if they have already 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.000
 installed another crack other that has not 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.310
 served 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.530
 this is so that I do not give them any kind 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.530
 of problems now we go with the 5 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.860
 hit a folder 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.740
 how can you replace 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.849
 then we go 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.849
 to the folder that says crack 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.100
 supposedly with this with this crack not 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:53.590
 there is a need to install the social club 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:57.040
 but you install it just in case 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:01.269
 I have it installed and I'm going to let you 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.290
 the link can leave the video that I 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.300
 I have the other crack than what I went up 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.070
 good here says 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.650
 this step we are going to do of the 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.510
 next good way we already occupy the 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.360
 three other steps that would be 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.870
 the first the second the third good 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.640
 let's go with the room 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:29.300
 for those of us to do the fourth step 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:32.130
 how right here says let's go to the folder 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.090
 a pepe data 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:40.620
 we copy this this address 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.590
 we open we give here at home team and 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.470
 we are going 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.730
 does scheduled is good once 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.709
 you fashion in programs dating this that says 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.590
 here you are and the club I think no no no 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.209
 we will leave then what we are going to 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.209
 do for that will be 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:07.040
 well we minimize this and the launcher 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.030
 that is here that came out in gta 5 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.280
 we execute it 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.930
 once we execute it we are going to 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.240
 enter the gta I think it will throw us 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.780
 a student error if he does not throw them the 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.190
 error anyway will enter normal 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.710
 this to the story mode then you 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.970
 they close the story mode and copy these 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.060
 files that are here 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.180
 these files that are here these two 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.660
 they beat him in this social club folder 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.390
 rl t 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.080
 they go to this folder which is 27 15 90 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:43.490
 and here they copy these two files 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.490
 just as I have them 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.259
 and that would be all already be 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.409
 completely full to play it in the way 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.409
 history 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.170
 the good gta and the gta lunch to click 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.320
 straight 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:03.540
 properties of block compatibility 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.990
 execute as administrator apply and 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:11.870
 accept well that would be all and now 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.600
 let's see if it works 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.840
 let's see if it works if it gets slow 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.220
 the game is because good if you see it slow 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.220
 you because I'm recording 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.440

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.930

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.310

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:45.310
 record but now we already go back 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:55.249
 as you see it works completely 

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:57.080
 problems wait for him to charge for 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:01.360
 they see that it does not give any kind of 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.360
 problems and goes super 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.600
