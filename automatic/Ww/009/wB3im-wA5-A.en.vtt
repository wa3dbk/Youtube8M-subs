tournament drag racing I want to get
into<00:03:29.359> more<00:03:29.540> drifting<00:03:30.019> I<00:03:30.169> started<00:03:30.560> using<00:03:30.709> the

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
into more drifting I started using the

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.539 
into more drifting I started using the
wheel<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.069> lot<00:03:31.370> more<00:03:31.579> and<00:03:31.849> the<00:03:32.780> wheel<00:03:32.989> is<00:03:33.549> really

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
wheel a lot more and the wheel is really

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.430 
wheel a lot more and the wheel is really
I've<00:03:35.120> seen<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.389> nice<00:03:35.690> improvement<00:03:36.079> with<00:03:36.349> the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
I've seen a nice improvement with the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.750 
I've seen a nice improvement with the
wheel<00:03:37.870> I've<00:03:38.870> been<00:03:39.019> actually<00:03:39.609> actually<00:03:40.609> able

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
wheel I've been actually actually able

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.110 
wheel I've been actually actually able
to<00:03:40.879> drift<00:03:41.120> down<00:03:41.209> lately<00:03:41.659> so<00:03:42.019> that's<00:03:42.229> been<00:03:42.440> good

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
to drift down lately so that's been good

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.580 
to drift down lately so that's been good
before<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.629> all<00:03:44.870> over<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.109> road<00:03:45.349> and<00:03:45.379> I

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
before this all over the road and I

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.530 
before this all over the road and I
couldn't<00:03:45.859> do<00:03:45.979> shit<00:03:46.280> but<00:03:46.389> I've<00:03:47.389> actually

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
couldn't do shit but I've actually

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.610 
couldn't do shit but I've actually
gotten<00:03:47.930> better<00:03:47.959> with<00:03:48.199> it

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
gotten better with it

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.879 
gotten better with it
and<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:50.209> think<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:51.229> wheel<00:03:51.409> is<00:03:51.560> gonna<00:03:51.620> be

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
and I think the wheel is gonna be

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.750 
and I think the wheel is gonna be
helping<00:03:52.189> me<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.340> lot<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:54.370> would<00:03:55.370> like<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.639> do

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
helping me a lot so I would like to do

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.599 
helping me a lot so I would like to do
some<00:03:55.939> more<00:03:55.970> open<00:03:56.359> lobbies<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:58.010> maybe<00:03:58.340> some

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
some more open lobbies and maybe some

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.860 
some more open lobbies and maybe some
lobbies<00:03:59.000> it's<00:03:59.150> all<00:03:59.299> to<00:03:59.479> where<00:03:59.659> it's<00:03:59.780> just

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
lobbies it's all to where it's just

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.030 
lobbies it's all to where it's just
strictly<00:04:00.939> actual<00:04:01.939> real<00:04:02.180> users<00:04:02.629> I<00:04:02.900> think<00:04:03.739> that

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
strictly actual real users I think that

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.320 
strictly actual real users I think that
would<00:04:04.159> be<00:04:04.189> pretty<00:04:04.400> sick

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.090 

it's<00:04:10.330> a<00:04:10.390> big<00:04:10.569> one<00:04:10.780> I<00:04:10.990> want<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.260> get<00:04:11.350> into<00:04:11.500> just<00:04:11.800> a

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
it's a big one I want to get into just a

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.390 
it's a big one I want to get into just a
wheel<00:04:12.370> Bobby<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:13.560> see<00:04:14.560> how<00:04:14.709> everyone<00:04:14.980> stacks
