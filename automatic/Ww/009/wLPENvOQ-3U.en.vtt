00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
welcome to episode 2 of need for speed

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.680 
welcome to episode 2 of need for speed
up<00:00:16.080> suit<00:00:16.410> gameplay<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.240> this<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.330> not<00:00:18.420> live<00:00:18.660> so

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
up suit gameplay and this is not live so

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.720 
up suit gameplay and this is not live so
I'm<00:00:19.320> trying<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.619> talk<00:00:19.680> about<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.279> few<00:00:20.400> things

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
I'm trying to talk about a few things

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.640 
I'm trying to talk about a few things
about<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.630> game<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.080> some<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> games

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
about this game and some of the games

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.220 
about this game and some of the games
just<00:00:22.800> comparing<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.779> basically

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
just comparing it with this so basically

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.109 
just comparing it with this so basically
first<00:00:26.160> off<00:00:26.810> you<00:00:27.810> know<00:00:27.900> Neffe<00:00:28.080> speed<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:29.189> no

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
first off you know Neffe speed is no

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.780 
first off you know Neffe speed is no
action<00:00:30.570> packed<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.399> you<00:00:32.399> can't<00:00:32.640> really

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
action packed and you can't really

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.000 
action packed and you can't really
compare<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.420> gran<00:00:33.660> turismo<00:00:34.170> simply

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
compare it to gran turismo simply

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.000 
compare it to gran turismo simply
because<00:00:35.309> gran<00:00:35.640> turismo<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:37.010> real-life

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
because gran turismo is a real-life

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.490 
because gran turismo is a real-life
space<00:00:38.399> game<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.629> pretty<00:00:40.110> much<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
space game so it's pretty much like a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.350 
space game so it's pretty much like a
simulator<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.809> professional<00:00:42.809> driver<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
simulator to a professional driver and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.430 
simulator to a professional driver and
nifA<00:00:45.360> speed<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.989> them<00:00:47.059> you<00:00:48.059> know<00:00:48.180> them

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
nifA speed is just them you know them

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.270 
nifA speed is just them you know them
how<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.590> call<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:51.590> those<00:00:52.590> games<00:00:52.800> where<00:00:53.100> you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
how do you call it those games where you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.459 
how do you call it those games where you
pretty<00:00:53.730> much<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:54.000> fun<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.480> let<00:00:54.690> ray<00:00:54.870> /<00:00:54.930> for

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
pretty much have fun just let ray / for

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.049 
pretty much have fun just let ray / for
each<00:00:55.530> other<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.309> me<00:00:56.430> let<00:00:56.610> cause

each other up you get me let cause

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.479 
each other up you get me let cause
criterion<00:00:57.690> games<00:00:57.800> originally<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:59.250> burnout

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
criterion games originally from burnout

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.610 
criterion games originally from burnout
paradise<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:00.570> were<00:01:00.870> pretty<00:01:00.899> much<00:01:01.350> all

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
paradise and they were pretty much all

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.039 
paradise and they were pretty much all
about<00:01:01.890> smashing<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.699> cars<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.930> know

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
about smashing up cars and you know

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.440 
about smashing up cars and you know
competitive<00:01:04.979> stuff<00:01:05.250> even<00:01:06.090> though<00:01:06.150> gran

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
competitive stuff even though gran

competitive stuff even though gran
turismo<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.049> competitive<00:01:07.650> stuff<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
turismo is competitive stuff but the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.760 
turismo is competitive stuff but the
majority<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> time<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.140> all<00:01:10.229> about<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
majority of the time is all about the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.710 
majority of the time is all about the
way<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.979> drive<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.760> skill<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.150> driving

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
way you drive and the skill of driving

whereas<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.340> know<00:01:14.430> need<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.700> speed<00:01:15.080> hop

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
whereas in you know need to speed hop

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.320 
whereas in you know need to speed hop
see<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.890> about<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.369> having<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.729> escape<00:01:18.119> from

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
see what about you having to escape from

you're always taking the lead no matter

you're always taking the lead no matter
how<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.520> drive<00:01:24.020> but<00:01:25.020> long<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.830> what

you're doing and know how to do that

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.340 
you're doing and know how to do that
technical<00:01:29.009> things<00:01:29.340> such<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.759> drifting<00:01:30.630> you're

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
technical things such as drifting you're

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.770 
technical things such as drifting you're
perfectly<00:01:31.920> fine<00:01:32.280> need<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:32.790> speed<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
perfectly fine need for speed but you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
perfectly fine need for speed but you
know<00:01:33.930> there's<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.350> lot<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.549> Gran

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
know there's a lot more to it in Gran

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.450 
know there's a lot more to it in Gran
Turismo<00:01:36.229> not<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.470> can't<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:37.890> drift<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
Turismo not you can't really drift you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.030 
Turismo not you can't really drift you
know<00:01:38.670> because<00:01:39.079> there's<00:01:40.079> two<00:01:40.350> types<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.770> drills

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
know because there's two types of drills

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.370 
know because there's two types of drills
Breaking<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.150> gran<00:01:42.420> turismo<00:01:42.960> there's<00:01:43.200> one

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
Breaking and gran turismo there's one

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.880 
Breaking and gran turismo there's one
circle<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.520> square<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:45.320> normally<00:01:46.320> do<00:01:46.560> square

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
circle and square I normally do square

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.429 
circle and square I normally do square
by<00:01:47.070> circle<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.820> slightly<00:01:48.180> drifting<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.290> it's

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
by circle is slightly drifting but it's

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.149 
by circle is slightly drifting but it's
really<00:01:49.799> hard<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.130> control<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.540> know<00:01:52.159> need

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
really hard to control so you know need

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.859 
really hard to control so you know need
for<00:01:53.310> speed<00:01:53.340> i<00:01:53.549> think<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.240> drifting<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.720> it's

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
for speed i think the drifting and it's

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.260 
for speed i think the drifting and it's
much<00:01:55.110> more<00:01:55.350> easy<00:01:55.710> i<00:01:55.979> guess<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.030> want<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
much more easy i guess if you want to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.010 
much more easy i guess if you want to
say<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.159> but<00:01:59.159> anyway<00:01:59.340> um<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.479> really

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
say it like that but anyway um so really

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.899 
say it like that but anyway um so really
you<00:02:01.200> can't<00:02:01.409> compare<00:02:01.829> or<00:02:02.130> both<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.549> games

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
you can't compare or both these games

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.039 
you can't compare or both these games
because<00:02:03.270> I've<00:02:03.420> been<00:02:03.450> getting<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> lot<00:02:03.990> of

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
because I've been getting a lot of

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.450 
because I've been getting a lot of
messages<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.799> do<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.950> think<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.280> better

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
messages what do you think is better

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.950 
messages what do you think is better
need<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.850> speed<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.180> Gran<00:02:06.299> Turismo<00:02:06.570> that's

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
need for speed of Gran Turismo that's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.080 
need for speed of Gran Turismo that's
why<00:02:07.079> I've<00:02:07.170> both<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.590> these<00:02:07.680> games<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.250> didn't

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
why I've both of these games and didn't

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.449 
why I've both of these games and didn't
really<00:02:09.179> give<00:02:09.420> back<00:02:09.629> any<00:02:09.959> because<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:11.009> know<00:02:11.069> that

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
really give back any because I know that

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.950 
really give back any because I know that
they're<00:02:12.180> completely<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
they're completely the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.170 
they're completely the
games<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.680> can't<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.220> compare<00:02:14.580> even

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
games and can't really compare even

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.440 
games and can't really compare even
though<00:02:15.270> they're<00:02:15.540> both<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.960> same<00:02:15.990> genre

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
though they're both the same genre

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.440 
though they're both the same genre
vocalizing<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.500> know<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:21.300> whole

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
vocalizing but you know the whole

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.100 
vocalizing but you know the whole
concept<00:02:21.750> was<00:02:22.110> different<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:24.810> know<00:02:24.840> Gran

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
concept was different and you know Gran

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.900 
concept was different and you know Gran
Turismo<00:02:25.260> has<00:02:25.590> more<00:02:25.800> car<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.610> got<00:02:26.760> big

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
Turismo has more car so it's got big

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.510 
Turismo has more car so it's got big
advantage<00:02:27.420> with<00:02:27.540> more<00:02:27.750> variety<00:02:28.350> but<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:29.370> know

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
advantage with more variety but you know

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.000 
advantage with more variety but you know
at<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> same<00:02:30.000> time<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.630> can<00:02:30.660> get<00:02:31.140> slightly

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
at the same time it can get slightly

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.460 
at the same time it can get slightly
boring<00:02:32.580> whereas<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.720> Nick's<00:02:34.290> speed<00:02:34.610> no<00:02:36.470> there

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
boring whereas in Nick's speed no there

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.340 
boring whereas in Nick's speed no there
is<00:02:37.710> no<00:02:37.980> overlap<00:02:38.370> there's<00:02:38.820> hardly<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.690> variety

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
is no overlap there's hardly a variety

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.640 
is no overlap there's hardly a variety
but<00:02:40.820> there's<00:02:41.820> just<00:02:42.180> action-packed<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.500> it's

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
but there's just action-packed so it's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.020 
but there's just action-packed so it's
always<00:02:43.800> going<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.130> keep<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.490> awake<00:02:44.730> if<00:02:44.970> you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
always going to keep you awake if you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.580 
always going to keep you awake if you
know<00:02:45.120> what<00:02:45.240> I<00:02:45.270> mean<00:02:45.330> right<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.290> there's<00:02:46.470> all

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
know what I mean right so there's all

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.980 
know what I mean right so there's all
there's<00:02:46.830> always<00:02:47.040> ups<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.400> downs<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.820> games<00:02:48.060> or

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
there's always ups and downs on games or

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.290 
there's always ups and downs on games or
between<00:02:49.260> both<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.770> these<00:02:50.160> two<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.700> know<00:02:50.970> I

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
between both to these two so you know I

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.440 
between both to these two so you know I
guess<00:02:52.170> balance<00:02:53.040> either<00:02:53.550> way<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.860> anyway<00:02:56.450> I'm

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
guess balance either way so anyway I'm

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.210 
guess balance either way so anyway I'm
just<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.020> plane<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.650> when<00:02:58.770> I<00:02:58.800> want<00:02:59.040> with<00:02:59.160> this

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
just the plane and when I want with this

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.030 
just the plane and when I want with this
guy<00:03:00.050> because<00:03:01.050> other<00:03:01.410> people<00:03:01.740> could<00:03:01.890> not

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
guy because other people could not

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.550 
guy because other people could not
connect<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.610> should<00:03:02.910> be<00:03:03.090> eight<00:03:03.270> players<00:03:03.600> but

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
connect it should be eight players but

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.220 
connect it should be eight players but
there's<00:03:04.680> only<00:03:04.740> one<00:03:04.860> personnel<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:07.080> could

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
there's only one personnel so you could

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.390 
there's only one personnel so you could
just<00:03:07.320> call<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> one-on-one<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.310> i
