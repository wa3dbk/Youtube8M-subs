about<00:00:14.709> cat<00:00:15.010> vaccinations

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:19.519 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.890 

there<00:00:20.519> are<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.759> lot<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.029> cat<00:00:21.419> vaccines

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
there are a lot of cat vaccines

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.019 
there are a lot of cat vaccines
available<00:00:22.079> we<00:00:22.919> only<00:00:23.130> recommend<00:00:23.400> three<00:00:23.849> of

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
available we only recommend three of

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.749 
available we only recommend three of
them<00:00:24.179> the<00:00:24.630> reason<00:00:24.929> for<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:26.009> most<00:00:26.520> of

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
them the reason for that is that most of

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.550 
them the reason for that is that most of
them<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.060> feel<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.509> the<00:00:27.599> benefits<00:00:27.869> don't

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
them I feel that the benefits don't

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.799 
them I feel that the benefits don't
outweigh<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.130> risk<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.939> downsides<00:00:30.509> and<00:00:30.689> the

outweigh the risk the downsides and the

outweigh the risk the downsides and the
risks<00:00:31.259> have<00:00:31.739> to<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.160> outweighed<00:00:32.759> by<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
risks have to be outweighed by the

risks have to be outweighed by the
benefits<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.079> all<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.409> through<00:00:34.739> we
