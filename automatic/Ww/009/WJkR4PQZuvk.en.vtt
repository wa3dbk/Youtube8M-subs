00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.980
 the beach of san juan del sur is located on the pacific coast of 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.309
 Nicaragua 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.240
 although sea turtles spend most of their lives offshore 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.099
 When the time comes they leave looking for a safe place to spawn 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.179
 there are only seven beaches in the world where they arrive massively 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.489
 they tend to give birth 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.539
 they deposit an average of 100 bodies each 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.020
 although of the turtles that are born very few they will be adult 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.990
 currently its main predator is the human being 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.640
 although there are those who try to change this reality the merchants or way of 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.670
 life ei 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.160
 still has not found another alternative or maybe we do not find in 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.320
 how to the right mechanism for 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.100
 completely eradicate 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 the Nicaraguan government believed to have found a solution 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.940
 the 40 dollars to people who walk 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.940
 he survived from collecting turtle eggs 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 they seem to have assumed 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.990
 tone housing osalan the solution 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.590
 we see what 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.020
 basically if we are not only depending on the good product or what 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.220
 we are going to do is disappear the species 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.940
 also soldiers police guards forest and bolivia 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.649
 they stand guard on the beach to protect the turtles and uploaded 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.560
 after seven to eight weeks the pups are born 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.190
 I had newborns 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.420
 they also seek the sea 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.670
 many will not arrive 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.990
 beyond governmental actions, only the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.229
 survival of sea turtles 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.570
 when the population was created a true ecological conscience 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.829
 although the commercialization of turtle eggs has recently been typified 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.710
 as an environmental crime 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.420
 still many or for fear of justice are willing to 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.420
 stop your partners 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:17.399
 slowly 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.579
 2 on 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.370
 according to international environmental organizations 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:27.289
 the marketing of meat 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:31.319
 turtle games annually produces more than half a million dollars
