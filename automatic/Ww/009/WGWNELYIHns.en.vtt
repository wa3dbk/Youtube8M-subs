00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:09.560
 I will put almost near you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.560
 so is better focused on their feet and 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.450
 fly 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.130
 hello my name is Lena and we 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.480
 continue our video tutorials and instructional 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.279
 roller skating 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 today we look at one of the species 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.930
 slide and dima will help me in this 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.519
 why because I tell you honestly I 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.620
 type layers is not possible to make smarter 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.120
 of course learn but why study 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.220
 most if you can take a specialist 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.409
 which will show this much better line 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.879
 the latter will be on the rollers practically 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.860
 I did not skate because I worked 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.899
 dolphinarium to about a year 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.890
 I swam with dolphins principle I did 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.839
 just envy 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.420
 but we now see it as one video 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.370
 these are the fighting videos 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.129
 a little bit something is broken off by something to tor 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.600
 on but nevertheless they still drove I 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.309
 I will ask Dima to comment a little 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.740
 these are all preparatory exercises 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.509
 which there try to mark on 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.170
 how much do we have already puts you 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.170
 Well, let's get started 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.220
 here is dima showing this slide he 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.100
 being made of backwards moving 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.470
 about how to ride backwards we 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.780
 viewed with you in one of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.690
 previous video tutorials so now not 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.530
 we will dwell on this in detail 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.530
 here is such a slide 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.409
 the length of the leg looks at my supporting leg 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.409
 we change support legs 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.520
 But Dima thinks how to explain these 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.289
 preparatory exercise he is not their 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.390
 already explained ten times but on camera 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.789
 we can not try to explain I 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.290
 so look here you 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.080
 preparatory such a position is simple 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.879
 then you put the rollers perpendicular 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.799
 one to another and do this 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:24.440
 fix movement yes let's ask where 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.510
 we repeat again essentially that leg 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.849
 which now looks at me is 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.730
 we have a different leg shape which is to her 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.450
 perpendicular we will go on it 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.670
 here we are a little bit so we push off 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.260
 on one leg and the second see starts 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.540
 so a little bit to slide that is she 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.790
 performs such a braking function 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.970
 it is advisable to learn to do it 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.709
 movement on both sides 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.870
 but an ordinary person turns on one 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.639
 well the second one is already harder but it 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.630
 quite normal here let's go again 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.630
 consider the movement itself 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.689
 You see, he drove well but it 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.579
 quite a complex element that will take 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:09.840
 you have some time to study 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:12.409
 let 's see again so now 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:18.239
 I will show in the general plan 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:20.609
 They were given one more time if we are so far 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:27.870
 rolled away but this is now directly 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:30.209
 in motion he made here see Dima 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.840
 moves backwards then he alone 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.760
 gets the leg like this 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.449
 her body weight and begins to slide 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.449
 other foot 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.700
 the sun is a bit in the way let's now 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.370
 once again try to see that is here 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.810
 he's on his way 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.810
 his foot movement went 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.310
 in fact, everything is just the main thing a little bit 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.310
 sort out 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.750
 the leg went back and here is the very end element 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.670
 I 'll ask Dima to do it in full 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:30.970
 speeds make you appreciate all the beauty 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:38.500
 a similar element is very important by the way 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.500
 colleagues work knees and because 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.590
 note the position of the legs in 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.450
 the end of this slide we have 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.730
 supporting leg see very bent in 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.430
 knee another divergent leg she 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.730
 fully extended with the knees 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.320
 it is desirable to be close to each other 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.150
 friend but one is a little uncomfortable 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.400
 show in this position therefore 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.669
 position may be different now we 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.669
 ask him the other side to show yes 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.919
 You see, it will look like this 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.540
 i.e. legs together and body position 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.210
 pay attention to what should be 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.610
 tilted because otherwise you have nothing 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.260
 Now do not get this position can be 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.160
 at first exactly the same as we are now 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.950
 do exercise on the grass 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.840
 here look the position of the legs so she can 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.700
 be here so it is a relatively rollers 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.500
 relatively each other but if you 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.780
 allows you to stretch your physical 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.600
 these legs may be further friend 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.220
 from a friend that's how much Dima is watching 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.350
 it's pretty hard to show here 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.450
 honestly talk about light maybe 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.650
 such a distance between the boots here 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.650
 already selected for yourself 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:06:00.330
 Well, so it will look back 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:06:00.330
 in this way like that here 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.220
 Now let's try to look at this view. 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.600
 slide at good speed as far as 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:20.440
 it will turn out like that and accelerates 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.130
 the way that he corner and that went 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.070
 slide itself 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:35.750
 incipio quite beautiful and interesting 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:37.370
 movement now try again not 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.530
 everything always works out like us 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.750
 it would be desirable but it is a normal principle 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.340
 the working process 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:50.780
 before you do well yet 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:58.340
 ten times will not work at all both 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:07:02.210
 quite normal thirds happened because 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:07.310
 still such an interesting element movement 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:10.510
 slalom is quite complicated but in principle 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.350
 it is based on this slide 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:18.890
 which we are with you just 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:22.310
 considered let's take another look 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:26.780
 this movement is tess how do you go from 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:28.820
 one side to the other are able housing in China 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:33.410
 that's even a little jealous I'm not under the 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:35.480
 I can work other elements that 

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:40.120
 I liked a little bit more, but these 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.120
 they are also pretty see interesting 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.400
 not
