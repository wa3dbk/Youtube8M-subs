00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.830 
today I have a double batter where's my
boy<00:00:10.740> John<00:00:11.040> Calipari<00:00:11.580> mango<00:00:12.059> I'll<00:00:12.420> avith

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.839 
boy John Calipari mango I'll avith
actually<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.559> three<00:00:14.040> double<00:00:14.309> battles<00:00:14.639> a

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
actually it's three double battles a

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.730 
actually it's three double battles a
really<00:00:15.540> brought<00:00:15.690> for<00:00:15.870> Pokemon<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.470> guess<00:00:16.619> it

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
really brought for Pokemon so I guess it

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.560 
really brought for Pokemon so I guess it
could<00:00:16.949> be<00:00:16.980> considered<00:00:17.310> BGC<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.150> not<00:00:18.390> really

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
could be considered BGC but not really

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.390 
could be considered BGC but not really
because<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:19.080> weren't<00:00:19.230> trying<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.980> make<00:00:20.279> it

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400

as I actually get both for those

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.380 
as I actually get both for those
correctly<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:34.980> essentially<00:03:35.489> i<00:03:35.519> did<00:03:35.940> get<00:03:36.090> the

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.050 
Metagross predicting my switch and you
know<00:04:53.220> that<00:04:53.310> was<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.430> good<00:04:53.520> play<00:04:53.670> because<00:04:53.970> I

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
know that was a good play because I

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.670 
know that was a good play because I
definitely<00:04:54.270> was<00:04:54.480> not<00:04:54.510> expecting<00:04:55.200> him<00:04:55.650> to

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
definitely was not expecting him to

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.350 
definitely was not expecting him to
predict<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.580> switch<00:04:56.820> right<00:04:56.970> there<00:04:57.120> since<00:04:57.300> I

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
predict that switch right there since I

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.790 
predict that switch right there since I
didn't<00:04:57.540> think<00:04:57.690> he<00:04:57.750> was<00:04:57.840> in<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:58.020> position<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.560> but

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
didn't think he was in a position to but

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.040 
didn't think he was in a position to but
like<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.190> said<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.400> was<00:04:59.490> a<00:04:59.520> good<00:04:59.610> play<00:04:59.820> by<00:05:00.000> John
