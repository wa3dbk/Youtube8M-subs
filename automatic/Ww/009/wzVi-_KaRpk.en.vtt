00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.029
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.750
 we are in a new news and attention 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.900
 because if you have old games or 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.570
 even consoles you can make gold 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.630
 and it is that old relics of 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.900
 megadrive for thousands of euros if from 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.860
 megadrive the mythical console that I in his 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.760
 day I had it 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.850
 I had the 32 x I opted for the 2x trot instead 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.569
 of by the mega cd I remember that for 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.059
 that era was the mega cd and 82 xy 

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:38.120
 well in his day I opted for the 32 x 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.069
 I even had the fifa that came out for 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.949
 attended here I motorcycle game 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:43.579
 motocross forgiveness that came up were the 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.149
 host 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.960
 I already bet for more for that format 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.359
 because it was still a cd cartridge 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.020
 still distrusted and really by 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.920
 that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.020
 it did not really have its success but good if 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.650
 you have for example a copy of premium to 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.900
 reich for megadrive 32x or dtm that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 possibly because you can have it 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.630
 You can have a starting price of 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.060
 output of three thousand euros price in the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.910
 that you can find these products 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.040
 on ebay output the truth is that 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.560
 you can get a lot more raw money 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.940
 Reich remember is a game of the 90s 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.250
 known for their violence and their 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.490
 graphics at that time in the case of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.520
 he fears that it is also a game of the 90s 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.130
 we put ourselves in charge of a steering wheel 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.450
 a hovercraft the subject is that these 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.970
 games in his day because really not 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.670
 they had a lot of room in the market for 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.700
 what is currently a difficult treasure 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.490
 to find but possibly you can 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.880
 have one of these copies and what not 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.610
 you know what you have at home 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.350
 well I sold it surely sold it 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.619
 because as the matter is, well, as 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.960
 to not have liquidity but you already know 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.179
 if you have 9 are the games you have a 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.470
 gold mine a hug to all 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.310
 lequi favorites and see you in the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.310
