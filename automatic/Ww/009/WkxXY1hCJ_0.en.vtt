for my own time playing it it's

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.410 
for my own time playing it it's
surprisingly<00:00:20.369> simple<00:00:20.789> once<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.119> get<00:00:21.330> in

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
surprisingly simple once you get in

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.630 
surprisingly simple once you get in
there<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.600> play<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.590> super<00:00:22.980> super

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
there and play it but it's super super

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.490 
there and play it but it's super super
competitive<00:00:24.300> as<00:00:24.480> far<00:00:25.019> as<00:00:25.140> my<00:00:25.260> first

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
competitive as far as my first

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.310 
competitive as far as my first
impressions<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.189> enjoyed<00:00:26.670> every<00:00:27.019> minute<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.199> it

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
impressions I enjoyed every minute of it

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.779 
impressions I enjoyed every minute of it
but<00:00:28.740> that's<00:00:28.859> probably<00:00:29.099> because<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.640> able

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
but that's probably because I was able

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.700 
but that's probably because I was able
to<00:00:29.910> communicate<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.689> my<00:00:30.869> team<00:00:31.140> if<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.439> wasn't

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
to communicate with my team if I wasn't

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.410 
to communicate with my team if I wasn't
able<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.040> communicate<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.820> was<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.210> in

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
able to communicate or I was going in

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.940 
able to communicate or I was going in
with<00:00:33.540> people<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.960> didn't<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.500> know<00:00:34.710> it

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
with people that I didn't really know it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.979 
with people that I didn't really know it
would<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.430> been<00:00:35.520> much<00:00:35.850> more<00:00:35.910> difficult<00:00:36.480> if

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
would have been much more difficult if

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.569 
would have been much more difficult if
you<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.230> ever<00:00:37.440> played<00:00:37.620> Daisy<00:00:37.980> or
