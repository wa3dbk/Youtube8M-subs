00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
it's we're back one prime we think about

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.119 
it's we're back one prime we think about
it<00:00:39.000> because<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.410> heads<00:00:40.770> as<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:40.920> knew<00:00:41.100> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it because the this heads as we knew it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.560 
it because the this heads as we knew it
last<00:00:41.250> week<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.030> might<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.390> started

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
last week so they might have started

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.660 
last week so they might have started
earlier<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.620> might<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:43.950> indicating<00:00:44.550> that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
earlier so this might be indicating that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.880 
earlier so this might be indicating that
it<00:00:45.180> might<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.390> interested<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.379> bringing<00:00:46.559> out
