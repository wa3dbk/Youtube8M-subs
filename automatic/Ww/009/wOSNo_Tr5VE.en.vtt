hey<00:00:00.690> everybody<00:00:01.110> today<00:00:01.350> I<00:00:01.829> want<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.280> be<00:00:02.370> showing

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hey everybody today I want to be showing

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.610 
hey everybody today I want to be showing
you<00:00:02.879> my<00:00:02.909> first<00:00:03.510> crack<00:00:03.959> at<00:00:04.230> making<00:00:04.380> an

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
you my first crack at making an

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.499 
you my first crack at making an
aluminium<00:00:05.040> melting<00:00:05.400> furnace

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
aluminium melting furnace

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.350 
aluminium melting furnace
so<00:00:06.750> this<00:00:06.899> first<00:00:07.049> design<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.649> super<00:00:07.950> basic<00:00:08.360> all

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
so this first design is super basic all

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.870 
so this first design is super basic all
it<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.960> an<00:00:10.080> old<00:00:10.380> charcoal<00:00:11.219> chimney<00:00:11.460> there

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
it is is an old charcoal chimney there

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.970 
it is is an old charcoal chimney there
on<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.090> right<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:13.170> I've<00:00:13.259> got<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> couple<00:00:13.830> of

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
on the right and I've got a couple of

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.310 
on the right and I've got a couple of
bricks<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.490> hold<00:00:14.790> things<00:00:15.030> up<00:00:15.389> right<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.900> then

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
bricks to hold things up right and then

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.930 
bricks to hold things up right and then
a<00:00:16.379> couple<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.740> fire<00:00:16.920> bricks<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.430> top<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.789> those

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
a couple of fire bricks on top of those

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.160 
a couple of fire bricks on top of those
to<00:00:18.539> insulate<00:00:19.320> from<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.650> regular<00:00:20.010> bricks<00:00:20.279> so

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
to insulate from the regular bricks so

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.460 
to insulate from the regular bricks so
once<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.680> fully<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.730> flame<00:00:24.720> I'm<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.410> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
once this is fully a flame I'm going to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.830 
once this is fully a flame I'm going to
move<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.920> top<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.400> fire<00:00:26.580> bricks<00:00:26.880> and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
move it on top of the fire bricks and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.650 
move it on top of the fire bricks and
then<00:00:27.990> we'll<00:00:28.199> put<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.740> air<00:00:29.550> source<00:00:30.150> underneath

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
then we'll put a air source underneath

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.290 
then we'll put a air source underneath
it<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.040> melt<00:00:32.369> aluminum<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> need<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.120> very

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
it so to melt aluminum you need a very

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.900 
it so to melt aluminum you need a very
high<00:00:33.390> temperature<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:34.500> normally<00:00:35.399> can't<00:00:35.670> be

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
high temperature that normally can't be

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.569 
high temperature that normally can't be
achieved<00:00:36.000> by<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:37.020> charcoal<00:00:37.710> alone<00:00:38.070> I've

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
achieved by just charcoal alone I've

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.030 
achieved by just charcoal alone I've
gotten<00:00:38.879> really<00:00:39.090> close<00:00:39.420> I've<00:00:40.260> gotten<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
gotten really close I've gotten the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.250 
gotten really close I've gotten the
aluminum<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> sort<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.910> weaken<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> normal

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
aluminum to sort of weaken with a normal

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.310 
aluminum to sort of weaken with a normal
charcoal<00:00:43.680> fire<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.570> doesn't<00:00:45.840> quite<00:00:46.020> cut

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
charcoal fire but that doesn't quite cut

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.860 
charcoal fire but that doesn't quite cut
it<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.800> need<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.309> temperature<00:00:47.879> by

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
it so we need to up the temperature by

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.650 
it so we need to up the temperature by
adding<00:00:49.320> an<00:00:49.440> air<00:00:49.590> source<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:51.300> I'm<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
adding an air source and I'm going to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.410 
adding an air source and I'm going to
provide<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.860> an<00:00:53.039> old<00:00:53.190> hair<00:00:53.489> dryer<00:00:53.520> on

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
provide that with an old hair dryer on

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.389 
provide that with an old hair dryer on
so<00:00:54.930> once<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.559> set<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:55.829> I'll<00:00:56.100> show<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
so once I get this set up I'll show you

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.660 
so once I get this set up I'll show you
how<00:00:57.090> I'm<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.520> alright<00:00:59.520> so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
how I'm going to do that alright so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.700 
how I'm going to do that alright so
here's<00:00:59.820> my<00:00:59.940> setup<00:01:00.329> we've<00:01:00.660> got<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.050> charcoal

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
here's my setup we've got the charcoal

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.030 
here's my setup we've got the charcoal
fire<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.309> there<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.229> I've<00:01:04.350> got<00:01:04.559> an<00:01:04.830> old

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
fire in there and I've got an old

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.390 
fire in there and I've got an old
hairdryer<00:01:06.020> taped<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> PVC<00:01:07.530> pipe<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:07.979> has

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
hairdryer taped to a PVC pipe that has

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.340 
hairdryer taped to a PVC pipe that has
an<00:01:08.549> elbow<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.450> end<00:01:09.600> that's<00:01:09.750> pointing<00:01:10.170> up

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
an elbow on the end that's pointing up

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.010 
an elbow on the end that's pointing up
so<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.220> air<00:01:11.400> from<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> hairdryer<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.869> going

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so the air from the hairdryer is going

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.929 
so the air from the hairdryer is going
to<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.170> directed<00:01:13.470> through<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.710> pipe<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
to get directed through the pipe up the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.630 
to get directed through the pipe up the
elbow<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.840> through<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.400> charcoal<00:01:17.400> there

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
elbow and in through the charcoal there

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.480 
elbow and in through the charcoal there
which<00:01:18.330> should<00:01:18.659> increase<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.530> T<00:01:19.799> output<00:01:20.220> quite

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
which should increase the T output quite

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.850 
which should increase the T output quite
a<00:01:20.520> bit<00:01:20.729> my<00:01:21.180> crucible<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.740> this

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
a bit my crucible is going to be this

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.530 
a bit my crucible is going to be this
stainless<00:01:23.280> steel<00:01:23.460> cup<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:23.970> found<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
stainless steel cup that I found in the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
stainless steel cup that I found in the
camping<00:01:25.080> section<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:26.220> put<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> little<00:01:26.580> bit

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
camping section and I put a little bit

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
camping section and I put a little bit
of<00:01:26.820> aluminum<00:01:27.119> foil<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.540> there<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> start<00:01:28.020> with

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
of aluminum foil in there to start with

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.890 
of aluminum foil in there to start with
my<00:01:28.829> plan<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.939> melt<00:01:30.119> aluminium

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
my plan is to use this to melt aluminium

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.859 
my plan is to use this to melt aluminium
cans<00:01:31.350> soda<00:01:31.829> cans<00:01:32.329> but<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.360> want<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.840> a

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
cans soda cans but I want to have a

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.420 
cans soda cans but I want to have a
little<00:01:34.229> bit<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.409> foil<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.799> there<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.070> this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
little bit of foil in there I think this

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.340 
little bit of foil in there I think this
will<00:01:35.610> provide<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:37.259> good<00:01:37.890> contact<00:01:38.430> area<00:01:38.909> of

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
will provide a good contact area of

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.450 
will provide a good contact area of
aluminum<00:01:40.350> around<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> edges<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.280> should

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
aluminum around the edges so it should

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.149 
aluminum around the edges so it should
melt<00:01:41.780> hopefully<00:01:42.780> pretty<00:01:43.200> good<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.560> I'll<00:01:44.009> get

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
melt hopefully pretty good and I'll get

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.679 
melt hopefully pretty good and I'll get
a<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.310> bit<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.579> liquid<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.880> there<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.299> then

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
a little bit of liquid in there and then

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.810 
a little bit of liquid in there and then
I<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.899> start<00:01:46.049> feeding<00:01:46.229> cans<00:01:46.619> into<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
I can start feeding cans into it and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580 
I can start feeding cans into it and
they'll<00:01:48.000> fit<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.479> liquid<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:48.960> should<00:01:49.380> melt

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
they'll fit in a liquid and should melt

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.800 
they'll fit in a liquid and should melt
nicely<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.610> let's<00:01:50.759> stick<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
nicely so let's stick this in here and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.730 
nicely so let's stick this in here and
let's<00:01:54.810> see<00:01:54.930> what<00:01:55.049> happens<00:01:55.320> when<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
let's see what happens when we get the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.210 
let's see what happens when we get the
air<00:01:55.890> going

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.250 

so<00:02:03.790> this<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.180> maiden<00:02:04.600> voyage<00:02:04.630> of<00:02:05.110> this

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
so this is the maiden voyage of this

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.620 
so this is the maiden voyage of this
thing<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.920> who<00:02:06.760> knows<00:02:06.940> this<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.330> actually

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
thing so I who knows this is actually

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.950 
thing so I who knows this is actually
going<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.810> work<00:02:07.930> or<00:02:08.110> not<00:02:08.260> but<00:02:09.100> we'll<00:02:09.250> find<00:02:09.460> out

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
going to work or not but we'll find out

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.210 
going to work or not but we'll find out
so<00:02:10.960> we'll<00:02:11.140> just<00:02:11.290> keep<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.620> running<00:02:11.980> for<00:02:12.160> a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
so we'll just keep this running for a

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.730 
so we'll just keep this running for a
bit<00:02:12.430> until<00:02:13.210> something<00:02:13.690> happens<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.320> I'll<00:02:14.590> let

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
bit until something happens and I'll let

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.580 
bit until something happens and I'll let
you<00:02:14.830> know<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:16.270> about<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.510> second<00:02:16.990> after<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.290> turn

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
you know so about a second after I turn

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.830 
you know so about a second after I turn
the<00:02:17.770> video<00:02:17.920> off<00:02:18.100> this<00:02:18.700> immediately<00:02:19.510> has

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
the video off this immediately has

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.780 
the video off this immediately has
melted<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.470> aluminum<00:02:20.500> this<00:02:21.460> is<00:02:21.610> pretty

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
melted the aluminum this is pretty

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.910 
melted the aluminum this is pretty
awesome<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.930> I'm<00:02:23.050> gonna<00:02:23.140> go<00:02:23.290> grab<00:02:23.470> some<00:02:23.530> cans

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
awesome so I'm gonna go grab some cans

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.200 
awesome so I'm gonna go grab some cans
and<00:02:24.100> throw<00:02:24.250> them<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.640> see<00:02:24.760> what<00:02:24.880> happens

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
and throw them in and see what happens

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.780 
and throw them in and see what happens
you<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:26.500> see<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.860> bottom<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.490> thing<00:02:27.670> is

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
you can see the bottom of this thing is

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.870 
you can see the bottom of this thing is
red-hot<00:02:28.030> now<00:02:28.450> let's<00:02:29.010> start<00:02:30.010> feeding<00:02:30.220> cans<00:02:30.610> in

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
red-hot now let's start feeding cans in

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.509 
red-hot now let's start feeding cans in
and<00:02:31.660> see<00:02:31.840> how<00:02:31.960> this<00:02:32.110> goes

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.160 

of<00:02:36.909> course<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.329> going<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.510> burn<00:02:37.719> off<00:02:37.959> the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
of course it's going to burn off the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.259 
of course it's going to burn off the
label<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.099> plastic<00:02:39.519> on<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.730> inside<00:02:40.060> as

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
label and the plastic on the inside as

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:49.059 
label and the plastic on the inside as
well<00:02:42.359> you<00:02:43.359> can<00:02:43.540> see<00:02:43.659> it<00:02:43.780> discoloring

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.580 

and<00:02:49.549> there<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.790> goes

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.430 

Wow

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.710 

as<00:02:58.500> amazing<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.670> did<00:02:59.790> not<00:02:59.940> expect<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.690> work

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
as amazing I did not expect this to work

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.530 
as amazing I did not expect this to work
as<00:03:01.050> well

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:17.589 

there<00:03:06.170> goes<00:03:06.319> another<00:03:06.349> one

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.640 

okay<00:03:18.599> so<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:18.959> guess<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.230> got<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.379> be<00:03:19.470> careful

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
okay so I guess you got to be careful

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.699 
okay so I guess you got to be careful
doing<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.299> I<00:03:21.299> imagine<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.290> was<00:03:22.349> a<00:03:22.409> steam

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
doing that I imagine that was a steam

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:48.020 
doing that I imagine that was a steam
explosion

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.400 

so<00:03:48.480> I'm<00:03:48.540> just<00:03:48.630> going<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.810> keep<00:03:48.990> on<00:03:49.140> feeding

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
so I'm just going to keep on feeding

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:57.190 
so I'm just going to keep on feeding
cans<00:03:49.740> into<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.130> thing<00:03:50.310> until<00:03:50.580> I<00:03:50.640> run<00:03:50.880> out

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.090 

all<00:03:58.200> right<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.380> went<00:03:58.470> ahead<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.710> turned<00:03:58.920> the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
all right I went ahead and turned the

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.180 
all right I went ahead and turned the
air<00:03:59.220> off<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.610> got<00:03:59.990> six<00:04:00.990> cans<00:04:01.290> plus<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.710> couple<00:04:02.100> of

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
air off I got six cans plus a couple of

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.380 
air off I got six cans plus a couple of
sheets<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.520> aluminum<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.090> had<00:04:03.210> laying

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
sheets of aluminum that I had laying

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.890 
sheets of aluminum that I had laying
around<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:04.320> there<00:04:04.590> now<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:05.760> all<00:04:05.910> molten<00:04:06.330> so

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
around in there now it's all molten so

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.990 
around in there now it's all molten so
I'm<00:04:07.020> going<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.200> take<00:04:07.410> this<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.520> pour<00:04:08.850> it<00:04:08.910> into

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
I'm going to take this and pour it into

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.210 
I'm going to take this and pour it into
my<00:04:09.300> mold<00:04:09.750> over<00:04:10.020> here<00:04:10.230> which<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.440> just<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.860> pie

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
my mold over here which is just a pie

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.880 
my mold over here which is just a pie
sheet<00:04:11.490> basically<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.210> I<00:04:12.600> hit<00:04:12.780> one<00:04:12.990> side<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.800> it

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
sheet basically and I hit one side of it

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.380 
sheet basically and I hit one side of it
with<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.040> blowtorch<00:04:14.490> to<00:04:14.820> try<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.030> get<00:04:15.210> rid<00:04:15.360> of

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
with a blowtorch to try to get rid of

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.550 
with a blowtorch to try to get rid of
the<00:04:15.570> nonstick<00:04:16.050> coating<00:04:17.209> in<00:04:18.209> case<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:19.260> did

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
the nonstick coating in case that did

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.560 
the nonstick coating in case that did
anything<00:04:19.800> bad<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:23.370> can<00:04:23.640> see<00:04:23.910> we<00:04:24.450> got

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
anything bad so you can see we got

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.870 
anything bad so you can see we got
molten<00:04:24.960> aluminum<00:04:25.380> in<00:04:25.500> there<00:04:25.680> so<00:04:26.640> I'm<00:04:26.700> going<00:04:26.820> to

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
molten aluminum in there so I'm going to

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:36.080 
molten aluminum in there so I'm going to
pour<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.150> out<00:04:27.210> into<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.570> mold

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.900 

quite<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.690> bit<00:04:36.900> of<00:04:36.960> slag<00:04:37.170> from<00:04:37.410> those<00:04:37.560> cans<00:04:37.910> just

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
quite a bit of slag from those cans just

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.390 
quite a bit of slag from those cans just
kind<00:04:39.090> of<00:04:39.120> what<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.270> expected<00:04:43.040> so<00:04:44.040> here's<00:04:44.250> my

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
kind of what I expected so here's my

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.390 
kind of what I expected so here's my
solidified<00:04:45.150> blob<00:04:45.480> of<00:04:45.690> aluminum<00:04:46.130> I'm<00:04:47.130> going<00:04:47.310> to

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
solidified blob of aluminum I'm going to

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.910 
solidified blob of aluminum I'm going to
quench<00:04:47.640> it<00:04:47.760> in<00:04:47.880> some<00:04:48.060> water<00:04:48.300> for<00:04:48.840> no<00:04:49.650> real

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
quench it in some water for no real

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.250 
quench it in some water for no real
reason<00:04:50.420> except<00:04:51.420> that<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.570> just<00:04:51.780> can't<00:04:52.020> wait<00:04:52.140> to

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
reason except that I just can't wait to

00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:04.629 
reason except that I just can't wait to
touch<00:04:52.440> this<00:04:52.620> thing<00:04:52.680> so<00:04:53.640> here<00:04:53.790> we<00:04:53.880> go

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.670 

there<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.270> go<00:05:05.949> sell<00:05:06.949> aluminum<00:05:08.439> so<00:05:09.439> I<00:05:09.500> brought

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
there you go sell aluminum so I brought

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.279 
there you go sell aluminum so I brought
this<00:05:09.919> back<00:05:10.490> into<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:10.819> lab<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:11.629> show<00:05:11.870> you<00:05:11.930> the

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
this back into the lab to show you the

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.379 
this back into the lab to show you the
crystals<00:05:13.280> now<00:05:13.669> there's<00:05:13.969> a<00:05:14.000> little<00:05:14.090> bit<00:05:14.270> better

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
crystals now there's a little bit better

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.450 
crystals now there's a little bit better
lighting<00:05:14.719> maybe<00:05:15.439> you'll<00:05:15.680> be<00:05:15.770> able<00:05:15.860> to<00:05:16.069> see<00:05:16.250> the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
lighting maybe you'll be able to see the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.730 
lighting maybe you'll be able to see the
crystals<00:05:16.969> a<00:05:17.090> little<00:05:17.270> bit<00:05:17.360> better<00:05:17.539> you<00:05:17.840> can<00:05:18.530> see

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
crystals a little bit better you can see

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.730 
crystals a little bit better you can see
they<00:05:19.129> look<00:05:19.159> really<00:05:19.789> feathery<00:05:20.419> and<00:05:20.810> they<00:05:21.620> all

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
they look really feathery and they all

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.850 
they look really feathery and they all
of<00:05:21.889> course<00:05:22.099> intertwine<00:05:22.729> and<00:05:23.139> they<00:05:24.139> sparkle<00:05:24.590> a

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
of course intertwine and they sparkle a

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.899 
of course intertwine and they sparkle a
little<00:05:25.129> bit<00:05:25.250> differently

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
little bit differently

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:26.860 
little bit differently
just<00:05:26.150> because<00:05:26.300> they're<00:05:26.419> all<00:05:26.539> aligned

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
just because they're all aligned

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.980 
just because they're all aligned
differently<00:05:27.849> so<00:05:28.849> that's<00:05:29.060> really<00:05:29.360> cool<00:05:29.659> that

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
differently so that's really cool that

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.450 
differently so that's really cool that
it's<00:05:30.139> solidified<00:05:30.650> like<00:05:30.919> that<00:05:33.189> and<00:05:34.189> you<00:05:34.310> can

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
it's solidified like that and you can

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.640 
it's solidified like that and you can
see<00:05:34.669> on<00:05:34.849> the<00:05:34.969> back

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
see on the back

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.580 
see on the back
you<00:05:36.650> really<00:05:36.860> don't<00:05:36.979> see<00:05:37.159> much<00:05:37.550> of<00:05:37.580> that<00:05:38.590> now

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
you really don't see much of that now

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.869 
you really don't see much of that now
I'm<00:05:39.680> bettin<00:05:39.979> because<00:05:40.250> it<00:05:40.370> cooled<00:05:40.610> a<00:05:40.729> lot

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
I'm bettin because it cooled a lot

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.029 
I'm bettin because it cooled a lot
faster<00:05:41.389> you<00:05:41.569> know<00:05:42.020> because<00:05:42.259> it's<00:05:42.379> in<00:05:42.500> contact

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
faster you know because it's in contact

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.110 
faster you know because it's in contact
with<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:44.680> metal<00:05:45.680> surface<00:05:46.190> so<00:05:46.819> that's<00:05:47.000> going

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
with the metal surface so that's going

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.999 
with the metal surface so that's going
to<00:05:47.180> draw<00:05:47.360> out<00:05:47.539> of<00:05:47.629> the<00:05:47.690> heat<00:05:47.840> away<00:05:47.960> can<00:05:48.800> you<00:05:48.830> see

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
to draw out of the heat away can you see

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.469 
to draw out of the heat away can you see
there's<00:05:49.190> some<00:05:49.430> feathery<00:05:49.819> regions<00:05:50.270> on<00:05:50.389> the

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
there's some feathery regions on the

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.170 
there's some feathery regions on the
sides<00:05:50.719> so<00:05:51.400> like<00:05:52.400> I<00:05:52.490> said<00:05:52.639> before<00:05:52.759> this<00:05:53.030> is

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
sides so like I said before this is

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.659 
sides so like I said before this is
incredibly<00:05:53.629> simple<00:05:53.930> design<00:05:54.349> and<00:05:54.620> you<00:05:55.310> can<00:05:55.340> see

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
incredibly simple design and you can see

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.249 
incredibly simple design and you can see
that<00:05:55.879> it's<00:05:56.060> already<00:05:56.270> sort<00:05:56.629> of<00:05:56.719> falling<00:05:56.960> apart

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
that it's already sort of falling apart

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.029 
that it's already sort of falling apart
the<00:05:59.110> hairdryer<00:06:00.110> is<00:06:00.139> kind<00:06:00.469> of<00:06:00.529> falling<00:06:00.860> out<00:06:00.979> of

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
the hairdryer is kind of falling out of

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.369 
the hairdryer is kind of falling out of
the<00:06:01.490> duct<00:06:01.849> tape<00:06:01.940> here<00:06:02.389> so<00:06:02.990> I<00:06:03.050> need<00:06:03.169> to<00:06:03.229> figure

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:03.379 
the duct tape here so I need to figure

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:05.769 
the duct tape here so I need to figure
out<00:06:03.500> a<00:06:03.560> better<00:06:03.710> way<00:06:03.830> to<00:06:03.949> secure<00:06:04.430> that<00:06:04.669> and<00:06:05.629> then

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
out a better way to secure that and then

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.230 
out a better way to secure that and then
as<00:06:06.020> I<00:06:06.080> suspected<00:06:06.949> the<00:06:07.340> elbow<00:06:07.639> at<00:06:07.759> the<00:06:07.909> end<00:06:08.029> is

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
as I suspected the elbow at the end is

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.089 
as I suspected the elbow at the end is
already<00:06:08.419> getting<00:06:08.810> scorched<00:06:09.259> so<00:06:09.830> I'll<00:06:09.889> have<00:06:10.009> to

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
already getting scorched so I'll have to

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:11.860 
already getting scorched so I'll have to
replace<00:06:10.400> that<00:06:10.639> with<00:06:10.789> a<00:06:10.819> metal<00:06:11.180> one<00:06:11.300> I<00:06:11.360> imagine

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
replace that with a metal one I imagine

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.510 
replace that with a metal one I imagine
and<00:06:12.440> maybe<00:06:12.529> put<00:06:12.800> some<00:06:12.919> insulation<00:06:13.250> between

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
and maybe put some insulation between

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.570 
and maybe put some insulation between
that<00:06:13.849> and<00:06:13.879> the<00:06:14.029> connector<00:06:14.389> here<00:06:15.310> you<00:06:16.310> can<00:06:16.430> see

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
that and the connector here you can see

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.950 
that and the connector here you can see
there's<00:06:16.759> quite<00:06:16.879> a<00:06:17.000> bit<00:06:17.120> of<00:06:17.150> slag<00:06:17.419> left<00:06:17.810> in

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
there's quite a bit of slag left in

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.369 
there's quite a bit of slag left in
there

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:18.379 
there

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:20.019 
there
I'll<00:06:18.889> have<00:06:19.069> to<00:06:19.190> get<00:06:19.310> that<00:06:19.370> out<00:06:19.729> once<00:06:19.940> that

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:20.029 
I'll have to get that out once that

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:24.339 
I'll have to get that out once that
fully<00:06:20.599> cools<00:06:20.930> but<00:06:22.389> all-in-all<00:06:23.389> I<00:06:23.990> mean<00:06:24.259> this

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
fully cools but all-in-all I mean this

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.079 
fully cools but all-in-all I mean this
didn't<00:06:24.650> hardly<00:06:24.830> cost<00:06:25.159> me<00:06:25.339> anything<00:06:25.610> I<00:06:25.909> had<00:06:26.029> to

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:26.089 
didn't hardly cost me anything I had to

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:27.909 
didn't hardly cost me anything I had to
go<00:06:26.240> by<00:06:26.419> the<00:06:26.449> the<00:06:26.900> cup<00:06:27.080> was<00:06:27.229> about<00:06:27.440> five<00:06:27.710> dollars

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
go by the the cup was about five dollars

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.059 
go by the the cup was about five dollars
the<00:06:28.460> piping<00:06:29.000> o<00:06:29.210> is<00:06:30.199> probably<00:06:30.620> eight<00:06:30.800> or<00:06:30.949> nine

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:31.069 
the piping o is probably eight or nine

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:34.959 
the piping o is probably eight or nine
dollars<00:06:31.550> the<00:06:31.789> hairdryer<00:06:32.779> was<00:06:33.020> free<00:06:33.430> and<00:06:34.430> the

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
dollars the hairdryer was free and the

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:36.579 
dollars the hairdryer was free and the
charcoal<00:06:35.449> chimney<00:06:35.629> was<00:06:35.960> free<00:06:36.199> too<00:06:36.379> because

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:36.589 
charcoal chimney was free too because

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:38.050 
charcoal chimney was free too because
that<00:06:36.620> was<00:06:36.770> a<00:06:36.800> gift<00:06:37.069> and<00:06:37.310> it<00:06:37.430> sold<00:06:37.639> so<00:06:37.759> I'm<00:06:37.940> not

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
that was a gift and it sold so I'm not

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.430 
that was a gift and it sold so I'm not
using<00:06:38.270> it<00:06:38.419> for<00:06:38.569> anything<00:06:38.750> else<00:06:38.870> anyway<00:06:39.339> so<00:06:40.339> I'm

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
using it for anything else anyway so I'm

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
using it for anything else anyway so I'm
fairly<00:06:42.440> amazed<00:06:42.800> that<00:06:42.979> this<00:06:43.129> was<00:06:43.279> actually

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
fairly amazed that this was actually

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.159 
fairly amazed that this was actually
able<00:06:43.819> to<00:06:43.940> do<00:06:44.120> the<00:06:44.270> job<00:06:44.509> but<00:06:45.400> there<00:06:46.400> you<00:06:46.520> go

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
able to do the job but there you go

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.610 
able to do the job but there you go
hope<00:06:48.169> you<00:06:48.289> enjoyed<00:06:48.620> thanks<00:06:49.159> for<00:06:49.279> watching
