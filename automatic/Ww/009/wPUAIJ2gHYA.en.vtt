00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
now this year has been a banner year for

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.160 
now this year has been a banner year for
us<00:01:33.380> because<00:01:34.119> we're<00:01:35.119> experienced<00:01:35.990> some<00:01:36.140> very

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
us because we're experienced some very

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.260 
us because we're experienced some very
large<00:01:36.679> increase<00:01:37.219> in<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.429> very<00:01:37.609> short<00:01:37.789> period<00:01:38.240> of

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
large increase in a very short period of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.740 
large increase in a very short period of
time<00:01:38.740> this<00:01:39.740> is<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:39.950> month-by-month<00:01:40.750> production

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
time this is a month-by-month production

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.569 
time this is a month-by-month production
schedule<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.469> it<00:01:42.560> doesn't<00:01:42.890> look<00:01:43.009> like<00:01:43.039> at<00:01:43.490> the

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
schedule and it doesn't look like at the

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:44.919 
schedule and it doesn't look like at the
end<00:01:43.729> of<00:01:43.819> the<00:01:43.880> year<00:01:44.000> we're<00:01:44.119> producing<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:44.719> many

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
end of the year we're producing so many

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.929 
end of the year we're producing so many
this<00:01:45.140> is<00:01:45.200> because<00:01:45.469> there<00:01:45.590> are<00:01:45.679> fewer<00:01:45.920> days<00:01:46.159> in

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
this is because there are fewer days in

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.819 
this is because there are fewer days in
the<00:01:47.060> calendar<00:01:47.390> month<00:01:47.869> at<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.500> end<00:01:48.649> of<00:01:48.770> the

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
the calendar month at the end of the

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.010 
the calendar month at the end of the
year<00:01:48.979> we<00:01:49.880> take<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.179> Christmas<00:01:50.509> holiday<00:01:50.840> for

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
year we take the Christmas holiday for

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.050 
year we take the Christmas holiday for
example<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:51.469> we're<00:01:51.590> operating<00:01:51.829> fewer<00:01:52.250> days<00:01:52.459> in

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
example so we're operating fewer days in

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.910 
example so we're operating fewer days in

we're<00:02:31.670> operating<00:02:31.940> with<00:02:32.239> just<00:02:32.420> one<00:02:32.660> shift<00:02:33.130> this

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
we're operating with just one shift this

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.009 
we're operating with just one shift this
is<00:02:34.310> because<00:02:34.579> our<00:02:34.730> members<00:02:35.359> in<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.540> assembly

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
is because our members in the assembly

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.410 
is because our members in the assembly
area<00:02:36.350> are<00:02:36.530> able<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:36.889> assemble<00:02:37.340> an<00:02:37.489> ATV<00:02:37.910> faster

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
area are able to assemble an ATV faster

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.550 
area are able to assemble an ATV faster
than<00:02:38.569> we<00:02:38.660> can<00:02:38.840> make<00:02:38.989> some<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.410> raw

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
than we can make some of the raw

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.650 
than we can make some of the raw
materials<00:02:40.069> that<00:02:40.100> are<00:02:40.220> needed<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.670> produce<00:02:41.480> the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
materials that are needed to produce the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.990 
materials that are needed to produce the
ATV<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.530> takes<00:02:42.739> longer<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.190> build<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.700> frame

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
ATV it takes longer to build a frame

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.910 
ATV it takes longer to build a frame
that<00:02:44.690> does<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.109> assemble<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.560> rest<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:45.829> the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.099 
that does to assemble the rest of the
ATV<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:47.239> we<00:02:47.359> have<00:02:47.480> two<00:02:47.630> shifts

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
ATV so we have two shifts

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.690 
ATV so we have two shifts
two<00:02:48.260> shifts<00:02:48.590> running<00:02:48.859> on<00:02:48.980> injection<00:02:49.400> molding

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
pretty quickly every 89 seconds and then

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.000 
pretty quickly every 89 seconds and then
a<00:03:41.060> TV<00:03:41.450> is<00:03:41.600> passing<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.110> certain<00:03:42.380> station<00:03:42.650> and

is<00:03:47.270> rolling<00:03:47.630> off<00:03:47.750> right<00:03:48.050> off<00:03:48.080> of<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.380> in<00:03:48.500> there

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
is rolling off right off of the in there

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.160 
is rolling off right off of the in there
maybe<00:03:49.130> nine<00:03:49.340> seconds<00:03:49.820> that's<00:03:50.300> less<00:03:50.750> than<00:03:50.780> one

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
maybe nine seconds that's less than one

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.410 
maybe nine seconds that's less than one
and<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.320> half<00:03:51.470> minutes<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:52.100> that's<00:03:52.880> pretty<00:03:53.120> fast

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
and a half minutes so that's pretty fast

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.000 
and a half minutes so that's pretty fast
however<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:53.900> notice<00:03:54.050> in<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.320> DVD<00:03:54.620> is<00:03:54.830> said

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
however you notice in the DVD is said

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.940 
however you notice in the DVD is said
about<00:03:55.100> taking<00:03:55.910> six<00:03:56.240> hours<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:57.260> make<00:03:57.440> an<00:03:57.560> ATV

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
about taking six hours to make an ATV

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.650 
about taking six hours to make an ATV
from<00:03:58.070> start<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.400> finish<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:58.940> what<00:03:59.330> that<00:03:59.450> means

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
from start to finish so what that means

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.780 
from start to finish so what that means
in<00:03:59.870> is<00:03:59.990> that<00:04:00.200> when<00:04:00.740> we<00:04:00.830> take<00:04:01.100> a<00:04:01.130> piece<00:04:01.430> of<00:04:01.459> metal

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
in is that when we take a piece of metal

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.580 
in is that when we take a piece of metal
and<00:04:02.060> we<00:04:02.240> run<00:04:02.420> it<00:04:02.510> through<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.810> fabrication

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
and we run it through the fabrication

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.790 
and we run it through the fabrication
the<00:04:04.100> welding<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:05.209> painting<00:04:05.690> area<00:04:05.840> bring<00:04:06.650> it

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
the welding the painting area bring it

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.530 
the welding the painting area bring it
out<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.070> assembly<00:04:07.519> line<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:07.940> then<00:04:08.239> build

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
out to the assembly line and then build

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.650 
out to the assembly line and then build
it<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.930> be<00:04:09.110> all<00:04:09.769> together<00:04:10.190> from<00:04:10.820> that<00:04:11.330> piece<00:04:11.510> of

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
it to be all together from that piece of

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.120 
it to be all together from that piece of
metal<00:04:11.900> starting<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.350> just<00:04:12.620> a<00:04:12.709> piece<00:04:12.890> of<00:04:13.010> metal

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
metal starting is just a piece of metal

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.190 
metal starting is just a piece of metal
coming<00:04:13.400> off<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.760> end<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.030> ATV<00:04:14.360> line<00:04:14.720> is

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
coming off the end of the ATV line is

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.609 
coming off the end of the ATV line is
taking<00:04:15.590> approximately<00:04:15.800> six<00:04:16.430> hours
