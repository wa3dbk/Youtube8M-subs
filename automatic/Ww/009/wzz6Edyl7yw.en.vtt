00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 nice that again so better for use 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.390
 because with the exagon is finally gone and 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.519
 so that somebody compares something like that 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.440
 more expensive and cheaper than a microphone 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.200
 but I had one 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.770
 Comparison of Roth video with and the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.840
 text of the tc 69 83 his microphone for 50 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.960
 euro from china with nice chinese 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.730
 instruction in comparison to one 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.269
 premium manufacturer microphone out 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.269
 Australia 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.780
 so we leave the process so 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.400
 the cheaper microphone from china and 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.780
 I 'll read something to it 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.270
 you can compare how the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.930
 Listening to microphones is once a man 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.520
 and a woman 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.430
 they have been wishing for a long time 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.020
 In vain a child finally made himself 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.690
 the woman hope that God will love 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.250
 fulfill your wish and get it 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.960
 even a comparison of the microphone 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.730
 with background noise again 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.449
 first on whether this microphone 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.470
 or this microphone by Roth 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.600
 possible better sound did not sound when you 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.280
 easier to absorb and quiet environment 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.770
 only one voice without music or 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.509
 want to record something so have now 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.830
 the microphone for 100 euros so for 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.750
 double the money and I'll read that again 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.560
 same story before it was once on 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.330
 man and a woman 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.759
 they have been wishing for a long time 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.590
 In vain a child finally made himself 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:25.600
 the woman the hope of the dear god 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.700
 will fulfill every wish so that was 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.170
 the story so now we have the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.430
 same construction, however, runs in the 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.259
 background a tv in 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.000
 room volume that is, I would 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.210
 watch TV every evening or 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.159
 somehow musicians and something before 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.130
 then you have in comparison to one 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.310
 good the crown in your shotgun microphone 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.270
 function works or pulls well 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.200
 comes out fields could 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.259
 Rapunzel had long conversations with us 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.030
 today a spoken gold if they are now 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.920
 the voice of the magician heard that 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.439
 new and now we will be the other 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.140
 microphone is you build the 50 euro 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.860
 microphone so kuntzl had long brought 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.570
 the hair spun gold when they are 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.060
 the voice of the sorcerer heard soon 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.220
 she untied her pigtails and wrapped her up 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.500
 hook a window and then the missing 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.070
 hair all 20 deep and falsified and 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.360
 The sorcerer is up against it 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.220
 my expectation, the two take 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.709
 microphones not so much but the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.450
 relatively high price difference during 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.489
 the day a bit tinny 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.860
 absorbs or hollower find 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.150
 me that red has a lot of bass what 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.250
 but I am both a neighborly education 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.100
 without problems back to the right one 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.790
 turn direction 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.500
 in the test with the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.030
 background noise you have then too 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.950
 yet heard the text to a little bit of 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.540
 Repressive in the voice that is to say 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.160
 you take more voluminous respectively 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.600
 louder the voices 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.900
 with the road a small advantage or 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.000
 to paint comparison of the text microphone 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.110
 when recording music directly over 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.110
 a plant 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.970
 and now again the same shots 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.970
 with the red 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.050
 The taxi is different than you would get it from 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.970
 a 50 euro microphone maybe 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.130
 expected in a very nice box 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.020
 delivered on pressure and indeed 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.360
 Chinese but a few English 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.130
 Words can be through and in 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.450
 this box the carton there is the 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.580
 everything you need to get started 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.350
 to use this microphone so 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.420
 both a dead cat the wind noise 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.440
 as well as the meetyoo cell 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.260
 which one needs around the microphone 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.550
 to be able to turn on at all 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.080
 He really would have a slice of red 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.730
 can cut then where is 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.500
 the whole in a plastic packaging the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.970
 decorated with a bit of cards outside 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.230
 has been 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.850
 by the way, both microphones are one 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.590
 Unfortunately, the final check ran 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.140
 Lord of the txtr has probably tested 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.489
 forget his name what mine 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.980
 opinion after that completely beside it 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.600
 battery compartment from the red because that once 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.190
 a battery is inserted obscures the 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.390
 complete control of the level 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.070
 that means you have to get that one 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.110
 awkward to open the battery cover 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.930
 reset battery noise level and 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.790
 to rebuild the whole again the new one 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.160
 walt blog you have to red by the way 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.710
 for just under 6 to 7 euros even to it 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.300
 to buy 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.980
 that would definitely be more elegant with tax 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.340
 solved and the rule is adjustment 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.540
 attached to the top of the microphone 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.310
 here is the battery on the 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.350
 Rear side behind a metal screw 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.419
 place how long the battery life gives 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.849
 The manufacturer does not look at red you should 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.740
 but 100 hours 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.999
 so now we are already at the end of the 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.770
 small comparison between the taximeter 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:02.699
 And yes, I'm the road red 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.389
 I won with that too 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.339
 take up 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.199
 the tax the 50 euro really not 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:10.289
 bad so who has his limit here 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.449
 at 50 euro the value clearly 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.279
 very good because the sound distinguishes it 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.959
 now my nasty so bombastic 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:18.119
 except it's a bit red 

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:19.529
 This is more serious in male voices 

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:20.789
 can come a little bit better or 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:22.469
 maybe even if my motorsport 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:26.279
 Shooting makes the engines better 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:28.080
 sounds otherwise threatens ten years 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:29.819
 Guarantee that means you get at least 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.619
 now online mr. 10 years warranty if 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.279
 A big bonus is here you have to 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:34.409
 somehow watch that one 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.849
 contact person in china or maybe 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.459
 if so ordered at amazon 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.349
 Amazon finds but otherwise threatens 

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:42.719
 really not bad of me 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.759
 in each case a clear recommendation and 400 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.349
 it is always in the microphone range 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.729
 still relatively cheap if you take as a 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.519
 a little bit looks then you land quickly 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.599
 when double or triple many 

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:53.999
 Thanks for watching you have the video 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.769
 then just like the like 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:59.539
 -button press and ask easily 

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:59.539
 below the comments until next time
