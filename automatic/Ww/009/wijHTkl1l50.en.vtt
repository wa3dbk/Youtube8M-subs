00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.319
 now all kids who are so welcome 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.740
 to a new video of the final saga 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.420
 fantasy iv of 3 2015 in this case I will 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.519
 talk about a game that was announced 15 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.290
 seconds before the final remake 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.059
 fantasy 7 and that maybe this is why 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.560
 stayed a bit in the shadow of the great 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.780
 bombing of the night of the competition of 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.580
 sony not to contend for the nostalgic theme 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.920
 for the hype theme for the theme of the 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.600
 pepinazo that was that but also 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.610
 I think it deserves attention is called 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.410
 walk of final fantasy and his game his 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.270
 sony consoles team will reach 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.850
 playstation vita and playstation 4 in 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.730
 2016 and looks good so 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.680
 let's talk a little bit about 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.300
 good final fantasy is obviously a 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.070
 spin-off of the main franchise and 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.110
 will allow you to control a pair of twins 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.030
 that can mutate at the size level is 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.579
 say they can be or small plots 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.960
 cabezones what comes to be chibi or 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.329
 Stylized characters in style 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.199
 kindhearts this decision not only 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.910
 aesthetic but also at a 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.530
 strategic is to say for example being 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.089
 can be mounted in different 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.280
 big creatures like a neighbor like a 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.410
 chocobo etcetera to combat the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.390
 enemies have another option which is to be 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.890
 big in this case they catch the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.960
 enemies and respond on his head 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.030
 to make towers this allows you to do 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.729
 outer combat strategies is a 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.500
 game focused on the action fighting 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.660
 at least among them they seem to me in turns 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.759
 but you will have to see them in real time 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.170
 worth the trailer is generated with the 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.149
 engine of the game but it's not that I put 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.140
 really and I think he has enough 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.229
 possibilities of being a very game 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.520
 strategic and very interesting are not 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.869
 faithful to say tactics is worth not be 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.090
 thinking either that this is going to be there 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.670
 count the steps you take if such but you 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.229
 it simply allows the user to say 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.040
 think what you want to do to attack 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.660
 the enemies to defeat them and so on 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.980
 the interesting also the fact that 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.690
 the game will allow the capture of 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.140
 creatures is to say you will be able to capture a lot 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.450
 like a poster me 11th a goal on a mobile 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.430
 etcetera make them evolve grow 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.780
 learn skills and with this 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.100
 basically create a little team to 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.930
 pokemon style with that motto of 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.330
 cotacachi in mold and basically has 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.860
 pretty good looking so I do not know what 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.870
 more say about this game well a 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.610
 important detail is that like 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.870
 kingdom hearts will offer the option of 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.810
 visit different worlds steve ayles 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.640
 previous fantasy will not be worlds 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.440
 complete or simply will be changes of 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.090
 characters we have seen the warrior of the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.430
 light of missing and we've seen a 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.200
 cloud extract from fai the lack 7 but 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.209
 obviously we do not have more data like this 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.130
 what are we going to mess with you wear lead 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.780
 because I imagine that it will not be to enter 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.330
 mitigate find everything full 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.800
 of characters you need 37 and explore 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.390
 that's worth it will be simply klaus 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.670
 appearing on a stage and it's over 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.440
 is a game that also visually 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.230
 like a lot of color is very clear 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.400
 very nice characters in short that I 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.930
 I really like the roll it takes and 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.540
 remember crystal chronicles a that non 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.060
 hard nonsense are not very candid at all 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.710
 dark nothing serious without that I like 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.300
 when 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.940
 / after the project we found how 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.710
 director hiroki chivas admitted that this 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.090
 sir I did not know him by name ballet 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.950
 but seeing his resume I think he has 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.720
 enough options to make a game 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.700
 great because I say it basically 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.490
 because this man was even planner of 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.800
 pharma 17 file the fantasy 8 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.560
 final fantasy 10 daily observer or is 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.780
 missing 67 was the fantasy test sirou e 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.390
 even plan of enrich tent I have 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.640
 even because I also have to comment on 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.440
 bad and basically unibet planner it 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.360
 responsible for generating events worth creating 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.980
 specific situations of characters or 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.230
 specific situations of the plot for 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.510
 to advance this gentleman also collaborated 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.900
 with cases and not yolk co-writing the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.790
 script of fouls and 8 and also wrote the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.100
 main story of tape ciro ie 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.360
 has an important background and I think what 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.530
 can do very well even here give the 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.970
 jump as a director worth 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.680
 remember that nomura for example began 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.980
 as visions of characters and finally 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.780
 he jumped to director and he's gone more or less 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.670
 well it's not perfect either but it has 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.930
 gone more or less well tension some by 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.730
 hundred also continues to work in the 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.680
 title is character designer 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.500
 I imagine that only in the classics or 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.580
 redesigning the originals that also 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.560
 we find 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.180
 and already a month ago water in the role of 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.860
 character designer before mentioned 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.900
 to crystal chronicles and it makes sense that 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.660
 look like because this gentleman designed 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.850
 those games and with softail games of 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.350
 fate and the first crystal chronicles are 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.120
 part of his legacy and he also worked 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.160
 sick almost 10 as designer 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.900
 monsters worked in final fantasy 9 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.700
 as additional character designer 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.790
 It's worth doing secondary and in titles 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.780
 as saga frontier 2 or is not lost like that 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.280
 that at the moment we have three names 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.930
 important letters a project that has 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.940
 been covered by the shadow of crime 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.400
 he lacks feeling but he is the first 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.650
 let's see 2016 playstation 4 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.240
 Playstation Vita looks great 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.680
 I insist I will continue with the coverage 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.150
 of the channel title as they go 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.530
 announcing characters and so on 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.260
 you are going to bore those of bergua the final 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.400
 fantasy on the channel and nothing else in the 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.020
 comments then tell me what you think 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.030
 about the malicious like the title if 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.409
 what motivates us too much if with the remake 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.330
 by 2028 you have enough 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:47.080
 until the next video come kids 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.080
 until another
