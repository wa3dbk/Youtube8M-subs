00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
move within this to change the different

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.540 
move within this to change the different
colors<00:02:13.910> same<00:02:14.830> actually<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:16.100> not<00:02:16.190> too<00:02:16.340> bad

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
colors same actually it's not too bad

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.360 
colors same actually it's not too bad
that<00:02:17.030> one<00:02:17.150> there<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.680> tend<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.800> just<00:02:19.010> move<00:02:19.220> this

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
that one there I tend to just move this

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.350 
that one there I tend to just move this
a<00:02:19.430> little<00:02:19.640> bit<00:02:19.820> out<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.120> way

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
a little bit out of the way

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.570 
a little bit out of the way
and<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.660> tend<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.110> take<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.740> cursor<00:02:23.250> when<00:02:23.460> it

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
and I tend to take this cursor when it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.400 
and I tend to take this cursor when it
goes<00:02:23.700> off<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.090> screen<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.660> sample<00:02:24.930> color

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
goes off the screen you can sample color

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.530 
goes off the screen you can sample color
within<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.800> image<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.760> always<00:02:26.940> why<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.300> the

duplicate that image I personally could

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.960 
duplicate that image I personally could
stop<00:03:16.620> here<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:16.980> be<00:03:17.100> okay<00:03:17.400> but<00:03:17.670> let's

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
stop here and be okay but let's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.340 
stop here and be okay but let's
duplicate<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.540> image<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.900> see<00:03:19.080> what<00:03:19.230> this

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
duplicate the image and see what this

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.180 
duplicate the image and see what this
pop<00:03:19.590> art<00:03:19.830> does<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:21.860> instill<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:22.950> have<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.070> nice

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
pop art does and instill you have a nice

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.370 
pop art does and instill you have a nice
little<00:03:23.340> pop<00:03:23.580> art<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.600> instead<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.050> having<00:03:25.260> a

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
little pop art so instead of having a

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.229 
little pop art so instead of having a
sunflower<00:03:25.680> maybe<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.160> could<00:03:26.340> use<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> person's

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
sunflower maybe you could use a person's

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.060 
sunflower maybe you could use a person's
face<00:03:27.480> if<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.840> want<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.440> or<00:03:28.650> something<00:03:28.950> of

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
face if you want it to or something of

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.280 
face if you want it to or something of
that<00:03:29.100> sort<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:30.299> it's<00:03:30.420> just<00:03:30.570> another<00:03:30.750> option<00:03:31.170> at

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
that sort so it's just another option at

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.549 
that sort so it's just another option at
photoshop<00:03:31.650> elements<00:03:31.799> provide<00:03:32.310> you
