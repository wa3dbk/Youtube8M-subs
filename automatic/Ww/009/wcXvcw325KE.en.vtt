00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.280
Today we will witness
a great musical event

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.560
a performance of the J.S. Bach's
great Mass in B Minor

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.200
Beethoven Academy Orchestra
from Cracov was invited

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.200
by the University of Warsaw Choir.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.040
Extraordinary thing is that
the choirists are young amateurs.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.800
The greatest strenght of such
choirs is their motivation.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.680
I expect positive feedback
beetween choir and orchestra.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.280
Bach wrote vocal parts as if
they were instrumental solos.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.200
Mine would be the
"corno da caccia",
or "the hunting horn",

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.800
and two oboes d'amore
in the second aria.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.400
Both arias clearly written
as instrumental parts.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.680
My parts are mostly written
in a very high register.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.160
Not only single notes,
but the whole course.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.640
That always makes it
more difficult to sing.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.240
Bach's compositions
demand a lot from a vocalist,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.880
but their beauty,
their unprecedented harmonies,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.720
which seem to be
very ahead of their time,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.840
all that makes up for any difficulties.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.400
This isn't the first time
I sing with this choir.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.200
Our cooperation started
three or four years ago.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.520
I really enjoy it every time.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.600
My compliments to the choir.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.480
It is such a difficult piece
and they sang it like professionals.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.360
I'm so impressed I'm speechless.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.160
In particular "Agnus Dei"
by Małgorzata Pańko

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.480
Breathtaking.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.000
Magnificent concert,
exceptional choir's performance

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.360
Ms Bogdanovich should be very
proud of all the hard work, enthusiasm

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.680
and the great outcome.
Truly magnificent.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.680
I shared the great joy
of making music with you.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.960
