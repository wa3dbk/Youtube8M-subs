00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
isn't really a way to induce permanents

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.810 
isn't really a way to induce permanents
and<00:00:52.200> a<00:00:52.410> 10<00:00:52.560> you<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.310> you're<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.760> be

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and a 10 you so you're not going to be

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.190 
and a 10 you so you're not going to be
really<00:00:54.030> wanting<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.390> go<00:00:54.510> with<00:00:54.630> this<00:00:54.780> ability

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
really wanting to go with this ability

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.069 
really wanting to go with this ability
very<00:00:55.890> often<00:00:56.160> especially<00:00:56.940> since<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.900> it's

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
very often especially since that it's

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.840 
very often especially since that it's
rough<00:00:58.350> skin<00:00:58.650> ability<00:00:59.130> which<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.400> its<00:00:59.579> remote

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
rough skin ability which is its remote

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.000 
rough skin ability which is its remote
ability<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.390> far<00:01:00.899> superior<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:01.710> opinion

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
ability is far superior in my opinion

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.009 
ability is far superior in my opinion
just<00:01:02.610> because<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> allows<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:03.810> some

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
just because it allows you to get some

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
just because it allows you to get some
extra<00:01:04.259> damage<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.920> your<00:01:04.949> opponent<00:01:05.519> every<00:01:05.820> time

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
extra damage on your opponent every time

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.440 
extra damage on your opponent every time
they<00:01:06.150> attack<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.810> with<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.590> contact<00:01:08.159> move<00:01:08.450> but

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
they attack you with a contact move but

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.420 
they attack you with a contact move but
for<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.690> stats<00:01:09.960> even<00:01:10.800> though<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.010> Pokemon

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
speed meaning that it actually is pretty

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
its special attack is not very usable

its special attack is not very usable
especially<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.030> physical<00:01:51.689> attack

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
especially with the physical attack

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.080 
especially with the physical attack
being<00:01:52.320> far<00:01:52.530> superior<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.549> more<00:01:53.729> often<00:01:53.970> than

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
being far superior so more often than

set on gabite it will be from the
physical<00:01:57.689> side<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:59.009> with<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.280> let's<00:01:59.790> take<00:01:59.909> a

physical side but with that let's take a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.550 
physical side but with that let's take a
look<00:02:00.180> at<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> first<00:02:00.750> set<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.380> for

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
look at the first set that I have for

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.109 
look at the first set that I have for
you<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.830> this<00:02:01.920> video<00:02:02.070> which<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> more

you in this video which is a more

you in this video which is a more
defensive<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> first<00:02:05.700> off<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.150> set

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
defensive one so first off for the set

defensive one so first off for the set
we're<00:02:06.600> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> start<00:02:07.020> by<00:02:07.140> either<00:02:07.290> giving<00:02:07.740> a

we're going to start by either giving a
bite<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.310> impish<00:02:08.700> or<00:02:08.939> a<00:02:09.000> careful<00:02:09.450> nature<00:02:09.780> the

bite and impish or a careful nature the
ambush<00:02:10.590> nature<00:02:10.889> would<00:02:11.039> increase<00:02:11.370> your

ambush nature would increase your

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
attack whereas the careful nature will

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:15.950 
attack whereas the careful nature will
increase<00:02:15.120> your<00:02:15.150> special

if you do choose to go with the ambush
nature<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.110> this<00:02:43.770> works<00:02:43.950> extremely<00:02:44.370> well<00:02:44.580> for

nature and this works extremely well for

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.880 
nature and this works extremely well for
this<00:02:45.030> Pokemon<00:02:45.480> due<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> fact<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.260> as<00:02:46.590> I

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
this Pokemon due to the fact that as I

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.040 
this Pokemon due to the fact that as I
said<00:02:47.070> before<00:02:47.100> most<00:02:47.970> contact<00:02:48.540> moves<00:02:48.780> are

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
said before most contact moves are

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.920 
said before most contact moves are
physical<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.160> rough<00:02:50.520> skin<00:02:50.820> is<00:02:51.030> going<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.810> be

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
physical so rough skin is going to be

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.140 
physical so rough skin is going to be
very<00:02:52.110> useful<00:02:52.230> when<00:02:52.800> wanting<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.700> get<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.090> a

by one stage which is really good

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.260 
by one stage which is really good
because<00:03:10.500> as<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.340> said<00:03:11.400> before<00:03:11.520> this<00:03:11.880> Pokemon

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
because as I said before this Pokemon

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.180 
because as I said before this Pokemon
does<00:03:12.420> not<00:03:12.540> have<00:03:12.750> fantastic<00:03:13.290> defenses<00:03:14.010> but

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
does not have fantastic defenses but

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.220 
does not have fantastic defenses but
what<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.460> violet<00:03:14.940> item<00:03:15.210> they<00:03:15.660> become<00:03:15.990> very

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
what the violet item they become very

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.990 
what the violet item they become very
good<00:03:16.470> especially<00:03:16.800> from<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.370> physical<00:03:17.820> side

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
good especially from the physical side

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.910 
good especially from the physical side
which<00:03:18.570> means<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.870> good<00:03:19.140> bite<00:03:19.320> is<00:03:19.500> definitely

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
which means that good bite is definitely

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.760 
which means that good bite is definitely
able<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.340> take<00:03:20.550> physical<00:03:21.000> hits<00:03:21.180> pretty<00:03:21.510> well

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
able to take physical hits pretty well

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.650 
able to take physical hits pretty well
from<00:03:22.770> pretty<00:03:23.010> much<00:03:23.160> any<00:03:23.400> Pokemon<00:03:23.910> interior
