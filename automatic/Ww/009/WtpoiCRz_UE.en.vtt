00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hey my loves him well again 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.859
 I wanted to be there today 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.639
 quick test make of the new of the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.080
 new foundation the l'orÃ©al in broken 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.120
 24 hours frosty I hope you can 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.460
 I recognize you in the last dm hall 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.109
 shown and I have the last ones too 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.279
 Tried and I have a few things 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.410
 saying 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.720
 That's why I just wanted it today 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.570
 I'll do it with you now 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.820
 Apply together have my face 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.260
 now just eyes closed and one 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.390
 little lip care given on it 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.149
 otherwise I do not wear anything on the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.980
 face and yes I will now 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.010
 Just apply it I have the color 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.920
 12 natural roos that was the brightest 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 Hue which was there and I take mine 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.450
 sigma capo kiew 80 to apply 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.180
 I'll probably be here too 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.110
 on top of it and what I noticed 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.300
 is the first time of the order 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.059
 emphasizes incredibly dry skin 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.620
 and you have to work very fast 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.960
 I saw that too, I have now 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.670
 sometimes the hair as far as it went 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.439
 plugged it in and now simply evaluate it 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.530
 let's try it so you can do that very much 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.500
 very well covering by the way but you have to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.720
 work super fast because that will be just 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.450
 Very much of this creamy texture 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.250
 fast and then you have to stop 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.020
 be quick because that's how puttrich 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.049
 So that will really be like powder 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.100
 and you see, it's really great 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.100
 opacity so 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.130
 I'll do it fast now 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.440
 So you already see such a pea-sized 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:55.040
 Crowd now has for my whole face 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.540
 served and what I did today 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.440
 I have a night cream underneath 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.270
 given up 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.820
 because when I said that yesterday 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.830
 have given day cream are just 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.600
 I stop dry skin 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.760
 sometimes I'll show you where I am 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.290
 I usually have them up here 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.210
 I have mine today 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.600
 night cream taken after krems are yes 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.180
 generally richer and greasier 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.690
 a bit as day creams now I do 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.850
 The city is still fast from the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.110
 color fits it really wonderful it is 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.940
 exactly my shade at the moment I do it 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.850
 just my skin tone I'm really very 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.920
 So the best result is very enthusiastic 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.290
 Do you really get that if you're from that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.540
 product what goes on your brush and 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.430
 I already use it for eternity 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.680
 I can only recommend that on top of it 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.500
 give because otherwise this texture will 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.210
 really fast too dull and you can 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.370
 they do not work properly anymore 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.260
 sometimes I push that with me 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.470
 hands a little bit in here 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.760
 but I'm really excited but me 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.500
 she really does not have to say it for 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.050
 dry skin because they really every 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.209
 single skin scales would emphasize but 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.190
 I do not have very dry skin and 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.650
 What I noticed later is 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.870
 you no longer need powder because of the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.450
 really matted immediately and hope you 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.100
 sees that now is mine to me today 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.540
 cable broke so I see 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.520
 not now if I am keen 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.739
 I have to buy a new cable first 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.709
 Unfortunately, I saw that first when I did 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.940
 So the computer turned on 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.650
 normally I have a live picture next to me 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.330
 but unfortunately I do not see it today 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.580
 That's why I just work today 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.120
 under difficult conditions I think 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.290
 this foundation really very good 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.320
 many have written that they are at 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.600
 This is really more expensive for them 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.790
 really great I do not take any now 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.320
 powder more because the really great from 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.060
 So I hope you can do that 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.340
 recognize now reasonably well 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.860
 I have no shiny faces anymore 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.989
 which would be missing now 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.720
 And that's just what it takes 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.519
 not from neither in the small wrinkles 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.980
 here or below in the eye I would now 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.250
 one more 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.700
 take the concealer for this 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.720
 to lighten but unfortunately I have it 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.659
 none down here 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.209
 then I take my melanie place and 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.849
 give me and I'll just remember 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.920
 little rouge on the cheeks and so 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.160
 from the ceiling power and how that looks 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.290
 I like that really well 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.030
 no foundation for a long time 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.750
 I like it so much I have to 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.820
 honestly say yes now I will you 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.610
 let it off today during the day and 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:31.110
 today is very sunny 22 degrees me 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.580
 believe all of germany and yes let's see 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.960
 how it will be when I do it 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.400
 a bit in the sun in the afternoon 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.440
 sit there we have to look but 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.930
 So without brother now without everything sees 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.100
 the picture afterwards so we like it 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.690
 really good 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.870
 I like to write down below 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.320
 how he thinks that looks right 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.940
 Great, I'm really out and about 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.770
 you have to look at it 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.000
 above all things if you like and often 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.160
 The foundation also shines in the t zone 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.070
 yes, that just frosts it right now 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.539
 You see , that's really bomb 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.370
 So I'm blown away 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.720
 I have only a small one yesterday 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.310
 Tested and my finger 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.750
 applied and there you have to really 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.520
 be super fast 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.710
 So if you give that on the brush 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.740
 then that is very good 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.539
 work in it chases it just seen 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.919
 So you can stop a bit, yes 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.780
 I just wanted you this morning 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.340
 just show it 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.070
 I will do it the same way during the day 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.570
 let it on as you see it now and 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.430
 I hope you can the effect 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.050
 recognize a bit from before to afterwards 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.360
 So I have no problems and 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.990
 Not too big with skin irritations too 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.849
 fight 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.830
 I think if you have a night cream here 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.099
 Underneath, the result is simple 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.950
 even better because it marks so much 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:51.180
 So the foundation that yes with mine 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.729
 bobby brown bobby brown cream I think 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.320
 I do not know how to do it 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.479
 That's what I'm describing as this 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.860
 pad here not really suitable because 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.650
 that's really easy now 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.690
 night cream because by this mat 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.090
 can work properly 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.660
 yes, if I now the bobby brown cream 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.410
 took 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.530
 then I just think that 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.240
 Foundation would have beaten that way 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.640
 so I think so 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.640
 Moisture-proof from the night 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.340
 Cream and this foundation works 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.470
 really good and that was the plan and me 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.970
 think that you can also recognize it 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.400
 I'm going to a whole day of it 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.680
 and then I'm curious how 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.090
 My conclusion will be canceled now wishes 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.830
 i wish you a nice day and 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.830
 say goodbye then
