which<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.570> am<00:01:39.720> probably<00:01:39.990> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.350> glue<00:01:40.530> back

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
which I am probably going to glue back

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.560 
which I am probably going to glue back
in<00:01:40.979> because<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.310> want<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.939> cut<00:01:42.150> out<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.270> my

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
in because I want to cut out all my

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.120

holes in the top of the wing instead and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.249 
holes in the top of the wing instead and
finally<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> comes<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> couple<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.810> balsa

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
finally it comes with a couple of balsa

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.960 
finally it comes with a couple of balsa
Ella<00:01:46.439> wands<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.369> that's<00:01:47.520> everything<00:01:47.729> that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
Ella wands so that's everything that

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
Ella wands so that's everything that
came<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> kit<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.020> my<00:01:49.140> first<00:01:49.560> wing

building them so this is going to be a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.740 
building them so this is going to be a
learning<00:01:53.220> process<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:53.790> me<00:01:54.030> hopefully<00:01:54.600> when<00:01:54.720> I
