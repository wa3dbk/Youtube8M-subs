things we have this I know this is one
thing<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.610> remember<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.479> have

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.990 
there you go
now<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.860> line<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:17.490> slightly

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
now this line is actually slightly

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.679 
now this line is actually slightly
different<00:01:18.720> from<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.500> light<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.890> movie<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
different from the light in the movie it

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.170 
different from the light in the movie it
sounds<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.049> me<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:23.369> ended<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.880> having

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
sounds to me like they ended up having

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.730 
sounds to me like they ended up having
to<00:01:24.240> change<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.900> little<00:01:25.049> bit<00:01:25.200> because

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to change it just a little bit because

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.480

sort of toy in fact let's just use let's
just<00:01:46.350> use<00:01:46.500> ego<00:01:46.979> eye<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.210> little<00:01:48.360> bit

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
just use ego eye to get that little bit

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.399 
just use ego eye to get that little bit
closer

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
closer

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.469 
closer
and<00:01:51.100> yet<00:01:51.310> there<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.490> go<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:51.759> can't<00:01:52.119> see<00:01:52.329> that

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
and yet there you go you can't see that

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.740 
and yet there you go you can't see that
it<00:01:52.630> is<00:01:52.750> indeed<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.530> toy<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:55.270> course

it is indeed a toy and that is of course
well<00:01:56.020> most<00:01:56.259> likely<00:01:56.380> anyway<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.920> reference<00:01:57.460> to

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
well most likely anyway a reference to

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.260 
well most likely anyway a reference to
mrs.<00:01:57.850> Doubtfire<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:59.039> yeah<00:02:00.039> Alex<00:02:00.640> for<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.000> win
