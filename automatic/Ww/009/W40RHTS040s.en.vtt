00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
and then what happens after that is

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.030 
and then what happens after that is
let's<00:03:42.569> say<00:03:42.659> when<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:42.989> uploaded<00:03:43.409> another<00:03:43.590> video

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
let's say when I uploaded another video

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.809 
let's say when I uploaded another video
that<00:03:44.310> night<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:45.120> evening<00:03:45.569> it<00:03:46.010> put<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.129> back

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
that night that evening it put it back

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.369 
that night that evening it put it back
up<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:48.150> top<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.420> your<00:03:48.510> sub<00:03:48.720> box<00:03:48.959> but<00:03:49.140> what<00:03:49.290> it

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
up the top of your sub box but what it

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.050 
up the top of your sub box but what it
does<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.830> it<00:03:49.860> takes<00:03:50.159> the<00:03:50.310> other<00:03:50.519> video<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:51.030> I

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
does is it takes the other video that I

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.240 
does is it takes the other video that I
posted<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.569> day<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.080> it<00:03:52.470> puts<00:03:52.680> them<00:03:52.860> both<00:03:53.040> at

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
posted that day and it puts them both at

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.470 
posted that day and it puts them both at
the<00:03:53.280> top<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:53.580> your<00:03:53.700> cell<00:03:53.909> backs<00:03:54.060> at<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.299> same

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
the top of your cell backs at the same

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.839 
the top of your cell backs at the same
time<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.110> that's<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.040> guess<00:03:56.129> that's<00:03:56.459> how

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
time and that's I guess that's how

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.369 
time and that's I guess that's how
people<00:03:57.209> are<00:03:57.330> trying<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.569> use<00:03:57.659> the<00:03:57.840> system

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
people are trying to use the system

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.410 
people are trying to use the system
instead<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.280> actually<00:03:59.610> posting<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.060> second

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
instead of actually posting a second

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.179 
instead of actually posting a second
video<00:04:00.599> they're<00:04:00.780> doing<00:04:00.989> an<00:04:01.080> unlisted<00:04:01.379> and<00:04:01.739> it's

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
video they're doing an unlisted and it's

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.759 
video they're doing an unlisted and it's
causing<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:03.120> that<00:04:03.810> video<00:04:04.200> first<00:04:04.470> thing

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
causing it that that video first thing

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.770 
causing it that that video first thing
that<00:04:05.340> day<00:04:05.519> or<00:04:05.670> whatever<00:04:05.819> to<00:04:06.120> be<00:04:06.239> put<00:04:06.480> back<00:04:06.599> up

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
that day or whatever to be put back up
