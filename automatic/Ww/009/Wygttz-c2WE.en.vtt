I<00:01:53.270> talked<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.360> Jordan<00:01:54.660> about<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.020> he<00:01:55.140> was

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
I talked to Jordan about it and he was

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.670 
I talked to Jordan about it and he was
like<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.800> just<00:01:55.980> seems<00:01:56.160> so<00:01:56.370> unnatural<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.880> me

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
like it just seems so unnatural to me

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.750 
like it just seems so unnatural to me
and<00:01:58.680> yeah<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:58.980> does<00:01:59.130> look<00:01:59.160> unnatural

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
and yeah it does look unnatural

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.050 
and yeah it does look unnatural
sometimes<00:02:00.330> actually<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.990> lot<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.230> the<00:02:01.290> times

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
sometimes actually a lot of the times

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.400 
sometimes actually a lot of the times
but<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.300> think<00:02:03.360> I'll<00:02:03.660> still<00:02:04.110> think<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.380> looks

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
but I think I'll still think it looks

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.460 
but I think I'll still think it looks
pretty<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.100> would<00:02:05.370> feel<00:02:05.550> bad<00:02:06.170> like<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
pretty but I would feel bad like if it

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.580 
pretty but I would feel bad like if it
got<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.710> his<00:02:07.860> face<00:02:08.780> which<00:02:09.780> could<00:02:10.110> happen<00:02:10.320> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
got on his face which could happen I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.460 
got on his face which could happen I
guess<00:02:11.120> anyway<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.970> but<00:02:14.970> uh<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:16.290> so

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
guess anyway this this is but uh and so

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.290 
guess anyway this this is but uh and so
