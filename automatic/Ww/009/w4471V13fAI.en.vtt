I've been roughly about 30 to 45 minutes

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.499 
I've been roughly about 30 to 45 minutes
at<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> local<00:00:13.230> school<00:00:13.349> ground<00:00:13.950> playground<00:00:14.880> and

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
at a local school ground playground and

detector<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.720> I've<00:00:22.050> had<00:00:22.320> about<00:00:22.470> two

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
detector that I have I've had about two

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.769 
detector that I have I've had about two
years<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:24.050> it's<00:00:25.050> called<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.560> Garrett<00:00:26.210> 550<00:00:27.210> GTA

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
years and it's called a Garrett 550 GTA

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.299 
years and it's called a Garrett 550 GTA
X<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.970> this<00:00:29.970> particular<00:00:30.800> detector<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.949> very

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
X and this particular detector is very

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.060 
X and this particular detector is very
good<00:00:34.190> one<00:00:35.190> feature<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:36.030> about<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.899> that

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
good one feature I like about it is that

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.889 
good one feature I like about it is that
it<00:00:38.070> has<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> coin<00:00:39.000> tone<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.129> unmistakable

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
it has a coin tone that is unmistakable

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.250 
it has a coin tone that is unmistakable
if<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.559> come<00:00:43.739> across<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.129> coin<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.930> has<00:00:46.230> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
if you come across a coin it has a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.790 
if you come across a coin it has a
distinct<00:00:47.010> tone<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:48.870> will<00:00:49.050> demonstrate

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
distinct tone and I will demonstrate

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.939 
distinct tone and I will demonstrate
this<00:00:50.100> at<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.820> time<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> apron<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
this at this time I have a apron with a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.410 
this at this time I have a apron with a
quarter<00:00:53.460> placed<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.149> top<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:55.129> you<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
quarter placed on top as you can see and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.049 
quarter placed on top as you can see and
I'm<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> take<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.010> metal<00:00:59.370> detector

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
I'm going to take the metal detector

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.590 
I'm going to take the metal detector
over<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> top<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:02.039> quarter<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:03.149> try<00:01:03.539> to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
over the top of the quarter now try to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.399 
over the top of the quarter now try to
point<00:01:04.019> at<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.320> same<00:01:04.710> time<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> display

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
point at the same time on the display

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.100 
point at the same time on the display
the<00:01:07.409> quarter<00:01:07.950> symbol<00:01:08.430> I'll<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.630> this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the quarter symbol I'll do that at this

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:27.530 
the quarter symbol I'll do that at this
time<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.360> hear<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:26.540> it's

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
time so as you can hear and see it's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
time so as you can hear and see it's
unmistakable<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.579> corner<00:01:30.560> over

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
unmistakable that it is the corner over

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.940 
unmistakable that it is the corner over
probably<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.460> past<00:01:32.700> two<00:01:33.119> years<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.950> found

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
probably the past two years I found

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.399 
probably the past two years I found
roughly<00:01:35.310> about<00:01:35.670> five<00:01:36.299> hundred<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.900> seven

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
roughly about five hundred and seven

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.530 
roughly about five hundred and seven
dollars<00:01:37.520> worth<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.759> various<00:01:39.299> coins<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.540> when

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
dollars worth of various coins so when

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.370 
dollars worth of various coins so when
you're<00:01:42.740> buying<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:44.040> detector<00:01:44.899> make<00:01:45.899> sure<00:01:46.170> you

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
you're buying a detector make sure you

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.469 
you're buying a detector make sure you
get<00:01:46.590> one<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.920> has<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> good<00:01:48.140> discriminating

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
get one that has a good discriminating

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.580 
get one that has a good discriminating
program<00:01:53.119> that<00:01:54.119> way<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.570> pays<00:01:54.869> off<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
program that way it pays off for you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.359
