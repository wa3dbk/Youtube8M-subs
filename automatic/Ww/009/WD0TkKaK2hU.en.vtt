00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.350 
couple that I made they're nothing
special<00:00:40.950> there<00:00:41.370> super<00:00:41.760> simple<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.149> didn't

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
special there super simple I didn't

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.240

think that these camels obviously are

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.600 
think that these camels obviously are
not<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.410> carry<00:00:46.590> over<00:00:46.800> into<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.309> full

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
not going to carry over into the full

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
not going to carry over into the full
