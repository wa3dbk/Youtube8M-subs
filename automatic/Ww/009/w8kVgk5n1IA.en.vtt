00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.680
 Hello everyone~ I am dancing autumn wind 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.460
 I want to bring you a novice survival teaching series today. 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.380
 Today... 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.820
 The lesson taught today is actually... 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.320
 Ugh...... 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.500
 Novices don't matter 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.880
 Because this is just a pure interest. 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.980
 Interest 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.060
 A ~ interest 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.100
 Will interest be written? 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.340
 Not that sex 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.880
 Don't write typo 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.420
 That...oh... 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.360
 First of all, to complete this interest. 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.060
 Must have this 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.920
 Deng Deng~ 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.640
 fishing rod 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.780
 This is how the fishing rod is synthesized. 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.140
 It is called a fishing rod 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.560
 Get the fishing rod 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.840
 That's right 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.340
 Now everyone knows what we are going to do. 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.640
 Just going fishing 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.100
 That... interest is all right. 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.240
 Interest 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.780
 Fishing? 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.440
 In the Minecraft world, it can only be regarded as an interest. 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.020
 Ok... 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.460
 You are not living underwater 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.720
 There are many ways to get your food source. 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.020
 Um... I donâ€™t need to rely on fishing to eat food. 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.740
 Then... if you want to cultivate this interest? 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.020
 The first thing, of course, is to have patience. 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.480
 Can cultivate 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.700
 Then the second thing is to find a piece... 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.480
 Ok... 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.120
 It's not easy to hook up to the side... 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.860
 The vast majority... 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.960
 Vast waters 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.700
 Like this piece 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.920
 You told me what would be hooked up 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.760
 No one believes 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.260
 Eh... 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.760
 and then... 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760
 Hey... we just press our right button 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.320
 The rest is... 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.820
 Wait 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.380
 That's right 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.880
 Just wait 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.020
 Quietly waiting for the hook of our fish 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.320
 Wow~ 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.140
 Have you seen ~ 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.200
 Fish hooked 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.620
 Fish hooked 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.940
 Fish hooked 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.020
 Raw fish hooked up 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.700
 Ok... 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.760
 Just if... 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.260
 Ok... 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.000
 Audience 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.520
 If you press the fast forward button 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.780
 that... 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.500
 Please don't fish. 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.100
 This interest is not for you. 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.120
 This interest is not for you. 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.260
 Fishing is as simple as that 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.240
 After going out 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.880
 Wait until its buoy sinks 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.700
 The moment the buoy sinks 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.560
 Eh... 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.080
 buoy 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.760
å”‰...buoy 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.680
 I have to wait for the buoy to sink. 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.440
 Fishing is a very patient interest. 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.800
 A patient person with patience can complete this interest 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.520
 Normal people can't do it. 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.820
 When it floats... 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.320
 Hey~ 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.780
 Pull it 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.340
 The fish will fall to your side. 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.420
 Itâ€™s that simple 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.940
 Do you understand 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.880
 Are you interested in developing this interest? 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.000
 Ok... 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.720
 Just like this 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.580
 This lesson... 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.800
 Not new... novices will not and no Kansai 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.300
 Interested people come fishing again 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.940
 Thank you for watching. 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.940
 We will meet again 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.120
 Hey~
