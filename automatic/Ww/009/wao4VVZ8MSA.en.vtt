if your laptop only boots up with a

if your laptop only boots up with a
white<00:00:44.310> screen<00:00:44.550> you've<00:00:45.030> got<00:00:45.060> a<00:00:45.270> problem<00:00:45.540> and

white screen you've got a problem and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.960 
white screen you've got a problem and
here's<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.410> solution<00:00:49.670> first<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:50.940> to

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
here's the solution first you have to

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.160 
here's the solution first you have to
open<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:51.510> laptop

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
open your laptop

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.890 
open your laptop
remove<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.340> screws<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> screwdriver<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
remove the screws with a screwdriver and

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.750 
remove the screws with a screwdriver and
make<00:00:55.739> sure<00:00:55.920> you're<00:00:56.100> checked<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.730> hidden

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
make sure you're checked for hidden

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.940 
make sure you're checked for hidden
screws<00:00:57.390> under<00:00:57.720> stickers<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.350> tapes<00:01:00.950> every

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950

laptop<00:01:02.130> is<00:01:02.400> built<00:01:02.610> differently<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.420> have

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
laptop is built differently so you have

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.450 
laptop is built differently so you have
to<00:01:03.870> identify<00:01:04.020> all<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> parts<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
to identify all of the parts and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.910 
to identify all of the parts and
observes<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:06.479> signal<00:01:06.840> wave<00:01:07.080> from<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
observes the signal wave from the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.900 
observes the signal wave from the
motherboard<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.550> your<00:01:08.670> screen<00:01:10.850> somewhere<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
motherboard to your screen somewhere in

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.430 
motherboard to your screen somewhere in
the<00:01:12.030> signal<00:01:12.360> path<00:01:12.390> must<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> bad<00:01:13.410> connection

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
the signal path must be a bad connection

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.760 
the signal path must be a bad connection
or<00:01:14.190> a<00:01:14.250> loose<00:01:14.610> joint<00:01:17.930> if<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.050> can't<00:01:19.290> find<00:01:19.560> any

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
or a loose joint if you can't find any

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.740 
or a loose joint if you can't find any
bad<00:01:20.009> connections<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.940> way<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.420> screen

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
bad connections on the way to the screen

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.510 
bad connections on the way to the screen
it<00:01:22.080> might<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.740> behind<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.460> screen

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.399 

if<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.150> let<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.479> bone<00:01:31.630> lipids<00:01:31.960> out<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.320> the

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
if you let the bone lipids out of the

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.680 
if you let the bone lipids out of the
white<00:01:32.560> screen<00:01:32.860> this<00:01:33.130> means<00:01:33.460> there's<00:01:34.330> power

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
white screen this means there's power

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.630 
white screen this means there's power
for<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.049> backlighting<00:01:35.500> but<00:01:35.799> no<00:01:36.010> signal<00:01:36.460> for

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
for the backlighting but no signal for

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.399 
for the backlighting but no signal for
the<00:01:36.700> actual<00:01:36.970> picture<00:01:37.479> so<00:01:37.810> we<00:01:37.960> have<00:01:38.080> to<00:01:38.229> check

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
the actual picture so we have to check

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.010 
the actual picture so we have to check
every<00:01:38.830> connection<00:01:39.190> in<00:01:39.520> your<00:01:39.610> laptop<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:40.810> make

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
every connection in your laptop to make

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.630 
every connection in your laptop to make
sure<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.320> works<00:01:41.590> again<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.430> last

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
sure it works again and the last

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.120 
sure it works again and the last
connection<00:01:42.909> it<00:01:43.840> might<00:01:44.200> possibly<00:01:44.440> be<00:01:44.860> is

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
connection it might possibly be is

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:54.330 
connection it might possibly be is
behind<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.850> actual<00:01:46.119> screen

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.490 

pay<00:01:54.880> close<00:01:55.119> attention<00:01:55.299> when<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:56.020> remove<00:01:56.320> the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
pay close attention when you remove the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:10.139 
pay close attention when you remove the
screen<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.009> breaks<00:01:57.310> easily<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:08.849> there<00:02:09.849> it<00:02:09.970> is

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
screen and breaks easily and there it is

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.600 
screen and breaks easily and there it is
we<00:02:10.390> found<00:02:10.660> two<00:02:10.810> loose<00:02:10.959> joints

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.550 

this<00:02:15.240> little<00:02:15.450> connector<00:02:15.750> causes<00:02:16.290> all<00:02:16.440> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
this little connector causes all the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.960 
this little connector causes all the
trouble<00:02:18.770> just<00:02:19.770> losing<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.190> reconnected

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
trouble just losing it reconnected

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.340 
trouble just losing it reconnected
properly<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.630> secure<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.140> some

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
properly and secure it with some

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:32.230 
properly and secure it with some
adhesive<00:02:22.800> tape<00:02:25.220> now<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.610> test

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.190 

push<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.050> button<00:02:33.350> wait<00:02:33.980> for<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.310> little<00:02:34.610> and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
push the button wait for a little and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.780 
push the button wait for a little and
receipt<00:02:36.200> booting<00:02:36.620> up<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:37.070> hopefully<00:02:37.550> there's

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
receipt booting up and hopefully there's

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.720 
receipt booting up and hopefully there's
a<00:02:37.850> picture

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.000 

and<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.390> works<00:02:45.599> so<00:02:46.110> don't<00:02:46.349> forget<00:02:46.530> though<00:02:46.980> a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
and it works so don't forget though a

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.690 
and it works so don't forget though a
just<00:02:47.520> repair<00:02:47.879> yourself

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700
