about<00:00:01.510> a<00:00:01.540> year<00:00:01.839> ago<00:00:01.930> one<00:00:02.800> of<00:00:02.830> our<00:00:02.980> large

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
about a year ago one of our large

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.929 
about a year ago one of our large
customers<00:00:04.740> asked<00:00:05.740> us<00:00:05.830> to<00:00:05.979> deploy<00:00:06.310> our<00:00:06.549> system

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939 
customers asked us to deploy our system

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.410 
customers asked us to deploy our system
in<00:00:07.209> the<00:00:07.569> UK<00:00:07.870> we<00:00:08.620> rolled<00:00:09.460> out<00:00:09.639> the<00:00:09.849> system<00:00:10.210> and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
in the UK we rolled out the system and

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.589 
in the UK we rolled out the system and
within<00:00:11.290> a<00:00:11.769> couple<00:00:11.860> of<00:00:12.190> weeks<00:00:12.250> they<00:00:13.000> had<00:00:13.179> cut

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 
within a couple of weeks they had cut

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.390 
within a couple of weeks they had cut
over<00:00:13.870> to<00:00:14.139> it<00:00:14.259> completely<00:00:14.559> and<00:00:14.919> started

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
over to it completely and started

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.540 
over to it completely and started
running<00:00:15.549> campaigns<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:17.199> then<00:00:17.529> got<00:00:18.279> a<00:00:18.310> call

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
running campaigns and then got a call

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.490 
running campaigns and then got a call
and<00:00:18.730> the<00:00:19.090> call<00:00:19.269> was<00:00:19.599> you<00:00:19.869> know<00:00:19.990> almost<00:00:20.410> a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
and the call was you know almost a

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.259 
and the call was you know almost a
distress<00:00:20.890> signal<00:00:21.099> but<00:00:21.490> it<00:00:21.580> was<00:00:21.670> essentially

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
distress signal but it was essentially

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.960 
distress signal but it was essentially
hey<00:00:22.990> the<00:00:23.199> system<00:00:23.529> is<00:00:23.650> not<00:00:23.769> working<00:00:24.189> we<00:00:24.760> looked

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
hey the system is not working we looked

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.269 
hey the system is not working we looked
at<00:00:25.150> it<00:00:25.330> and<00:00:25.420> we<00:00:26.050> found<00:00:26.230> the<00:00:26.470> problem<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:27.009> the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
at it and we found the problem and the

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.160 
at it and we found the problem and the
problem<00:00:27.699> was<00:00:27.849> the<00:00:28.359> savings<00:00:28.929> or<00:00:29.080> the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
problem was the savings or the

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.480 
problem was the savings or the
efficiency<00:00:29.529> that<00:00:29.920> the<00:00:30.039> system<00:00:30.369> had

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
efficiency that the system had

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.339 
efficiency that the system had
introduced<00:00:31.000> were<00:00:31.269> so<00:00:31.539> great<00:00:31.839> that

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
introduced were so great that

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.260 
introduced were so great that
essentially<00:00:33.219> they<00:00:33.340> were<00:00:33.370> only<00:00:33.610> able<00:00:33.879> to<00:00:34.000> spend

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
essentially they were only able to spend

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.590 
essentially they were only able to spend
about<00:00:34.540> 20%<00:00:35.350> of<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.790> budget<00:00:37.180> that<00:00:37.300> had<00:00:37.450> been

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
about 20% of the budget that had been

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.229 
about 20% of the budget that had been
previously<00:00:38.129> allocated<00:00:39.129> what<00:00:39.700> first<00:00:39.969> looked

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
previously allocated what first looked

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.090 
previously allocated what first looked
like<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.420> system<00:00:40.870> issue<00:00:41.020> actually<00:00:41.410> wound<00:00:41.920> up

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
like a system issue actually wound up

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.430 
like a system issue actually wound up
being<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:43.120> planning<00:00:43.539> or<00:00:43.719> in<00:00:43.809> budgeting<00:00:44.260> issue

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
being the planning or in budgeting issue

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.729 
being the planning or in budgeting issue
and<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.879> you<00:00:46.120> know<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.390> net<00:00:46.899> net<00:00:47.140> was<00:00:47.500> that

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
and the you know the net net was that

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.799 
and the you know the net net was that
the<00:00:48.460> marketers<00:00:48.969> and<00:00:49.180> market<00:00:49.600> had<00:00:49.780> been

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
the marketers and market had been

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.520 
the marketers and market had been
spending<00:00:50.489> possibly<00:00:51.489> 80%<00:00:52.329> above<00:00:53.050> what<00:00:53.440> they

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
spending possibly 80% above what they

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.170 
spending possibly 80% above what they
should<00:00:53.739> have<00:00:53.770> been<00:00:53.890> spending<00:00:54.250> to<00:00:54.789> reach<00:00:54.969> the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
should have been spending to reach the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.970 
should have been spending to reach the
same<00:00:55.359> goals<00:00:55.660> that<00:00:55.780> they<00:00:56.079> that<00:00:56.590> they<00:00:56.680> had<00:00:56.829> in

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
same goals that they that they had in

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:06.630 
same goals that they that they had in
place<00:01:04.440> rather<00:01:05.440> than<00:01:05.770> becoming<00:01:06.220> more

place rather than becoming more

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.670 
place rather than becoming more
transparent<00:01:07.300> it's<00:01:07.450> become<00:01:07.780> less<00:01:08.050> transparent

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
transparent it's become less transparent

transparent it's become less transparent
the<00:01:08.890> truth<00:01:09.100> of<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.340> matter<00:01:09.370> is<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.790> lot<00:01:10.150> of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
the truth of the matter is a lot of

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.970 
the truth of the matter is a lot of
brands<00:01:10.630> haven't<00:01:10.960> made<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.260> shift<00:01:11.530> into

brands haven't made the shift into
taking<00:01:12.130> control<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:12.970> driving<00:01:13.300> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.970 

the<00:01:19.330> audience<00:01:19.660> science<00:01:20.020> platform<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.680> really

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
the audience science platform is really

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.760 
the audience science platform is really
a<00:01:21.670> culmination<00:01:22.180> of<00:01:22.480> about<00:01:22.780> 12<00:01:23.110> years<00:01:23.410> of<00:01:23.560> work

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
a culmination of about 12 years of work

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.570 
a culmination of about 12 years of work
it's<00:01:24.460> essentially<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.060> full<00:01:25.860> Anton<00:01:26.860> solution

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
it's essentially a full Anton solution

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.600 
it's essentially a full Anton solution
that<00:01:28.450> integrates<00:01:28.840> very<00:01:29.590> well<00:01:29.830> together<00:01:30.100> and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
that integrates very well together and

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.940 
that integrates very well together and
that<00:01:31.240> is<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.540> core<00:01:31.810> principle<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:32.770> the

that is the core principle is the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.800 
that is the core principle is the
integration<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.700> these<00:01:33.850> components<00:01:34.480> into<00:01:34.780> a

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
integration of these components into a

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:46.309 
integration of these components into a
very<00:01:35.230> cohesive<00:01:35.680> system

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.660 

some<00:01:47.319> of<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:47.500> results<00:01:47.649> that<00:01:47.950> marketers<00:01:48.490> get

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
some of the results that marketers get

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.279 
some of the results that marketers get
when<00:01:48.880> they<00:01:48.969> work<00:01:49.119> with<00:01:49.149> audience<00:01:49.630> science<00:01:50.020> are

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
when they work with audience science are

when they work with audience science are
that<00:01:50.799> immediately<00:01:51.219> they<00:01:51.520> can<00:01:51.729> see<00:01:51.939> they're
