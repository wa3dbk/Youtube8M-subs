00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 good in today's tutorial 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.540
 I want to show you how to use a 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.580
 application that is called winter board tal 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.400
 and how do you see it here which is going to 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.860
 allow customize the appearance of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.630
 what is our iphone phone in 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.570
 where you are going to have the possibility of 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.460
 install different themes and obviously 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.180
 make it look just like you 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.320
 like 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.410
 I want to mention that this application 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.390
 to be able to install it you need to have already 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.460
 the jailbreak on your iphone phone 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.489
 I want to also mention that this 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
 it works for what is an ipad if you 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.540
 you do not have your phone with the jailbreak or 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.760
 your ipad with the jailbreak here I'm going to 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.469
 leave some links in the description 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.390
 also from the video you will find some 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.820
 links so you can learn 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.890
 first how to jailbreak the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.230
 certain equipment that you have and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.870
 later to be able to install what is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.129
 the application that I am mentioning 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.079
 winterboard when we already have 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.390
 the jailbreak on the phone what 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.489
 you have to do is go to Syria 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.590
 just as you see it on this side when you give it 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.680
 one click the application opens in the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.489
 bottom part where it says look we're going to 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.829
 give a click 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.770
 from this side you are going to look for winter 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.840
 world usually when you write the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.149
 name then good appears to you already 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.520
 result of this side is the first 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.140
 option where winterboard says in this 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.119
 case it appears to me with a popcorn 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.950
 because I already have it installed in this 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.429
 moment but in control of the part 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.350
 from above where he says modify there he would say 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.330
 technically install it regularly 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.830
 when you click on it, this appears 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.189
 menu where you are going to select 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.780
 install it and then it starts to 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.850
 install you will see the screen 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.130
 Black will continue with the process and 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.360
 later until the end you will 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 appear an option to return 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.009
 Silvia again when you already 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.590
 you install when you come to what 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.690
 is let's say the desk of your phone 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.700
 You will find the application that 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.490
 flame winterboard me at this moment 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.830
 As I have customized the phone is 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.869
 why the icon looks that way 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.939
 but it may be that the whole time of 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.520
 that you install it look different what 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.560
 The only thing you have to do is open it and 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.049
 on this side you will find different 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.920
 options the first one above is where 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.310
 it will allow you 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.170
 and select the configurations of a 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.900
 certain subject that you already have 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.000
 installed in advance in this case 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.790
 the theme that I have installed is called 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.640
 colors and if you notice me they appear 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.790
 all those options with regard to what 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.980
 that is the topic that I downloaded 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.440
 moment when I selected it 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.200
 technically active it or deactivated it 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.600
 here every topic that you install goes to 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.760
 have different configurations by 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.010
 example here in the bottom part I have 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.930
 another one called atomic and this 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.180
 it's just showing me two 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.730
 options if I wanted to activate the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.810
 atomic the only thing I do is select 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.660
 both and obviously to select those from 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.540
 up because technically I want that 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.430
 this other topic is placed when I 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.910
 back clicking here up where 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.760
 says winterboard and I give spring in the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.489
 top left technically the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.400
 phone goes off and turns on let's say it 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.550
 so that automatically that topic 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.860
 that you activate take effect 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.560
 I'm going to open my phone here how do you 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.390
 you will notice the icons have changed 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.180
 I want to mention that when you activate 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.820
 regularly a topic almost always these 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.820
 they install what they are background or 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.040
 world papers and wallpapers for 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.780
 that you can change them if I enter the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.390
 phone settings already 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.760
 then entry to where it says 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.000
 wallpapers and brightness that means 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.680
 wallpaper and obviously the brightness 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.500
 entering this section I will be able to 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.930
 select this for below 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.940
 change what the wallpaper is if I 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.850
 I click here where it says styles or 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.590
 to take still images from this side 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.380
 at the bottom regularly you get 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.560
 they install those wallpapers that 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.410
 obviously includes the theme that you have 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.270
 activated if I give you set in the part of 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.520
 down that technically means 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.350
 place it will ask me where 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.510
 I want to place it or be the bottom of 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.580
 screen in the first window when 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.130
 our phone is asleep or in the 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.200
 home window that is technically the 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.570
 what we see behind when our phone 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.280
 It's in use 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.190
 select at the bottom that what 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.770
 place in both that is exactly what 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.230
 that I did at this moment I return to 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.750
 where it was and automatically there would be 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.910
 activated correctly what is the 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.010
 theme that I would have installed if I 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.670
 back to the application I want to show you 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.770
 that within this section you are always going to 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.600
 can activate or deactivate what is 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.730
 any subject that you previously have 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.770
 downloaded if you want to turn off everything 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.830
 and leave it how it was 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.330
 originally I did not select anything 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.400
 return to the previous window 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.760
 I give him again in the spring of 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.260
 up my phone restarts already 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.810
 continuation 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.120
 technically our original theme of the 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.250
 phone would go back to how it 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.960
 I found from the beginning here if I 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.520
 I would like to change the fund again 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.740
 screen and put the one next 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.230
 originally with the phone you know 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.030
 how to enter the configurations to 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.850
 the wallpapers and automatically 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.190
 select anyone then like this 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.800
 easy is how it works what it is 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.020
 the winter board application so that 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.460
 you can activate what are topics that 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.220
 you have previously installed your 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.960
 phone or your ipad I hope it serves you and 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.410
 I'm going to leave a video below for 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.990
 show you how you can search by topics and 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.910
