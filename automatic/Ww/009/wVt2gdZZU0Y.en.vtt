00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
these by the way because it's not

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.220

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.179 
the only costs like the most expensive
things<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.840> 250<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.619> most<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.920> stuff<00:01:56.070> was

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
things like 250 but most of stuff was

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.920 
things like 250 but most of stuff was
like<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.490> dollar<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.060> dollar<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.689> below

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
like in the dollar to dollar like below

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.350 
like in the dollar to dollar like below
to<00:01:58.079> dollar<00:01:58.229> range<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.340> all<00:01:59.460> fairly<00:02:00.060> good

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to dollar range so it's all fairly good

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.789 
to dollar range so it's all fairly good
value<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> mean<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.409> cheaper<00:02:01.770> than

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
value I mean it's cheaper than

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.200 
value I mean it's cheaper than
McDonald's<00:02:02.369> stuff<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.820> most<00:02:02.969> part<00:02:03.149> unless

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
McDonald's stuff and most part unless

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.399 
McDonald's stuff and most part unless
you're<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.600> off<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.840> their<00:02:03.990> breakfast

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
you're going off of their breakfast

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.950 
you're going off of their breakfast
value<00:02:04.710> menu<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.159> would<00:02:05.700> give<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.509> high

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
value menu I would give this one a high

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
value menu I would give this one a high
three<00:02:07.320> there's<00:02:08.069> nothing<00:02:08.220> super<00:02:08.729> special

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
three there's nothing super special

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.430 
three there's nothing super special
about<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.479> mean<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:09.750> very<00:02:09.840> simplistic

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
about it I mean it's very simplistic

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.890 
about it I mean it's very simplistic
it's<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.770> flat<00:02:10.950> bread<00:02:11.220> cheese<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.300> sausage

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it's just flat bread cheese and sausage

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
it's just flat bread cheese and sausage
but

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
but

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.500 
but
the<00:02:14.010> price<00:02:14.250> wise<00:02:14.520> it's<00:02:14.819> fairly<00:02:15.060> delicious

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
the price wise it's fairly delicious

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.240 
the price wise it's fairly delicious
it's<00:02:15.660> above<00:02:15.870> average<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.380> wouldn't<00:02:16.920> say<00:02:17.069> it's

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it's above average I wouldn't say it's

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.370 
it's above average I wouldn't say it's
super<00:02:17.610> amazing<00:02:18.090> or<00:02:18.209> anything<00:02:18.540> unlike<00:02:19.230> other

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380
