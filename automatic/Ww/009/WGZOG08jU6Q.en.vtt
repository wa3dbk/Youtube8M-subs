00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.879
 okay we are here at the booth 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:06.419
 Polish company have no idea how to do it 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.760
 pronounce 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.950
 there are 3d printers to see 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.130
 about 800 euro should cost 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.009
 the prints as used by 3d printers 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.779
 here now with plastics the pressure 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.070
 The table is made of glass and is heated 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.029
 sees these hot coils down there 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.070
 but the special thing about this 3d 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.019
 printer is actually that he is modular 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.089
 that means I can 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.550
 instead of this normal printhead and 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.379
 various other 3d printer heads there 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.020
 For example, you build what you build 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.519
 right here at the front that knows that I am 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.989
 myself with a 3d printer made and 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.890
 I can eat chocolate or cake dough 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.980
 with print 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.840
 that next to it is a conventional one 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.370
 Print head with two nozzles for two 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.620
 different plastic materials 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.500
 at the same time there is the whole 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.929
 normal standards printhead with with only 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.850
 a nozzle and then there are still 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.320
 the possibility of a small cutter 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.880
 to incorporate that one, so to speak 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.700
 can use as cnc milling machine 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.010
 yes the device has a closed 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.530
 space that the heat stays inside 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.360
 and there is another very interesting one 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.480
 thing can be the normal 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.170
 plastic material of how accustomed 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.730
 wind up or use coils 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.660
 special sticks which one into each other 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.360
 can get stuck 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.590
 and then you can get such striped objects 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.270
 build from it with changing colors 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.270
 yes it all looks very exciting 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.590
 his 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.590
 previously are soaked
