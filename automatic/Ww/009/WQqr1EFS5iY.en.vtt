00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
that it relieves a lot of frustration

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.960 
that it relieves a lot of frustration
between<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.540> pad<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:26.989> owner<00:03:27.970> you

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
between the the pad and the owner you

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.610 
between the the pad and the owner you
know<00:03:29.090> because<00:03:29.900> if<00:03:30.019> you're<00:03:30.170> trained<00:03:30.349> you<00:03:30.470> don't

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
know because if you're trained you don't

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.020 
know because if you're trained you don't
know<00:03:30.709> how<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:30.890> train<00:03:31.129> your<00:03:31.190> your<00:03:31.609> puppy<00:03:31.940> your
