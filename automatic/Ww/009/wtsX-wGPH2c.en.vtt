not saying that summer flings always end

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.319 
not saying that summer flings always end
because<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:44.010> don't<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.550> might<00:00:44.760> meet<00:00:45.059> your

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329

ultimate<00:00:45.840> perfect<00:00:46.200> match<00:00:46.649> during<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.190> summer

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and that's fantastic but it doesn't

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.880 
and that's fantastic but it doesn't
always<00:00:50.730> happen<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.230> summertime<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
always happen because the summertime is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.680 
always happen because the summertime is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
that is the intention and even more so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.060
