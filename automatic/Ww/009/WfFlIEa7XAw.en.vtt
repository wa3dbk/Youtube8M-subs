a little bit bigger none of them are
very<00:00:29.550> difficult<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.750> burn<00:00:30.990> them<00:00:31.109> down

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
very difficult you just burn them down

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.370 
very difficult you just burn them down
as<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:31.830> die<00:00:32.099> you'll<00:00:32.790> see<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:33.750> energy<00:00:34.140> go

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
as they die you'll see some energy go

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.010 
as they die you'll see some energy go
from<00:00:34.829> their<00:00:35.070> corpse<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.000> shield<00:00:36.690> and

from their corpse to the shield and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.319 
from their corpse to the shield and
after<00:00:37.770> enough<00:00:38.040> energy<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.579> hit<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.969> shield

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
after enough energy is hit that shield

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.680 
after enough energy is hit that shield
it<00:00:40.430> disperses<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.760> jellyfish<00:00:42.210> falls<00:00:42.540> to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it disperses and the jellyfish falls to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 
it disperses and the jellyfish falls to
the<00:00:42.719> ground<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.410> you've<00:00:43.829> entered<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.280> into

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the ground and you've entered it into

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.420 
the ground and you've entered it into
Phase<00:00:44.910> two<00:00:44.940> which<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> burn<00:00:46.020> phase<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:47.250> your

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
Phase two which is a burn phase if your

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.970 
Phase two which is a burn phase if your
dps<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> ball<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.899> pretty<00:00:49.620> strong<00:00:49.950> you

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
dps is on the ball and pretty strong you

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.400 
dps is on the ball and pretty strong you
should<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.579> able<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:51.000> them<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.410> during

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
should be able to get them down during

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
should be able to get them down during
the<00:00:52.680> second<00:00:53.219> burn<00:00:53.399> phase<00:00:53.809> hopefully<00:00:54.809> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the second burn phase hopefully it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.180 
the second burn phase hopefully it
doesn't<00:00:55.050> take<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.440> any<00:00:55.620> longer<00:00:55.980> than<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
doesn't take you any longer than the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.150 
doesn't take you any longer than the
third<00:00:56.399> burn<00:00:56.699> phase<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.300> even<00:00:57.510> if<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> does

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
third burn phase but even if it does

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.470 
third burn phase but even if it does
there's<00:00:59.160> no<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.670> enrage<00:00:59.969> time<00:01:00.329> or

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
there's no kind of enrage time or

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.599 
there's no kind of enrage time or
anything<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.899> we're<00:01:01.050> aware<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.829> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
anything that we're aware of so you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.719 
anything that we're aware of so you
should<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:03.379> ample<00:01:04.379> opportunity<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.040> get<00:01:05.640> him

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
should have ample opportunity to get him

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.460 
should have ample opportunity to get him
down<00:01:05.880> see<00:01:06.210> right<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.630> he's<00:01:06.869> dropped<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.409> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
down see right here he's dropped down to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.460 
down see right here he's dropped down to
the<00:01:07.650> ground<00:01:08.299> busy<00:01:09.299> reveling<00:01:09.810> somebody<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.409> I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the ground busy reveling somebody but I

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.160 
the ground busy reveling somebody but I
should<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.860> burning<00:01:11.270> as<00:01:12.270> quickly<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.720> possible

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
should be burning as quickly as possible

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.570 
should be burning as quickly as possible
so<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.680> take<00:01:13.860> them<00:01:14.010> down<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
so that we can take them down to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.850 
so that we can take them down to
hopefully<00:01:15.360> below<00:01:15.689> 50%<00:01:16.049> during<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.710> first

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
hopefully below 50% during that first

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.760 
hopefully below 50% during that first
burn<00:01:17.159> phase<00:01:17.580> or<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.390> least<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.869> close<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
burn phase or at least as close to that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.070 
burn phase or at least as close to that
as<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.150> second<00:01:21.540> burn<00:01:21.659> phase<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
as we can get the second burn phase is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.510 
as we can get the second burn phase is
actually<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.619> bit<00:01:22.710> easier<00:01:23.130> since<00:01:23.369> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
actually a little bit easier since you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.490 
actually a little bit easier since you
have<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> benefit<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> any<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.110> execute

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
have the benefit of any kind of execute

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.170 
have the benefit of any kind of execute
abilities<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.369> extra<00:01:26.670> damage<00:01:26.700> when<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
abilities that do extra damage when a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.780 
abilities that do extra damage when a
target<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.659> below<00:01:28.140> 20<00:01:28.829> 25%<00:01:29.670> health<00:01:31.670> during<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
target is below 20 25% health during the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.469 
target is below 20 25% health during the
fight<00:01:33.030> he's<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.729> teleport<00:01:35.729> around<00:01:35.820> and

fight he's going to teleport around and
when<00:01:36.630> he<00:01:36.720> does<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.110> don't<00:01:37.320> want<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> get

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
when he does that you don't want to get

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.679 
when he does that you don't want to get
away<00:01:37.740> from<00:01:37.920> him<00:01:38.369> because<00:01:38.670> he<00:01:38.909> practically
