00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:15.959 

this<00:00:14.500> is<00:00:14.620> a<00:00:14.650> pretty<00:00:14.950> advanced<00:00:15.339> simulator

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
this is a pretty advanced simulator

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.260 
this is a pretty advanced simulator
because<00:00:17.009> we<00:00:18.009> are<00:00:18.220> sitting<00:00:18.580> in<00:00:18.609> the<00:00:18.759> real<00:00:18.970> car

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
because we are sitting in the real car

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.359 
because we are sitting in the real car
and<00:00:19.539> then<00:00:19.810> all<00:00:19.960> the<00:00:20.259> screens<00:00:20.619> around<00:00:20.919> you<00:00:21.130> make

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
and then all the screens around you make

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.290 
and then all the screens around you make
you<00:00:21.520> feel<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:22.930> that<00:00:23.169> what<00:00:23.500> would<00:00:23.680> you<00:00:24.300> feel

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
you feel like that what would you feel

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.670 
you feel like that what would you feel
when<00:00:25.539> you<00:00:25.660> were<00:00:25.779> driving<00:00:26.020> right<00:00:26.349> so<00:00:26.470> you<00:00:26.560> can

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
when you were driving right so you can

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.679 
when you were driving right so you can
put<00:00:26.829> rain<00:00:27.009> over<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.340> Allianz<00:00:28.029> Arena<00:00:28.180> back

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
put rain over the Allianz Arena back

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.670 
put rain over the Allianz Arena back
there<00:00:28.930> yeah

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
there yeah

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.299 
there yeah
so<00:00:29.980> we're<00:00:30.129> in<00:00:30.219> stood<00:00:30.460> guard<00:00:30.879> I<00:00:31.680> think<00:00:32.680> the

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
so we're in stood guard I think the

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.490 
so we're in stood guard I think the
alien<00:00:33.640> serving<00:00:34.000> us<00:00:34.149> is<00:00:34.420> near<00:00:34.690> Munich<00:00:35.050> but<00:00:35.260> or

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
alien serving us is near Munich but or

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.799 
alien serving us is near Munich but or
Munich<00:00:35.710> really<00:00:36.070> really<00:00:36.370> gay<00:00:36.520> right<00:00:36.820> yeah<00:00:37.030> it's

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
Munich really really gay right yeah it's

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.180 
Munich really really gay right yeah it's
just<00:00:38.110> a<00:00:38.260> well<00:00:39.190> an<00:00:39.460> object<00:00:39.969> we<00:00:40.420> just<00:00:40.660> try<00:00:41.020> to<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
just a well an object we just try to to

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.209 
just a well an object we just try to to
make<00:00:42.399> it<00:00:42.610> pretty<00:00:43.180> realistic<00:00:43.840> right<00:00:44.320> now<00:00:44.500> so

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
make it pretty realistic right now so

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.890 
make it pretty realistic right now so
even<00:00:45.489> though<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.760> participants<00:00:46.450> about<00:00:46.630> there

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
even though the participants about there

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.340 
even though the participants about there
so<00:00:50.040> people<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:52.660> pretty<00:00:52.899> cool

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
so people that's pretty cool

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.000 
so people that's pretty cool
so<00:00:53.649> this<00:00:53.950> is<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.100> different<00:00:54.489> road<00:00:55.200> this<00:00:56.200> is<00:00:56.260> a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
so this is a different road this is a

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.460 
so this is a different road this is a
highway<00:00:57.340> situation<00:00:58.030> yeah<00:00:58.180> okay<00:00:58.630> so<00:00:58.960> we're<00:00:59.230> now

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
highway situation yeah okay so we're now

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.069 
highway situation yeah okay so we're now
in<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.710> simulator<00:01:00.190> with<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.670> s-class<00:01:01.090> in<00:01:01.720> the

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
in the simulator with the s-class in the

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.039 
in the simulator with the s-class in the
u.s.<00:01:02.320> class<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:02.920> we're<00:01:03.100> like<00:01:03.430> driving<00:01:03.940> in<00:01:04.899> the

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
u.s. class and we're like driving in the

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.289 
u.s. class and we're like driving in the
similarily<00:01:05.619> munich<00:01:06.130> in<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.490> rain<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:07.060> what

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
similarily munich in the rain so what

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.530 
similarily munich in the rain so what
are<00:01:07.420> we<00:01:07.540> gonna<00:01:07.810> experience<00:01:08.259> here<00:01:09.299> okay<00:01:10.299> yeah

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
are we gonna experience here okay yeah

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.670 
are we gonna experience here okay yeah
on<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.170> highway

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.999 

yes

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
yes

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.069 
yes
different<00:01:16.729> possibilities<00:01:17.509> I<00:01:18.549> mean<00:01:19.930> most<00:01:20.930> of

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
different possibilities I mean most of

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.749 
different possibilities I mean most of
the<00:01:21.229> driver<00:01:21.439> system<00:01:21.740> functions<00:01:22.369> are<00:01:22.549> aimed

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
the driver system functions are aimed

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.169 
the driver system functions are aimed
for<00:01:23.119> for<00:01:23.420> highway<00:01:23.750> situations<00:01:25.000> we<00:01:26.000> have<00:01:26.149> a

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
for for highway situations we have a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.630 
for for highway situations we have a
blind<00:01:26.539> spot<00:01:26.840> monitoring

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
blind spot monitoring

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.580 
blind spot monitoring
and<00:01:28.730> now<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.690> blind<00:01:29.930> blind<00:01:30.290> spot

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
and now the the blind blind spot

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.900 
and now the the blind blind spot
monitoring<00:01:31.010> is<00:01:31.400> even<00:01:32.320> an<00:01:33.320> active<00:01:33.830> one<00:01:34.040> so<00:01:34.550> if

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
monitoring is even an active one so if

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.110 
monitoring is even an active one so if
there's<00:01:35.150> a<00:01:35.240> car<00:01:35.570> in<00:01:35.600> your<00:01:35.840> blind<00:01:36.110> spot<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:37.120> you

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
there's a car in your blind spot and you

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.530 
there's a car in your blind spot and you
drift<00:01:38.450> over<00:01:38.680> into<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.830> other<00:01:39.950> Lane<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:41.360> will

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
drift over into the other Lane it will

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.730 
drift over into the other Lane it will
just<00:01:42.050> drag<00:01:42.830> you<00:01:43.010> back<00:01:44.050> by<00:01:45.050> hitting<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.470> brakes

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
just drag you back by hitting the brakes

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.160 
just drag you back by hitting the brakes
on<00:01:46.160> one<00:01:46.400> side<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:48.820> we<00:01:49.820> also<00:01:50.450> have<00:01:50.870> a<00:01:50.900> feature

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
on one side and we also have a feature

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.050 
on one side and we also have a feature
which<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:51.740> called<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:52.160> Stronach<00:01:52.550> plus<00:01:52.820> you

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
which is called a Stronach plus you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.560 
which is called a Stronach plus you
might<00:01:53.240> know<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.420> yeah<00:01:54.410> it's<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.220> have<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.150> put

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
might know that yeah it's a have to put

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.570 
might know that yeah it's a have to put
it<00:01:56.690> up<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.050> state<00:01:57.320> yes<00:01:57.650> big<00:01:57.979> control<00:01:58.400> which

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
it up the state yes big control which

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.520 
it up the state yes big control which
keeps<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.150> distance<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.840> car<00:02:00.080> in<00:02:00.170> front<00:02:00.200> of

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
keeps a distance to the car in front of

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.860 
keeps a distance to the car in front of
him

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.430 

you<00:02:05.140> just<00:02:05.970> stop<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.150> rain<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:08.619> much<00:02:08.800> nicer

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you just stop the rain it's much nicer

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.110 
you just stop the rain it's much nicer
so<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:11.740> is<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.010> Autobahn<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.580> can<00:02:12.850> go<00:02:13.000> as

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
so this is the Autobahn so I can go as

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.920 
so this is the Autobahn so I can go as
fast<00:02:13.270> as<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.570> can

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
fast as I can

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.280 
fast as I can
right<00:02:14.730> theoretically<00:02:15.730> yeah<00:02:16.080> there's<00:02:17.080> no

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
right theoretically yeah there's no

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.500 
right theoretically yeah there's no
general<00:02:17.860> speed<00:02:18.280> limit<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.730> Germany<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.480> e

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
general speed limit in Germany on the e

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.080 
general speed limit in Germany on the e
on<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> Autobahn<00:02:20.260> but<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:21.490> fact<00:02:21.790> there<00:02:22.060> are

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
on the Autobahn but in fact there are

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.260 
on the Autobahn but in fact there are
many<00:02:22.450> speed<00:02:22.870> limits<00:02:23.230> just<00:02:23.740> but<00:02:24.670> even<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.120> in

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
many speed limits just but even this in

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.490 
many speed limits just but even this in
the<00:02:25.390> simulator<00:02:25.750> do<00:02:25.990> you<00:02:26.080> have<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.470> a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
the simulator do you have like a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.290 
the simulator do you have like a
high-speed<00:02:27.100> simulator

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
high-speed simulator

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.580 
high-speed simulator
oh<00:02:28.330> well<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.650> can<00:02:29.860> speed<00:02:30.960> in<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.140> simulator

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
oh well you can speed in the simulator

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.900
