00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
management we didn't use the inspection

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.730 
management we didn't use the inspection
access<00:06:59.940> for<00:07:00.180> testing<00:07:00.660> because<00:07:01.350> it's<00:07:01.530> very

testing and replenishment in this case

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.280 
testing and replenishment in this case
we<00:07:09.510> ran<00:07:09.660> the<00:07:09.870> pH<00:07:10.260> between<00:07:10.860> 6<00:07:11.220> and<00:07:11.460> 6.5<00:07:12.290> the

we ran the pH between 6 and 6.5 the

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.040 
we ran the pH between 6 and 6.5 the
conductivity<00:07:13.919> around<00:07:14.310> 1200<00:07:15.030> which<00:07:15.660> would<00:07:15.840> put

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050 
conductivity around 1200 which would put

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.070

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.870 

removing<00:07:22.080> a<00:07:22.169> plant<00:07:22.440> container<00:07:22.919> also<00:07:23.250> made<00:07:23.729> it

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 
removing a plant container also made it

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.650 
removing a plant container also made it
a<00:07:23.940> lot<00:07:24.180> easier<00:07:24.660> to<00:07:24.960> make<00:07:25.590> up<00:07:25.800> water<00:07:26.100> and<00:07:26.509> to<00:07:27.509> add

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 
a lot easier to make up water and to add

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.010 
a lot easier to make up water and to add
nutrient<00:07:28.789> we<00:07:29.789> did<00:07:30.060> run<00:07:30.479> the<00:07:30.509> nutrient

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 
nutrient we did run the nutrient

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.710 
nutrient we did run the nutrient
solution<00:07:31.139> reservoir<00:07:32.009> a<00:07:32.250> little<00:07:32.669> higher<00:07:32.940> than

a<00:07:33.750> recommended<00:07:34.380> mark<00:07:35.419> okay

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.630 
a recommended mark okay

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.650 
a recommended mark okay
so<00:07:36.900> what's<00:07:37.169> so<00:07:37.349> good<00:07:37.530> about<00:07:37.590> Emily's<00:07:38.130> garden

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:38.660 
so what's so good about Emily's garden

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.110 
so what's so good about Emily's garden
well<00:07:39.660> it's<00:07:40.020> simple<00:07:40.500> and<00:07:40.740> very<00:07:41.120> inexpensive

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 
well it's simple and very inexpensive

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.710 
well it's simple and very inexpensive
you<00:07:42.740> don't<00:07:43.740> have<00:07:43.919> to<00:07:44.130> build<00:07:44.310> it<00:07:44.580> and<00:07:44.729> it's<00:07:45.509> real

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 
you don't have to build it and it's real

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.960 
you don't have to build it and it's real
easy<00:07:45.960> to<00:07:46.199> assemble<00:07:46.620> also<00:07:47.370> it<00:07:47.550> operates

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:47.970 
easy to assemble also it operates

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.570 
easy to assemble also it operates
extremely<00:07:48.630> well<00:07:48.810> and<00:07:49.139> can<00:07:49.620> be<00:07:49.650> easily<00:07:49.979> set<00:07:50.550> up

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580
