wine cooler top and the bottom with the
dual<00:00:09.630> temperature<00:00:10.110> control<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.370> was

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
dual temperature control and I was

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.390 
dual temperature control and I was
getting<00:00:11.790> an<00:00:11.880> e3<00:00:12.540> error<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:14.130> looked<00:00:14.309> up

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
getting an e3 error and I looked up

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.570 
getting an e3 error and I looked up
online<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.210> what<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.640> in<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.150> fan<00:00:18.660> area

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
online and what it is is in the fan area

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.300 
online and what it is is in the fan area
on<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:21.210> back<00:00:21.480> there<00:00:22.230> are<00:00:22.439> two<00:00:22.800> sets<00:00:23.130> of

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
on the back there are two sets of

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.880 
on the back there are two sets of
connectors<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:25.970> come<00:00:26.970> through<00:00:27.680> from<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
connectors that come through from the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.650 
connectors that come through from the
back<00:00:31.040> there's<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.250> white<00:00:32.640> connector<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.390> there

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
back there's a white connector and there

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.060 
back there's a white connector and there
is<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.899> black<00:00:34.170> connector<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.860> just

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
is a black connector and it's just

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.209 
is a black connector and it's just
basically<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.489> hotter<00:00:35.760> ground<00:00:36.800> that<00:00:37.800> come<00:00:38.070> back

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
basically a hotter ground that come back

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.720 
basically a hotter ground that come back
out<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> very<00:00:39.570> back<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.050> unit<00:00:40.379> or

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
out of the very back of the unit or

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.630 
out of the very back of the unit or
inside<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> unit<00:00:42.500> into<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.070> back<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.489> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
inside the unit into the back of this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.130 
inside the unit into the back of this
shelf<00:00:45.030> which<00:00:45.629> sits<00:00:46.020> right<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.370> area<00:00:47.610> here

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
shelf which sits right in this area here

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.630 
shelf which sits right in this area here
so<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.530> do<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.280> take<00:00:50.430> all

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
so what you have to do is you take all

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.729 
so what you have to do is you take all
your<00:00:50.670> other<00:00:50.940> shelves<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.230> pull<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.559> out

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
your other shelves out and pull this out

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.130 
your other shelves out and pull this out
about<00:00:53.010> two<00:00:53.309> inches<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.750> disconnect

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
about two inches you can disconnect

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.939 
about two inches you can disconnect
these<00:00:55.559> small<00:00:55.980> connectors<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:58.379> back<00:00:58.770> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
these small connectors in the back of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.510 
these small connectors in the back of
this<00:00:59.070> shelf<00:00:59.660> but<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> side<00:01:01.559> there

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
this shelf but then on the side there

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.640 
this shelf but then on the side there
are<00:01:02.550> some<00:01:03.180> other<00:01:03.329> larger<00:01:03.809> connectors<00:01:04.320> because

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
are some other larger connectors because

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.539 
are some other larger connectors because
you're<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:04.920> gonna<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.100> able<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
you're not gonna be able to get the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.730 
you're not gonna be able to get the
drawer<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.590> got<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
drawer out just like that you got to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.100 
drawer out just like that you got to
swing<00:01:08.070> your<00:01:08.220> door<00:01:08.460> all<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> way<00:01:08.909> open<00:01:09.299> gives

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
swing your door all the way open gives

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.230 
swing your door all the way open gives
you<00:01:10.229> about<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.439> three<00:01:10.979> inch<00:01:11.189> area<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.090> can

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
you about a three inch area that you can

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
you about a three inch area that you can
actually<00:01:12.390> pull<00:01:12.810> these<00:01:12.990> connectors<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.680> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
actually pull these connectors out and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.429 
actually pull these connectors out and
just<00:01:15.000> connect<00:01:15.390> them<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:15.659> now<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.930> won't<00:01:16.259> need

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
just connect them all now you won't need

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.980 
just connect them all now you won't need
to<00:01:16.500> touch<00:01:16.799> these<00:01:17.130> at<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.540> ones<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
to touch these at all the ones on the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.289 
to touch these at all the ones on the
side<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> shelf<00:01:19.740> now<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.060> two

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
side of the shelf now there are two

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.999 
side of the shelf now there are two
screws<00:01:21.630> underneath<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.259> plate<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.830> could

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
screws underneath this plate but I could

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.469 
screws underneath this plate but I could
not<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.400> front<00:01:23.729> plate<00:01:24.030> off<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
not get this front plate off that

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.850 
not get this front plate off that
probably<00:01:24.780> would<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.930> made<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> easier<00:01:25.380> for

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
probably would have made it easier for

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.429 
probably would have made it easier for
me<00:01:26.570> but<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:27.930> connect<00:01:28.259> them<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
me but you can just connect them and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.859 
me but you can just connect them and
then<00:01:28.590> push<00:01:28.799> them<00:01:28.950> back<00:01:29.100> into<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> song<00:01:29.869> so

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
then push them back into the song so

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
then push them back into the song so
basically<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
basically what you have to do is be I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.859 
basically what you have to do is be I
guess<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.570> could<00:01:33.720> either<00:01:33.840> use<00:01:33.990> wire<00:01:34.409> nuts<00:01:34.680> or

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
guess you could either use wire nuts or

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.630 
guess you could either use wire nuts or
electrical<00:01:36.869> tape<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.380> bollock<00:01:38.220> connectors

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
electrical tape or bollock connectors

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.020 
electrical tape or bollock connectors
and<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.110> just<00:01:40.110> want<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> connect<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.700> black

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and you just want to connect the black

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.929 
and you just want to connect the black
and<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> red<00:01:42.750> from<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> white<00:01:43.680> connector<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
and the red from the white connector to

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.359 
and the red from the white connector to
the<00:01:45.060> black<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> red<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.220> white

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the black and the red of the white

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
the black and the red of the white
connector<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> fan<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> put

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
connector on the fan but you have to put

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.399 
connector on the fan but you have to put
your<00:01:49.409> fan<00:01:49.710> back<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.220> first<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.780> then<00:01:51.930> wire<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
your fan back in first and then wire and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.649 
your fan back in first and then wire and
then<00:01:52.530> basically<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.070> hardwire<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.420> that

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
then basically you hardwire and that

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.810 
then basically you hardwire and that
will<00:01:54.810> get<00:01:54.930> rid<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.229> either<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.860> your<00:01:56.070> III<00:01:56.729> or

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
will get rid of either of your III or

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.289 
will get rid of either of your III or
efore<00:01:57.299> errors<00:01:57.689> which<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> fan<00:01:58.890> error<00:01:59.299> which

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
efore errors which is a fan error which

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.289 
efore errors which is a fan error which
will<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.750> cool<00:02:01.619> either<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.790> top<00:02:03.000> or<00:02:03.210> bottom

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
