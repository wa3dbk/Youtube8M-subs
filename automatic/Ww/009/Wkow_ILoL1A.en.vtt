hi I'm Steve Carr and I've been making a
hand<00:00:24.430> wired<00:00:24.640> guitar<00:00:25.180> amplifiers<00:00:25.690> for<00:00:25.960> the

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
hand wired guitar amplifiers for the

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.609 
hand wired guitar amplifiers for the
last<00:00:26.230> 15<00:00:26.680> years<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:28.020> we're<00:00:29.020> about<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.380> see<00:00:29.500> the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
last 15 years and we're about to see the

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.400 
last 15 years and we're about to see the
behind<00:00:30.190> the<00:00:30.310> scenes<00:00:30.720> workings<00:00:31.720> of<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:32.199> guys

behind the scenes workings of the guys

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.139 
behind the scenes workings of the guys
in<00:00:32.680> my<00:00:32.710> shop<00:00:33.129> there<00:00:33.460> are<00:00:33.550> eight<00:00:33.699> of<00:00:33.730> us<00:00:33.940> all

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
in my shop there are eight of us all

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.930 
in my shop there are eight of us all
together<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:34.780> this<00:00:35.530> amplifier<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.550> Impala

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
together and this amplifier the Impala

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.259 
together and this amplifier the Impala
was<00:00:37.329> introduced<00:00:37.780> this<00:00:37.960> year<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.579> you<00:00:39.640> get<00:00:40.120> to

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
was introduced this year so you get to

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.899 
was introduced this year so you get to
see<00:00:40.479> some<00:00:41.199> of<00:00:41.289> the<00:00:41.350> beginning<00:00:41.499> sketches<00:00:42.280> for

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
see some of the beginning sketches for

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.910 
see some of the beginning sketches for
the<00:00:42.969> design<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.510> then<00:00:44.260> all<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.559> way<00:00:44.649> through

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
the design and then all the way through

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.969 
the design and then all the way through
actually<00:00:45.460> building<00:00:45.909> one<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:50.350> we<00:00:50.499> start<00:00:50.800> with

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
actually building one so we start with

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.360 
actually building one so we start with
solid<00:00:51.579> time<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:52.239> we<00:00:52.329> get<00:00:52.449> locally<00:00:53.069> blue<00:00:54.069> cuts

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
solid time that we get locally blue cuts

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.149 
solid time that we get locally blue cuts
the<00:00:54.519> wood<00:00:54.699> down<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:55.059> size<00:00:55.710> actually<00:00:56.710> cuts

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
the wood down the size actually cuts

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.180 
the wood down the size actually cuts
into<00:00:57.339> all<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.609> dovetails<00:00:58.149> and<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:58.659> manually

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.920 

tend<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.309> stick<00:01:03.549> with<00:01:03.789> a<00:01:03.819> simpler<00:01:04.390> recipe<00:01:04.870> in

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
tend to stick with a simpler recipe in

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.410 
tend to stick with a simpler recipe in
each<00:01:05.080> amp<00:01:05.350> things<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.220> we<00:01:06.369> know<00:01:06.580> work<00:01:06.760> sound

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
each amp things that we know work sound

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.090 
each amp things that we know work sound
great<00:01:07.659> and<00:01:07.930> last<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:13.600> glues<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.080> boss<00:01:14.260> he

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
great and last it glues the boss he

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.960 
great and last it glues the boss he
takes<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.520> box<00:01:15.730> it<00:01:15.910> clamps<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.450> MUX<00:01:17.580> he<00:01:18.580> trims

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
takes the box it clamps the MUX he trims

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:28.060 
takes the box it clamps the MUX he trims
the<00:01:19.270> by<00:01:19.560> fans<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.830> bottom

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.679 

so<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> lot<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.429> people<00:01:29.640> come<00:01:29.850> together<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.509> make

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
so a lot of people come together to make

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.289 
so a lot of people come together to make
these<00:01:30.960> each<00:01:31.530> model<00:01:32.100> takes<00:01:32.340> approximately<00:01:32.939> 20

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
these each model takes approximately 20

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.679 
these each model takes approximately 20
hours<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.929> work<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.979> complete<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.569> said

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
hours of work to complete and as I said

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.240 
hours of work to complete and as I said
it's<00:01:36.929> done<00:01:37.049> by<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.500> lot<00:01:37.679> of<00:01:37.710> people<00:01:37.950> who<00:01:38.130> are

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it's done by a lot of people who are

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.559 
it's done by a lot of people who are
going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> see<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.490> three<00:01:44.819> app<00:01:45.090> builders

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
going to see we have three app builders

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.539 
going to see we have three app builders
and<00:01:46.020> they<00:01:46.259> take<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.920> empty<00:01:47.219> room<00:01:47.340> at<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and they take the empty room at the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.100 
and they take the empty room at the
beginning<00:01:47.969> to<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.179> end<00:01:48.209> they<00:01:48.539> switch<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
beginning to the end they switch to the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.039 
beginning to the end they switch to the
law<00:01:49.319> for<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.100> wall<00:01:50.250> chassis<00:01:51.049> transformers

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
law for the wall chassis transformers

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.410 
law for the wall chassis transformers
that<00:01:52.259> both<00:01:52.469> all<00:01:52.709> those<00:01:52.890> parts<00:01:53.250> together<00:01:53.459> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
that both all those parts together the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.599 
that both all those parts together the
tube<00:01:54.630> sockets<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.829> put<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.280> all<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
tube sockets and then put in all the

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.419 
tube sockets and then put in all the
components<00:01:57.209> and<00:01:57.750> everything<00:01:58.170> is

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
components and everything is

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.550 
components and everything is
point-to-point<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.750> kind<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.140> an<00:02:01.229> extreme

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
point-to-point and kind of an extreme

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.190 
point-to-point and kind of an extreme
way<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.069> lot<00:02:02.489> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> parts<00:02:03.149> are<00:02:03.329> right<00:02:03.989> from

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
way a lot of the parts are right from

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.319 
way a lot of the parts are right from
the<00:02:04.259> capacitor<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> tin<00:02:05.579> socket<00:02:06.090> there's

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
the capacitor to the tin socket there's

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.930 
the capacitor to the tin socket there's
no<00:02:06.599> wires<00:02:07.500> between<00:02:07.829> them<00:02:08.250> everything<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.700> very

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
no wires between them everything is very

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.589 
no wires between them everything is very
very<00:02:09.470> simple<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.560> direct<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.209> seems<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
very simple and direct and this seems to

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.289 
very simple and direct and this seems to
sound<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.470> feel<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.920> best<00:02:14.099> each<00:02:14.849> amp<00:02:15.120> goes

it's<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.660> very<00:02:49.870> tricky<00:02:50.080> thing<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.440> do<00:02:50.710> but<00:02:51.460> he's

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
it's a very tricky thing to do but he's

it's a very tricky thing to do but he's
been<00:02:52.150> doing<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.450> for<00:02:52.600> 10<00:02:52.750> years

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.020 

so<00:03:10.110> John<00:03:10.290> takes<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:11.069> Cabot's<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.730> finished

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
so John takes the Cabot's the finished

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.180 
so John takes the Cabot's the finished
cabinets<00:03:12.510> have<00:03:12.690> put<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.080> speaker<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.770> reverb

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
cabinets have put in a speaker a reverb

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.880 
cabinets have put in a speaker a reverb
tank<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.959> flashing<00:03:15.959> checks<00:03:16.650> all<00:03:16.860> the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
tank and flashing checks all the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.280 
tank and flashing checks all the
fasteners<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.819> then<00:03:18.630> assembled<00:03:19.140> who

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
fasteners and then assembled who

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.680 
fasteners and then assembled who
finished<00:03:19.680> amplifier<00:03:20.250> into<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.000> cabinet<00:03:21.480> and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
finished amplifier into the cabinet and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:30.320 
finished amplifier into the cabinet and
now<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:21.959> ready<00:03:22.170> for<00:03:22.560> final<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.300> mic<00:03:24.300> does

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.560 

issues<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.870> might<00:03:31.200> come<00:03:31.230> up<00:03:32.360> moving<00:03:33.360> with

issues that might come up moving with

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.080 
issues that might come up moving with
the<00:03:33.660> speakers<00:03:34.140> no<00:03:34.290> vibrates<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.670> any<00:03:35.850> tube

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
the speakers no vibrates so any tube

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.800 
the speakers no vibrates so any tube
rattles<00:03:36.720> any<00:03:37.190> chassis<00:03:38.450> vibrations<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.660> need
