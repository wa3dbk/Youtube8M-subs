00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.660 
beginners and even great for people has
been<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.470> know<00:02:55.560> trying<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.160> get<00:02:56.310> lean<00:02:56.460> for<00:02:56.640> a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
been you know trying to get lean for a

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.120 
been you know trying to get lean for a
long<00:02:56.820> time<00:02:57.090> because<00:02:57.930> it's<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.260> rule<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.560> follow

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
long time because it's a rule you follow

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.390 
long time because it's a rule you follow
that<00:02:59.340> rule<00:02:59.670> it's<00:02:59.940> going<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.300> work<00:03:01.010> like<00:03:02.010> if<00:03:02.220> you

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
that rule it's going to work like if you

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.920 
that rule it's going to work like if you
count<00:03:02.610> your<00:03:02.700> calories<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.240> estimate<00:03:03.600> window

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
count your calories in estimate window

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.810 
count your calories in estimate window
is<00:03:04.080> kind<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.680> hard<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.890> already<00:03:05.250> eat<00:03:05.460> because

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
is kind of hard to already eat because

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.400 
is kind of hard to already eat because
you<00:03:05.940> can't<00:03:06.210> eat<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:06.600> much<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:06.990> that<00:03:07.110> amount<00:03:07.320> of

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
you can't eat so much in that amount of

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.800 
you can't eat so much in that amount of
time<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.490> it<00:03:08.610> keeps<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.970> caloric<00:03:09.270> deficit

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
time so it keeps you the caloric deficit

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.570 
time so it keeps you the caloric deficit
and<00:03:09.990> you're<00:03:10.200> burning<00:03:10.530> fat<00:03:10.800> all<00:03:11.040> throughout
