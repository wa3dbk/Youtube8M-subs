00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.680
 and nothing more 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.250
 do not 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:45.150
 And if it rained, it was a Bío Bío Bío Bío Bío Bío Bío 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.190
 Bio Bio 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.190
 pio, bío, bío, bío, bío, bío, bío, bío, bío 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.370

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.370
 Bío Bío Bío Bío Bío Bío Bío Bío 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.660
 myopia, bio, bio, bio, bio, bio, bio, 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.780
 you threw 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.310
 when I'm rehearsing a work of 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.700
 theater and I have to do bird that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.979
 as well as I do now think 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.450
 I'm just missing the bird costume 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.430
 I'm going to teach how to make a costume 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.270
 bird and so after we can play the 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.530
 two 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.140
 we need plastic bags 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.900
 colors 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.620
 a piece of yellow cardboard 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.760
 light 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.130
 an eye mask 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.590
 and colorful adhesive tapes and 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.350
 Stapler already have everything you need 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.390
 when you are ready we need a 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.880
 bag with a funny color for example 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.010
 this orange that will be the basis of our 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.330
 disguise or we'll cut it like a 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.690
 shirt but the sleeves and then the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.690
 neck 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.790
 before starting it is important to check 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.500
 that we fit our heads through the hole 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.900
 I think that here it fits me 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.150
 perfectly and with other bags 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.280
 colors we will have to cut strips more or 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.380
 less than a span wide we can 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.440
 use the colors that we like the most 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.560
 and now panda we will double the next 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.560
 way 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.069
 as well as a fan we will cut in shape 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.069
 of feathers 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.790
 tatxan have seen how it looks 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.360
 if it does not work out very well, we can 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.310
 draw it before trimming panda looks 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.600
 for example we could make some feathers 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.600
 more rounded 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.469
 or for example we could also do 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.469
 some pointed feathers 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.459
 we could even combine the two 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.459
 designs and it would be more fun 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.890
 let's start decorating the body of 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.500
 our bird we will always start 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.720
 on the bottom part putting a strip 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.680
 of feathers so that the following ones go 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.219
 covering each other holds here panda 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.790
 very well we will attach it with adhesive tape 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:41.739
 of colors 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.390
 we have to take into account that also 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.450
 has to go around the part of 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.450
 behind 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.490
 now panda if you think let's put 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.110
 the green because it will contrast very well 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.090
 with the black we have put in first 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.050
 place the color combination we can 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.050
 make it as we like 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.770
 and now skirt we are going to put the color 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.770
 Red 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.500
 home 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.240
 we'll have to put a lot of panda 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.190
 strips to fill the whole suit to 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.050
 which is very easy because we will have 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.200
 fantastic if on the top 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.670
 we put longer pens 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.980
 what do you think skirt looks 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.140
 here is fantastic look besides the good 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.790
 that are the long strips here that 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.640
 They look like the rooms of the Bio Bio Bio Bio 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.470
 bío and now panda to finish we're going to 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.390
 use this mask and we're going to put 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.780
 a beak and some feathers to have the 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.440
 complete bird suit we folded a 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.440
 piece of cardboard 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:03.200
 and we draw a triangle like that 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.380
 and now we cut it so that it is 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.569
 double we do it inside the line 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.550
 black so you can not see 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:16.470
 and when we finish we round off this part 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.470
 now we have to record it 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.930
 and to finish with the remains that we 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.930
 have left over we can make some small 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.870
 feathers and shaving them also the mask 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.990
 I'm ready panda I'm already a super 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.220
 bird now we can play you want 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:42.840
 Okay, so I put myself here as a bird 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:46.500
 clean that happens not well 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:50.480
 on the street it 's true the birds have 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.480
 that going to the street is worth it now I go back 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.340
 and I just need to fly
