a<00:01:20.420> couple<00:01:20.660> of<00:01:20.840> ideas<00:01:20.960> why<00:01:21.440> that<00:01:21.680> might<00:01:21.890> be

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
a couple of ideas why that might be

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.480 
a couple of ideas why that might be
many<00:01:23.420> woodworkers<00:01:24.200> make<00:01:24.740> their<00:01:24.980> own<00:01:25.010> feather

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
many woodworkers make their own feather

many woodworkers make their own feather
boards<00:01:25.910> and<00:01:26.120> I've<00:01:26.210> certainly<00:01:26.810> made<00:01:27.020> many

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
boards and I've certainly made many

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.140 
boards and I've certainly made many
myself<00:01:27.770> there's<00:01:28.310> nothing<00:01:28.610> wrong<00:01:28.790> with<00:01:28.970> doing
