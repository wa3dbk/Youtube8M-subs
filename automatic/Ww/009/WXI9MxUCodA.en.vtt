00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:14.169
 All in all, tourism is a concept my philosophy is 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.939
 while 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.240
 we want 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.070
 that who-is-who innovations have become as important as we should 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.010
 Not the Indian orbits in the river currently score a vehicle of it 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.769
 Design and technology are aligned 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.149
 to make the vehicle the center of an increasingly networked living environment 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.260
 is progressing safety infotainment 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.490
 Innovative BMW Connected Drive functions are tailored to this 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.490
 very personal needs of driver and front passenger 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.920
 the sense organs in which the concept study relevant information 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.180
 from the environment on, this situates the vehicle occupants 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.180

 Insured persons are invisible because of mobile injuries 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.720
 We do that with three colors. Red stands for safety 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.810
 Infotainment and green for progress 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.490

 Road users are connected when there is a danger to Qantas the driver or 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.450
 brakes on its own 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.490
 Bad blue is a color that also fits very well 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.050
 infotainment 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.310
 the driver is in constant contact with the outside world he receives 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.790
 For example, information about the city in which he is currently traveling 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.990
 such as restaurant recommendations or museum tips usually they have long been 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.020
 rescued 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.530
 Green thinks of comfort because we want to facilitate networked life 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.340
 All mobile devices are therefore directly connected to the vehicle 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.950
 synchronized 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.520
 in the future the vehicles will continue to be dynamic and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.560
 look quite elegant as the concept study demonstrates the mobile 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.739
 Networking becomes an integral part of the vehicle a sign and monitors 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.739
 and displays will be integrated eyewitness series

 Premiere of the concept car BMW between Connected Life on the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.259
 Motor Show in Geneva 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.299
 For me, this is a historic moment should be the highlight 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.620
 months of work 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.000
 On the whole, in July, Doubt has a very important moment in it 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.969
 milestone 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:38.189
 This is also such a size because we are the first to get a prescription 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.189
 bundled to represent the future here 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.039
