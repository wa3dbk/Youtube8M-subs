00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 plus 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.720
 after the 1-0 defeat against Jamaica in 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.790
 kingston the tricolor technician sven 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.980
 goran eriksson recognized the evil 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.750
 functioning of the Mexicans of the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.670
 fortuitous play that ended in goal for 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.680
 the Jamaicans and the problems that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.509
 face in defense after injury 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.039
 of Ricardo Osorio and the suspension of 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:25.019
 Rafael Marquez for accumulation of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.390
 cards we have to see the ball more 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.550
 face but we think that by finding a 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:38.640
 called very very physically physically as 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:42.930
 of little luck in people like Rafa 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.120
 marquez the captain how can he play the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:51.030
 doctor we have to change them on the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.150
 2-1 about or have a problem a 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.130
 problem with the foot 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.130
 where it came out mildly 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.610
 for the players then pretexts 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.220
 Jamaica was blunt, everything is 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.750
 approximations scored one the Mexicans 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.909
 they could not solve in their favor the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.979
 party and now they hope to get at least 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.890
 a point next Wednesday against 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.840
 Canada of visitors to achieve their 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.240
 classification to the final hexagonal of the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.240
 concacaf next year this Monday 15 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.800
 the center was where we collided the two and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.690
 is that part do not calm I spoke 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.860
 with the doctor and there are good things I do not 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.380
 it inflamed me this is it I have something a 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.640
 very strong blow and also allows me to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.200
 tread but with that for Wednesday 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.539
 well the party charge a bit 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.070
 desperate in the end run over this 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.980
 you lose value there is more in your game 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.630
 such is this 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.480
 we got in the first time because in 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.050
 your crash game fight I'm I think 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.250
 that they are played today or did 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.400
 a very good match you have to admit 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.860
 also rudeness the strong game of 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.410
 they and the poor state of the field 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.840
 It affects a bit and it did not not 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.210
 we can practice our football well 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.130
 ivana made their party too 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.050
 we could not let ourselves 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.420
 hit in such a way not so 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.430
 we try to defend ourselves from some of 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.320
 somehow soccer is like that 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.510
 taking advantage of circumstances and play at 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.010
 limit of your conditions on a court 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.440
 where I do not know what they are given to go out as 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.580
 crazy and be a different team than the one 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.530
 they play in mexico I think we see that 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.720
 everything when we have three games all 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.070
 the world was laughing now that another 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.180
 you have to laugh because the handsome ones have 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.380
 have to get their face heard today a 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.960
 party that we should not have 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.390
 lost not being in plans on Wednesday 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.830
 I hope everything is different and is 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.860
 others say but so that we learn 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.140
 from kingston jamaica to the universal 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.720
 arthur television exit of jorge 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.490
 villalpando giovanni are very young 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.959
 but the pressure builds up 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.370
 people who play here are left over teams 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.379
 important are we are 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.659
 pressure first have to put up with 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.680
 they and we support it in the 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.680
 life shut up bastards
