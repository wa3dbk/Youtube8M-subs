on the side of rule of law I I believe

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.650 
on the side of rule of law I I believe
that<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.700> people<00:05:56.850> are<00:05:57.090> right<00:05:57.270> to<00:05:57.390> be<00:05:57.420> doing

that the people are right to be doing
what<00:05:57.780> they're<00:05:57.900> doing<00:05:57.930> and<00:05:58.460> I<00:05:59.460> think<00:06:00.060> that's

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
what they're doing and I think that's

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.550 
what they're doing and I think that's
all<00:06:00.420> it<00:06:00.540> released<00:06:00.810> it<00:06:00.960> needs<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.200> be<00:06:01.260> say<00:06:01.410> about

all it released it needs to be say about

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.410 
all it released it needs to be say about
that<00:06:01.740> I<00:06:01.980> hope<00:06:02.490> that<00:06:02.610> they<00:06:02.730> get<00:06:02.880> a<00:06:02.940> government
