so that we can split the stroke into two
parts<00:00:48.990> the<00:00:49.079> front<00:00:49.380> half<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> back<00:00:49.980> half

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
that way we can split the stroke in two

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:33.030 
that way we can split the stroke in two
and<00:02:25.660> do<00:02:26.470> our<00:02:26.650> drill<00:02:31.500> now<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.709> I've<00:02:32.830> got<00:02:33.010> my
