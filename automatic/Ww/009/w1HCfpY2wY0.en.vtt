00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.580
 good afternoon my name is kirill 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.850
 i'm a designer holding a motorbike skated 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.070
 hacker 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.780
 i am 28 years old and spend hours average roller 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.270
 This is true 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.200
 give and what you want in the world I 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.860
 love verse anyway 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.140
 enough 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.480
 about three years ago I saw in 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.300
 online picture of a tracked motorcycle 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.370
 This machine hooked me firmly sat down in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.320
 head but it seemed to me that he had 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.350
 the caterpillar will fly in the first turn 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.180
 well and it's also just a concept 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 having studied the history of tracked motorcycles i 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.640
 I found that the two were riding them plyara 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.800
 built in 1937 thirty-eighth 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.940
 unfortunately they both do not know how 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.430
 turn in the 1980s was created 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.290
 snowmobile fink from the dead one caterpillar and 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.210
 cast in a turn he could 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.220
 move not only in the snow but its 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.680
 ruined the lack of suspension unreliable 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.509
 external drive caterpillar all the rest 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.110
 designs had or more than one 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.060
 caterpillar 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.860
 or driven wheels which led to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.440
 the complexity of the design and the appearance 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.090
 various lack of apparatus devoid 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.220
 obvious drawbacks like the lack of 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.470
 suspension and able to rotate with 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.030
 tilting the hull at high speed could 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.649
 would be the transport of the future 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.660
 first really off road 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.790
 a vehicle without tank dimensions 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.680
 simple and cheap universal 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.810
 transport equally suitable as for 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.229
 Alaska and for Moscow or for example 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.300
 sugar and i started to scatter the design 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.280
 beads 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.170
 a cyclone which would not be victorious 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.610
 each problem is troy like 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.500
 the first part of the caterpillar on the supporting 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.750
 skating rinks are overly complicated and expensive 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.430
 second construction above simple chase 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.110
 something like an inflatable board from 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.570
 rubber boat on the surface of which 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.490
 would slip to learn this option would 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.860
 very cheap easy but unfortunately 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.080
 unguided unreliable all found 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.720
 solutions are not provided for me by two things 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.990
 strict control tracks the position and 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.790
 also simplicity of design and low cost 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.080
 what if it were possible on the 5th design 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.570
 matching this cream 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.700
 what if you could combine stiffness 6 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.500
 On photo for paintings date float from 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.310
 boats 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.470
 it would be an amazing device 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.170
 it could drive on asphalt 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.850
 off-road snow supplements smoothly this 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.280
 transport would replace the whole garage 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.800
 vehicles quad bike snowmobile and jet ski 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.940
 at the price of deprived of them besides 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.900
 could drive on common roads 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.510
 use 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.430
 they move around in sight besides 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.320
 Opara would completely solve problems with 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.970
 transport northern regions on it 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.300
 you can move all year round as 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.160
 roads and beyond 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.090
 such a construction exists and it does not 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.850
 is it completely 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.150
 but also very simply stopped from 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.040
 1000 watts either instead of expensive springs and 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.110
 shock absorbers play the role of suspension 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.989
 inflatable body divided into sections for 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.850
 facilitating rotation with bulk 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.010
 luggage to the frame of the case will provide 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.690
 buoyancy of the apparatus 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.280
 the caterpillar will serve 2 inhabitants of the water on 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.170
 when typing high speed apparatus 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.480
 can move along the surface of the water like 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.310
 snowmobile 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.959
 yes if you didn't know snowmobiles could on 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.500
 high speed cross the stretch 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.500
 smooth water 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.810
 you're not just a snowmobile 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.750
 very likely our apparatus will float 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.440
 a little slower 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.270
 rotation is carried out by bending the body 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.010
 when hitting an obstacle a caterpillar can 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.900
 move only up and down 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.660
 no pictures or transverse vibrations 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.590
 not happening 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.870
 rubber track slides along 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.060
 rubber squeeze no road wheels 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.370
 no constructions then maximize 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.270
 number of pivot point for improvement 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.990
 manageability 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.210
 the same rollers great highway roads 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.000
 there is only one rotating part 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.950
 this is for in one hand instead of spring 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.800
 elastic suspension elements we have 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.720
 rubber inflatable boards they are nice in 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.830
 Art Rut primary secondary fluctuations 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.630
 at low speeds 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.209
 and the maximum speed of the device is rather 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.790
 total will be within 90 120 kilometers in 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.380
 an hour not to fix the caterpillar at the right 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.450
 position steel from set to 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.120
 simple telescopic or lever 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.770
 racks these racks form similar 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.770
 ice flexible frame apparatus 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.139
 in motion the motorcycle is driven 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.660
 standard move here these are seen 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:27.500
 maxi scooter from 400 to 900 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.930
 cubic centimeters what problems 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.630
 still not resolved in designs on 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.220
 today their 2 first problem as 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.229
 ensure the reliability of structures with 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.229
 lick caterpillar with low training 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:42.590
 system, the second problem is how to ensure 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.419
 manageability of the apparatus to respond to 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.910
 these two questions i need your 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.860
 appearance answer to the first question knows 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.479
 the amount required is simple 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.699
 practice test 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.800
 to answer the second question can 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.930
 build acting inaudible to cycle 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.280
 and tests on it in various ways 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.990
 me 6 this is rolling then stand for 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.360
 tracked driveability studies 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.250
 motorcycle chassis of course i don't have 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.669
 too impressive a design he can't 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.620
 to swim 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.870
 1 com is designed exactly in carrying 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.699
 tests the construction of this simplest 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.550
 apparatus and is the goal of the project and a 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.300
 collects and funds on it 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.669
 the result of our cooperation with you 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.009
 it will be just such a small tracked 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.750
 skoda his test bring us closer 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.460
 sitting habit 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.590
 read this mod and stand 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.310
 pores will have the simplest highway there and 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.680
 skopich sketch 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.540
 surroundings and racks the number of table will be 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.610
 as small as the maximum 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.110
 speed and steam 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.490
 caterpillars from enema factory order 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.470
 rubber products 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.630
 it is on them that accounts for most of 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.790
 budget large batches of these products 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.320
 extremely expensive motion apparatus 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.570
 driven by a scooter engine 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.160
 if the power to move is not enough even 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.170
 considering the small diameter of the drive 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.640
 pulley machine will cast machine 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.370
 ruler will not test anyway 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.480
 will be possible 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.280
 the main task of this study 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.890
 development of steering mechanism 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.200
 on how much influence should the wheel year 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.150
 on several and any as on all what 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.190
 we are better than the middle rack tough 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.200
 whether the elastic need to expand. 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.240
 contact old men sklif to improve 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.160
 handling imitating motorcycle trail 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.610
 Wali all these questions yet no 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.980
 accurate answers 2 but no less important 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.270
 the task is the search for weaknesses constructie 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.520
 caterpillars searched on 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.440
 there are a lot of trouble options 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.240
 many options to eliminate them therefore 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.600
 some stock of funds is required 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.430
 also the acquisition of several blacksmiths 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.420
 tokkebi nach construction designed but 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.640
 not scared 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.890
 try it look only with your help 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.010
 and therefore I appeal to you to offer 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.120
 participate in the project 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.950
 the apparatus will build skill and 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.170
 make-up was worth where all the necessary 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.530
 tear off his buildings suggest but 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.560
 give on 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:53.820
 and love on follow the progress of the works you 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.440
 you can blog China along with 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.090
 creating a device that do 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.750
 assumptions patrol tracks any 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.960
 season 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.450
 aspen let's go with this machine 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.030
 alone that is whole mountains of technology 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:10.130
 so let us sang in that in 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.130
 half opening the floating
