well<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:30.210> grounded<00:01:30.689> okay<00:01:31.159> that<00:01:32.159> is

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
well that's grounded okay that is

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.480 
well that's grounded okay that is
certainly<00:01:33.930> lost<00:01:34.320> consciousness<00:01:35.009> he<00:01:35.189> hit<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
certainly lost consciousness he hit the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.710 
certainly lost consciousness he hit the
floor<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.890> he<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.610> Indy<00:01:38.939> actor<00:01:39.180> scoring

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
floor and he that was Indy actor scoring

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990 
floor and he that was Indy actor scoring
so<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.530> try<00:01:40.770> will<00:01:40.950> obviously<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.430> given<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
so the try will obviously be given that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.730 
so the try will obviously be given that
I<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.450> allowed<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> conversion<00:01:43.350> when

mr. Silvester
and<00:01:59.290> I<00:02:00.430> think<00:02:01.430> also<00:02:01.760> there<00:02:02.570> will<00:02:02.690> be<00:02:02.720> contact

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
and I think also there will be contact

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.870 
and I think also there will be contact
with<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.560> head<00:02:03.740> in<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.950> act<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.250> story<00:02:04.580> if

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
with the head in the act of story if

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.850 
with the head in the act of story if
that<00:02:05.120> is<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.570> then<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.530> further

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
that is so then that is a further

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.749 
that is so then that is a further
penalty<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.490> comes<00:02:08.450> out<00:02:08.600> of<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:09.759> substitute

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759
