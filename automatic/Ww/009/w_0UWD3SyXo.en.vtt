00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
is a little little bit of fuel into the

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:12.249 
is a little little bit of fuel into the
stove<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.080> that's<00:01:07.290> gonna<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:07.770> is

provide<00:01:13.259> something<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.100> light<00:01:14.750> what<00:01:15.750> we're

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
provide something to light what we're

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.849 
provide something to light what we're
really<00:01:15.990> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.320> doing<00:01:16.469> is<00:01:16.829> heating<00:01:17.369> up

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
really going to be doing is heating up

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.880 
really going to be doing is heating up
the<00:01:19.859> gas<00:01:20.039> and<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.429> stove<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.969> that<00:01:21.719> we<00:01:22.679> can

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the gas and the stove so that we can

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.069 
the gas and the stove so that we can
vaporize<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:26.490> gas<00:01:26.700> better<00:01:26.999> so<00:01:27.749> it's<00:01:27.899> now

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
vaporize the to gas better so it's now

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.270 
vaporize the to gas better so it's now
lit<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.549> warming<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.069> warm

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
lit and it's warming up you have to warm

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.580 
lit and it's warming up you have to warm
up<00:01:32.399> the<00:01:32.609> stove<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.390> little<00:01:33.630> bit<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.259> able<00:01:34.499> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
up the stove a little bit to be able to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.700 
up the stove a little bit to be able to
get<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.920> gas<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.700> vaporize<00:01:36.289> once<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.439> flames

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
get the gas to vaporize once the flames

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.889 
get the gas to vaporize once the flames
go<00:01:37.979> down<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.969> we're<00:01:39.149> gonna<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.450> able<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> turn

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
go down then we're gonna be able to turn

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.059 
go down then we're gonna be able to turn
the<00:01:40.140> stove<00:01:41.100> back<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:43.170> first<00:01:43.439> step<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.770> to

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
the stove back on so first step is to

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.899 
the stove back on so first step is to
light<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.609> stove

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909

get<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.869> warmed<00:01:46.139> up<00:01:47.780> let<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.990> flame<00:01:49.319> die<00:01:49.590> out

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
get it warmed up let the flame die out

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.539 
get it warmed up let the flame die out
and<00:01:50.450> then<00:01:51.450> we're<00:01:51.539> gonna<00:01:51.630> turn<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> stove<00:01:52.079> on

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:14.670 

okay<00:01:56.329> now<00:01:56.509> it's<00:01:56.659> time<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.840> turn<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.229> stove<00:01:57.470> on

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
thing about this stove is it's really to

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.490 
thing about this stove is it's really to
adjust<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.790> amount<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.150> gas<00:02:22.390> flow<00:02:22.719> just<00:02:23.290> by

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
adjust the amount of gas flow just by

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:33.670 
adjust the amount of gas flow just by
adjusting<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:26.349> whole<00:02:26.530> setup<00:02:26.829> there

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.040 

we're<00:02:34.040> gonna<00:02:34.129> boil<00:02:34.400> some<00:02:34.700> water

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.190 

put<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.590> lid<00:02:38.770> on<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.540> couple<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.900> minutes
