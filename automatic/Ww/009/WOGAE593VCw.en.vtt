00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.370
 good afternoon today I will show you a video about 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.300
 My regular Chinese site purchase 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.580
 aliexpress this time and bought on it 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.160
 cube which consists of magnetic 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.750
 balls so here it means it's all 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.930
 looked in a box well, that is, 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.189
 there was a black bag threw it out 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:30.859
 a box and a bag count 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.859
 here is the box creative here is sponge and 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.320
 here here lay on the cube now too 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.020
 cube holes here like this all 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.660
 packed because I'm as soon as he 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.780
 I came at once 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.610
 broke into a cube I have not had 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.149
 time even probably fellow and because 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.620
 what I tried yesterday I have new 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.320
 before the very end as soon as i have it 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.840
 did but for some reason I somehow 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.800
 hooked yourself there and everything messed up in 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.899
 Overall so far I have not figured out the bill 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.420
 how do i make it like this 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.869
 such magnetic balls like this 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.409
 little razmerchik and comics to yourself 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:20.159
 here is a little too they all come out 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.619
 with each other well molded can 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.170
 make of them all nonsense that is well 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.909
 You ask why I bought it I do not know 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.540
 just falling so first saw 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.920
 I wanted to buy that cube because 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.430
 it was two years ago 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.049
 and then finally a dream come true here this 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.079
 molded 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.079
 all metal here and so it looks 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.890
 there can be found in the u-tube, even many 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.110
 rollers how to fold dice does 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:56.579
 some other interesting figures for now 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.130
 that i don't have time for this i heard 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.689
 sure that some people still give 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.689
 the balls begin to demagnetize 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.160
 and here but also everything went too 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.810
 there will be electronics in class there with 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:18.430
 cards or something next to it 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:23.980
 we will see while everything suits me 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.520
 here is what beeches take by the way 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.250
 look after all I collected this cube 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.460
 Now he is ready to gotovenkoe tselenky 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.180
 smooth and here still spare here 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.420
 6 stuff turns out so that all 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.420
 possibly
