really<00:00:26.390> good<00:00:26.509> boost<00:00:26.720> finish<00:00:29.259> if<00:00:30.259> you<00:00:30.319> do<00:00:30.470> that

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
really good boost finish if you do that

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.080 
really good boost finish if you do that
quite<00:00:30.949> a<00:00:30.980> long<00:00:31.159> way<00:00:31.310> before<00:00:31.609> the<00:00:31.730> line<00:00:31.909> you'll

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
quite a long way before the line you'll

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.550 
quite a long way before the line you'll
learn<00:00:32.560> maximize<00:00:33.560> that<00:00:33.710> boost<00:00:35.230> so<00:00:36.230> here's<00:00:36.500> a

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
learn maximize that boost so here's a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.590 
learn maximize that boost so here's a
job<00:00:36.920> in<00:00:37.070> you<00:00:37.940> notice<00:00:38.210> how<00:00:38.330> he's<00:00:38.450> actually

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
job in you notice how he's actually

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.270 
job in you notice how he's actually
throwing<00:00:38.870> over<00:00:39.260> arm<00:00:39.440> bit<00:00:39.710> like<00:00:39.830> a<00:00:39.860> cricket

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
throwing over arm bit like a cricket

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.090 
throwing over arm bit like a cricket
ball<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:41.660> lot<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.290> people<00:00:42.500> tend<00:00:42.650> to<00:00:42.740> hold<00:00:42.980> their

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
ball a lot of people tend to hold their

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.560 
ball a lot of people tend to hold their
hand<00:00:43.280> up<00:00:43.370> above<00:00:43.610> their<00:00:43.760> heads<00:00:44.030> but<00:00:44.330> you<00:00:44.450> know

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
hand up above their heads but you know

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.350 
hand up above their heads but you know
it<00:00:45.010> kind<00:00:46.010> if<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:46.130> get<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.310> bit<00:00:46.460> more<00:00:46.670> motion<00:00:47.060> bit

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
it kind if you get a bit more motion bit

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.360 
it kind if you get a bit more motion bit
while<00:00:47.480> swinging<00:00:47.840> your<00:00:48.080> arm<00:00:48.260> before<00:00:49.010> from

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
while swinging your arm before from

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.010 
while swinging your arm before from
underneath<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.540> that's<00:00:50.600> really<00:00:50.840> what

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
underneath and that's really what

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.440 
underneath and that's really what
cameras<00:00:51.350> tracking<00:00:51.590> here<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.610> mine<00:00:52.970> is<00:00:53.090> able<00:00:53.330> to

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
cameras tracking here so mine is able to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:02.130 
cameras tracking here so mine is able to
get<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:53.720> know<00:00:53.780> well<00:00:54.050> over<00:00:54.080> 100<00:00:54.680> each<00:00:54.800> time

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.079 

so<00:01:03.140> onto<00:01:03.320> long<00:01:03.980> jump<00:01:04.220> it's<00:01:04.820> getting<00:01:05.030> these

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
so onto long jump it's getting these

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.330 
so onto long jump it's getting these
knees<00:01:05.269> very<00:01:05.659> very<00:01:05.960> high<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:06.920> notice<00:01:07.190> how

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
knees very very high and you notice how

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.490 
knees very very high and you notice how
precise<00:01:07.880> is<00:01:08.150> jump<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:08.840> at<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.049> end<00:01:09.200> these<00:01:09.320> we

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
precise is jump is at the end these we

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.499 
precise is jump is at the end these we
will<00:01:09.560> take<00:01:09.740> these<00:01:09.830> arms<00:01:10.130> twice<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.090> windmill

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
will take these arms twice the windmill

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:12.880 
will take these arms twice the windmill
and<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.780> your<00:01:11.900> arms<00:01:12.080> does<00:01:12.259> give<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.530> bit<00:01:12.830> of

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
and in your arms does give you a bit of

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.230 
and in your arms does give you a bit of
extra<00:01:13.250> distance<00:01:13.580> there<00:01:15.190> very<00:01:16.190> good<00:01:16.280> fourteen

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
extra distance there very good fourteen

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.640 
extra distance there very good fourteen
point<00:01:17.630> one<00:01:17.899> six<00:01:18.470> meters

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.440 

okay<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.610> running<00:01:23.760> here<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.180> pretty<00:01:24.330> much

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
okay so the running here is pretty much

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.970 
okay so the running here is pretty much
the<00:01:24.600> same<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.230> do<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.410> the<00:01:25.620> other<00:01:25.710> sports

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
the same as you do in the other sports

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.730 
the same as you do in the other sports
key<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.120> knees<00:01:27.330> really<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:28.290> high

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.260 

it's<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> very<00:01:31.980> very<00:01:32.400> precise<00:01:32.730> little<00:01:33.060> jump

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it's a very very precise little jump

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.550 
it's a very very precise little jump
forward

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.290 

okay<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.890> discus<00:01:40.130> nice<00:01:41.130> long<00:01:41.490> throw<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:42.090> I

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
okay so discus nice long throw there I

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.180 
okay so discus nice long throw there I
think<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> key<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.070> just

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
think the key to this one is really just

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.920 
think the key to this one is really just
to<00:01:44.550> kind<00:01:44.760> of<00:01:44.940> crouch<00:01:45.270> down<00:01:45.300> as<00:01:45.690> much<00:01:45.780> as

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
to kind of crouch down as much as

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.740 
to kind of crouch down as much as
possible<00:01:46.110> keep<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.100> arms<00:01:47.460> straight<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
possible keep that arms straight and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.630 
possible keep that arms straight and
really<00:01:49.080> kind<00:01:49.440> of<00:01:49.470> focus<00:01:49.830> on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.310> ceiling

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
really kind of focus on the ceiling

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.670 
really kind of focus on the ceiling
trying<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.060> find<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.510> good<00:01:51.630> spot<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.230> aim<00:01:52.650> for

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
trying to find a good spot and aim for

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.620 
trying to find a good spot and aim for
that<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.190> think<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.150> of<00:01:54.180> those<00:01:54.360> events

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that I think this is one of those events

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.970 
that I think this is one of those events
what<00:01:54.870> you<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.590> put<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.740> lot<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
what you really do have to put a lot of

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.980 
what you really do have to put a lot of
energy<00:01:58.640> onto<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.760> hurdles<00:02:00.150> here<00:02:00.390> last<00:02:00.810> about

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
energy onto the hurdles here last about

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.110 
energy onto the hurdles here last about
track<00:02:01.230> and<00:02:01.410> field<00:02:01.560> events<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.910> boost

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
track and field events so the boost

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.790 
track and field events so the boost
start<00:02:03.360> here<00:02:03.510> applies<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.200> third<00:02:04.440> heart<00:02:04.650> beat

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
start here applies the third heart beat

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.730 
start here applies the third heart beat
you<00:02:04.980> can<00:02:05.100> start<00:02:05.370> learning<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:07.020> what<00:02:07.530> watch

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
you can start learning and what watch

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.160 
you can start learning and what watch
this<00:02:07.980> is<00:02:08.190> M<00:02:08.369> jumps<00:02:08.880> are<00:02:08.970> quite<00:02:09.149> small<00:02:09.630> I<00:02:09.840> think

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
this is M jumps are quite small I think

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.350 
this is M jumps are quite small I think
being<00:02:10.430> short<00:02:11.430> at<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.610> time<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:11.940> spend<00:02:12.180> off

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
being short at the time you spend off

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.940 
being short at the time you spend off
the<00:02:12.540> grounds<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.320> faster<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:13.710> keep

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the grounds the faster you can keep

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.460 
the grounds the faster you can keep
running<00:02:14.570> she's<00:02:15.570> doing<00:02:15.780> very<00:02:15.960> small<00:02:16.230> precise

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
running she's doing very small precise

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.020 
running she's doing very small precise
double<00:02:16.710> jumps<00:02:16.920> here<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.250> it's<00:02:17.820> getting<00:02:18.000> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
double jumps here and it's getting a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.590 
double jumps here and it's getting a
good<00:02:18.270> boost<00:02:18.480> finish<00:02:18.840> over<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.080> line<00:02:20.600> it's

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
good boost finish over the line it's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.730 
good boost finish over the line it's
good<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.870> boost<00:02:22.050> quite<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.380> long<00:02:22.470> way<00:02:22.590> before

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
good to boost quite a long way before

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.420 
good to boost quite a long way before
the<00:02:23.010> line<00:02:23.130> there

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.640 

the<00:02:26.430> danger<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:26.880> suppose<00:02:27.180> if<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.510> boost<00:02:28.020> too

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
the danger is I suppose if you boost too

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.260 
the danger is I suppose if you boost too
early<00:02:28.980> you'll<00:02:29.340> run<00:02:29.460> out<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.580> steam<00:02:29.790> before<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
early you'll run out of steam before the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.730 
early you'll run out of steam before the
finish<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:31.200> have<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.470> start<00:02:31.770> running<00:02:31.980> again

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
finish you have to start running again

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.570 
finish you have to start running again
so<00:02:34.740> if<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:34.890> follow<00:02:35.010> those<00:02:35.220> tips<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.550> should

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
so if you follow those tips you should

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.060 
so if you follow those tips you should
pretty<00:02:36.390> much<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.630> able<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.020> beat<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.380> computer

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
pretty much be able to beat the computer

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.130 
pretty much be able to beat the computer
on<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.250> champion<00:02:38.790> difficulty<00:02:39.390> which<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.780> one

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
on the champion difficulty which is one

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.070 
on the champion difficulty which is one
of<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.260> hardest<00:02:40.500> achievements<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.100> game

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
of the hardest achievements in the game

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:52.970 
of the hardest achievements in the game
needs<00:02:43.080> very<00:02:43.320> high<00:02:43.410> there<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:51.260> yet<00:02:52.260> very<00:02:52.620> small

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
needs very high there and yet very small

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.520 
needs very high there and yet very small
jumps<00:02:53.340> there<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:54.540> hardly<00:02:54.810> spends<00:02:55.080> any<00:02:55.260> time

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
jumps there so hardly spends any time

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.990 
jumps there so hardly spends any time
off<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.830> ground<00:02:56.010> at<00:02:56.190> all<00:02:56.340> before<00:02:56.520> he<00:02:56.730> carries

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
off the ground at all before he carries

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.699 
off the ground at all before he carries
on<00:02:57.120> running<00:02:57.360> again

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.309 

and<00:03:03.250> there's<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.519> boost<00:03:03.700> finish<00:03:04.170> quite<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.200> lot

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
and there's the boost finish quite a lot

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
and there's the boost finish quite a lot
of<00:03:05.349> energy<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.709> stone<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.849> a<00:03:06.909> good<00:03:07.090> time
