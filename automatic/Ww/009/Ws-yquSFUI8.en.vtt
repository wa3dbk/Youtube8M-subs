00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.550 
ahead and jump into it first thing I
might<00:00:26.099> go<00:00:26.220> ahead<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.760> drag<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.300> my<00:00:27.480> clip<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
might go ahead do is drag in my clip the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.380 
might go ahead do is drag in my clip the
first<00:00:28.740> thing<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.010> when<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.279> ever<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.760> dragon<00:00:30.179> in

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
first thing I do when I ever I dragon in

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.110 
first thing I do when I ever I dragon in
eclipse<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.189> right<00:00:32.189> click<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.910> go<00:00:33.059> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
eclipse is I right click it and I go to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.209 
eclipse is I right click it and I go to
properties<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.440> always<00:00:34.680> make<00:00:35.010> sure<00:00:35.040> i

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
properties and I always make sure i

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.160 
properties and I always make sure i
disable<00:00:35.820> resample<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.600> some<00:00:36.750> reason<00:00:37.050> this

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
disable resample for some reason this

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.319 
disable resample for some reason this
makes<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> huge<00:00:37.649> difference<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.219> me<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.969> that

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
makes a huge difference for me but that

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.549 
makes a huge difference for me but that
might<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:40.200> personal

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
might just be one of my personal

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.900 
might just be one of my personal
opinions<00:00:40.980> or<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.219> those<00:00:41.309> pet<00:00:41.520> peeves<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
opinions or one of those pet peeves that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.000 
opinions or one of those pet peeves that
I<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:42.719> let's<00:00:42.930> go<00:00:43.050> ahead<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.320> find<00:00:43.770> out

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
I have now let's go ahead and find out

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.680 
I have now let's go ahead and find out
whether<00:00:44.280> or<00:00:44.399> not<00:00:44.489> your<00:00:44.670> computer<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.210> even<00:00:45.480> do

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
whether or not your computer can even do

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.869 
whether or not your computer can even do
a<00:00:45.719> GPU<00:00:46.320> rendering<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.280> order<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.760> this

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
a GPU rendering so in order to do this

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.490 
a GPU rendering so in order to do this
we're<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> go<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> options<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.350> down

we're going to go to options and go down

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.799 
we're going to go to options and go down
to<00:00:49.559> preferences<00:00:50.360> all<00:00:51.360> right<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
to preferences all right it's going to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
pull up this huge crazy preference thing

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.310 
pull up this huge crazy preference thing
with<00:00:53.850> lots<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.840> all<00:00:55.079> over<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
with lots of going on all over the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.660

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
place but what we're going to do is

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.979 
place but what we're going to do is
wrong<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.969> worry<00:00:57.149> about<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.570> tab<00:00:57.809> right

wrong I worry about this one tab right

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
wrong I worry about this one tab right
here<00:00:58.020> versus<00:00:58.350> video<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.309> we're<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
here versus video so we're going to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.069 
here versus video so we're going to
click<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.820> video<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.480> there's<00:01:00.870> only<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.050> couple

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

click on video and there's only a couple
things<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.680> we're<00:01:01.770> even<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> look<00:01:02.250> at

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
things and we're even going to look at

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.160 
things and we're even going to look at
in<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.359> first<00:01:03.539> thing<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.870> right<00:01:03.989> here

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
in here the first thing is right here

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.870 
in here the first thing is right here
you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.530> where<00:01:04.650> says<00:01:04.799> GPU<00:01:05.309> acceleration

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you can see where says GPU acceleration

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.390 
you can see where says GPU acceleration
of<00:01:06.330> video<00:01:06.750> processing<00:01:07.350> right<00:01:07.979> here<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
of video processing right here is the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.370 
of video processing right here is the
big<00:01:08.729> thing<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.390> see<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.350> says

big thing if you see right here it says
i<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.680> an<00:01:10.920> AMD<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.640> showing<00:01:12.119> my<00:01:12.360> GPU<00:01:13.110> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
i have an AMD it's showing my GPU so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.710 
i have an AMD it's showing my GPU so
it's<00:01:13.799> actually<00:01:14.070> available<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> only

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it's actually available now the only

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.260 
it's actually available now the only
other<00:01:15.900> question<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.950> opencl<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:18.000> not

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
other question is if it's opencl or not

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.570 
other question is if it's opencl or not
so<00:01:18.659> let's<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.930> ahead<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.259> hit<00:01:19.470> apply<00:01:19.619> here

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
so let's go ahead and hit apply here

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.370 
so let's go ahead and hit apply here
okay<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.150> let's<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.659> ahead<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.960> find<00:01:22.200> that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
okay and let's go ahead and find that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
okay and let's go ahead and find that
out<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.710> first<00:01:22.979> we're<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.000> over

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
out but first we're going to go over

and to mimic that as you guys can see
I'm<00:01:45.570> using<00:01:45.600> 1080<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.500> I'm<00:01:46.560> actually<00:01:46.740> using<00:01:47.009> it

at<00:01:47.399> 30<00:01:47.729> frames<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.210> second<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.049> reason<00:01:49.200> why

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
at 30 frames a second and the reason why

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.990 
at 30 frames a second and the reason why
I'm<00:01:49.530> doing<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.520> use<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.880> al

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
I'm doing this is because I use in al

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.870 
I'm doing this is because I use in al
gato<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> elgato<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> Xbox<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
gato and with the elgato on the Xbox it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.600 
gato and with the elgato on the Xbox it
outputs<00:01:54.720> at<00:01:54.930> only<00:01:55.200> 30<00:01:55.470> frames<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.950> second<00:01:56.340> even

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
outputs at only 30 frames a second even

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.969 
outputs at only 30 frames a second even
though<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.909> xbox<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.540> inputting<00:01:58.200> at<00:01:58.320> 60

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979

pixel aspect ratio is one sometimes you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.999 
pixel aspect ratio is one sometimes you
see<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.259> actually<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.920> the

even a 64-bit I like to keep it at eight

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.050 
even a 64-bit I like to keep it at eight
bit<00:02:20.200> just<00:02:20.740> because<00:02:20.800> I'm<00:02:21.370> playing<00:02:21.760> something

the lower bit kind of helps it makes it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.840 
the lower bit kind of helps it makes it
makes<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.770> little<00:02:26.950> bit<00:02:27.040> easier<00:02:27.220> for<00:02:27.520> playback

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850

think it actually defaults to either
good<00:02:38.560> or<00:02:38.590> preview<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:39.580> make<00:02:39.760> sure<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.180> is

for<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.510> bit<00:04:28.660> rate<00:04:28.840> is<00:04:29.020> 10<00:04:29.520> 10<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.639> 15<00:04:31.060> is<00:04:31.300> pretty

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
for a bit rate is 10 10 to 15 is pretty

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.879 
for a bit rate is 10 10 to 15 is pretty
good<00:04:31.750> it's<00:04:31.960> going<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.170> increase<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.680> file

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
good it's going to increase the file

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.650 
good it's going to increase the file
size<00:04:33.130> some<00:04:33.460> people<00:04:33.730> might<00:04:33.850> be<00:04:34.000> able<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.510> get

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
size some people might be able to get

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.500 
size some people might be able to get
away<00:04:34.750> with<00:04:34.930> six<00:04:35.560> just<00:04:36.520> remember<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.120> the

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
away with six just remember that the

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.640 
away with six just remember that the
higher<00:04:37.720> are<00:04:37.870> going<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:38.080> put<00:04:38.260> this<00:04:38.410> it's

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
higher are going to put this it's

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.990 
higher are going to put this it's
actually<00:04:38.950> going<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.130> increase<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.550> file<00:04:39.760> size

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
actually going to increase the file size

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.850 
actually going to increase the file size
but<00:04:40.570> if<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.720> have<00:04:40.840> pretty<00:04:41.080> good<00:04:41.230> upload<00:04:41.560> speed

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
but if you have pretty good upload speed

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.110 
but if you have pretty good upload speed
it's<00:04:42.220> really<00:04:42.550> not<00:04:42.700> going<00:04:42.880> to<00:04:42.940> make<00:04:43.090> a

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
it's really not going to make a

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.909 
it's really not going to make a
difference<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:43.840> now<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.200> last<00:04:44.440> two<00:04:44.680> things

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
difference and now the last two things

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.440 
difference and now the last two things
i'm<00:04:45.070> going<00:04:45.220> to<00:04:45.280> show<00:04:45.430> you<00:04:45.460> are<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.240> biggest

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
i'm going to show you are the biggest

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.270 
i'm going to show you are the biggest
things<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.020> whole<00:04:47.200> video<00:04:47.410> here<00:04:48.100> it<00:04:48.190> is

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
things of the whole video here it is

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.129 
things of the whole video here it is
with<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.610> encode<00:04:49.090> mode<00:04:49.419> right<00:04:49.660> here<00:04:49.870> itself

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
with the encode mode right here itself

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.320 
with the encode mode right here itself
to<00:04:50.260> go<00:04:50.380> automatic<00:04:51.100> right<00:04:51.250> now<00:04:51.400> recommended<00:04:52.180> we

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
to go automatic right now recommended we

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.300 
to go automatic right now recommended we
don't<00:04:52.510> want<00:04:52.690> that<00:04:52.780> what<00:04:53.080> we<00:04:53.200> want<00:04:53.380> to<00:04:53.500> do<00:04:53.650> is<00:04:53.860> go

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
don't want that what we want to do is go

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.360 
don't want that what we want to do is go
to<00:04:54.370> render<00:04:54.760> using<00:04:55.060> GPU<00:04:55.840> if<00:04:56.190> available<00:04:57.190> and

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
to render using GPU if available and

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.610 
to render using GPU if available and
that's<00:04:57.940> going<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.240> be<00:04:58.450> pulling<00:04:58.810> our<00:04:59.080> GPU<00:04:59.500> and

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
that's going to be pulling our GPU and

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.890 
that's going to be pulling our GPU and
the<00:04:59.680> reason<00:05:00.250> why<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.430> GPU<00:05:01.060> makes<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.510> so<00:05:01.750> much

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
the reason why the GPU makes it so much

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.110 
the reason why the GPU makes it so much
faster<00:05:02.260> than<00:05:02.680> just<00:05:02.950> going<00:05:03.130> strictly<00:05:03.490> with

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
faster than just going strictly with

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.030 
faster than just going strictly with
your<00:05:04.270> CPU<00:05:04.660> is<00:05:04.810> because<00:05:04.990> your<00:05:05.080> CPU<00:05:05.440> is<00:05:05.590> pretty

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
your CPU is because your CPU is pretty

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.980 
your CPU is because your CPU is pretty
decent<00:05:06.460> at<00:05:06.550> making<00:05:06.850> calculations<00:05:07.419> but<00:05:07.870> it

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
decent at making calculations but it

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.020 
decent at making calculations but it
does<00:05:08.140> them<00:05:08.260> in<00:05:08.380> sequential<00:05:08.710> order<00:05:09.010> a<00:05:09.340> GPU<00:05:09.940> is

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
does them in sequential order a GPU is

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.030 
does them in sequential order a GPU is
even<00:05:10.360> faster<00:05:10.510> at<00:05:10.900> it<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.169> it<00:05:11.620> kind<00:05:11.800> of<00:05:11.860> does

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
even faster at it and it kind of does

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.340 
even faster at it and it kind of does
does<00:05:12.730> whatever<00:05:12.970> it<00:05:13.120> can<00:05:13.390> at<00:05:13.630> that<00:05:13.780> moment<00:05:14.080> and

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
does whatever it can at that moment and

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.480 
does whatever it can at that moment and
then<00:05:14.410> kind<00:05:14.590> of<00:05:14.710> pieces<00:05:15.070> in<00:05:15.160> them<00:05:15.250> all<00:05:15.340> back

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
then kind of pieces in them all back

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.430 
then kind of pieces in them all back
together<00:05:15.700> so<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.419> makes<00:05:16.540> it<00:05:16.690> very<00:05:16.750> good<00:05:17.140> and

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
together so it makes it very good and

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.100 
together so it makes it very good and
very<00:05:17.470> fast<00:05:18.220> without<00:05:18.700> losing<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.270> quality<00:05:19.690> but

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
very fast without losing the quality but

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.540 
very fast without losing the quality but
want<00:05:20.350> to<00:05:20.470> go<00:05:20.560> ahead<00:05:20.680> and<00:05:20.979> make<00:05:21.100> sure<00:05:21.130> that<00:05:21.430> we

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
want to go ahead and make sure that we

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.190 
want to go ahead and make sure that we
have<00:05:21.729> that<00:05:21.880> open<00:05:22.120> CL<00:05:22.630> that<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:22.840> had<00:05:22.960> talked

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
have that open CL that I had talked

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.570 
have that open CL that I had talked
about<00:05:23.410> earlier<00:05:23.710> right<00:05:24.190> here<00:05:24.340> you're<00:05:24.430> going<00:05:24.520> to

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
about earlier right here you're going to

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.120 
about earlier right here you're going to
click<00:05:24.760> on<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:25.000> system's<00:05:25.419> tab<00:05:25.800> pin<00:05:26.800> in<00:05:26.950> here

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
click on the system's tab pin in here

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
click on the system's tab pin in here
it's<00:05:27.280> going<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.460> have<00:05:27.580> this<00:05:27.700> little<00:05:27.910> tab<00:05:28.120> that

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
it's going to have this little tab that

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.570 
it's going to have this little tab that
says<00:05:28.330> check<00:05:28.630> GPU<00:05:29.590> go<00:05:30.070> ahead<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.250> click<00:05:30.520> that

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
says check GPU go ahead and click that

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.000 
says check GPU go ahead and click that
and<00:05:31.000> you<00:05:31.330> can<00:05:31.479> see<00:05:31.570> that<00:05:31.630> I'll<00:05:31.810> say<00:05:31.990> opencl<00:05:32.800> is

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
and you can see that I'll say opencl is

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.190 
and you can see that I'll say opencl is
available<00:05:33.729> that<00:05:34.180> means<00:05:34.360> your<00:05:34.510> GPU<00:05:34.840> is<00:05:34.930> good

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
available that means your GPU is good

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.900 
available that means your GPU is good
enough<00:05:35.380> you<00:05:35.710> can<00:05:35.860> go<00:05:35.950> ahead<00:05:36.040> and<00:05:36.160> do<00:05:36.310> it<00:05:36.430> hit<00:05:36.580> ok

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
enough you can go ahead and do it hit ok

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.090 
enough you can go ahead and do it hit ok
go<00:05:37.660> ahead<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:37.870> hit<00:05:37.960> render<00:05:38.169> and<00:05:38.530> you're<00:05:39.010> going

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
go ahead and hit render and you're going

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.060 
go ahead and hit render and you're going
to<00:05:39.160> see<00:05:39.990> you're<00:05:40.990> going<00:05:41.020> to<00:05:41.200> see<00:05:41.380> just<00:05:41.830> how<00:05:41.890> much

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
to see you're going to see just how much

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.730 
to see you're going to see just how much
faster<00:05:42.520> it<00:05:42.970> is<00:05:43.060> versus<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.110> other<00:05:44.140> way<00:05:44.500> that

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
faster it is versus the other way that

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.440 
faster it is versus the other way that
you<00:05:44.830> used<00:05:44.860> to<00:05:45.250> render<00:05:45.460> now<00:05:45.940> mine<00:05:46.240> right<00:05:46.419> now

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
you used to render now mine right now

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.790 
you used to render now mine right now
it's<00:05:46.750> going<00:05:46.840> to<00:05:46.900> look<00:05:47.080> like<00:05:47.260> it's<00:05:47.530> actually

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
it's going to look like it's actually

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.170 
it's going to look like it's actually
kind<00:05:48.010> of<00:05:48.100> slow<00:05:48.340> just<00:05:48.580> because<00:05:48.850> I'm<00:05:48.970> actually

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
kind of slow just because I'm actually

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.420 
kind of slow just because I'm actually
recording<00:05:49.780> at<00:05:49.900> the<00:05:49.990> same<00:05:50.169> time<00:05:50.380> so<00:05:50.620> my<00:05:50.770> GPU<00:05:51.400> is

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
recording at the same time so my GPU is

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.850 
recording at the same time so my GPU is
already<00:05:51.910> under<00:05:52.150> a<00:05:52.330> lot<00:05:52.750> of<00:05:52.780> stress<00:05:53.200> and<00:05:53.410> is

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
already under a lot of stress and is
