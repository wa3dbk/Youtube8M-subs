this well yeah just a little bit more
experience<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> Beastmaster

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
experience I think with a Beastmaster

experience I think with a Beastmaster
clearing<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.049> creep<00:01:22.290> camp<00:01:22.500> making<00:01:22.740> sure

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
clearing out this creep camp making sure

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.530 
clearing out this creep camp making sure
that<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.250> isn't<00:01:23.400> an<00:01:23.700> expansion<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that there isn't an expansion up and

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.050 
that there isn't an expansion up and
running<00:01:25.140> tauren<00:01:25.500> chieftain<00:01:25.530> takes<00:01:26.520> down<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
running tauren chieftain takes down and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.480 
running tauren chieftain takes down and
now<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.900> only<00:01:28.110> 24<00:01:28.590> experience<00:01:28.979> away<00:01:29.220> from

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
now is only 24 experience away from

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.210 
now is only 24 experience away from
level<00:01:29.850> 3<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.630> well<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.229> level<00:01:31.560> two<00:01:31.710> shock<00:01:32.009> wave

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
level 3 as well so level two shock wave

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.190 
level 3 as well so level two shock wave
will<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> good<00:01:33.240> counter<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.810> those<00:01:33.960> truths

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
will be a good counter to those truths

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.719 
will be a good counter to those truths
of<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> town<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.740> he<00:01:35.189> does<00:01:35.400> need<00:01:35.610> those
