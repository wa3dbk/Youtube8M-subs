00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.240
 beauty galley 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.490
 I'm going to make a different video today because 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.400
 had a rope at home and the pack 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.240
 that new collection of collectors more 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.720
 or less of the white plate harry potter 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.310
 So just got the package at home. 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.859
 on Sunday but anyway 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.399
 and I decided to open the package with 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.399
 you 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.210
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.010
 today I decided to make a different video 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.440
 because I just got home that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.470
 harry potter's collection of white cloak 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.799
 which is a collector's collection and I 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.229
 I decided to open the package as you together 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.659
 for us to find out how the books 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.610
 are an asset in a harry potter book 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.680
 I read that it was small had more or 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.780
 at least nine and ten years old until the fourth 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.810
 book after he lost interest 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.570
 so I decided to buy the collection to see 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.360
 if some day says ask again that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:36.270
 interest and I return to him the books of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:40.790
 harry potter take is that the books come out 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.790
 for a griddle without paper bubble 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:02:01.500
 the fiscal and here are the seven books of 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:09.179
 the collection then begin with the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:11.310
 smaller it is not the secret camera that the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:21.150
 his 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:24.510
 the philosopher 's stone is a very fine book 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.700
 and I 'm a little shocked actually 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.890
 because I read yu the philosopher's stone 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.360
 was very small and I remembered that he 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.269
 it's a lot thicker 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.390
 I do not know who killed a paper or syllable and 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:42.530
 remember that cardinal at least 12 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:45.450
 here he is very fine is in blue has ear 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.400
 on top and then I show the gambiarra 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.400
 what I did to get it - hello here 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:57.450
 anyway the lyrics I thought were small 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.930
 today you are actually smaller but the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.930
 philosopher's stone 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.519
 the next one that is the secret camera 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.519
 my book is very small it's true but 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.250
 it's not even the size of the stone 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:22.170
 philosopher has 250 pages based on this 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.049
 I think it has not been that long since 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.269
 I then gave him nine brains of 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.950
 characters use the secret camera 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:40.260
 next book is the prisoner day left 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:42.900
 which is starting to get a little bigger than 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.660
 Calm is a little bigger has 318 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.849
 Books pages remain the same is 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.630
 blue whiting the letter looks the same size 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.490
 of the other views and not a bit 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:59.140
 thicker 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:02.140
 finally the prisoner of azkaban the next 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.160
 is not unique to the deaths with lego the chalice 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:10.120
 of fire 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:11.770
 I stopped reading this book here the chalice 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.690
 of fire and a skull that in front 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:21.820
 channel and record that it is finally 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:28.660
 basically the same as others, except that 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:31.810
 here is orangeade next book is do not know 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.550
 now I do not know how it is 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:40.410
 I think the relic of the relics of the 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.410
 death do not think the last is death 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:51.090
 it is whiting same 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.620
 besides the phoenix is the fifth 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:16.290
 look at the phoenix there is a ball with the 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:18.350
 arm on the cover looks like a phoenix here 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.350
 side 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.500
 I have seen several people complaining about 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.680
 way of books packed mainly 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.610
 Submarine books but face 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.340
 no book threatened or anything brazil 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.100
 always spotless 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.670
 I see why I do not care 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.310
 a lot for this but I never had one 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.280
 very big defect and here the puzzle of 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:52.400
 prince with a potion here from the side 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:56.580
 here in all the books in the collection 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.200
 this is that guys are smart last one video 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.600
 video more - different 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.210
 I do not know if I intend to do more 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.040
 times that I was going to buy a place of 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.420
 harry potter collection 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:12.120
 that collection of the chronicles of ice and 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.300
 fire is a special collection the 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.010
 pocket that is very beautiful but I saw 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.010
 some comments on the internet that she 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.180
 does not come with ear and pages are 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.400
 very thin 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.050
 so I finished I already have both 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.730
 first books so I ended up talking ah 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.470
 I do not think it's worth much 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.290
 I will be with my connection and as 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:34.260
 I was the forum I was reading, I 'm going 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:38.640

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:41.490
 and here is my new collection collection 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:45.660

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:49.080

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.750
 in fact and that's galley and even 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.250
 next to the actress let me show you 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.170
 It's Gambiarra that I made up here. 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.770
 started there to see if you can say 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:01.700
 something from above 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:05.510
 Look, I was just fighting to fall, then. 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:08.340
 gives you duct tape 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.850
 but I hope it has been good 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.850
 to the next
