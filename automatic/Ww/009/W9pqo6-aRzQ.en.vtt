00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.909
 However, there are things that I would like you to acknowledge in advance 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.450
 Oh dear 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:35.760
 Not only myself but this already is already 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:41.790
 Each person makes various success 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:44.730
 Since it is sold's user is a lot that has been pushed an anti-shaving how's other users to 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.900
 Please listen to that too 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:57.100
 Well if the user is good I think that I will tell you that already 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:58.710
 This is just the way you are doing very well in that transformation action Yes 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.200
 First of all 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.670
 Well it is the Fu say 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.590
 Well it is a deck attached card yes 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.030
 Well this shake is there 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.060
 Well makeover action starts 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.800
 To Fu say you Deko little Tsu but it is got to do this 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.510
 There is a question of the digital camera, but in this way it is like this with vibration 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.310
 Geesen but the other one 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:28.390
 I think I've been doing something like this 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.900
 And about and in three seconds say in rubbing in such Fu 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.960
 I wonder 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.610
 After about 3 seconds 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:41.800
 I'll loosen it a little over 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:45.970
 It's loose, what do you say? 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.420
 It's a bit overwhelming at first , so it's looser 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.010
 And then again 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.550
 It will be a great success 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:02.070
 I in more than slowly beyond just those of the right hand I Are You a here of the right hand 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:06.300
 Well prepared not too intense , not a large slender person, so do it this way and left 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.640
 I only rub my hands like this 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.620
 And after positive 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.400
 I'm doing this until the countdown of that countdown makeover action is over 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.459
 powder 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.600
 Constant rubbing is also true 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.730
 Toka I rub 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:33.400
 that 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:33.400
 It is this god which is different depending on the card, but this is already that already 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:40.780
 This is already the time, but this is the time when it came out 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:45.850
 That ordinary 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.400
 I was doing this I was doing something sweet like this I was doing something like this 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:53.550
 ra Oh gauge something 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:59.580
 Something even if that accumulate how is Te will and body Ya Toko'll slow softening 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:02.340
 It was late, it's a guy who comes to this thing , so it's slowly like this 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.810
 Early After doing soooo 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:11.090
 Nde said, accumulated that gauge gold 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:14.000
 Even cards that the same makeover action is different in how they are stored are also marni 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.959
 But it is Well there you either Marni I mean 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.930
 It might have been the case when the section happened to happen 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.810
 Actually 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.570
 Yup 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.080
 There is 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.080
 Well, though I can not say it absolutely 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.610
 If you are your own, it is your own 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:39.699
 In the same way as earlier by saying Tsu course to Fu say Well this is the case of his own 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:41.310
 Loosen beyond the had rubbed doing this now doing this After standing Well 33 seconds or four seconds Well a few seconds 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.750
 The 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:49.150
 But here is a feeling too 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.080
 I think it's a sense I think it's a good idea and it's like I'm feeling like it's one second or two seconds 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:56.140
 More 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:58.300
 It 's a great success if you go beyond one's pat after one or two seconds after loosening 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:03.080
 Well countdown hmm 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:08.120
 Well I wanted to be a big success when the count went to 0 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:12.169
 It's only about 3 seconds or 4 seconds that I 've rubbed over the dirt 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.120
 I want to be a big success or it only takes about 2 seconds. 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.210
 There is also that kind of thing just 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.969
 It says even Depending on the state of the panel 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.429
 Yup 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:27.009
 Well, I can't say it absolutely, as I said earlier 

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:30.360
 I 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.830
 Mark at the time of new action earn 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.100
 Say that man is making great success 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:40.569
 I can't say how it is 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:43.499
 It is really a reference level, but if you ask other users 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.499
 I think it's good
