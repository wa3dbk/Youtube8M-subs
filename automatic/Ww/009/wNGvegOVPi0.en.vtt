has<00:01:05.729> been<00:01:05.880> talking<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.240> collecting<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.049> fund

has been talking about collecting a fund

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.039 
has been talking about collecting a fund
and<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.920> few<00:01:08.280> members<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.360> more<00:01:09.510> wealthy<00:01:09.869> ones

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and a few members the more wealthy ones

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.230 
and a few members the more wealthy ones
in<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.229> crowd<00:01:10.439> offered<00:01:10.920> $1,000<00:01:11.580> each<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.060> him

in this crowd offered $1,000 each to him

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.760 
in this crowd offered $1,000 each to him
so<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> think<00:01:12.720> he<00:01:12.840> would<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.110> made<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.590> five

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.679 
so I think he would have made like five
