the front and one in the rear okay now

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.660 
the front and one in the rear okay now
there's<00:00:15.750> also<00:00:15.990> one<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.920> passenger<00:00:17.400> side

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
there's also one on the passenger side

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.310 
there's also one on the passenger side
and<00:00:17.850> there's<00:00:18.000> also<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.359> transmission<00:00:18.779> mount

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
and there's also the transmission mount

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.470 
and there's also the transmission mount
or<00:00:19.619> engine<00:00:20.160> mount<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.609> call<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
or engine mount we call it on the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.439 
or engine mount we call it on the
driver's<00:00:21.869> side<00:00:21.900> now<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> cradle

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
driver's side now this is the cradle

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.939 
driver's side now this is the cradle
that<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.960> sits<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.560> don't<00:00:25.740> need<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
that it sits in you don't need to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.410 
that it sits in you don't need to
replace<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.460> whole<00:00:26.640> part<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.119> need<00:00:27.330> to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
replace this whole part you just need to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.550 
replace this whole part you just need to
do<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.960> inserts<00:00:29.060> now<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.900> bolted<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
do the inserts now it's bolted in the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.250 
do the inserts now it's bolted in the
back<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.719> arm<00:00:35.360> there's<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.450> trick<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.899> did<00:00:36.960> with

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
back and arm there's a trick I did with

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.450 
back and arm there's a trick I did with
this<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:38.070> lot<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.340> people<00:00:38.579> don't<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
this that a lot of people don't do and

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.950 
this that a lot of people don't do and
you<00:00:41.460> could<00:00:41.610> probably<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.210> partly<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.750> here

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
you could probably see it partly in here

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.010 
you could probably see it partly in here
is<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.170> they're<00:00:43.530> filled<00:00:43.829> up<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.219> some

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
is that they're filled up with some

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.600 
is that they're filled up with some
urethane<00:00:46.020> windshield<00:00:46.649> adhesive<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.550> I'll

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
urethane windshield adhesive and I'll

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.720 
urethane windshield adhesive and I'll
tell<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> reason<00:00:48.270> why<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> do<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:49.039> but<00:00:50.039> it's

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
tell you a reason why I do that but it's

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.520 
tell you a reason why I do that but it's
not<00:00:51.420> super<00:00:51.870> difficult<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.649> take<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:53.070> this

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
not super difficult to take out this

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.500 
not super difficult to take out this
these<00:00:55.530> motor<00:00:55.800> mounts<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.579> requires<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.180> lot<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
these motor mounts it requires a lot of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.150 
these motor mounts it requires a lot of
hammering<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> inserts<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
hammering to get the inserts out with a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.639 
hammering to get the inserts out with a
chisel<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.059> I'll<00:01:00.629> explain<00:01:01.050> something<00:01:01.500> on

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
chisel and I'll explain something on

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.119 
chisel and I'll explain something on
this<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.859> little<00:01:02.129> bit<00:01:02.280> further<00:01:03.379> but<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.769> trick

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
this a little bit further but this trick

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.010 
this a little bit further but this trick
I'm<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> tell<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.330> actually<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
I'm going to tell you is actually what I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.070 
I'm going to tell you is actually what I
really<00:01:07.320> will<00:01:07.439> get<00:01:07.590> into<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:09.080> obviously

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
really will get into on this obviously

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.070 
really will get into on this obviously
have<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> take<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.619> Center<00:01:10.920> bulb<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
have to take out that Center bulb and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.850 
have to take out that Center bulb and
the<00:01:13.080> radiator<00:01:13.439> support<00:01:13.740> has<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.310> come<00:01:14.520> down

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
the radiator support has to come down

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.899 
the radiator support has to come down
all<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.310> radiator<00:01:17.759> support

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
all right that's the radiator support

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.890 
all right that's the radiator support
right<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:19.820> these<00:01:20.820> two<00:01:21.030> bolts<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.689> come

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
right here these two bolts have to come

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.960 
right here these two bolts have to come
out<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.650> whole<00:01:22.860> radiator<00:01:23.340> support<00:01:23.520> comes

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
out this whole radiator support comes

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
out this whole radiator support comes
down<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.900> don't<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.290> disconnect<00:01:25.920> like

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
down you don't have to disconnect like

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
down you don't have to disconnect like
the<00:01:27.150> radiator<00:01:27.509> itself<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:28.259> don't<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.470> to

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the radiator itself you don't have to

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.350 
the radiator itself you don't have to
disconnect<00:01:29.070> any<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> hoses<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:30.150> anything

disconnect any of the hoses or anything

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.789 
disconnect any of the hoses or anything
like<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.990> don't<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.350> disconnect

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
like that you don't have to disconnect

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
like that you don't have to disconnect
the<00:01:31.950> transmission<00:01:32.610> line<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> radiator

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the transmission line but the radiator

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.289 
the transmission line but the radiator
has<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.409> come<00:01:34.619> down<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.189> few<00:01:35.250> inches<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.850> get<00:01:36.150> out

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
has to come down a few inches to get out

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.890 
has to come down a few inches to get out
the<00:01:37.159> cradle<00:01:38.159> from<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> top<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> top

here this is a this thing in the center
right<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.049> that's<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.799> top<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
right here that's the top of the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:44.780 
right here that's the top of the
radiator

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
radiator

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.480 
radiator
um<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:46.409> know<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.680> built<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.130> into<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
um you know it's built right into the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.120 
um you know it's built right into the
radiator<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.689> whole<00:01:48.720> thing<00:01:49.130> will

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
radiator and this the whole thing will

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.380 
radiator and this the whole thing will
turn<00:01:51.979> counterclockwise<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> left<00:01:54.090> about

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
turn counterclockwise to the left about

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.170 
turn counterclockwise to the left about
a<00:01:54.450> quarter<00:01:54.780> turn<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.700> in<00:01:56.700> other<00:01:56.969> words

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
a quarter turn and that in other words

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.969

them back in and they like they'll turn
about<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> quarter<00:02:09.599> turn<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.140> lock<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.069> in

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
about a quarter turn and lock it in

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.399 
about a quarter turn and lock it in
place

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
this is like the top of the Raider

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.399 
this is like the top of the Raider
itself<00:02:22.819> this<00:02:23.030> little<00:02:23.299> circle<00:02:23.749> in<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.170> middle

itself this little circle in the middle

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.160 
itself this little circle in the middle
and<00:02:24.590> this<00:02:25.549> whole<00:02:25.849> thing<00:02:26.150> holes<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.659> in<00:02:26.840> place

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
other words you turn it this way

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.399 
other words you turn it this way
counterclockwise<00:02:34.579> about<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.420> quarter<00:02:36.349> of

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
counterclockwise about a quarter of

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.069 
counterclockwise about a quarter of
return<00:02:36.769> and<00:02:37.060> then<00:02:38.060> if<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.299> thing<00:02:38.540> comes<00:02:38.840> out

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
return and then if the thing comes out

return and then if the thing comes out
you<00:02:40.010> push<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.400> Raider<00:02:40.579> up<00:02:40.939> there'll<00:02:41.209> be<00:02:41.239> like

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
you push the Raider up there'll be like

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.539 
you push the Raider up there'll be like
a<00:02:41.510> big<00:02:41.780> hole<00:02:42.079> you<00:02:42.409> know<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:42.919> a<00:02:43.040> frame<00:02:43.340> right

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
a big hole you know and a frame right

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.159 
a big hole you know and a frame right
here<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:43.969> you<00:02:44.060> put<00:02:44.239> these<00:02:44.389> things<00:02:44.689> back<00:02:44.930> on

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:45.169 
here then you put these things back on

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.530 
here then you put these things back on
you<00:02:45.500> just<00:02:45.650> put<00:02:45.919> it<00:02:46.069> this<00:02:46.489> way<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.150> turn<00:02:47.359> it

you just put it this way and you turn it

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.470 
you just put it this way and you turn it
this<00:02:47.659> way<00:02:47.719> and<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.109> locks<00:02:48.319> it<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.650> place<00:02:49.480> it's

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
this way and it locks it in place it's

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.909 
this way and it locks it in place it's
kind<00:02:50.659> of<00:02:50.719> a<00:02:50.810> simple<00:02:51.109> thing<00:02:53.560> as<00:02:54.939> far<00:02:55.939> as<00:02:56.919> the

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
kind of a simple thing as far as the

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.000 
kind of a simple thing as far as the
motor<00:02:58.159> mounts<00:02:59.109> this<00:03:00.109> is<00:03:00.290> what<00:03:00.439> I<00:03:00.469> did<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:00.919> the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
motor mounts this is what I did to the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.949 
motor mounts this is what I did to the
motor<00:03:01.189> mount<00:03:01.459> itself<00:03:01.939> this<00:03:02.389> may<00:03:02.629> be<00:03:02.689> not<00:03:02.930> a

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
motor mount itself this may be not a

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.920 
motor mount itself this may be not a
perfectly<00:03:03.500> clear<00:03:03.739> picture<00:03:04.189> what<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.519> did<00:03:04.879> was<00:03:05.750> I

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
perfectly clear picture what I did was I

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.629 
perfectly clear picture what I did was I
filled<00:03:06.230> them<00:03:06.379> up<00:03:06.530> with<00:03:06.590> urethane<00:03:07.719> weather<00:03:08.719> um

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
filled them up with urethane weather um

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.610 
filled them up with urethane weather um
urethane<00:03:10.639> windshield<00:03:11.299> adhesive<00:03:12.139> what

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
urethane windshield adhesive what

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.649 
urethane windshield adhesive what
urethane<00:03:13.280> windshield<00:03:13.819> adhesive<00:03:14.389> and<00:03:14.510> there's

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
urethane windshield adhesive and there's

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.280 
urethane windshield adhesive and there's
a<00:03:14.750> reason<00:03:15.169> for<00:03:15.199> that<00:03:15.500> because<00:03:15.739> these<00:03:16.699> mounts

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
a reason for that because these mounts

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.490 
a reason for that because these mounts
typically<00:03:18.290> break<00:03:19.150> they're<00:03:20.150> too<00:03:20.299> soft<00:03:20.599> and<00:03:21.019> you

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
typically break they're too soft and you

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.140 
typically break they're too soft and you
know<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.739> factory<00:03:22.159> has<00:03:22.310> in<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:22.489> way<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:22.819> the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
know the factory has in that way so the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.330 
know the factory has in that way so the
engine<00:03:23.449> state<00:03:24.199> stage<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.709> little<00:03:24.949> bit<00:03:25.129> more

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
engine state stage a little bit more

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.819 
engine state stage a little bit more
steady<00:03:25.699> in<00:03:25.879> the<00:03:25.909> car<00:03:26.239> but<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.169> can't<00:03:27.500> tell<00:03:27.650> the

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
steady in the car but I can't tell the

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.300 
steady in the car but I can't tell the
difference<00:03:28.220> but<00:03:28.459> when<00:03:28.639> I<00:03:28.669> did<00:03:28.909> this<00:03:29.239> arm<00:03:30.310> these

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
difference but when I did this arm these

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.920 
difference but when I did this arm these
things<00:03:31.639> are<00:03:31.790> like<00:03:31.909> one<00:03:32.180> piece<00:03:32.479> of<00:03:32.689> solid

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
things are like one piece of solid

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.589 
things are like one piece of solid
rubber<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:34.220> there's<00:03:34.579> two<00:03:34.759> in<00:03:34.909> searches<00:03:35.419> one

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
rubber and there's two in searches one

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.629 
rubber and there's two in searches one
on<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.840> front<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.530> one<00:03:36.949> on<00:03:36.979> the<00:03:37.189> rear<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
on the front and one on the rear of the

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.610 
on the front and one on the rear of the
cradle<00:03:37.909> and<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.780> have<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.049> hammer<00:03:39.259> them<00:03:39.439> out

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
cradle and you have to hammer them out

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.740 
cradle and you have to hammer them out
arm<00:03:41.979> here's<00:03:42.979> a<00:03:43.069> close-up<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.939> it<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.239> a

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
arm here's a close-up of it of a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.119 
arm here's a close-up of it of a
replacement<00:03:45.530> part

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
replacement part

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.770 
replacement part
so<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.549> notice<00:03:46.879> they're<00:03:47.030> all<00:03:47.090> hollowed<00:03:47.629> out

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
so you notice they're all hollowed out

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.939 
so you notice they're all hollowed out
right<00:03:48.169> and<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:50.000> what<00:03:50.389> I<00:03:50.419> did<00:03:50.689> was<00:03:51.049> I<00:03:51.290> use<00:03:51.620> brake

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
right and so what I did was I use brake

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.580 
right and so what I did was I use brake
cleaner<00:03:51.979> clean<00:03:52.790> this<00:03:52.939> up<00:03:53.150> really<00:03:53.389> good<00:03:53.689> let<00:03:54.470> it

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
cleaner clean this up really good let it

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.439 
cleaner clean this up really good let it
dry<00:03:54.829> after<00:03:55.159> it<00:03:55.400> dries<00:03:55.669> clean<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.180> up<00:03:56.269> really

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
dry after it dries clean it up really

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:57.939 
dry after it dries clean it up really
good<00:03:56.689> so<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.930> rubbers<00:03:57.259> like<00:03:57.319> chemically

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:57.949 
good so the rubbers like chemically

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.509 
good so the rubbers like chemically
clean<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:59.469> then<00:04:00.469> I'd<00:04:00.799> fill<00:04:01.099> this<00:04:01.219> up<00:04:01.459> with

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.449 
clean and then I'd fill this up with
urethane<00:04:02.389> windshield<00:04:03.019> adhesive<00:04:03.739> then<00:04:04.159> let<00:04:04.340> it

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
urethane windshield adhesive then let it

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.580 
urethane windshield adhesive then let it
dry<00:04:04.699> for<00:04:04.729> a<00:04:05.090> couple<00:04:05.120> days<00:04:05.569> and<00:04:06.169> then<00:04:06.290> it's<00:04:06.439> like

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
dry for a couple days and then it's like

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.949 
dry for a couple days and then it's like
one<00:04:06.799> piece<00:04:07.099> of<00:04:07.159> solid<00:04:07.819> rubber<00:04:08.239> because

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
one piece of solid rubber because

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.689 
one piece of solid rubber because
typically<00:04:09.560> what<00:04:09.709> happens<00:04:09.739> is<00:04:10.189> these<00:04:10.430> things

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
typically what happens is these things

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.909 
typically what happens is these things
all<00:04:10.849> like<00:04:11.359> break<00:04:11.780> inside<00:04:12.289> and<00:04:12.680> they<00:04:12.739> don't

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
what a lot of times on that cradle

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.420 
what a lot of times on that cradle
itself<00:05:03.330> where<00:05:03.570> this<00:05:03.660> goes<00:05:03.960> in<00:05:04.230> I'll<00:05:04.410> file<00:05:05.220> the

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
itself where this goes in I'll file the

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.180 
itself where this goes in I'll file the
edge<00:05:05.670> of<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.600> metal<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.800> there's<00:05:08.040> like<00:05:08.160> a

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
edge of the metal so there's like a

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.360 
edge of the metal so there's like a
little<00:05:08.430> bit<00:05:08.640> of<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:09.380> taper<00:05:10.380> going<00:05:11.010> inward<00:05:11.340> and

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
little bit of a taper going inward and

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.090 
little bit of a taper going inward and
that<00:05:12.030> helps<00:05:12.360> to<00:05:12.510> start<00:05:12.900> this<00:05:13.140> a<00:05:13.410> lot<00:05:13.710> easier

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
that helps to start this a lot easier

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.120 
that helps to start this a lot easier
that<00:05:14.730> that's<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.300> little<00:05:15.390> trick<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:15.960> arm<00:05:16.290> and

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
that that's a little trick to arm and

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.000 
that that's a little trick to arm and
the<00:05:17.520> stuff<00:05:17.910> I<00:05:18.120> used<00:05:18.450> was<00:05:19.260> this<00:05:19.470> junk<00:05:19.770> right

people that review their cars so they

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.460 
people that review their cars so they
make<00:05:53.160> them<00:05:53.310> too<00:05:53.490> soft<00:05:53.880> so<00:05:54.240> the<00:05:54.360> car<00:05:54.600> seems<00:05:55.260> like

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
make them too soft so the car seems like

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.140 
make them too soft so the car seems like
it's<00:05:55.650> smoother<00:05:56.160> but<00:05:56.600> it's<00:05:58.400> to<00:05:59.400> me<00:05:59.550> it's<00:05:59.790> not<00:06:00.090> a

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
it's smoother but it's to me it's not a

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.930 
it's smoother but it's to me it's not a
very<00:06:00.780> good<00:06:01.020> way<00:06:01.260> doing<00:06:01.680> things<00:06:01.950> but<00:06:02.250> that's

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
very good way doing things but that's

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.030 
very good way doing things but that's
just<00:06:03.300> how<00:06:03.480> it<00:06:03.600> works<00:06:06.290> but<00:06:07.290> yeah<00:06:07.530> this<00:06:07.800> is<00:06:07.890> how<00:06:08.010> I

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
just how it works but yeah this is how I

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.290 
just how it works but yeah this is how I
filled<00:06:08.400> it<00:06:08.580> up<00:06:08.700> and<00:06:09.000> you<00:06:09.060> know<00:06:09.180> I've<00:06:09.240> just

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.330 
filled it up and you know I've just
filled<00:06:09.630> it<00:06:09.780> up<00:06:09.870> solid<00:06:10.500> it's<00:06:10.650> one<00:06:10.860> solid<00:06:11.310> piece

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
filled it up solid it's one solid piece

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.290 
filled it up solid it's one solid piece
of<00:06:11.520> rubber<00:06:11.910> and<00:06:12.120> urethane<00:06:12.720> and<00:06:13.700> they<00:06:14.700> were<00:06:14.910> not

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
of rubber and urethane and they were not

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.510 
of rubber and urethane and they were not
going<00:06:15.450> to<00:06:15.540> break<00:06:15.750> any<00:06:16.020> more<00:06:16.050> so<00:06:16.470> that's<00:06:16.620> a<00:06:16.800> that

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
going to break any more so that's a that

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.150 
going to break any more so that's a that
is<00:06:17.640> a<00:06:17.669> little<00:06:18.030> tip<00:06:18.300> um<00:06:18.570> that<00:06:19.500> I<00:06:19.530> did<00:06:19.710> on<00:06:19.740> the<00:06:19.919> car

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
is a little tip um that I did on the car

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.159 
is a little tip um that I did on the car
sorry<00:06:20.640> I<00:06:20.700> didn't<00:06:20.910> couldn't<00:06:21.120> show<00:06:21.390> like<00:06:21.690> what<00:06:21.930> I

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
sorry I didn't couldn't show like what I

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.020 
sorry I didn't couldn't show like what I
did<00:06:22.530> as<00:06:22.740> I<00:06:22.919> changed<00:06:23.310> it<00:06:23.460> but<00:06:23.669> this<00:06:23.820> is<00:06:24.000> really

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
did as I changed it but this is really

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.700 
did as I changed it but this is really
the<00:06:24.360> tip<00:06:25.140> itself<00:06:25.650> of<00:06:25.950> how<00:06:26.820> a<00:06:27.300> very<00:06:27.960> good<00:06:28.200> idea<00:06:28.350> I

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
the tip itself of how a very good idea I

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.520 
the tip itself of how a very good idea I
think<00:06:29.010> and<00:06:29.690> they'll<00:06:30.690> probably<00:06:30.900> never<00:06:31.200> break

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
think and they'll probably never break

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.860 
think and they'll probably never break
again
