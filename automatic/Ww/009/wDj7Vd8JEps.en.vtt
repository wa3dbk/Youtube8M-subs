a Lafitte this 300 watt inverter and I'm

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.470 
a Lafitte this 300 watt inverter and I'm
just<00:00:13.920> going<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.130> put<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.480> just<00:00:16.730> here<00:00:18.529> just<00:00:20.480> so

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
just going to put it just here just so

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.730 
just going to put it just here just so
it's<00:00:21.630> accessible<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.840> I'm<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> also

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
it's accessible and I'm going to also

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.400 
it's accessible and I'm going to also
watch<00:00:26.279> I'm<00:00:26.490> doing<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.910> I'm<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> make

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
watch I'm doing this I'm going to make

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.620 
watch I'm doing this I'm going to make
it<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:30.349> car<00:00:31.349> stereo<00:00:31.940> the<00:00:32.940> interior<00:00:33.360> lights

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
it so the car stereo the interior lights

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.060 
it so the car stereo the interior lights
and<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:36.680> 12-volt<00:00:37.879> sockets<00:00:39.320> all<00:00:40.320> work<00:00:40.680> off<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and the 12-volt sockets all work off the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.920 
and the 12-volt sockets all work off the
laser<00:00:41.250> battery<00:00:41.760> rather<00:00:42.420> than<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> car

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
laser battery rather than the car

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.150 
laser battery rather than the car
battery<00:00:44.090> so<00:00:45.090> I'm<00:00:45.510> going

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
battery so I'm going

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.500 
battery so I'm going
sure<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.280> how<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:48.739> um<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:51.210> fit<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
sure you how to do that um to fit the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.010 
sure you how to do that um to fit the
inverter<00:00:51.809> I'm<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> use<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:53.750> thick<00:00:54.750> a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.940 
stuff hey so first job is to run this
thick<00:01:15.930> red<00:01:16.590> wire<00:01:16.619> from<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.670> laser<00:01:17.939> battery

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
thick red wire from the laser battery

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.730 
thick red wire from the laser battery
through<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> bulkhead<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:21.290> get<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
through the bulkhead and get it to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.460 
through the bulkhead and get it to
roughly<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.430> position<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.939> want<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.470> so

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
roughly the position I want it in so

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.780 
roughly the position I want it in so
I'll<00:01:25.560> start<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.340> bring<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.759> back

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
I'll start on that and bring you back

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.560 
I'll start on that and bring you back
once<00:01:27.210> I've<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:27.720> got<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:30.150> your<00:01:30.360> ass

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
once I've there got it going so your ass

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600 
once I've there got it going so your ass
is<00:01:30.780> wire<00:01:31.040> roughly<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.130> position

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
is wire roughly in position

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.600 
is wire roughly in position
really<00:01:33.450> obviously<00:01:34.049> cable<00:01:34.409> tie<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.650> up<00:01:34.860> once

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
really obviously cable tie it up once

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.200 
really obviously cable tie it up once
I've<00:01:35.759> got<00:01:36.000> my<00:01:36.229> connections<00:01:37.229> done<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:38.210> rely

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
I've got my connections done I rely

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.870 
I've got my connections done I rely
should<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.570> disconnected<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.290> batteries

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
should have disconnected the batteries

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.899 
should have disconnected the batteries
so<00:01:41.880> I'm<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.509> next<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.909> start

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
so I'm going to do that next to start

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.270 
so I'm going to do that next to start
messing<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.299> their<00:01:45.799> actual<00:01:46.799> electrical

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
messing with their actual electrical

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.990 
messing with their actual electrical
connections

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
connections

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.139 
connections
um<00:01:49.220> for<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.340> stage<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.759> wasn't<00:01:51.030> actually

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
um for this stage I wasn't actually

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.420 
um for this stage I wasn't actually
messing<00:01:51.600> with<00:01:51.630> connections<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.340> on

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
messing with connections but to be on

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.649 
messing with connections but to be on
the<00:01:53.520> safe<00:01:53.700> side<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.090> always<00:01:54.329> best<00:01:54.570> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the safe side is always best to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.380 
the safe side is always best to
disconnect<00:01:55.439> your<00:01:55.619> batteries<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:57.030> I've<00:01:57.180> got

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
disconnect your batteries so I've got

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.830 
disconnect your batteries so I've got
this<00:01:57.509> wire<00:01:57.829> I've<00:01:58.829> got<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> fuse<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:00.030> needs<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
this wire I've got a fuse that needs to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.280 
this wire I've got a fuse that needs to
go<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:02.030> heavy-duty<00:02:03.030> fuse<00:02:03.570> that's<00:02:04.079> in

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
go on here a heavy-duty fuse that's in

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.330 
go on here a heavy-duty fuse that's in
this<00:02:04.439> box<00:02:04.649> somewhere

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.090 

find<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:11.520> then<00:02:11.720> fuse<00:02:12.720> will<00:02:13.590> go<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.800> there

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
find that and then fuse will go to there

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.170 
find that and then fuse will go to there
and<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.580> will<00:02:14.730> connect<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.150> your

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
and then that will connect to your

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.410 
and then that will connect to your
positive<00:02:15.750> wire<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:17.220> then<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.520> goes<00:02:17.819> follow

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
positive wire and then this goes follow

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.150 
positive wire and then this goes follow
along<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:20.310> hopefully<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.180> see<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.450> there

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
along and hopefully you can see it there

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.479 
along and hopefully you can see it there
just<00:02:23.160> goes<00:02:23.400> through<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:24.000> rubber<00:02:24.870> grommet

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
just goes through that rubber grommet

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.620 
just goes through that rubber grommet
there<00:02:26.489> where<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.850> way<00:02:26.970> has<00:02:27.120> already<00:02:27.300> been

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
there where the way has already been

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.380 
there where the way has already been
made<00:02:27.840> at<00:02:28.410> whether<00:02:28.739> we're<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> hole<00:02:29.940> has<00:02:30.060> already

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
made at whether we're a hole has already

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.809 
made at whether we're a hole has already
been<00:02:30.510> made<00:02:30.750> for<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.050> wire<00:02:31.459> okay<00:02:32.459> now<00:02:32.670> I've<00:02:32.790> got

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
been made for the wire okay now I've got

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.290 
been made for the wire okay now I've got
the<00:02:33.030> wire<00:02:33.209> through<00:02:34.010> comes<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.160> under<00:02:35.459> -<00:02:35.790> I've

the wire through comes you under - I've

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.390 
the wire through comes you under - I've
got<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.569> running<00:02:36.720> don't<00:02:37.650> see<00:02:37.830> here<00:02:38.040> he'll<00:02:38.280> be

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
got it running don't see here he'll be

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.979 
got it running don't see here he'll be
tucked<00:02:38.640> under<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.060> trim<00:02:39.330> event<00:02:39.630> Roy

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
tucked under this trim event Roy

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.310 
tucked under this trim event Roy
yeah<00:02:40.560> well<00:02:41.190> eventually<00:02:41.640> -<00:02:41.790> Lee<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:41.970> mean<00:02:42.320> and

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
yeah well eventually - Lee I mean and

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.770 
yeah well eventually - Lee I mean and
then<00:02:43.769> it's<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.160> run<00:02:44.340> along<00:02:44.459> here<00:02:44.910> where

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
then it's going to run along here where

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.370 
then it's going to run along here where
the<00:02:45.930> rest<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.350> these<00:02:46.470> wires<00:02:46.800> are<00:02:46.950> running<00:02:47.340> and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
the rest of these wires are running and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.290 
the rest of these wires are running and
then<00:02:50.209> back<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.750> here<00:02:52.850> which<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:53.880> where<00:02:54.180> I'm

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
then back to here which is where I'm

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.180 
then back to here which is where I'm
going<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.510> make<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.959> inverter<00:02:56.750> just<00:02:57.750> there

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
going to make the inverter just there

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.050 
going to make the inverter just there
before<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.370> I'm<00:02:59.489> going<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.730> make<00:02:59.850> this

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
before that I'm going to make this

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.000 
before that I'm going to make this
single<00:03:00.900> bus<00:03:01.080> for<00:03:01.560> we<00:03:01.739> fuse<00:03:02.670> box<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.680> fat

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
single bus for we fuse box so the fat

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.350 
single bus for we fuse box so the fat
wire<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.370> going<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.640> come<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.090> bottom

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
wire is going to come in to the bottom

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.990 
wire is going to come in to the bottom
of<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.810> then<00:03:07.739> I'm<00:03:08.160> going<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.370> take<00:03:08.580> three

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
of this and then I'm going to take three

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.720 
of this and then I'm going to take three
smaller<00:03:09.569> ones<00:03:09.930> off<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:11.160> go<00:03:12.090> back<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:13.730> fuse

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
smaller ones off to go back to the fuse

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.690 
smaller ones off to go back to the fuse
box<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.510> fuse<00:03:15.930> box<00:03:16.079> of<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.440> van<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.610> I'll

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
box the fuse box of the van and I'll

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.380 
box the fuse box of the van and I'll
show<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.180> Y<00:03:18.480> after<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.170> then<00:03:20.160> one<00:03:20.459> is

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
show you the Y after and then one is

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.990 
show you the Y after and then one is
going<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.750> be<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.870> fat<00:03:22.110> wire<00:03:22.320> that<00:03:23.100> comes<00:03:23.340> off<00:03:23.640> to

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
going to be a fat wire that comes off to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.690 
going to be a fat wire that comes off to
go<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.420> inverter<00:03:25.310> so<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.340> get<00:03:26.549> these

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
go to the inverter so I get these

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.440 
go to the inverter so I get these
mounted<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.420> then<00:03:27.900> I'll<00:03:28.140> bring<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.470> back

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
mounted and then I'll bring you back

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.330 
mounted and then I'll bring you back
okay<00:03:30.450> that's<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.900> inverter<00:03:31.470> mounted<00:03:31.890> here<00:03:32.100> I

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
okay that's the inverter mounted here I

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.560 
okay that's the inverter mounted here I
had<00:03:33.150> talked<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.510> cover<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:33.989> with<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:35.570> heat

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
had talked to cover this with the heat

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.920 
had talked to cover this with the heat
shrink<00:03:36.720> tape<00:03:37.260> or<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.130> can't<00:03:38.640> remember<00:03:39.090> not

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
shrink tape or you can't remember not

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.289 
shrink tape or you can't remember not
enough<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.350> do<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:41.760> that's<00:03:41.910> oh<00:03:42.090> she's

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
enough to do it and that's oh she's

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.170 
enough to do it and that's oh she's
watching<00:03:42.750> that's<00:03:43.049> our<00:03:43.260> next<00:03:44.040> job<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:44.910> just

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
watching that's our next job this just

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.410 
watching that's our next job this just
gets<00:03:45.390> wires<00:03:45.989> hooked<00:03:46.260> up<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.880> I'll<00:03:47.970> get<00:03:48.150> on<00:03:48.269> with

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
gets wires hooked up so I'll get on with

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.259 
gets wires hooked up so I'll get on with
that<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:50.010> now<00:03:50.040> we've<00:03:50.280> got<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.579> done<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:51.060> want

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
that so now we've got that done I want

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.130 
that so now we've got that done I want
to<00:03:51.359> move<00:03:51.510> on<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.829> van<00:03:53.040> fuse<00:03:53.370> box<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:54.140> pull

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
to move on to the van fuse box and pull

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.819 
to move on to the van fuse box and pull
the<00:03:55.260> fuses<00:03:55.680> for<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.400> things<00:03:57.109> for<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.200> items

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
the fuses for the things for the items

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.720 
the fuses for the things for the items
we're<00:03:59.400> going<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.000> run<00:04:00.750> off<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.019> later<00:04:01.200> battery

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
we're going to run off the later battery

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.340 
we're going to run off the later battery
so<00:04:02.730> we'll<00:04:03.060> start<00:04:03.269> with<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.570> first<00:04:03.750> one<00:04:04.049> which

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
so we'll start with the first one which

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.910 
so we'll start with the first one which
is<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.829> car<00:04:05.310> stereo<00:04:06.230> and<00:04:07.230> there<00:04:07.350> is<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.500> fuse

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
is the car stereo and there is a fuse

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.330 
is the car stereo and there is a fuse
removal<00:04:08.370> -<00:04:08.579> which<00:04:08.820> is<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.209> O<00:04:09.239> button<00:04:09.540> so

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
removal - which is the O button so

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:18.879 
removal - which is the O button so
absolutely<00:04:16.180> say<00:04:17.180> it<00:04:18.109> doesn't<00:04:18.350> get<00:04:18.590> it<00:04:18.650> very

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
absolutely say it doesn't get it very

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.000 
absolutely say it doesn't get it very
well<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:21.079> just<00:04:21.470> use<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.680> pair<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.400> pliers

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
well so I just use a pair of pliers

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.750 
well so I just use a pair of pliers
needlenose<00:04:25.010> pliers

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
needlenose pliers

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.340 
needlenose pliers
so<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.419> car<00:04:26.720> stereo<00:04:26.990> is<00:04:28.150> run<00:04:29.150> off<00:04:29.889> this<00:04:30.889> fuse

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
so the car stereo is run off this fuse

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.320 
so the car stereo is run off this fuse
so<00:04:33.350> we<00:04:33.440> pull<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.130> with<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.620> small

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
so we pull that and with the small

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.020 
so we pull that and with the small
connectors<00:04:38.330> we<00:04:38.480> got<00:04:39.400> just<00:04:40.400> put<00:04:40.550> these<00:04:40.669> on<00:04:40.880> the

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
connectors we got just put these on the

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.230 
connectors we got just put these on the
wires<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.690> heat<00:04:42.139> shrink<00:04:42.410> tube<00:04:42.650> on<00:04:42.830> them<00:04:43.240> put

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
wires and heat shrink tube on them put

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.390 
wires and heat shrink tube on them put
that<00:04:44.479> into<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.940> floor<00:04:46.940> of<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.810> two<00:04:48.500> pins<00:04:48.860> from

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
that into the floor of the two pins from

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.150 
that into the floor of the two pins from
the<00:04:49.580> fuse<00:04:49.820> with<00:04:50.000> just<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.330> go<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:50.990> just<00:04:51.979> leave

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
the fuse with just to go and just leave

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.030 
the fuse with just to go and just leave
the<00:04:52.340> fuse<00:04:52.580> out<00:04:52.790> this<00:04:53.540> wire<00:04:53.840> then<00:04:54.110> runs<00:04:54.470> back<00:04:54.740> to

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
the fuse out this wire then runs back to

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.570 
the fuse out this wire then runs back to
the<00:04:55.070> year<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.960> way<00:04:57.169> will<00:04:57.470> then<00:04:57.620> run<00:04:58.130> back<00:04:58.370> to

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
the year this way will then run back to

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.120 
the year this way will then run back to
the<00:04:58.700> fuse<00:04:58.940> box<00:04:59.030> or<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.200> fuses<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:00.620> we<00:05:00.889> just

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
the fuse box or the fuses that we just

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.000 
the fuse box or the fuses that we just
fitted<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.870> we<00:05:02.990> do<00:05:03.139> that<00:05:03.350> for<00:05:03.620> each<00:05:03.680> of<00:05:03.919> the

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
fitted so we do that for each of the

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.409 
fitted so we do that for each of the
items<00:05:04.130> so<00:05:04.639> it's<00:05:04.760> going<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.000> be<00:05:05.229> stereo<00:05:06.229> and

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
items so it's going to be stereo and

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:14.500 
items so it's going to be stereo and
then<00:05:08.710> ink<00:05:09.710> it<00:05:09.919> so<00:05:10.870> these<00:05:11.870> ones<00:05:12.139> here<00:05:13.360> okay<00:05:14.360> out

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
then ink it so these ones here okay out

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.029 
then ink it so these ones here okay out
of<00:05:14.539> shape<00:05:14.900> and<00:05:15.650> it<00:05:15.950> seems<00:05:16.190> that<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:18.039> stereo

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
of shape and it seems that the stereo

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.980 
of shape and it seems that the stereo
and<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.640> interior<00:05:19.880> i'ts<00:05:20.350> Raftis<00:05:21.430> frost<00:05:22.430> fuse

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
and the interior i'ts Raftis frost fuse

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.190 
and the interior i'ts Raftis frost fuse
so<00:05:23.990> that's<00:05:24.169> going<00:05:24.500> to<00:05:24.560> make<00:05:25.039> it<00:05:25.070> less<00:05:25.400> work<00:05:25.669> and

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
so that's going to make it less work and

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.750 
so that's going to make it less work and
the<00:05:27.200> power<00:05:27.680> sockets<00:05:28.660> run<00:05:29.660> off<00:05:29.810> this<00:05:30.080> infuse<00:05:30.830> so

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
the power sockets run off this infuse so

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.480 
the power sockets run off this infuse so
I'm<00:05:31.820> going<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.000> pull<00:05:32.210> that<00:05:32.419> then<00:05:33.340> there<00:05:34.340> will

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
I'm going to pull that then there will

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.520 
I'm going to pull that then there will
be<00:05:34.550> just<00:05:34.940> two<00:05:35.240> hours<00:05:35.419> I<00:05:35.690> need<00:05:35.720> to<00:05:35.870> run<00:05:36.169> to<00:05:36.410> the

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
be just two hours I need to run to the

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.680 
be just two hours I need to run to the
back<00:05:36.710> so<00:05:37.010> that's<00:05:37.789> good<00:05:38.090> because<00:05:38.240> it<00:05:38.450> will<00:05:38.510> give

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
back so that's good because it will give

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.529 
back so that's good because it will give
me<00:05:38.810> an<00:05:38.930> extra<00:05:39.260> fuse<00:05:39.800> point<00:05:40.100> in<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.430> rear<00:05:40.639> for

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
me an extra fuse point in the rear for

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.680 
me an extra fuse point in the rear for
putting<00:05:42.260> there<00:05:42.820> more<00:05:43.820> lighting<00:05:44.300> in<00:05:44.450> the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
putting there more lighting in the

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.650 
putting there more lighting in the
cupboards<00:05:45.050> later<00:05:45.320> on<00:05:47.919> okay<00:05:48.919> that's<00:05:49.160> all<00:05:49.430> the

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
cupboards later on okay that's all the

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.920 
cupboards later on okay that's all the
wires<00:05:50.660> now<00:05:50.870> hooked<00:05:51.169> up<00:05:51.440> to<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:52.580> fuse<00:05:52.880> box

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
wires now hooked up to the fuse box

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.420 
wires now hooked up to the fuse box
still<00:05:53.930> going<00:05:54.110> to<00:05:54.169> run<00:05:54.580> enough<00:05:55.580> wire<00:05:55.970> for<00:05:56.360> the

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
still going to run enough wire for the

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.670 
still going to run enough wire for the
inverter<00:05:58.630> so<00:05:59.630> all<00:05:59.690> their<00:05:59.870> wires<00:06:00.080> just<00:06:00.380> run

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
inverter so all their wires just run

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.129 
inverter so all their wires just run
under<00:06:01.280> there<00:06:01.490> so<00:06:02.360> I'm<00:06:02.419> going<00:06:02.539> to<00:06:02.630> tuck<00:06:02.780> them<00:06:02.990> in

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
under there so I'm going to tuck them in

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.350 
under there so I'm going to tuck them in
and

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.020 

let's<00:06:07.360> hear<00:06:07.570> around<00:06:07.930> to<00:06:08.169> the<00:06:08.230> bottom<00:06:09.030> the

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
let's hear around to the bottom the

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.520 
let's hear around to the bottom the
bottom<00:06:10.210> pins<00:06:10.830> and<00:06:11.830> the<00:06:12.190> fuse<00:06:12.400> box<00:06:13.200> the<00:06:14.200> bonnet

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
bottom pins and the fuse box the bonnet

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.020 
bottom pins and the fuse box the bonnet
still<00:06:15.280> got<00:06:15.430> a<00:06:15.460> cable<00:06:16.060> tie<00:06:16.270> this<00:06:16.330> -<00:06:16.780> red<00:06:17.139> wire<00:06:17.350> up

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
still got a cable tie this - red wire up

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.330 
still got a cable tie this - red wire up
just<00:06:19.030> dab<00:06:19.300> the<00:06:20.730> fuse<00:06:21.750> holder<00:06:22.800> for<00:06:23.800> the<00:06:23.889> 30<00:06:24.130> amp

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
just dab the fuse holder for the 30 amp

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.840 
just dab the fuse holder for the 30 amp
fuse<00:06:24.730> and<00:06:27.150> get<00:06:28.150> that<00:06:28.330> all<00:06:28.780> connected<00:06:29.410> up<00:06:29.530> and

fuse and get that all connected up and

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.520 
fuse and get that all connected up and
then<00:06:30.850> check<00:06:31.889> check<00:06:32.889> everything<00:06:33.340> works<00:06:34.530> that's

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
then check check everything works that's

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.170 
then check check everything works that's
the<00:06:35.650> way<00:06:35.800> under<00:06:36.190> the<00:06:36.280> bonnet<00:06:36.490> all<00:06:36.700> hooked<00:06:36.940> up

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
the way under the bonnet all hooked up

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.940 
the way under the bonnet all hooked up
now<00:06:37.530> just<00:06:38.530> as<00:06:38.770> a<00:06:38.800> stock<00:06:39.190> pour<00:06:39.490> in<00:06:39.639> there<00:06:39.790> and<00:06:40.000> so

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
now just as a stock pour in there and so

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:47.580 
now just as a stock pour in there and so
hopefully<00:06:41.950> I<00:06:42.070> can<00:06:42.100> shut<00:06:42.669> this<00:06:42.820> bonnet<00:06:46.590> that's

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
hopefully I can shut this bonnet that's

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.290 
hopefully I can shut this bonnet that's
it<00:06:47.800> and<00:06:48.010> see<00:06:48.270> in<00:06:49.270> the<00:06:49.540> hoop<00:06:50.110> top

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.000 
it and see in the hoop top
on<00:06:51.720> the<00:06:52.050> work<00:06:52.590> in<00:06:52.800> the

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.010 
on the work in the

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.650 
on the work in the
stereo<00:06:55.940> and<00:06:56.380> the<00:06:57.460> power<00:06:58.460> socket<00:06:58.760> and<00:06:59.090> interior

stereo and the power socket and interior
lights<00:06:59.840> are<00:07:00.140> working<00:07:00.380> though<00:07:00.740> nothing<00:07:01.730> was

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
lights are working though nothing was

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.270 
lights are working though nothing was
working<00:07:02.090> when<00:07:02.390> I<00:07:02.420> first<00:07:02.690> tried<00:07:02.870> that<00:07:03.170> it<00:07:04.100> was

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
working when I first tried that it was

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.280 
working when I first tried that it was
because<00:07:04.670> the<00:07:04.880> laser<00:07:05.150> battery<00:07:05.660> was<00:07:05.870> totally

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
because the laser battery was totally

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.370 
because the laser battery was totally
flat<00:07:06.560> oh<00:07:06.910> one<00:07:07.910> of<00:07:07.940> the<00:07:08.060> fuses<00:07:08.510> are<00:07:08.540> born<00:07:08.960> on<00:07:09.200> the

flat oh one of the fuses are born on the

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.880 
flat oh one of the fuses are born on the
charging<00:07:10.250> circuit<00:07:10.900> so<00:07:11.900> I<00:07:11.930> obviously<00:07:12.260> hadn't

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:12.890 
charging circuit so I obviously hadn't

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.609 
charging circuit so I obviously hadn't
been<00:07:13.010> getting<00:07:13.100> charged<00:07:13.580> for<00:07:13.640> the<00:07:13.820> world

00:07:15.609 --> 00:07:15.619 
been getting charged for the world

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:17.829 
been getting charged for the world
I'll<00:07:15.859> share<00:07:16.309> a<00:07:16.339> hot<00:07:16.789> date<00:07:17.029> some<00:07:17.269> pale<00:07:17.299> and<00:07:17.689> airy

00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:17.839 
I'll share a hot date some pale and airy

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:22.269 
I'll share a hot date some pale and airy
look<00:07:18.759> everything<00:07:19.759> seems<00:07:20.029> to<00:07:20.119> be<00:07:20.179> working
