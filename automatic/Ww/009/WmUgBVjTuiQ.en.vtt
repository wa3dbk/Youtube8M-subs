00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello guys my name is rushen 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.440
 Boris Viktorovich 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.400
 I am a teacher of the center is he training 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.889
 taiga dot ru 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.990
 and we continue to prepare for you with him 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.750
 mathematics 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.150
 let's solve the following problem vessel 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.510
 cone shaped liquid level 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.000
 liquid reaches half the height 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.369
 equal to 70 milliliters is asked 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.410
 how many milliliters to fill up 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.989
 to completely fill the vessel's Well 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.399
 it is clear that at 1 this vessel is not easy 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.899
 here's a cone like you used to 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:45.930
 it is necessary to turn it as you know these 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:47.730
 thighs at firefighters 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.910
 vessel and he filled 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.360
 filled to half the height that is 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.829
 so here now the fluid reaches 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.079
 such a height 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.070
 but we must remember to remember the formula for 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.990
 cone volume formula is very simple i 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:12.799
 same as for the volume of the pyramid to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:20.119
 volume is equal to one third the area of ​​the base 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:22.860
 to a height that's well let's think here 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.890
 Let's enter some parameters 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:33.180
 let's say that here let the height of the source 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:37.470
 the cone was already and the radius of the base 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.119
 the initial cone is r large then 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.770
 as it is easy to figure well in the first place 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.990
 the height of this little cone 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.530
 how much water will we have right now 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.759
 in half but it's just from the condition yes a 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.470
 radius will obviously also be twice 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.290
 less but simply follows from the fact that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.180
 if you look at the plane 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:03.149
 sections or rather we even question here on 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.590
 such a right triangle then 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.840
 it is obvious that the two here such here 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.450
 right triangles small 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.310
 great like and if they have quality 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.150
 refer as one to two means and 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.170
 other legs too 1 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.110
 The two kazinka therefore radius that will be pi 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.310
 in half here and that means if we 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:29.799
 remember the formulas for the area of ​​a circle 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:31.599
 pi r square here it means that if 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:38.109
 base area of the top 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:44.379
 equals the area of ​​the small base 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:50.379
 will be how many pi r in half squared 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:53.590
 that is pi r squared for four that is, 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.709
 almost means it turns out that from 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.629
 small cone height twice 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.930
 less than a large area 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:10.950
 base 4 times less so from here 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:14.310
 it follows that the volume of a large cone is so 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.900
 as related to the volume of the small cone 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:24.480
 let's share one other piece of volume 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.739
 large cone is one third with our 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.120
 the volume of the small cone is one third from on 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.120
 4 on as much as half 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.870
 what do we get well one third 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.970
 shrinking and shrinking shrinking and 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.489
 these 2 and 4 they will climb in 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.250
 the numerator is not that big 8 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.069
 times more than small really 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.450
 it can be understood that way but this question 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.030
 which in my opinion the school is not very 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.879
 heavily lit but in principle if you 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.660
 remember by planimetry even if you are two 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:08.420
 figures like that their area refers 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.099
 as the square of the coefficient of similarity here in 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.660
 space is only the same area 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.549
 refers the volume does not refer as 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.019
 the square as the cube of the similarity coefficient a 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.620
 easy to understand that these two 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.970
 small big cone they are like friend 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.270
 so the boyfriend could immediately say 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.850
 what time they are two cones of similar height 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.960
 refers to one to two means volume 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.479
 refer as one to eight here but so 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.229
 or else we have found this yes and what 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:41.120
 we are asked to ask us next 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:44.450
 we are given that the volume of the small is equal to 70 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.570
 milliliters asks how much 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.970
 top up to get big yes and this 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.470
 means that we need to add juice 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.510
 need to add the difference between large and 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.550
 small volume but let's watch 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.330
 our we know that the volume is small 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.760
 70 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.220
 so and ask how much to add 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.580
 need to give 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.530
 volume large minus volume small 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.360
 correct because the volume is small 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.580
 already pour we need to pour something else that 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.770
 left to full volume large 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.289
 volume is large from 8 volumes small 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.979
 therefore it turns out that the difference is 7 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:24.560
 small volume well everything means we 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:31.360
 solved the problem because 7 multiply by 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:35.270
 70 we get the answer yes 777 and 749 to 470 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.700
 490 precisely this number and will need 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.220
 write in the answer form 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:44.630
 means again yes yes in essence what we did 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.099
 we said well if they don't pay attention 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.140
 carry calculations in fact we said 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.539
 the next is that we have two cones 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.009
 small large small cone he 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.110
 all parameters are two times less 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.699
 therefore, it is easy to figure out even without 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.520
 calculations that its volume is 8 times smaller 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.199
 But if all linear dimensions are smaller 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.189
 two times the volume is less than 8 times 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:06.740
 so it turns out that we need to top up 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:09.529
 up to a volume which is 8 times more than 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.899
 originally assigned to top up 7 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:14.180
 initial volumes here we are 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:16.669
 felt they got 490 well and then you 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.680
 calculations for those who want neatly 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.279
 all get it without any such 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.169
 speculative reasoning what if 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:27.379
 the figure there is all the parameters twice 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:30.259
 more than that volume more than 8 times all 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.800
 solution the problem is over we write in the form 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:35.930
