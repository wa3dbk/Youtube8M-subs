00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.550
 with the new bmw 7 we have that 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.199
 connected 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.240
 the well-known is proven clearly 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.040
 further developed that means next to the iph 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.750
 controller in our customers already today 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.220
 We also know and love each other 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.050
 In addition, touch skills in the 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.899
 display integrates that means per 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.850
 simple controller touch I can here 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.900
 between the radio channels between the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.550
 tracks or between them 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.949
 navigation data input back and forth 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.900
 change as an extra treat 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.250
 We also have gestik control in 97 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.050
 that means when I join the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.640
 Example would need a call 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.350
 me after the controller or the touch 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.360
 I can touch the display 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.149
 caller in the arrives quite simply with 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.010
 reject a gesture so for example 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.989
 or assume penne gesture 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.789
 Further we can control by gestures 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.590
 also controlling the sound system that is 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.220
 the volume simply steers through 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.179
 this gesture 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.399
 loud or very soft again 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.350
 intuitive and as a free programmer 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.330
 additional guests we have the customer 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.820
 the possibility given to the two 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.630
 guests, for example, the display on and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.729
 off 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.110
 there could also be the home address or there 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.360
 could be the next music track behind 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.920
 but are also hidden touch 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.130
 capabilities integrated into the display 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.410
 that means a simple controller touch 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.640
 i can do this between the radio channels 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.229
 between the tracks or between 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.179
 the navigation data typed out 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.190
 but I can do that 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.979
 call turn comes easy with 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.890
 reject a gesture so for example 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.360
 or continue to accept by gesture 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.709
 we also control the gesture 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.630
 controlling the sound system means that 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.050
 volume controls simply by this 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.980
 gesture 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.770
 loud 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.140
 or again quietly very intuitive and 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.460
 as a free programmer additional gesture 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.370
 We have the opportunity to customers 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.470
 given to the two guests for example 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.510
 the display on and off 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.510
 there could also be the home address or 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.330
 integrated update connecteddrive 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:30.660
 connecteddrive display 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.730
 bring it back down to top of that 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.730
 mean just that can be individual 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:37.700
 Configuration on display Jane 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:54.770
 campion configure casting on the 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.770
 display
