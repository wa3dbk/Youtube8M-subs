00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:18.760

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.349
 milan filiation prefer you them 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.730
 first cars can be realized 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.740
 also on straight hair 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.960
 while for the second it is better 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.880
 to see the curly hair and so for 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.609
 prepare my hair for this hairstyle 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.199
 I slept with my foam roller 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.090
 the john vickers brand 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.400
 You may know them already 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.010
 my previous videos but for those 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.920
 who missed this tutorial I put the links 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.360
 on the screen and so the bar of once 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.399
 I love them because he does not even have my 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 hair and create beautiful curls that 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.420
 last a long time 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.770
 we will start as if we wanted 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.450
 create an African braid the inverted one 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.840
 pass the arms left in the middle by 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.840
 seals 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.580
 we pass the right arms in the middle 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.320
 by two jumps again we go 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.270
 the slab middle left by 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.340
 jumps and then we will complicate our 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.860
 strategy we will pass the arms of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.930
 right in the middle but we'll also the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:20.280
 rolled around the middle slab okay 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.380
 give us a little separate blunder 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.270
 a little hair on the right side he 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.270
 added his middle auburn hair 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.760
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:40.240
 rolled the left branches around the 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.240
 brand from the middle and bring it back to the middle 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.090
 it'll give us a little loop 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.530
 add a little loose hair soon 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.530

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.820
 we bring back right bands in the middle 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.330
 after having enlisted him at the brown docks 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.330

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.459
 and we add a little loose hair 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.459
 from the right sides to his arms 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.580
 we bring back the left-wing brandes to 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.360
 middle after having rolled around the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.360
 middle brand 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.440

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.440
 his arms 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.260

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.710

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.330
 middle if you want you can 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.210
 tie your hair in the middle of your 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.950
 head is created in 2000 union with 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.180

 I love this version of hairstyle 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.910
 today I will continue to trace 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.910
 to the point 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.280
 once all heads of integrated sound 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.470
 in the press I will continue to be 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.540
 and that's without buying loose hair 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.490
 that is to say I will continue to 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.310
 wrap the outer planes around the 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.110
 middle arm suzusho t2 new wick 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.209
 if your hair is much longer 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.560
 that the million at this point you can 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.980
 tie them in a ponytail 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.140
 low or created in a bun I'm going 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.900
 tip stitch with an elastic and 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.459

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.739
 blow of the lacc and this hairstyle is 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.840
 finished but perso I prefer the 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.489
 second version of this hairstyle and 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.769
 so I'm going to relax mattress a little 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.720
 little do we draw on the craft of curling 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.640
 it is now that you will see the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.830
 benefits of seeing curly hair 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.690
 because thanks to loop his thirteen steps 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.260

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.830
 press in a bun 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.930
 you have to create a little race in 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.040
 under the braid and chop them 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.040
