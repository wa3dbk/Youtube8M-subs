why can't I fly there we go so this is

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.440 
why can't I fly there we go so this is
called<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.320> extreme<00:00:31.920> Hills<00:00:32.279> mod<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.239> I

happened<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.690> be<00:02:52.780> right<00:02:52.989> next<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.560> I

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
happened to be right next to it and I

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.320 
happened to be right next to it and I
think<00:02:54.069> that<00:02:54.220> kind<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.489> looks<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.819> coolest<00:02:54.970> of

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
think that kind of looks the coolest of

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.520 
think that kind of looks the coolest of
all<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.569> them<00:02:55.720> just<00:02:55.870> because<00:02:55.989> it's<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.260> jungle

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
all of them just because it's a jungle

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.660 
all of them just because it's a jungle
and<00:02:56.769> that's<00:02:56.890> kind<00:02:57.040> of<00:02:57.069> what<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.250> picture<00:02:57.549> with

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
and that's kind of what you picture with

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.910 
and that's kind of what you picture with
the<00:02:57.730> jungles<00:02:58.090> these<00:02:58.180> massive<00:02:58.569> cliffs<00:02:58.810> so<00:02:59.410> that

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920
