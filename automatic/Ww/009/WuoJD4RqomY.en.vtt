ok<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.360> light<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.720> glowing<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.230> hard<00:02:46.380> disk

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.430 

but<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.310> tablet<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.019> making<00:02:52.019> continuous

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
but the tablet is making continuous

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.009 
but the tablet is making continuous
sounds<00:02:52.829> but<00:02:53.069> I<00:02:53.280> don't<00:02:53.549> think<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.209> capable

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
sounds but I don't think that is capable

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.960 
sounds but I don't think that is capable
of<00:02:55.380> running<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:56.069> hard<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.459> because<00:02:56.489> the

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
of running this hard is because the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.910 
of running this hard is because the
power<00:02:57.660> consumption<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.260> hardest<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.739> much

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
power consumption of a hardest is much

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.559 
power consumption of a hardest is much
greater<00:02:59.099> than<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.819> of<00:02:59.879> a<00:03:00.030> pen<00:03:00.209> drive<00:03:00.299> or<00:03:00.540> a

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
greater than that of a pen drive or a

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.930 
greater than that of a pen drive or a
mouse<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:01.799> don't<00:03:02.160> think<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:02.780> able<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:04.940> run

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
mouse so I don't think it's able to run

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.670 
mouse so I don't think it's able to run
that<00:03:06.060> hard<00:03:06.299> is<00:03:06.480> it's<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:06.780> making<00:03:07.079> continuous

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
that hard is it's just making continuous

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.839 
that hard is it's just making continuous
noises<00:03:08.099> of<00:03:08.220> connection<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.760> disconnection

noises of connection and disconnection

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.270 
noises of connection and disconnection
on<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:10.260> light<00:03:10.410> on<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.680> hardest<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.040> glowing

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
on the light on the hardest is glowing

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.809 
on the light on the hardest is glowing
but<00:03:11.519> no<00:03:11.790> connection<00:03:12.329> ok<00:03:12.959> now<00:03:13.920> let's<00:03:14.250> remove<00:03:14.670> it

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
but no connection ok now let's remove it

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.539 
but no connection ok now let's remove it
so<00:03:15.599> that<00:03:15.989> stab<00:03:16.350> cannot<00:03:16.769> connect<00:03:17.130> person

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
so that stab cannot connect person

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.640 
so that stab cannot connect person
hardest<00:03:18.500> ok

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
hardest ok

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.199

now<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.840> must<00:03:22.230> be<00:03:22.290> thinking<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:23.190> we<00:03:23.819> can<00:03:24.000> use

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
now you must be thinking so we can use

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.970 
now you must be thinking so we can use
the<00:03:24.510> USB<00:03:24.660> capabilities<00:03:25.470> like<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.650> normal

the<00:04:29.729> same<00:04:29.940> time<00:04:30.180> now<00:04:30.900> let's<00:04:31.169> take<00:04:31.620> things<00:04:32.159> a

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
the same time now let's take things a

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.870 
the same time now let's take things a
bit<00:04:32.940> further<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.510> also<00:04:33.810> I<00:04:34.409> am<00:04:34.979> gonna<00:04:35.430> use<00:04:35.490> a

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
bit further and also I am gonna use a

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.290 
bit further and also I am gonna use a
dongle<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.630> with<00:04:37.260> this<00:04:37.500> let's<00:04:38.400> see<00:04:38.580> if<00:04:38.669> it<00:04:39.060> can

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
dongle and with this let's see if it can

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.690 
dongle and with this let's see if it can
use<00:04:39.570> for<00:04:40.020> your<00:04:40.229> throughput<00:04:40.440> ok<00:04:41.280> i've<00:04:41.430> inserted

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
use for your throughput ok i've inserted

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.630 
use for your throughput ok i've inserted

and the mouse cursor is also working at

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.740 
and the mouse cursor is also working at
means<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.860> right<00:05:11.610> now<00:05:11.789> it<00:05:12.030> is<00:05:12.240> supporting

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
means that right now it is supporting

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.830 
means that right now it is supporting
three<00:05:13.140> Pentland<00:05:13.919> USB<00:05:14.550> drives<00:05:14.940> at<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.630> same

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
three Pentland USB drives at the same

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.730 
three Pentland USB drives at the same
time<00:05:16.080> now<00:05:17.070> and<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:17.700> is<00:05:18.180> enough<00:05:18.690> for<00:05:19.020> a<00:05:19.080> normal

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
time now and that is enough for a normal

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.850 
time now and that is enough for a normal
user<00:05:20.099> but<00:05:20.760> but<00:05:21.539> let's<00:05:21.840> take<00:05:22.169> it<00:05:22.380> another<00:05:22.740> step

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
user but but let's take it another step

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.209 
user but but let's take it another step
further<00:05:23.270> it<00:05:24.270> is<00:05:24.479> a<00:05:24.510> cable<00:05:25.020> of<00:05:25.409> a<00:05:25.530> printer<00:05:26.039> I

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
further it is a cable of a printer I

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.670 
further it is a cable of a printer I
actually<00:05:26.520> use<00:05:27.360> under<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:27.990> driver<00:05:28.440> of<00:05:28.560> the

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
actually use under the driver of the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.100 
actually use under the driver of the
printers<00:05:29.039> nor<00:05:29.340> not<00:05:29.909> installed<00:05:30.479> on<00:05:30.690> this<00:05:30.900> thing

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
printers nor not installed on this thing

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.140 
printers nor not installed on this thing
but<00:05:31.590> let's<00:05:31.860> just<00:05:32.099> connect<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.669> see<00:05:32.880> if<00:05:33.000> that

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
but let's just connect and see if that

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.779 
but let's just connect and see if that
it<00:05:33.330> detects<00:05:33.690> new<00:05:34.050> hardware<00:05:34.500> or<00:05:34.620> not<00:05:34.830> this<00:05:35.669> is

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
it detects new hardware or not this is

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.719 
it detects new hardware or not this is
the<00:05:35.820> 4th<00:05:36.330> your<00:05:36.780> support<00:05:37.200> I'm<00:05:37.320> using

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
the 4th your support I'm using

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.409 
the 4th your support I'm using
ok<00:05:38.729> a<00:05:39.060> task<00:05:39.780> in<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.289> fourth<00:05:40.530> pin<00:05:40.830> and<00:05:41.550> now

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
ok a task in the fourth pin and now

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.600 
ok a task in the fourth pin and now
there<00:05:42.719> are<00:05:42.750> four<00:05:43.139> devices<00:05:43.650> cut<00:05:44.039> and<00:05:44.219> connected

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
there are four devices cut and connected

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.779 
there are four devices cut and connected
to<00:05:44.639> the<00:05:46.639> tablet<00:05:48.020> okay<00:05:49.020> looks<00:05:49.289> like<00:05:49.560> like<00:05:50.550> it

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
to the tablet okay looks like like it

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.700 
to the tablet okay looks like like it
hasn't<00:05:51.060> detected<00:05:51.389> the<00:05:52.260> printer<00:05:52.650> itself<00:05:53.039> only

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
hasn't detected the printer itself only

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.640 
hasn't detected the printer itself only
the<00:05:55.710> north<00:05:56.490> any<00:05:57.000> new<00:05:57.240> hardware<00:05:57.599> and<00:05:57.960> using

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
the north any new hardware and using

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.820 
the north any new hardware and using
port<00:05:59.520> has<00:05:59.700> opened<00:06:00.180> so<00:06:00.360> let's<00:06:00.599> just<00:06:00.930> disconnect

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
port has opened so let's just disconnect

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.300 
port has opened so let's just disconnect
that<00:06:02.450> so<00:06:03.450> right<00:06:04.229> now<00:06:04.440> this<00:06:04.710> tablet<00:06:05.190> is

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
that so right now this tablet is

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.500 
that so right now this tablet is
supporting<00:06:05.820> and<00:06:06.110> three<00:06:07.110> USB<00:06:07.680> devices<00:06:08.490> a<00:06:08.849> pen

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
supporting and three USB devices a pen

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.899 
supporting and three USB devices a pen

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909 
drive a mouse under the USB dongle which

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:15.019 
drive a mouse under the USB dongle which
is<00:06:12.090> very<00:06:12.300> good<00:06:12.479> in<00:06:12.599> my<00:06:12.750> thinking<00:06:13.680> it's<00:06:14.610> just<00:06:14.880> a

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
is very good in my thinking it's just a

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:16.399 
is very good in my thinking it's just a
5000<00:06:15.539> to<00:06:15.630> be<00:06:15.750> stopped<00:06:16.020> it

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
5000 to be stopped it

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.200 
5000 to be stopped it
it<00:06:16.800> doesn't<00:06:17.219> have<00:06:17.400> many

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
it doesn't have many

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.970 
it doesn't have many
features<00:06:19.210> but<00:06:19.660> and<00:06:20.050> because<00:06:20.710> of<00:06:20.740> the

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 
features but and because of the

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.940 
features but and because of the
operating<00:06:21.460> system<00:06:21.880> in<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.330> windows<00:06:22.690> it<00:06:23.290> is<00:06:23.530> in

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
are in pinyin USB slots at once which is

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.610 
are in pinyin USB slots at once which is
great<00:06:31.810> the<00:06:32.680> only<00:06:33.610> con<00:06:33.940> I<00:06:33.970> feel<00:06:34.390> of<00:06:34.660> this<00:06:34.990> device

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
great the only con I feel of this device

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.890 
great the only con I feel of this device
is<00:06:35.800> that<00:06:36.040> I<00:06:36.190> cannot<00:06:36.760> charge<00:06:37.210> it<00:06:37.420> while<00:06:37.600> using

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
is that I cannot charge it while using

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.000 
is that I cannot charge it while using
any<00:06:38.230> USB<00:06:38.740> accessory<00:06:39.370> so<00:06:40.270> I<00:06:40.300> thought<00:06:41.290> that<00:06:41.590> is

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
any USB accessory so I thought that is

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.310 
any USB accessory so I thought that is
not<00:06:42.040> a<00:06:42.520> very<00:06:42.850> good<00:06:42.970> thing<00:06:43.270> but<00:06:43.450> you<00:06:43.630> cannot

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
not a very good thing but you cannot

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.440 
not a very good thing but you cannot
accept<00:06:44.650> everything<00:06:45.130> expect<00:06:45.880> everything<00:06:46.240> in

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
accept everything expect everything in
