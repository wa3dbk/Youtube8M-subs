your screen doesn't work properly and if

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.139 
your screen doesn't work properly and if
I<00:01:12.899> try<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.410> to<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> desktop<00:01:14.220> well<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.970> go

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
I try going to the desktop well if I go

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.359 
I try going to the desktop well if I go
to<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> desktop<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.649> screen<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.190> totally

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
to the desktop the screen is totally

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.210 
to the desktop the screen is totally
blank<00:01:17.940> and<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.509> can't<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:19.020> anything<00:01:19.259> anyway

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
blank and I can't do anything anyway

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.070 
blank and I can't do anything anyway
thinking<00:01:20.729> oh<00:01:20.880> maybe<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.509> probably<00:01:21.899> that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
thinking oh maybe this is probably that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.070 
thinking oh maybe this is probably that
Avast<00:01:22.700> Antivirus<00:01:23.700> probably<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.660> really<00:01:24.899> no

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
Avast Antivirus probably but really no

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.930 
Avast Antivirus probably but really no
this<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.530> something<00:01:25.860> entirely<00:01:26.190> different

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
this is something entirely different

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.710 
this is something entirely different
so<00:01:28.190> and<00:01:29.190> I've<00:01:29.340> discovered<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.300> does

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
so and I've discovered that this does

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270 
so and I've discovered that this does
happen<00:01:30.990> when<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.470> change<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> window

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
happen when you change the window

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.980 
happen when you change the window
startup<00:01:32.820> sound<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:35.060> my<00:01:36.060> advice<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.600> don't

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
startup sound so my advice is just don't

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.380 
startup sound so my advice is just don't
do<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.520> that's<00:01:38.520> fine<00:01:38.700> why<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.060> make<00:01:39.240> this

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
do it that's fine why to make this

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510 
do it that's fine why to make this
little<00:01:39.630> video<00:01:39.810> because<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.470> had<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.280> problem

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
little video because I had this problem

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
little video because I had this problem
did<00:01:41.760> a<00:01:41.820> system<00:01:42.240> restore<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:43.560> fixed<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
did a system restore it fixed it and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.480 
did a system restore it fixed it and
then<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.580> tried<00:01:44.880> changing<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.140> sound<00:01:46.290> again<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
then I tried changing the sound again it

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.880 
then I tried changing the sound again it
did<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.850> again<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:49.200> why<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> wanted<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
did this again so that's why I wanted to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.359 
did this again so that's why I wanted to
show<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.299> get<00:01:51.479> Windows<00:01:51.869> 8<00:01:52.080> and

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
show that so you get Windows 8 and

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.620 
show that so you get Windows 8 and
you're<00:01:53.369> using<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.759> startup<00:01:54.090> sound<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.540> was

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
you're using the startup sound but I was

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.060 
you're using the startup sound but I was
thinking<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:55.020> changing<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.590> don't<00:01:55.830> do<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
thinking of changing it don't do it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.830 
thinking of changing it don't do it
because<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.970> end<00:01:57.150> up<00:01:57.270> having<00:01:57.330> this

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
because you can end up having this

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.040 
because you can end up having this
particular<00:01:58.409> problem
