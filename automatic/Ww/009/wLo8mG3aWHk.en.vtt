 Dirk Siebert Creative Ideas Basic Instructions for Earrings 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.290
 In this guide we will explain the material and the individual 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.290
 Steps to make a Paul Ringelkamp 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.400
 The first thing we need is an ear, which is available in many 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.560
 different versions 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.390
 The simplest and cheapest is the closed one among others 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.210
 Most often the fisherman had used it has had an ear without 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.210
 Clasp and just hang on the board 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.610
 These had a nice variation of the fisherman had 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.020
 especially level is the breeze clock she can through a folding mechanism 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.960
 completely opened and closed 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.350
 This ear was especially safe 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.550
 For anyone without Ulricher, the watch screwdriver is perfect for you 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.550
 unscrewed mechanism fixed on the earlobe 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.350
 we opt for the popular fisherman hook 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.350
 Next we need a fixation for the bald ones 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.670
 there are nasty pens that already have no nakedness above and bent down 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 be closed or with a Keith locket 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.980
 The Katla pen has a plate at the bottom and is at the top 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.870
 should these births 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.110
 we choose the chain of donors 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.520
 as a tool we need a rosary his 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.340
 the little one is the ideal the union with 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.130
 she had round godfathers that makes it very easy to get to the catwalk 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.730
 to offer an eyelid 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.870
 We also need a side cutter to pin the chain 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.820
 shorten and flat his for corrections and to turn on us 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.970
 from evil 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.050
 here again the watch list 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.399
 "We need two fish had u2 chain pins 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.649
 and pearls for the clock genes use each of the two Lafer balls 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.729
 twelve millimeters in diameter and 2 cook a 8-millimeter bullet 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.319
 Diameter in addition we still need four chosen the silver discs 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.260
 with a diameter of ten millimeters 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.040
 First, the Lotter bead is pulled onto the chain pin 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.790
 make sure that the hole of the bead is not larger than the plate of the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.959
 KÃ¤the Stiftes is because she otherwise slips 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.070
 Now the two of them are raised like she was divorcing 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.730
 they make a nice contrast and leave the Buring high quality values 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.870
 like Silva looks like sterling silver 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.600
 but is a much cheaper option 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.520
 the conclusion is the cook a ball we have google in different 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.830
 Used by sizes, the Uri looks very harmonious 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.099
 now the proceeds are offered 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.090
 grab the start with the pliers at the lower third then bend the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.299
 State backwards around the numbers 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.589
 help with your finger and complete the bends 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:46.709
 Now grab the wrench once around Wigan's pin under the chain 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.789
 Helping her fingers once around the Emser the runway is now firm 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.339
 locked 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.019
 Now the eyelet is bent under excess chain poses with 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.409
 cut off the side cutter 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.779
 with the more flat next, the equally clean pressed down 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:06.579
 In the next step, the beads are attached to Fischer hooks for it 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.719
 the custom of the fish species Smith flat forced his most bent ear 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.919
 have had a certain that can be outweighed 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.409
 then the bald ones are hung in the open door 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.840
 and finally the thesis that fishermen had bent them back 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.210
 and the Orient is ready
