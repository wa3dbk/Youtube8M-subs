00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.880
 from minecraft what is coming from the 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:23.950
 arcade numbers the first thing we have 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.220
 that to be is to have an account that a 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.870
 account created in the USA because if you 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.900

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.900

 how they count as the one that impacts 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.670
 the mind was made for the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.460

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.269
