this record Lee Scott isn't quite so

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.620

overt he's not so silly and over the top
he's<00:01:07.200> actually<00:01:07.409> pretty<00:01:07.860> laid-back<00:01:08.580> chill<00:01:09.119> but

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
he's actually pretty laid-back chill but

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.460 
he's actually pretty laid-back chill but
also<00:01:10.200> dark<00:01:10.860> kind<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.700> slack-jawed<00:01:12.659> which<00:01:13.260> is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
also dark kind of slack-jawed which is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.870 
also dark kind of slack-jawed which is
definitely<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.950> change<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.369> pace<00:01:14.549> from<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
definitely a change of pace from the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.450 
definitely a change of pace from the
very<00:01:15.060> aggressive<00:01:15.740> delivery<00:01:16.740> he<00:01:16.979> puts<00:01:17.250> out

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
very aggressive delivery he puts out

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.450 
very aggressive delivery he puts out
there<00:01:17.759> when<00:01:18.090> he's<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> midst<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.560> rap

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
there when he's in the midst of a rap

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.130 
there when he's in the midst of a rap
battle<00:01:20.490> which<00:01:21.060> ultimately<00:01:21.570> i<00:01:21.689> think<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
battle which ultimately i think is a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
battle which ultimately i think is a
pretty<00:01:22.350> good<00:01:22.470> thing<00:01:22.860> Lee<00:01:23.189> Scott<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> rapper

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.230 
however on this album I do wish he'd be
a<00:05:32.930> little<00:05:33.440> bit<00:05:33.590> more<00:05:33.800> aggressive<00:05:34.729> just<00:05:35.090> give

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
a little bit more aggressive just give

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.420 
a little bit more aggressive just give
his<00:05:35.360> rhymes<00:05:35.570> a<00:05:35.690> little<00:05:35.870> bit<00:05:35.990> more<00:05:36.110> oomph<00:05:36.620> from

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
his rhymes a little bit more oomph from

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.999 
his rhymes a little bit more oomph from
time<00:05:37.699> to<00:05:37.880> time<00:05:37.909> because<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:39.169> constant

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
time to time because the constant

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.060 
time to time because the constant
somewhat<00:05:40.490> monotone<00:05:41.240> just<00:05:41.990> really<00:05:42.349> laid-back

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
somewhat monotone just really laid-back

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.480 
somewhat monotone just really laid-back
delivery<00:05:44.000> that<00:05:44.210> we<00:05:44.360> has<00:05:44.659> on<00:05:44.930> this<00:05:45.080> record<00:05:45.500> does

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
delivery that we has on this record does

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.490 
delivery that we has on this record does
become<00:05:46.849> a<00:05:46.880> bit<00:05:47.090> of<00:05:47.180> a<00:05:47.270> drag<00:05:47.539> after<00:05:48.199> a<00:05:48.229> while<00:05:48.469> I

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
become a bit of a drag after a while I

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.170 
become a bit of a drag after a while I
really<00:05:48.919> sort<00:05:49.159> of<00:05:49.219> start<00:05:49.550> feeling<00:05:49.880> my<00:05:49.969> mind

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
really sort of start feeling my mind

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.779 
really sort of start feeling my mind
gravitate<00:05:50.930> toward<00:05:51.349> the<00:05:51.889> instrumentals<00:05:52.669> and

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
gravitate toward the instrumentals and

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.370 
gravitate toward the instrumentals and
I'm<00:05:52.940> not<00:05:53.090> really<00:05:53.210> feeling<00:05:53.539> much<00:05:53.960> of<00:05:54.110> what<00:05:54.229> Lee

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
I'm not really feeling much of what Lee

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.560 
I'm not really feeling much of what Lee
is<00:05:54.560> saying<00:05:54.830> at<00:05:55.099> all<00:05:55.490> just<00:05:55.789> because<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.150> energy

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
is saying at all just because the energy

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.060 
is saying at all just because the energy
isn't<00:05:56.750> really<00:05:57.110> there<00:05:57.349> I<00:05:57.380> guess<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.800> lack<00:05:58.039> of

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
isn't really there I guess the lack of

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.730 
isn't really there I guess the lack of
energy<00:05:58.639> kind<00:05:58.820> of<00:05:58.880> gets<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.419> me<00:05:59.539> after<00:06:00.139> one<00:06:00.409> song

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
energy kind of gets to me after one song

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.219 
energy kind of gets to me after one song
after<00:06:01.070> another<00:06:01.880> even<00:06:02.330> if<00:06:02.419> Lee<00:06:02.599> does<00:06:02.870> seem<00:06:03.110> to

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
after another even if Lee does seem to

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.540 
after another even if Lee does seem to
be<00:06:03.259> making<00:06:03.469> some<00:06:03.830> cool<00:06:04.039> or<00:06:04.370> interesting

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
be making some cool or interesting

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.760 
be making some cool or interesting
points<00:06:05.210> with<00:06:05.330> what<00:06:05.479> he's<00:06:05.659> saying<00:06:05.960> I<00:06:06.229> think<00:06:06.560> if

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
points with what he's saying I think if

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.469 
points with what he's saying I think if
there's<00:06:06.949> any<00:06:07.130> one<00:06:07.460> line<00:06:07.729> that<00:06:07.759> kind<00:06:08.090> of<00:06:08.150> sums

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
there's any one line that kind of sums

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.330 
there's any one line that kind of sums
up<00:06:08.630> Lee's<00:06:08.900> delivery<00:06:09.440> on<00:06:09.680> this<00:06:09.889> record<00:06:10.219> is

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
up Lee's delivery on this record is

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.129 
up Lee's delivery on this record is
actually<00:06:10.759> on<00:06:10.880> one<00:06:10.909> of<00:06:11.180> the<00:06:11.330> final<00:06:11.539> tracks<00:06:11.960> of

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
actually on one of the final tracks of

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.469 
actually on one of the final tracks of
this<00:06:12.229> album<00:06:12.469> ironically<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:14.090> most

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
this album ironically the most

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.810 
this album ironically the most
aggressive<00:06:15.110> track<00:06:15.409> on<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.889> LP<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:16.610> song

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
aggressive track on the LP the song

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.909 
aggressive track on the LP the song
don't<00:06:17.150> tell<00:06:17.479> me<00:06:17.659> and<00:06:17.810> I<00:06:17.870> do<00:06:17.930> love<00:06:18.229> the<00:06:18.440> second

verse<00:06:19.039> on<00:06:19.219> this<00:06:19.370> album<00:06:19.550> because<00:06:19.669> Lee<00:06:19.969> really

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
verse on this album because Lee really

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.550 
verse on this album because Lee really
changes<00:06:20.599> up<00:06:20.690> his<00:06:20.840> flow<00:06:21.080> gets<00:06:21.320> a<00:06:21.380> little

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
changes up his flow gets a little

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.909 
changes up his flow gets a little
speedier<00:06:22.130> here<00:06:22.849> and<00:06:23.000> there<00:06:23.210> and<00:06:23.389> he<00:06:23.960> says<00:06:24.199> call

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
speedier here and there and he says call

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.459 
speedier here and there and he says call
me<00:06:25.039> Alan<00:06:25.400> Watts<00:06:25.669> the<00:06:26.000> point<00:06:26.240> which<00:06:26.690> I<00:06:26.930> think<00:06:26.990> is

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
me Alan Watts the point which I think is

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.800 
me Alan Watts the point which I think is
a<00:06:27.740> really<00:06:28.009> amazing<00:06:28.820> way<00:06:28.969> of<00:06:29.120> kind<00:06:29.389> of<00:06:29.449> summing

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
a really amazing way of kind of summing

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.129 
a really amazing way of kind of summing
up<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.320> strong<00:06:31.310> sense<00:06:32.000> of<00:06:32.240> depression<00:06:32.630> and

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:33.139 
up the strong sense of depression and

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:37.029 
up the strong sense of depression and
apathy<00:06:33.860> but<00:06:34.370> also<00:06:34.750> gusto<00:06:35.750> and<00:06:36.139> and<00:06:36.440> and<00:06:36.740> and

humorousness that
that<00:06:38.460> pervades<00:06:39.090> this<00:06:39.990> album<00:06:40.530> it's<00:06:40.770> an

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
that pervades this album it's an

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.129 
that pervades this album it's an
interesting<00:06:41.100> mix<00:06:41.430> of<00:06:41.639> emotions<00:06:42.210> but<00:06:42.540> I<00:06:42.750> just

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
interesting mix of emotions but I just

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.650 
interesting mix of emotions but I just
wish<00:06:43.620> that<00:06:44.010> we<00:06:44.070> saw<00:06:44.430> different<00:06:44.970> mixes<00:06:45.630> of

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
wish that we saw different mixes of

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.960 
wish that we saw different mixes of
emotions<00:06:46.620> going<00:06:47.040> from<00:06:47.520> track<00:06:47.790> to<00:06:47.820> track

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
emotions going from track to track

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.240 
emotions going from track to track
overall<00:06:48.840> I<00:06:48.930> like<00:06:49.110> this<00:06:49.320> record<00:06:49.620> wasn't<00:06:49.830> blown

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
overall I like this record wasn't blown

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.909 
overall I like this record wasn't blown
away<00:06:50.520> by<00:06:50.790> it<00:06:50.850> I<00:06:51.389> think<00:06:51.780> Lee<00:06:52.470> has<00:06:52.680> a<00:06:52.710> lot<00:06:52.889> of

away by it I think Lee has a lot of

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:54.680 
away by it I think Lee has a lot of
talent<00:06:53.460> I<00:06:53.610> think<00:06:53.730> there<00:06:54.060> are<00:06:54.120> some<00:06:54.210> good<00:06:54.389> songs

doesn't<00:07:16.380> sound<00:07:16.440> like<00:07:16.560> he's<00:07:16.740> just<00:07:16.919> playing

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
doesn't sound like he's just playing

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.490 
doesn't sound like he's just playing
rapper<00:07:18.120> or<00:07:18.540> anything<00:07:18.780> like<00:07:19.020> that

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 
rapper or anything like that

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.290 
rapper or anything like that
he<00:07:19.800> seems<00:07:20.280> like<00:07:20.400> a<00:07:20.460> pretty<00:07:20.550> versatile

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 
he seems like a pretty versatile

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.730 
he seems like a pretty versatile
talented<00:07:22.230> artist

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740

talented artist
I<00:07:22.830> just<00:07:23.010> don't<00:07:23.160> think<00:07:23.280> all<00:07:23.610> of<00:07:23.669> those<00:07:23.940> talents

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:24.570 
I just don't think all of those talents

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.750 
I just don't think all of those talents
and<00:07:24.720> all<00:07:24.900> that<00:07:25.140> versatility<00:07:25.590> turned<00:07:26.460> up<00:07:26.610> on

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:26.760 
and all that versatility turned up on

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.490 
and all that versatility turned up on
this<00:07:26.910> record<00:07:27.150> because<00:07:27.660> when<00:07:27.840> you<00:07:27.930> watch<00:07:28.169> him

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 
this record because when you watch him

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.560 
this record because when you watch him
in<00:07:28.740> the<00:07:29.100> midst<00:07:29.340> of<00:07:29.370> a<00:07:29.490> rap<00:07:29.669> battle<00:07:29.700> and<00:07:30.210> when

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
in the midst of a rap battle and when

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.360 
in the midst of a rap battle and when
you<00:07:30.660> listen<00:07:30.840> to<00:07:31.050> him<00:07:31.200> on<00:07:31.350> a<00:07:31.440> record<00:07:31.950> it's<00:07:32.220> like

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
you listen to him on a record it's like

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.900 
you listen to him on a record it's like
hearing<00:07:32.580> two<00:07:32.970> completely<00:07:33.840> different<00:07:34.700> artists

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:35.910 
hearing two completely different artists

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.140 
hearing two completely different artists
I<00:07:35.940> just<00:07:36.510> wish<00:07:36.750> a<00:07:37.169> little<00:07:37.590> bit<00:07:37.680> more<00:07:37.860> of<00:07:37.950> that

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.150
