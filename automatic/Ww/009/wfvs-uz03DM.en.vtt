00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.340
 to all the cases for me my name is 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.940
 tomatito and the string a new video 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.369
 where I will show you a glitch as well 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.680
 say a trick mini trick for 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.600
 to be able to take out coins that you want 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.309
 Well, that depends on how long 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.490
 you can do in the xbox or how long 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.890
 you get bored in doing it but hey this is 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.410
 is very slow is not is not what 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.940
 you win a thousand and a thousand and a thousand every minute 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.140
 every second is very slow very 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.160
 boring so to speak 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.860
 but if you are one of those who stay 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.210
 well, let's be able to have a tight 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.989
 moored with your excel 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.500
 elevate the xbox control of exxon and then 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.870
 there you have coins and coins well what 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.600
 what we have to do first is 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.790
 have a sunflower we already have a sunflower 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.309
 now and we have to grab a sunflower 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.989
 of fire is preferably because the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.180
 kill faster and as I have here 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.309
 My tour is very cool, so let's give it 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.140
 I think that this goes nothing the sones are going to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.450
 be captured with the pimp that I'm 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.110
 but good 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.770
 let's wait for crisis to go 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.799
 you leave, I do not want you here, go away 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.990
 Go away I want you to get out of you ok 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.360
 when it is gone what we have that is 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.480
 take us running here 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.310
 and correct runs the correct 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.310
 sheltered and activate this garden 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.829
 to this now what we have to wait 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.990
 is that it is that our good the 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.140
 first zombies when already fall 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.120
 first are after 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.820
 if the zombies are here 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.100
 we propose a medical prescription here and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.159
 If they are and they come out here, let's plant one 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.320
 medical appointment here and then the 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.760
 magic to see what is activated of this 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.480
 thing and 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:03.060
 let's go around our our 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.060
 garden orioles the landmark law 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.130
 and now we are ready let's see 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.730
 where they come out here came out perfect 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.120
 but not here not for her 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.930
 ok well because now they are heading here 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.240
 the zombies pose a medical appointment the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.450
 that these are plants that when 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.849
 about a zombie hide 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.310
 and well that's why look now we try 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.470
 call attention to a zombie and we 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.550
 we put between our medical appointment and the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.739
 zombie going let's get here as 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.660
 we are and look at the beginning of the 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.000
 now he will be starting to do 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.840
 damage to our medical appointment and we 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.260
 let's cure it 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.810
 It has no loses, it's very easy, very 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.230
 fast and how the 7th doctor is losing 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.360
 is losing life and lasts a mogollÃ³n 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.480
 but a lot of the medical appointment my 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.769
 web ethic with good as hell she 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.810
 I was speculating is going to be healing 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.750
 and for us they will give us ten 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.849
 healing currencies indeed if you 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.330
 still do not have the achievement of healing to of 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:14.420
 to 25 plants because this is a way 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.569
 easy to do it because you can 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.079
 do I already have it 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.969
 if we kill these zombies now this 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.439
 this glitch can do it with friends 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.719
 if you want but you would have to 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.879
 put in the other pot and wait for 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:29.379
 that the sun and go and then heal it and the 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.049
 it's really hard to calculate that 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:35.829
 right now we were lucky to do it fast 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:40.030
 because it 's really hard and good 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.560
 should be winning 10 and 10 and 10 and by 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.079
 example if you say no then that 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.659
 I already have enough coins because 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.519
 I want to finish this do not come out ok 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.469
 that's a bad idea because if I do not lose two 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.829
 mines do not get out they have to finish 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:56.739
 the garden and good operation for example 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.239
 if you already have ten thousand coins at 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.959
 finish the garden pressure well then 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.840
 they have another thousand other five others 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.099
 thousand maybe not so yes yes yes but if the 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.319
 they are going to finish they have to be careful 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.819
 with your garden because you do not think so much 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.980
 Bolivar has already taken a quarter of 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.569
 mine because I think I 've been 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.889
 with tino because he is already lost but nothing 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.190
 more I wanted to show you this little 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.130
 trick 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.130
 getting coins is effective but it's 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.070
 very very slow I think it would be a 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.130
 little bit better if there were more zombies 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.560
 and a plant is healing them as well by 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.940
 example can they do this if they put more 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.850
 they are later on to put the healing plant 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.180
 and a little left on the ground 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.980
 curative healing the medical city 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.050
 extra low 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.430
 okay this is a little glitch my name 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.430
 it's tomatito and see you in another video
