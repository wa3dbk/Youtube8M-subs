00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
this way which will not work because

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.960 
this way which will not work because
then<00:01:04.260> once<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:04.979> sewn<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.519> won't<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.820> able

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
then once it's sewn on you won't be able

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.060 
there are holes you can add two tracks
on<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.470> clip<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.930> purposes<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.979> this

holes and with these top holes you use a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.499 
holes and with these top holes you use a
small<00:01:25.890> needle<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> only

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509
