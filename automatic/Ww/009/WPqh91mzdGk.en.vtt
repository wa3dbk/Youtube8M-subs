00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.569
 that is, for you I wanted first of all 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.230
 Excuse me if it always seems in my videos 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.700
 quite cold and awkward but 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.370
 however still being at the beginning 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.980
 let's say I couldn't get loose 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.630
 completely and I realize that when 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.660
 I speak I look like a machine 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.410
 gone crazy a robot that says those 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.320
 two three little phrases without even breathing 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.320
 and so I promise you I will try 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.930
 absolutely relax a little more 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.780
 and said nothing today I wanted to do 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.520
 see this trick I made 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 which is however quite simple 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.950
 because I mainly used two 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.710
 color taupe and quite a bronze 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.910
 intense and my lips too 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.010
 dark with this matt brown and I hope 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.640
 that you like the trick and leave you at 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.980
 tutorial start by applying on the whole 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.980
 eyelid the base of the urban decay 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.780
 I also put myself a little below 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.530
 as another base I go to put 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:30.310
 this illuminating in kiko gel by 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.939
 this taupe which is number 3 and lo 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.700
 put on the whole eyelid bringing it 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.700
 even a little towards the fold 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.240
 I also put it below 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.700
 the first color I'm going to get from 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.159
 this palette of essence this color 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.159
 dove that should be placed on the eyelid 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.700
 this too bringing it to the fold 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.270
 I also put below 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.090
 with a gradient brush then I go 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.970
 to take this eye shadow of this 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.720
 quite dark bronze color and this is it 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:55.190
 of the inglot and I put it on the fold 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:03:00.760
 blending it with the dove bringing it 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.760
 up inside the inner corner of the eye 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.790
 it fades a little with a clean brush 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:54.280
 I put here under the eyebrow arch 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:56.950
 a matt white eye shadow for both 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.239
 illuminate and open the gaze that for 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.010
 blend it a little with bronze 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.549
 I'm going to put the bronze with a 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.689
 thin brush even below 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.689
 blending it with taupe 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:25.229
 cotton swab that fades into a 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:27.990
 little bit I then take a little hide 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.599
 always from the essence spoon this 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.710
 silver eyeshadow to put it on 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.710
 in the inner corner of the eye 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.580
 even a little below 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.070
 mascara on the upper lashes that 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.070
 lower 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.479
 If the cheeks that is to put this bluff 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:12.360
 of kiko of this rose but anyway 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.360
 quite natural that is the number 109 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.050
 finally on the lips I go to put 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.259
 this chili lipstick that is 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:48.419
