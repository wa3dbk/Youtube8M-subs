00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.710
 videos for adults only boys and 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.820
 girls hello i ruslan usachev today 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.070
 I keep asking questions 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.800
 developers of the largest gaming innovations 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.719
 from e3 now I'll set my own 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.059
 questions are very and even your question which 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.010
 collected his group vkontakte we go 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.810
 such an interactive interview I will ask 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.039
 these questions to the developer of the new part 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.039
 splinter cell blacklist 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.640
 Artem Boreiko asks those questions 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.289
 who are interested in all the old school 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.030
 splinter cell fans and what's in the game 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:39.339
 there will be more action and rosary stealth by me 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.239
 crossbred really eat if kind of fans 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.569
 stealth 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.370
 This game is about how to be inconspicuous odnog 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:47.170
 tics and of course we are right 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.789
 I got here, I wonder if everything 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.829
 the developers of the sprint soldiers are not severe 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.780
 men i'm a big fan of thousands of particles 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.999
 the center of the village house theories therefore personally 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.799
 it is very important for me to know which game you are 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:01:00.639
 developers consider the coolest in 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:02.589
 I am of course a series of very 50 because I 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.390
 worked with this team for three years already 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.119
 that blacklist is my favorite 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.950
 but if you give the second place who is it 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.079
 there will definitely be chaos theory 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.130
 since she inspired me to work with 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:18.130
 of course that is his favorite card which 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.689
 not yet come out fun video games this 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.429
 Of course it's great I do not argue but not 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.740
 the developer plans to somehow expand 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:28.270
 the splinter cell universe do cartoons 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.159
 and comics movies about those and murders we 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.729
 already made our first steps in the world 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.920
 comics 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.170
 we released the splinter graphic novel 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.960
 cell and course that describes the time 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.579
 the period between the last two games 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.439
 a big event this year was the announcement 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.420
 splinter cell and we are pleased to announce 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.909
 that the main role will be performed by tom 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.140
 hardy 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.640
 Well, how do developers relate to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.090
 the fact that the phisher herself will play tom 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.700
 hardy 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.920
 i like tom hardy i think he 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.509
 great actor he proved himself capable 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.880
 cope with the role in the action movie 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.189
 and can add humanity to it and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.799
 yes he is highly qualified to 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.240
 pay this character I'm nothing 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.710
 determined his attitude to the fact that 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.719
 the main role in the splinter cell will be 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.670
 play tom hardy don't know if he can handle 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.409
 What do you think, that is, it fits 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.000
 folk sam poster or not write your 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.290
 opinion in the comments and Ivan Malyutin 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.569
 asks what is still a ray 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.569
 splinter cell blacklist and not sex 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.230
 of course the main question for this guy 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.180
 Does he know when will come beyond good &amp; 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.219
 evil 2 i'm actually the last person on 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.900
 light who might know something about it 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.609
 and now your questions will be answered 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.500
 developer of one of the most anticipated games 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:39.819
 Watch dogs Sergey Kravtsov interested 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.220
 will the game be cooperative 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.069
 passing with the application 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.019
 companion for android and ios 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.269
 you can play with your 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.930
 friends over can get rid of them 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.209
 the police 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.549
 disable helicopters it will help 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.430
 your friends reach their goals in the game 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.319
 but Pavel Shirokov asks 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.090
 It will be good in the game of life for stimulation 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.400
 the country is not as assassin's creed 4 well 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.329
 every citizen has his own identity 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.129
 own job there is an income profile in general 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.780
 each district which visit in the game 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.120
 will look and feel differently 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.169
 because there everything changes all the time and 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.159
 people generally react to the weather every 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:23.169
 the player's action in principle at all 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.040
 watch dogs go not only on xbox 360 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.959
 and playstation 3 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.909
 but also on the new generation of consoles which 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.190
 come out the end of the year so not interested 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.840
 is it worth buying a new console at all and 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.329
 for the sake of this game, well, here's the question 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.849
 saturation and wealth of worlds which 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.639
 weather simulation will change 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.250
 clothes the number of people on the streets in this 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.769
 there will be differences in versions for new consoles 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.220
 but in principle the gameplay will remain so 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.840
 so decide for yourself Rodion Grishchenko 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.940
 asks what actually pushed 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.190
 developers to create watch dogs what 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.379
 it was their inspiration but we generally wanted 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.870
 make the game really based on 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.359
 reality that is identical to the present 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.329
 the city if you go to chicago 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.530
 the game then you will meet there really 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.569
 existing sights 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.250
 much in the game is based on what we 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.880
 see actually 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.980
 or midi 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.570
 the main weapon the hero of the game is his 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.310
 the phone using it he switches 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.739
 traffic light controls the camera is engaged 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.390
 so different hacking 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.900
 the android owner is very important and 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.420
 I wonder how long the battery will last 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.120
 smartphone heroes are unlike any of 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.370
 those that are now in stores 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.700
 well yes it has batteries which 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.240
 limits the action with the phone but she 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.680
 still super powerful enough and well 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.770
 maybe even he knows when it comes out 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.080
 bianca this conclusion we are now actually 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.910
 very busy working on the mail met 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:54.000
 I have no information about leaving 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:55.590
 beyond where name2 that's all our end 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.180
 interactive interview thank you very much 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.950
 that asked a lot of questions 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.630
 thanks to your support honor this 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.820
