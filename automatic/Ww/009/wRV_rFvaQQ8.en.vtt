00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

difference<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.200> fight<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.739> me<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.100> looks

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
difference in this fight to me it looks

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.310 
difference in this fight to me it looks
like<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.489> heavyweight<00:00:45.300> versus<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.289> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
like a heavyweight versus like a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.010 
like a heavyweight versus like a
welterweight<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> middleweight<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.300> least

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
welterweight or a middleweight at least

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.830 
welterweight or a middleweight at least
I<00:00:49.350> mean<00:00:49.590> Mark<00:00:50.460> Coleman<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.850> pretty<00:00:51.090> small<00:00:51.480> as

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I mean Mark Coleman is pretty small as

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.619 
I mean Mark Coleman is pretty small as
far<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.559> size<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> game<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.760> as

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
far as just a size in the game but as

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.430 
far as just a size in the game but as
you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.739> see<00:00:55.980> he<00:00:56.460> let<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.239> beast<00:00:57.539> mount<00:00:58.140> him

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you can see he let the beast mount him

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.380 
you can see he let the beast mount him
that's<00:00:59.100> never<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.699> good<00:01:00.030> idea<00:01:00.739> but<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:02.850> this

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
that's never a good idea but in this

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.800 
that's never a good idea but in this
fight<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.660> actually<00:01:03.989> kind<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.619> let<00:01:05.339> him<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:05.810> just

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
fight I actually kind of let him up just

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.310 
fight I actually kind of let him up just
so<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.200> kind<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:08.180> get<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.240> better<00:01:09.479> finish<00:01:10.110> I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
so I can kind of get a better finish I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.230 
so I can kind of get a better finish I
didn't<00:01:10.590> want<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> TKO<00:01:11.340> finish<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.119> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
didn't want to get a TKO finish and I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.390 
didn't want to get a TKO finish and I
definitely<00:01:12.689> could<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.140> done<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> let
