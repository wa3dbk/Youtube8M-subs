00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.529
 Welcome to this new 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.049
 video by orgonit and today it's supposed to be around 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.960
 the apple watch are more accurate 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.490
 5 custom apps are already up 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.800
 the apple bot is worth the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.390
 scope of functions so far are that it 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.399
 in any case and this on the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.570
 I like to install apple watch 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.399
 these apps for a very short time 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.399
 which also like to show 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:27.840
 how do you watch these apps on your apple watch 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:30.239
 installed and I would say so 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.800
 I start right with the first app 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.570
 I wish you much fun before us 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.040
 now with the first apple would like to go 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.510
 and show you how you are 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.120
 the app is even more expensive apple 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.310
 watch install can connect to it 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.070
 Of course we use our apple watch with the 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.530
 iphone and then open the watch here 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.910
 app directly on the device and there you can 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.430
 We will then scroll down here 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.200
 all installed apps the compatible 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.120
 are with the apple bosch and come there 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.250
 then just click on it and then 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.710
 Show up here on apple watch 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.899
 then select this app 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 So it really works very well 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.909
 easy and to offer some apps 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.040
 In addition, the checks on this as 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.810
 example twitter twitter offers here and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.520
 there is the option of checks 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.800
 These are then directly in the checks 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.020
 displayed on the adwords that can be 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.880
 then individually for each app quite simply 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.610
 in the apple watch app on the iphone 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.380
 Let's start with the app 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.520
 shazam and this should be for everyone 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.530
 It has been known for a very long time 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.940
 the iphone has been here now for 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 We adapted the apple bosch we sound 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.900
 on this round icon and then opens 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.700
 This app makes it easy for us to do 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.710
 So music can recognize 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.119
 music recognition and that's what I want here 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.180
 any song now 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.840
 from my iphone and then I click 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.840
 here on this button 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.340
 and after a short while the song became 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.049
 So you see here you will be recognized 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.369
 the title is displayed on cover if 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.479
 this is available and we can 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.799
 then buy the song then 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.630
 or here the lyrics 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.149
 look at it when we get there 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.250
 click and then we can all over here 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.959
 just scroll through and then here 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.939
 the lyrics look on 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.439
 in any case very well and very quickly 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.170
 the apple boss we come already to 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.890
 next to football 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.440
 we find here 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.599
 this icon on our apple bot 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.090
 homescreen and have each here 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.370
 saved bundesliga games or 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.599
 also second bundesliga and so on ever 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.430
 after how we do that on our iphone 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.900
 have configured in this case now 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.910
 Two games left for the Bundesliga for 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.349
 today and there we can then 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.180
 show further information 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.180
 a live ticker as soon as the game starts 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.500
 also started and yes we have in 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.720
 finally a quick access to 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.060
 some important information about the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.040
 play each other and is special 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.510
 that we also have six here 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.670
 I go here quite normally in the clocks 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.510
 and then moves from bottom to top 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.950
 and here I find the back then 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.569
 respective bundesliga games i do 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.269
 So in this case I chose here 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.799
 now bremen against frankfurt and 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.569
 that we will be right in here then 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.459
 Checks displayed you may have it 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.470
 already with me in the checks I saw 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.389
 I have a data trecker on mine 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.060
 touch installed and if I have this 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.859
 open then I have access to mine 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.359
 I used my data with my 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.060
 So iphone has consumed in this 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.620
 fall here this 18 days and then 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.299
 how much gigabyte I already have 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.790
 I have used up here too 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.739
 the possibility to clear up here 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.090
 then come to the settings and 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.099
 then just a few things 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.440
 configure but most can 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.419
 i just make it in the iphone app and 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.980
 the nice thing about this app is that you 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.389
 is also displayed in the 'checks 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.790
 So if I go to the clock now 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.739
 and then pull from top to bottom 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.120
 I also use my data here 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.709
 right on the clock and always can 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.510
 See if I have this youtube video 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.220
 for example, should still look or 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.650
 should have been home until home 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.299
 until I have wlan again if you can 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.160
 I'd like to translate something but quickly 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.840
 not want to get the iphone out then 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.150
 You can translate that easily 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.310
 on the make on the apple watch and 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.780
 We open this app and then have 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.500
 the possibility to choose a language 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.360
 in which we want to put over 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.280
 So from German to English in this 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:09.930
 fall and I take it now in the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:11.640
 simple sentence I am 20 years old and 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.920
 Just leave this one for me 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.570
 translate quickly into english and her 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.100
 The whole thing works wonderfully 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.720
 and that's not how it is 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.329
 slow so you can easily 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.310
 quickly pick up your apple watch from 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.010
 your arm and then something fast 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.570
 translate works pretty well 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.790
 as a last possible driving a car 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.980
 imagine a smart refueling 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.290
 also here on the apple watch with 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.120
 you just here the next 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.850
 gas stations can see and then to 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.350
 I also include the price per liter and 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.730
 Of course you can do that as well 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.320
 the iphone a stone in this case here 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.150
 now for this then we have the 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.890
 distance and where this is exactly 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.330
 is there and then we can just 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.100
 between the individual filling stations the 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.780
 in our area are scrolling as on the 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.220
 possibility by a firm press you 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.980
 to change the sorting 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.750
 between kilometers distance and the 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.030
 respective price and we can 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.070
 of course, update everything if 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.520
 we have a new price here 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.710
 would like 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.240
 if something has changed we have 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.930
 with also the possibility in the 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.400
 six directly access this so 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.710
 I should now continue to 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.080
 page and then find here the free 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.840
 gas station or the nearest gas station 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.229
 the one near me is depending on how 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.090
 I configured this on the iphone 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.650
 these were five apple watch apps now 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.840
 I like you in this video 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.060
 I wanted to introduce once I hope 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.100
 of course the video has fallen and it 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.570
 was one way or another app while the 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.450
 you now on your apple bosch 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.100
 I would like to install yours already 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.210
 Favorite apple waterboarding in the 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.530
 Write comments 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.419
