here this is really where those
different<00:00:26.609> zooms<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.359> I'm<00:00:27.660> gonna<00:00:27.839> take<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
different zooms are I'm gonna take a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.470 
different zooms are I'm gonna take a
look<00:00:28.320> at<00:00:28.589> them<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.250> kind<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.970> how<00:00:30.089> they<00:00:30.240> work

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
you can zoom and actually pick a window

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.370 
you can zoom and actually pick a window
and<00:01:32.789> kind<00:01:32.999> of<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.179> target<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.810> well<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.229> we'll

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
and kind of a target as well so we'll

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.190 
and kind of a target as well so we'll
left-click<00:01:34.979> say<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.850> want<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.149> look<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.960> this

left-click say we want to look in this

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.219 
left-click say we want to look in this
area<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:38.039> click<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.609> drag<00:01:38.819> a<00:01:38.969> marquee<00:01:39.229> let

area here click and drag a marquee let

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.200 
area here click and drag a marquee let
go<00:01:40.469> it'll<00:01:41.340> zoom<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.759> next<00:01:44.999> one's

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
go it'll zoom in this this next one's

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.830 
go it'll zoom in this this next one's
pretty<00:01:45.509> useful<00:01:45.719> it's<00:01:46.289> zoom<00:01:46.950> extents<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
pretty useful it's zoom extents if you

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.660 
pretty useful it's zoom extents if you
left<00:01:49.229> click<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.889> it'll<00:01:50.850> focus<00:01:51.600> right<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
left click it it'll focus right on the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
left click it it'll focus right on the
window<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:53.850> viewport<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:55.020> active

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
window or viewport that you have active

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.629 
window or viewport that you have active
so<00:01:55.829> let's<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.219> we'll<00:01:56.579> left<00:01:56.819> click<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:58.629 --> 00:01:58.639 
so let's do that we'll left click and

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.899 
so let's do that we'll left click and
it'll<00:01:59.639> zoom<00:02:00.179> out<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.409> entire<00:02:01.770> model<00:02:02.249> fits

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
it'll zoom out so the entire model fits

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.440 
it'll zoom out so the entire model fits
into<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.659> viewport<00:02:04.259> let's<00:02:05.069> mess<00:02:05.369> these<00:02:05.609> up<00:02:05.670> a

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
into this viewport let's mess these up a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.590 
into this viewport let's mess these up a
little<00:02:06.719> bit<00:02:07.139> here<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.910> change<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.270> one

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
little bit here just change that one

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.040 
little bit here just change that one
zoom<00:02:09.900> in<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:11.150> we'll<00:02:12.150> go<00:02:12.240> back<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.780> zoom

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
zoom in and we'll go back to the zoom

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.260 
zoom in and we'll go back to the zoom
extents<00:02:13.260> if<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.550> right
