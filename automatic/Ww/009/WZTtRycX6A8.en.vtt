00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.800 
the main benefit which is argued is that
when<00:02:18.739> you<00:02:18.860> publish<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.280> blog<00:02:19.489> post<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:20.450> gets

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
when you publish a blog post it gets

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.690 
when you publish a blog post it gets
distributed<00:02:21.260> around<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:22.099> internet<00:02:22.550> with

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
distributed around the internet with

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.270 
distributed around the internet with
something<00:02:23.209> called<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.420> pinging<00:02:23.750> mechanism<00:02:24.530> so

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
something called a pinging mechanism so

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.430 
something called a pinging mechanism so
it<00:02:25.640> can<00:02:25.819> appear<00:02:26.209> in<00:02:26.510> places<00:02:26.690> such<00:02:27.200> as

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
it can appear in places such as

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.290 
it can appear in places such as
technorati<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:28.519> more<00:02:28.760> likely<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.180> get

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
technorati it's more likely to get

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.360 
technorati it's more likely to get
indexed<00:02:29.720> more<00:02:30.050> quickly<00:02:30.260> in<00:02:30.500> Google<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.010> so

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
indexed more quickly in Google and so

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.120 
indexed more quickly in Google and so
forth<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:32.630> my<00:02:32.870> opinion<00:02:33.110> is<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.530> you're<00:02:33.920> only

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
forth but my opinion is that you're only

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.460 
forth but my opinion is that you're only
going<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.430> have<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.910> few<00:02:35.269> pages<00:02:35.599> of<00:02:35.870> content<00:02:36.050> so

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
going to have a few pages of content so

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.699 
going to have a few pages of content so
that<00:02:36.500> benefit<00:02:37.099> is<00:02:37.250> very<00:02:37.580> small<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.470> do

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
that benefit is very small and if you do

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.370 
that benefit is very small and if you do
get<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.099> a<00:02:40.130> point<00:02:40.459> at<00:02:40.760> some<00:02:41.120> some<00:02:42.049> point<00:02:42.260> later

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
get to a point at some some point later

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.009 
get to a point at some some point later
