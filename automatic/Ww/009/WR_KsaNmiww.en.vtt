00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
hi and welcome to this DVD which is

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.410 
hi and welcome to this DVD which is
hopefully<00:00:48.460> gonna<00:00:48.580> help<00:00:48.670> improve<00:00:49.210> your

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
hopefully gonna help improve your

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.650 
hopefully gonna help improve your
knowledge<00:00:49.570> of<00:00:49.809> figure<00:00:50.110> sculpting<00:00:50.589> in<00:00:50.680> anatomy

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
knowledge of figure sculpting in anatomy

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.000 
knowledge of figure sculpting in anatomy
to<00:00:52.660> start<00:00:52.930> off<00:00:53.110> let's<00:00:53.350> take<00:00:53.559> a<00:00:53.619> look<00:00:53.830> at<00:00:53.920> the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
to start off let's take a look at the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.530 
to start off let's take a look at the
finished<00:00:54.339> sculpt<00:00:54.699> which<00:00:54.850> you'll<00:00:55.030> see<00:00:55.059> being

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
finished sculpt which you'll see being

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.350 
finished sculpt which you'll see being
constructed<00:00:56.199> over<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.409> next<00:00:56.650> few<00:00:56.860> hours<00:00:57.360> as

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
constructed over the next few hours as

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.609 
constructed over the next few hours as
you<00:00:58.390> can<00:00:58.570> see<00:00:58.720> I've<00:00:58.839> gone<00:00:59.019> for<00:00:59.229> something<00:00:59.530> a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:00:59.619 
you can see I've gone for something a

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.500 
you can see I've gone for something a
little<00:00:59.949> different<00:01:00.460> than<00:01:00.670> as<00:01:00.790> usual<00:01:01.180> for<00:01:01.360> an

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
little different than as usual for an

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.320 
little different than as usual for an
anatomy<00:01:02.140> tutorial<00:01:02.430> such<00:01:03.430> as<00:01:03.670> perhaps<00:01:04.030> a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
anatomy tutorial such as perhaps a

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.800 
anatomy tutorial such as perhaps a
generic<00:01:05.110> symmetrical<00:01:05.740> stance<00:01:06.010> pose<00:01:06.280> man

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
white lapse or the figure can be a

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.429 
white lapse or the figure can be a
useful<00:01:09.400> teaching<00:01:09.820> aid<00:01:10.210> it's<00:01:10.810> also<00:01:11.080> rather

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
useful teaching aid it's also rather

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.710 
useful teaching aid it's also rather
boring<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:12.430> artistically<00:01:12.909> flat<00:01:13.270> so<00:01:13.540> I've

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
boring and artistically flat so I've

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.510 
boring and artistically flat so I've
decided<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.200> go<00:01:14.380> with<00:01:14.500> something<00:01:14.680> rather<00:01:15.369> more

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
decided to go with something rather more

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.090 
decided to go with something rather more
dynamic<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.330> show<00:01:16.479> how<00:01:16.720> anatomy<00:01:17.590> knowledge<00:01:17.950> is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
dynamic to show how anatomy knowledge is

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.859 
dynamic to show how anatomy knowledge is
used<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.490> solve<00:01:18.760> problems<00:01:18.850> in<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.450> real<00:01:19.600> world

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
used to solve problems in the real world

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.230 
used to solve problems in the real world
rather<00:01:20.200> than<00:01:20.380> just<00:01:20.670> depicting<00:01:21.670> it<00:01:21.790> in<00:01:21.909> a<00:01:22.030> cold

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
rather than just depicting it in a cold

rather than just depicting it in a cold
technical<00:01:22.869> example<00:01:23.350> I<00:01:24.150> decided<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.360> do<00:01:25.510> this

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
are all pretty much identical I'm going

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.810 
are all pretty much identical I'm going
to<00:01:53.200> leave<00:01:53.380> all<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.770> panels<00:01:54.190> on<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.460> interface

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
to leave all the panels on the interface

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.460 
to leave all the panels on the interface
visible<00:01:55.390> for<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.659> duration<00:01:56.020> of<00:01:56.290> this

produce a sculpt like this I generally
only<00:02:18.909> use<00:02:19.360> but<00:02:19.959> six<00:02:20.230> brushes<00:02:20.590> anyway<00:02:21.010> I'd

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
only use but six brushes anyway I'd

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.449 
only use but six brushes anyway I'd

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
more easily pose it but I built this

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.480 
more easily pose it but I built this
mace<00:03:32.990> specifically<00:03:33.590> for<00:03:33.770> this<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.340> won't

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
mace specifically for this and I won't

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.000 
mace specifically for this and I won't
be<00:03:34.670> using<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:34.970> again<00:03:35.060> so<00:03:35.450> quickly<00:03:36.230> posing<00:03:36.890> it

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.880 
be using it again so quickly posing it
like<00:03:37.160> this<00:03:37.310> is<00:03:37.460> fine<00:03:38.230> I've<00:03:39.230> already<00:03:39.620> pre

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
like this is fine I've already pre

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.830 
like this is fine I've already pre
sculpted<00:03:40.370> this<00:03:40.520> piece<00:03:40.850> to<00:03:41.030> work<00:03:41.180> at<00:03:41.390> exactly

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
sculpted this piece to work at exactly

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.180 
sculpted this piece to work at exactly
what<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.080> wanted<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.650> do<00:03:42.800> with<00:03:43.010> it

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
what I wanted to do with it

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.990 
what I wanted to do with it
it's<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.150> reasonably<00:03:44.660> complex<00:03:45.140> piece<00:03:45.620> and

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
it's a reasonably complex piece and

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.150 
it's a reasonably complex piece and
doing<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:47.090> on<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:47.360> fly<00:03:47.630> while<00:03:47.900> recording<00:03:48.290> this

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
doing it on the fly while recording this

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.530 
doing it on the fly while recording this
would<00:03:49.430> take<00:03:49.700> too<00:03:49.970> long

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
would take too long

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.470 
would take too long
so<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.230> pre<00:03:51.770> scoff<00:03:52.100> at<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.580> I<00:03:52.790> can<00:03:53.090> now<00:03:53.240> use

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
so I pre scoff at it and I can now use

when I pre sculpt of the figures this

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.870 
when I pre sculpt of the figures this
will<00:04:09.170> help<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.530> speed<00:04:09.800> things<00:04:10.010> up<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.520> I'll<00:04:10.670> be

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
will help to speed things up and I'll be

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.330 
will help to speed things up and I'll be
providing<00:04:11.150> these<00:04:11.570> meshes<00:04:12.320> so<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:12.739> can<00:04:12.980> start

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
providing these meshes so you can start

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.840

at<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.090> point<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:17.450> start<00:04:17.630> talking<00:04:18.109> about

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
at this point to start talking about

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.199 
at this point to start talking about
