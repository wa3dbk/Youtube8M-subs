00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.120
 we also took this opportunity 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.890
 Today my wedding special in flowers 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.660

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.219
 is there anything possible ? 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.710
 think everything what will all this 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.300
 so that you can enjoy the most beautiful day of the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.270
 wedding then really nice 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.920
 Andrea is definitely famous 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.079
 you are already heavily armed that is 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 now here the typical rose i would 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.370
 Thinking as a layperson explains what happens 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.930
 now you want a bridal bouquet for her 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.920
 bind us live in the show what you have 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.480
 you have in hand already a time 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.359
 starting a little bit is a classic 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.920
 in Biedermeier style that when 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.240
 This rounding has come a few more 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.130
 freesia with the classic 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.630
 Gypsophila comes with it and will 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.090
 then a very classic miracle 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.799
 small coup and classic is like that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.659
 the most asked as possible 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.830
 that it is so the race is always coming 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.320
 on it one must also pay attention 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.720
 how is the bride as big as small 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.890
 they hit something corpulent in 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.970
 Accordingly , one must also the bridal bouquet 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.259
 Of course you can not do the big one 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.330
 slim woman with a huge 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.040
 bridal bouquet that must be all too 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.030
 be adapted effectively as it must 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.689
 take care that we will do it again 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.610
 be able to show 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.930
 really great that you have already such a pearl 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.700
 Gift never works that easy 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.560
 with mario they are already 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.450
 let on the needle then easy 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.189
 plugged in then we let you 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.649
 get started and tell us 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.210
 peter is still a little more on it 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.009
 it really on what must the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.600
 so, if I am now, bridal couples pay attention 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.159
 planning a wedding does not start there 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.700
 only at the bridal bouquet but it works 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.590
 much further 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.560
 what does it all belong to yes yes such a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.630
 lots of things that belong to it 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.909
 exotic is certainly the decoration 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.860
 also for the car to the one the first 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.540
 perhaps not thought of what 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.829
 But it also looks really nice when you look 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.160
 perhaps driving convoy after 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.210
 at that time today as two wrestlers as 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.220
 floral motif he brought behind us 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.660
 which is just great on the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.520
 hood looks like that then right 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.570
 send out 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.490
 Of course, if you come back 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.950
 at the very basics begins the 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.900
 then also for the man of the 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.720
 always lose post then is to the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.210
 bridal bouquet of the bride and also of course 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.760
 when she gets married to the church she becomes 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.320
 It is also nice if you have the benches 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.270
 little adorns and that a little 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.490
 small tube with a small rose 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.220
 it's pure and it depends 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.840
 so cool with a little bit of pearls 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.530
 which was then very very nice 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.170
 looks 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.170
 yes and then you have to decide where 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.000
 it should be flowering everywhere 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.610
 that's a great christian 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.520
 what afterwards on the bridal couple the bride 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.680
 panel can stand here is again a 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.360
 other variant of bridal bouquet the way 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.610
 a bit of waterfall down 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.170
 that's so popular 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.940
 meanwhile that's not just like that 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.670
 a round street but just after 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.800
 where the front is really nice 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.390
 then again the band much like 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.920
 I just shown that at the churches 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.260
 Decor just just a bit down 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.090
 is still something that is popular 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.310
 is it is something which now come so 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.980
 what would you call that a trend 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.020
 called or what is here where what 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.640
 is a particularly timely yes that can 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.530
 you actually not the area so 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.240
 say right because everyone has one 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.780
 Another way to celebrate different style 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.340
 celebrate 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.780
 from there, the things always look 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.250
 very different so I have it here 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.130
 another variant man brought 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.260
 for a table decoration if you like one 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.730
 a bit rustic also celebrates a lot 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.100
 very nice just now with flowering 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.620
 lavender a pair of zest a few 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.270
 clean as a bit of wall around that too 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.490
 I think a really nice one 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.590
 history you can show if 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.290
 you just do not have it so pretty 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.640
 but rather like that a bit 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.200
 wants to celebrate lust for a wedding 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.050
 very very nice now has indeed 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.240
 every plant every flower has its own 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.510
 The language of the lavender is different from that 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.190
 tulip and the rose what says which flower 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.990
 now exactly which additionally which 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.580
 but reach as an example here the 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.680
 table decoration which is now mine 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.990
 right is there for the first is the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.660
 white rose so for the delicate that 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.489
 untouched stands for the symbol 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.560
 then we have the callas which presses 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.540
 so the admiration and the majestic 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.460
 from so 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.010
 also a bit of respect for the 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.860
 brews from her groom and then 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.320
 are the little freesias are like that 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.150
 very fine and in this rosato still 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.680
 expresses a little tenderness 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.900
 So that's a bit of the language 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.070
 The flowers were very strong in the past 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.840
 was respected 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.790
 Today you have to say honestly it is then 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.920
 usually so when the bride and groom with us 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.840
 come in the garden courtyard flower shop that 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.350
 Just take what you like 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.400
 what just looks nice and what they 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.900
 Andrea already said something to one 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.190
 fits great so i would think so 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.810
 already marry alone because of the ostrich 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.580
 the glass of it you can do it 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.260
 The balance show madness super 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.220
 really nice what is missing now 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.750
 not much anymore 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.490
 who really once made a great round 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.340
 so a bunch of needs not only good 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.090
 but above all, it has to be 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.010
 stuck because he will eventually 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.390
 also thrown at the end of the day from where 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.490
 actually this tradition comes why 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.220
 you throw the star that is also one 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.810
 throw tradition in the bridal bouquet 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.130
 some bridal couples even order two 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.320
 Bouquets because they have their own 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.910
 bridal bouquet want to behave and there is 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.200
 there for the second litter ostrich the 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.300
 maybe a bit smaller than one 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.360
 bit of aerodynamics maybe for one 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.770
 huge ostrich hereby to the waterfall and 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.780
 yes, throw this bridal bouquet 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.480
 certainly next to it a highlight 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.310
 at any celebration or of course determined 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.090
 Whose next wedding is celebrated 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.340
 can be 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.480
 right here too , make the choice 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.710
 not so big we'll go back to that 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.450
 come talk trend has me already 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.920
 but classic from where to where rich 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.870
 because the tastes are so extreme 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.090
 So you already had customers 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.320
 which is something quite extraordinary 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.790
 desired or where is there really the 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.200
 span yes I also have a few times 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.270
 Pictures were brought where you can 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.170
 so quickly see the difference if 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.300
 you can have a look 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.070
 There are also very great variations 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.830
 Here you can see so very delicate white 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.820
 Of course, bridal bouquet is very very much 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.140
 Send very very noble and here is the 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.480
 something natural for example 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.430
 shamrocks cloverleaves is in there 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.320
 also very nice, I think got it 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.270
 Glücksklee and on such a send 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.970
 car sees such a white commitment to 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.980
 Of course, vintage cars are very noble 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.450
 if you more like an American 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.190
 dare then has to be one 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.470
 I want something in the hippie style 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.310
 say with his whole nature known 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.200
 his 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.460
 Of course that always depends on what 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.350
 you have what you want for a car 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.050
 has dress and how to feel yourself 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.870
 and there everything is possible what fun 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.730
 Slowly makes the end look real 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.870
 But you do not need class 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.780
 only the ostrich or hand but it becomes 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.480
 Of course also flowers strewn 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.060
 what do you take classically as well? 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.740
 rose or rose petals we are so with it 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.050
 a blog actually started it 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.370
