00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.070
 when rafael Moreno-Valle arrived at 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.190
 puebla government said he was going to carry 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.380
 he populated to the highest and he did not lie alone 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.960
 that he was not referring to what the majority of 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.080
 the citizens thought he was not referring 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.390
 who likes to fly and it's only because 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.270
 what the government of Puebla has just 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.590
 acquire a third helicopter so that 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.560
 The young man is very happy flying from 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.100
 these helicopters agusta the two 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.140
 first cost the government of Puebla 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.570
 124 million pesos 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.780
 but just a month ago the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.390
 third contract of a helicopter that goes 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.340
 to cost 8 million dollars plus 3 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.309
 million extra 3 million dollars 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.020
 extra for rescue team so that 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.239
 the helicopter is going to cost the people 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.510
 of people because they do not pay for it brown 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.510
 valley the governor bullets 11 million 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.430
 dollars were out there very worried 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.720
 because they did not know what license plate they were going to 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.640
 place then he recommended his friend 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.190
 gerardo ruiz-esparza to the general director 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.440
 of civil aeronautics of the secretariat of 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.490
 communications and transportation that no longer 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.619
 put the same license plates to it 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.570
 registration to this new one because 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:26.470
 we had the letters r mv yes 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.770
 yes the helicopters of puebla have the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.109
 initials of the governor go to him 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.990
 the other recommendation that was made 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:37.090
 It was please do not go 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.119
 showing off with people that people 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.750
 it was poor look at a very 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.080
 interesting the company 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.970
 because he won the contract because there was no 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.850
 tender awarded it 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.909
 directly- it's the company I put it 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.499
 be of seve 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.719
 and this company was curiously the one 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:01.880
 transported the puppet who bought the 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.880
 presidency 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.720
 when I was in the state of mexico and 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.810
 during the campaign in 2012 this 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.750
 company became very powerful when 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.569
 enrique peña grandson- was in the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.460
 government of the state of mexico and now 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.680
 it seems to be growing 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.780
 the payment for this new helicopter comes 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.330
 of the federal budget assigned to 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.380
 public safety and with this helicopter 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.630
 the only one that will be sure is the 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.730
 probably not the legal argument that 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.190
 used to justify the expense is 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.110
 the aircraft will serve to 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.660
 security and civil protection work 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.880
 in Puebla as it was said in the purchase 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.650
 of the first two helicopters but in 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.170
 actually those two others the r mb that already 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.690
 has therefore served for the use of 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.810
 governor for officials and their 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.580
 friends several governors have been 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.230
 buying helicopters with resources 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.350
 to address issues of 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.030
 security and the intermediary has always 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.110
 been the company 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.950
 eolo plus is a dsb signature very friend of 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.760
 enrique peña grandson 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:20.150
 in fact the own club buy 14 ago 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.519
 little bit and they're standing maybe 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.540
 because they were detected a problem in the 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.640
 factory 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.370
 in the tail rotor as indicated 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.739
 some reports bought helicopters 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.810
 that serve us, we must underline that in 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.700
 less than three years have collapsed in 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.579
 the center of the country four helicopters 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.349
 of this kind, that is, this brings us to 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.019
 think that it's not so bad that rafael 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.900
 Moreno-Valle has bought a 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.360
 helicopter more hopefully and little god make us 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.660
 the miracle 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.610
 in this six year the government of Puebla 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.610
 reported the sale of two helicopters 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.610
 bell-412 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.830
 then the purchase of these three of these 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.390
 three new helicopters inside the 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.270
 village government inventory 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.410
 then there are still two 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.790
 helicopters bell 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:14.120
 both of us liked the new 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:18.790
 that a bell 206 helicopter will arrive 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.790
 a bell 402 helicopter 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.160
 all these equipped with vision 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.450
 Night of transfer capacity of 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.600
 charges the new helicopters according to 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.060
 government of the state of puebla as they are 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.360
 they can land in difficult places 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.650
 have access to a place to places 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.210
 restricted have very quick repurchase 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.780
 reconfiguration can be used 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.850
 to fight fires are effective 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.730
 for the civil protection area can 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.800
 act as rescue helicopters 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.620
 ambulance to organ transplants 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.190
 patrol and even transport of 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.950
 passengers but in reality it is that with 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.590
 all these benefits the water he has 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.860
 like in Puebla they serve to transfer 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.980
 governor to civil servants friends and 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.990
 beneficiaries of his six-year term while 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.180
 people suffer 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.440
 because money does not reach him while 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.660
 the town is poor 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.440
 rafael moreno-valle buys a new 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.440
 helicopter
