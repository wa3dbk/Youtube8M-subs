enough<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:08.160> be<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> factor<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.570> race

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
enough to be a factor in this race

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.600 
enough to be a factor in this race
because<00:00:09.840> he<00:00:10.230> started<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.769> ninth<00:00:11.010> place<00:00:11.250> he's

because he started in ninth place he's

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.820 
because he started in ninth place he's
had<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> longer<00:00:12.509> strategy<00:00:13.230> than<00:00:13.440> some<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.740> the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
had a longer strategy than some of the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.700 
had a longer strategy than some of the
others<00:00:14.040> 17<00:00:14.880> laps<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.360> fuel<00:00:15.630> going<00:00:16.080> into<00:00:16.560> his

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.070 
others 17 laps of fuel going into his
car<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.490> let's<00:00:17.730> see<00:00:17.940> where<00:00:18.180> he<00:00:18.210> exits<00:00:18.720> now<00:00:18.930> as

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
car and let's see where he exits now as

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.859 
car and let's see where he exits now as
he<00:00:19.199> comes<00:00:19.439> down<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.949> pit<00:00:20.130> lane<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.750> will<00:00:21.750> he's

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
he comes down the pit lane and will he's

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.230 
he comes down the pit lane and will he's
run<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> longer<00:00:22.650> strategy<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.340> say<00:00:23.699> will<00:00:24.029> this

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
run a longer strategy as I say will this

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.029 
run a longer strategy as I say will this
put<00:00:24.480> him<00:00:24.570> into<00:00:24.720> contention<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:25.980> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
put him into contention it's going to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.640 
put him into contention it's going to
come<00:00:26.160> out<00:00:26.279> i<00:00:26.340> think<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.730> third<00:00:27.060> position<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:28.289> an

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
come out i think in third position so an

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.070 
come out i think in third position so an
excellent<00:00:29.220> race<00:00:29.429> strategy<00:00:29.730> there<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.720> david

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
excellent race strategy there for david

stream<00:00:41.760> there<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.239> possibly<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:42.930> bit

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

stream there and possibly a little bit
of<00:00:43.230> touching<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.739> they<00:00:43.860> come<00:00:44.040> down<00:00:44.160> into<00:00:44.370> the

of touching as they come down into the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
chicane balia makes the move at the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.190 
chicane balia makes the move at the
inside<00:00:46.980> runs<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.760> tiny<00:00:48.059> bit<00:00:48.329> wide<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> think

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
inside runs a tiny bit wide but I think

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.600 
inside runs a tiny bit wide but I think
he's<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.770> make<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.070> move<00:00:50.250> stick<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
he's going to make that move stick and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.520 
he's going to make that move stick and
indeed<00:00:51.149> trauma<00:00:51.449> sleeker<00:00:51.780> hasn't<00:00:52.140> got<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> very

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
indeed trauma sleeker hasn't got a very

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.740 
indeed trauma sleeker hasn't got a very
good<00:00:52.680> run<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.850> chicane<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> good

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
good run out of the chicane so a good

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.560 
good run out of the chicane so a good
move<00:00:54.960> there<00:00:55.260> from<00:00:55.850> Bali<00:00:56.850> er<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.149> we've<00:00:57.300> seen

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
move there from Bali er but we've seen

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.920 
move there from Bali er but we've seen
how<00:00:57.840> much<00:00:58.109> slipstreams<00:00:58.770> compare<00:00:59.300> play<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> role

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
how much slipstreams compare play a role

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.900 
how much slipstreams compare play a role
in<00:01:00.960> today's<00:01:01.410> racing<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.280> trammels<00:01:02.670> lika
