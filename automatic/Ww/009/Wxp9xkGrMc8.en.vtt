00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
terraria 1.2 on all three consoles at

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.020 
terraria 1.2 on all three consoles at
the<00:00:40.020> same<00:00:40.260> time<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> end<00:00:41.280> they<00:00:41.790> won't

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the same time now in the end they won't

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.240 
the same time now in the end they won't
actually<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.899> same<00:00:43.079> release<00:00:43.379> date<00:00:43.649> just

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
actually have the same release date just

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.100 
actually have the same release date just
because<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.610> each<00:00:44.760> console<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> game<00:00:45.600> goes

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
because on each console the game goes

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.410 
because on each console the game goes
through<00:00:46.379> slightly<00:00:46.829> different<00:00:47.420> certification

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
through slightly different certification

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.779 
through slightly different certification
process<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> games<00:00:49.890> might<00:00:50.190> either<00:00:50.370> take<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
process so the games might either take a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.600 
process so the games might either take a
shorter<00:00:51.360> or<00:00:51.510> longer<00:00:51.600> time<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.800> depending<00:00:53.520> on

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
shorter or longer time on depending on

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.150 
shorter or longer time on depending on
which<00:00:53.789> console<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> end<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
which console it is so in the end the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.069 
which console it is so in the end the
release<00:00:56.430> dates<00:00:56.699> will<00:00:56.940> differ<00:00:57.180> slightly<00:00:57.420> but

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
release dates will differ slightly but

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.479 
release dates will differ slightly but
then<00:00:58.230> really<00:00:58.530> won't<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.039> much<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
then really won't be that much of a

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.450 
then really won't be that much of a
difference<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.270> I'm<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.600> excited<00:01:00.750> because

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
difference and I'm so excited because

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.340 
difference and I'm so excited because
