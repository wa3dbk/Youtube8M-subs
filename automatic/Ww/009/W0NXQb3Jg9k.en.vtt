00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
easiest to complete and go through all

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.840 
easiest to complete and go through all
the<00:02:26.470> time<00:02:27.540> alright<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:28.990> yes<00:02:29.260> never<00:02:29.680> enter<00:02:30.280> fake

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
the time alright so yes never enter fake

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.460 
the time alright so yes never enter fake
information<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.450> series<00:02:31.810> I've<00:02:31.990> learned<00:02:32.290> it

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
information on series I've learned it

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.380 
information on series I've learned it
before<00:02:32.830> from<00:02:33.310> china<00:02:33.550> complete<00:02:34.000> different

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
before from china complete different

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.410 
before from china complete different
different<00:02:34.870> surveys<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.740> every<00:02:36.700> time<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:36.940> enter

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
different surveys and every time I enter

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.450 
different surveys and every time I enter
the<00:02:37.540> fake<00:02:37.720> info<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.290> never<00:02:38.620> get<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.980> download

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
the fake info you never get the download

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.040 
the fake info you never get the download
so<00:02:39.700> that's<00:02:39.880> probably<00:02:40.180> why<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.480> guys<00:02:40.660> don't

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050
