creek here which is awesome sauce and
not<00:03:48.300> that<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.630> probably<00:03:48.840> mattered<00:03:49.200> to<00:03:49.320> much

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
not that it probably mattered to much

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.410 
not that it probably mattered to much
that<00:03:49.620> things<00:03:49.800> got<00:03:49.920> massive<00:03:50.400> ass<00:03:50.520> attack<00:03:50.970> and

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
that things got massive ass attack and

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.950 
that things got massive ass attack and
you<00:03:51.660> know<00:03:52.170> it's<00:03:52.470> um<00:03:52.740> it's<00:03:53.610> stabbed<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.510> you

you know it's um it's stabbed and you

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.270 
you know it's um it's stabbed and you
know<00:03:55.050> it's<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.260> recoil<00:03:55.620> move<00:03:55.860> so<00:03:56.040> it's<00:03:56.160> pretty

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
know it's a recoil move so it's pretty

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.190 
know it's a recoil move so it's pretty
powerful<00:03:56.670> so<00:03:57.120> probably<00:03:57.690> didn't<00:03:57.900> matter<00:03:57.990> whole

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
powerful so probably didn't matter whole

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.750
