pattern<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.560> little<00:01:32.040> bit<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.340> tech<00:01:32.579> inspired

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
a little bit of a metallic sheen to it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.469 
a little bit of a metallic sheen to it
but<00:01:34.920> again<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> kind<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.520> adds<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.000> depth<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
but again it kind of adds that depth and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.520 
but again it kind of adds that depth and
texture<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.960> helmet<00:01:37.110> which<00:01:37.320> make<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
kind of cool it almost looks at tear

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.370 
kind of cool it almost looks at tear
looks<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.180> tariffs<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.600> are<00:01:39.689> exposing<00:01:40.290> a

very advanced technologically inspired
brain<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> don't<00:01:43.439> even<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.740> means

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
brain I don't even know what that means

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.139 
brain I don't even know what that means
but<00:01:44.159> that's<00:01:44.250> where<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.549> helmet<00:01:44.729> speaks<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
but that's where this helmet speaks to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.399 
but that's where this helmet speaks to
me<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.689> turn<00:01:45.840> around<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> back<00:01:46.259> you're

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
me if we turn around the back you're

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.960 
me if we turn around the back you're
gonna<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.920> nice<00:01:47.220> wing<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:47.640> integrated

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
gonna see a nice wing that's integrated

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.069 
gonna see a nice wing that's integrated
here<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:48.450> gonna<00:01:48.600> tie<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
here that's gonna tie in with the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.240 
here that's gonna tie in with the
graphic<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.500> again<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.799> clear<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.159> can

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
