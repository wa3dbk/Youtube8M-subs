00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.019
 after we have the first part 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.310
 I have shown a little bit of playing 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.180
 check out the second part of 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.609
 silent hill 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.320
 it was released two years later in 2001 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.779
 and came back from the house konami though 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.220
 this time for the playstation 2 a thing 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.510
 that makes up the series is that at 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.339
 each continued another 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.989
 protagonist is played in the first part 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:39.519
 it was harry mason his daughter 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.290
 lost and here we are james 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.610
 sutherland's by a letter and 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.600
 His wife, Mary, three years ago 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.790
 died in the small town 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.170
 is lured 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.460
 so mysterious is the end 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.140
 City the main actor of the series 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.510
 not in which figures in it 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.100
 what happens first 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.870
 Of course, the improved graphic is in the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.730
 comparison to the first part of the jump of 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.920
 playstation 1 was to playstation 2 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.989
 just gigantic the playstation 2 was 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.879
 yes the next generation console and has 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.860
 at that time cost almost 900 mark 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.940
 Right at the beginning, you meet a woman 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.710
 alone on a deserted 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.539
 Cemetery in the thick fog in front of him 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.039
 Sign alone on one 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.840
 abandoned cemetery you can only two 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.890
 No one can see me far 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.080
 tell her that she does not do it for me 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.550
 it turns out brutally raped 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.679
 to be killed and buried 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.780
 only a fat poster with the 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.130
 inscription booms me hard anyway 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.390
 Let's talk to her and she will tell us 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.099
 that you are looking for your mother 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.509
 Why is everyone looking for them? 

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:28.840
 possible you people fucking in silent 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.640
 hill 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.759
 I think I have my car key 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.599
 It will definitely be misplaced in Silent Hill 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.340
 In any case, we leave the women 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.170
 raped her ways go what 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.910
 By the way, it is not up to me I have it 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.800
 try and find that again 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.239
 obligatory radio which us 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.340
 Acoustically listening to opponents in our area 

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:47.050
 indicates running old manner by 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.209
 his till and find more surprising 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.520
 not my car key but 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.720
 to an apartment block 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.920
 strangely, james hardly wonders 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.149
 about that the city is full with 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.160
 fishes and corpses 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.840
 i'm just mine i suppose 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.640
 drive into a city around a corpse 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.619
 Search the sent me a letter 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.360
 still bump into other corpses and 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.819
 I call the funny monsters 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.770
 cops or at least psychiatrists or who 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.849
 has so plump persisted toads 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.459
 just alone with the fucking 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.110
 Wooden boards introduce this james 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.280
 Sutherland must have an estimated eight kilo 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.470
 hauling in the knee 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.030
 but where can I find her nowhere 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.200
 probably also lies somewhere in 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.360
 silent hill and we have to look for her 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.950
 he goes on proven his 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.540
 tradition with perfect acoustic 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.980
 underlined psycho horror terror 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.650
 few puzzles in between 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.000
 and the old departure mode 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.910
 We already know from the first part 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.680
 although I am here 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.090
 a little less is represented in the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.830
 opposing design have the same as 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.300
 the sick shit come in and 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.980
 for example, there is something like that 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.750
 but halfway human looks like 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.180
 There is a second pair of torsos 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.950
 legs practically up 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.120
 once without the stupid belief but one 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.470
 some chains would have it for mine 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.910
 taste may be anyway 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.530
 I have to conclude that that 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.090
 play is just as well done 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.950
 like the first part only with better 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.140
 graphic it has a similar horror 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.700
 atmosphere the same game mechanics it 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.740
 everything is as in the predecessor only 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.690
 less departure mode so why find 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.520
 I the first part anyway better it 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.470
 Must have nostalgia and childhood memories 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.120
 his part 2 is still not 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.770
 less recommendable and even today 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.120
 especially worth a look 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.470
 the good story 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.470
 for this james 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.989
