00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:12.150
 I show another video of me today 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:14.849
 you like her 16.1.2011 while the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.180
 works on all devices on the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:24.150
 abos 612 is running ie all ipod 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:27.449
 touches all iphones and all ipads like that 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.650
 the first thing we do in the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.859
 settings 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.480
 here you see again 612 is on 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.920
 installed my device I shows that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.690
 here in an ipod touch the 4th 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.600
 internationalization as I said it works 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.800
 on all other devices too and that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.120
 first thing we do is with us 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.149
 disable the code lock it is indeed 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.210
 not necessarily required 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.600
 but is recommended in any case to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.670
 to avoid mistakes 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.329
 next we go to ebay.com and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.449
 Download the ebase file 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.670
 Version 1.4 is the link you can find 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.479
 again a video description and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.920
 Let's start this one 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:15.330
 after we have connected our device 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.770
 Let's just click jailbreak and that 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.770
 jailbreak process is started 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.560
 throughout the process should 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.630
 The device will not be used except on 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.549
 a place where we are asked 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.070
 whether to click the jailbreak app 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.200
 but I'll come to that later 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.460
 of which you should the best things from 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.390
 leave device so that lasts now 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.610
 while 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.990
 First the device is restarted and 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.390
 The jailbreak is being carried out 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.579
 I will share some of the jailbreak 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.950
 process that they are not completely 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.240
 take so long 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.240
 nevertheless, everything will be visible 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.310
 so that has almost five minutes now 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.380
 we take it now 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.960
 prompt the device to unlock and 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:33.500
 whether to click the jailbreaker 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:35.290
 I'm now even be found then 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.550
 mostly on the second page 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.610
 just click on it and we'll see it 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:56.870
 screen became short black and the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:03:00.280
 jailbreak process continues like this 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.470
 jailbreak is almost done with 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.080
 windows we are now finished or 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.300
 with which are how finished that can 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.790
 We will close the device now 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.290
 Restart independently several times and 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.620
 then you would have to see her already 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.620
 his 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:54.160
 once it's done we can do the ipod 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.160
 unlock and we see here too 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.760
 at the first start point cydia will be the 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.070
 file system prepared and also 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.760
 closes after that lasts one 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.910
 quite a while at times I play now 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.290
 before as a message of the 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.210
 memory is almost full 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.750
 The message comes as well as we always do 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.640
 Just click on finished and 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.760
 the ignore with the memory is 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.950
 everything cheese is almost completely funny 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:32.840
 wise, this process always comes with the process 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:35.080
 message so that 's quite normal so that 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.880
 has now taken almost five minutes 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:43.070
 after it's done the apple is too 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.020
 then see and then the lockscreen 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.050
 We can just do it again 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:56.150
 lock up and we open it again 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:58.310
 we are asked how we are 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:05.270
 click on user and press 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:11.800
 finished so now the south city side 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.800
 loaded and we succeeded 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.480
 16.1.2011 it was already from me and 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.990
 then I would say bye and bye 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.990
 next time
