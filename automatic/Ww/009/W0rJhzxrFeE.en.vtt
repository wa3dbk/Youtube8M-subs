00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.820
 and we're going to need 220 grams of 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:09.220
 70% dark chocolate can be this 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.370
 that go drops or can be from pill 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:17.350
 desserts 220 grams of butter without 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:21.930
 salt 4 eggs 70 grams of flour 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.990
 pastry 220 grams of sugar 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.650
 a teaspoon of yeast and a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.500
 handful of nuts we will also throw 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.980
 some chocolate pearls for the part 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.980
 over 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.050
 let's prepare it in a very 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.989
 simple let's put a saucepan with 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.970
 a little water to undo the 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.510
 butter with the chocolate 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.670
 we put it together and what 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.670
 we put inside the pan careful 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.040
 do not 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.990
 until everything is well mixed 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.770
 meanwhile in a crystal bowl 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:08.200
 let's put the flour 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.200
 one teaspoon of yeast 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.920
 sugar this we are going to walk 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.330
 well sifted first that takes 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.420
 pick up a little volume and then if 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.479
 has some flour impurities left 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.479
 there we are going to see the sugar 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.570
 but let's mix 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.890
 and now let's add the four eggs 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.820
 and with some rods we are going to mix 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.820
 strongly 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.750
 and see how it unwinds the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.750
 butter and melting chocolate 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.120
 we'll leave it until it falls apart 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.120
 complete 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.010
 you have to split the energetically mind to 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.000
 that stays a more homogeneous cream 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.000
 smooth without lumps 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.650
 for a couple of minutes while 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.180
 keep undoing the butter together 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.760
 with the chocolate we are going to chop 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.640
 knife the nuts to roughly for 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.189
 that stay in the find 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.700
 trips of the month so you do not stay 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.700
 very chopped 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.030
 Well, we can see that there is 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.459
 chocolate with butter 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.290
 completely dissolved we have it 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.939
 let cool a few minutes so that it 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.590
 temper because if we put it in 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.719
 the mixture of eggs we risk 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.909
 that of which it coagulates in the eggs 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.010
 then we leave it a little bit that 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.959
 atempere and meanwhile we are going to 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.959
 prepare the mold in which we are going to 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.210
 baking the brownie is a mold always 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.060
 rectangular 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.370
 and we are going to use sulfurized paper 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.610
 tissue paper this paper does not need to 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.700
 we put previously butter and 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.300
 flour or anything that a trick for the 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.420
 square molds that I use 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:33.210
 is to do in the corner and with a clamp 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.210
 of clothes the subjects to paint 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.810
 ok we have the season tempered 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.480
 the cream with butter and 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:46.790
 melted chocolate and we're going to add it 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.400
 to the egg cream flour and sugar 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.640
 we use everything well 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.989
 taking advantage of that we have an invoice or 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.989
 a language in this case 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:08.160
 and we are going to mix vigorously 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.160
 that is all well mixed 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.670
 At this point we will add the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.670
 walnuts 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.239
 that we had previously chopped 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.239
 we mix 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.210
 and with a spatula 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.650
 a language that picks up well what 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.699
 we put 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.699
 in the mold 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.740
 that we have previously put the paper 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.740
 so we're going to introduce it into the 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:56.110
 oven and we'll have it 25 minutes 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.110
 maximum at 200 degrees 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.670
 the goal of this brownie or brownie 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.070
 is that it is quite juicy for the 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.060
 center 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.900
 time has passed and we have 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.410
 prepared ready our 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.509
 delicious brown sponge cake we will let 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.460
 it cools here on the grid and then 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.240
 we will serve it accompanied by a ball of 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.650
 vanilla ice cream 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.650
 we cut a portion 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.500
 square 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.220
 and we are going to divide 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:36.900
 between diagonal parts we're going to 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.900
 put in the center of the plate 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.740
 has stayed with a phenomenal aspect 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:52.300
 we will accompany it with a ball of 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.300
 ice cream in this case chocolate 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.889
 a little 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:01.499
 of syrup 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.499
 strawberry of some color point 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:10.369
 a little bit of chocolate syrup for the 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.369
 top of the brownie 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.050
 a cherry that will give you our point 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.530
 and a little bit of sugar rain 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.009
 try it you'll love and
