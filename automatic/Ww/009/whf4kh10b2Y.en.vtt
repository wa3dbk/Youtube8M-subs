00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.940
 action 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.950
 we have located in asturias the country 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.460
 Basque apart from the request for permits 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.170
 I expected the weather 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.010
 will improve that's why I think it has been a 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.010
 of the most complicated things 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.960
 there are two cameras the usual sense is one 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.750
 it's an epic a fairly new camera 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.660
 in market output that can roll 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.270
 up to 300 400 frames per second and 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.610
 a phantom 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.610
 gets to roll up to 800 bulls 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.110
 how are they going to be running so that 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.900
 do not bother your hair too much because some 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.030
 picked up something we have clothes very 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.520
 very urban casual because the idea is 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.259
 try to avoid the very sporty theme 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.500
 I think there are about 800 more garments or 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.500
 less 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.710
 we are in the wind park of the garki 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.159
 there located on the border between 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.170
 Guipúzcoa and Álava and this park is one 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.150
 of the most efficient from the point of 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.150
 energetic view of iberdrola renewable 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.130
 the true protagonist of this 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.270
 ad is the wind is actually the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.610
 trigger of the whole story 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.560
 We discover a lost character 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.270
 for that date to run and joins a 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.820
 queue of people that is endless 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.049
 we go through landscapes and more landscapes 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.049
 sensations of hundreds of thousands of 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.240
 people that form a human row what 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.560
 which is the whole row of the play that 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.270
 it takes us to the players of the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.289
 selection and to the last player who is the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.289
 that tops and medium good 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.019
 23 45 we will see each other 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.710
 but try to get a high effect 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.970
 speed and like that people like in 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.400
 all running one after the other and 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.290
 As it is impossible that it is so close and 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.420
 so stuck we do it only by layers the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.310
 challenge is a bit like it's recorded at 800 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.430
 frames per second as the material 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.430
 what we have to handle is very much 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.650
 it's practically a challenge not because 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.900
 hands of the effect of the wind 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.440
 metaphorically through the people that 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.410
 it goes like 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.870
 a domino effect is not easy but I 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.800
 I think we've gotten through 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.530
 the high speed that helps a lot and 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.690
 the effect of moving from the the let's say the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.160
 domino effect by many many places 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.160
 different and many landscapes 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.959
 at the player's exit 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.450
 then it is divided into two phases by 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.219
 one side three days of filming by 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.099
 different locations in the north of 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:23.739
 españá all outside and on the other hand 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.680
 all the shooting with the players of the 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.409
 Spanish football team for it 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.290
 we have 90 minutes in a 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:35.099
 concentration they had in the city 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.099
 of soccer in the rozas 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.410
 okay
