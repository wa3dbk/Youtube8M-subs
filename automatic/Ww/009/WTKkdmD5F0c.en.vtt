this because I'm em actually returning

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.229 
this because I'm em actually returning
this<00:05:38.709> I<00:05:39.709> found<00:05:40.189> one<00:05:40.309> hundred<00:05:40.610> twelve<00:05:40.849> dollars

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:41.239 
this I found one hundred twelve dollars

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:44.769 
this I found one hundred twelve dollars
on<00:05:41.419> this<00:05:41.599> which<00:05:41.869> is<00:05:42.139> crap<00:05:42.829> and<00:05:43.329> it's<00:05:44.329> not<00:05:44.599> a

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:44.779 
on this which is crap and it's not a

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:49.299 
on this which is crap and it's not a
good<00:05:45.019> device<00:05:45.499> um<00:05:46.959> so<00:05:47.959> basically<00:05:48.259> I<00:05:48.829> wouldn't

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:49.309

good device um so basically I wouldn't
recommend<00:05:49.579> this<00:05:49.909> because<00:05:50.149> it<00:05:50.449> freezes<00:05:50.719> when

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
recommend this because it freezes when

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.889 
recommend this because it freezes when
