00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
 but 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.780
 this cut off get burned to hit that 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.760
 is called self-injure our guest to 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.990
 to investigate five years on this subject 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.760
 of teens and young adults in a 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.160
 hospital setting or via internet 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.660
 baptist bursa hello you are 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.970
 sociologist or to be devoted so a 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.830
 book to this theme hurting oneself a 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.020
 youth self-control and that comes from 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.340
 to appear at alma publishers we know but 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.320
 when we talk about this topic to the magazine 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.390
 often are psychologists from 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.430
 psychiatrists who deals with this topic 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.860
 what is a shrink during this 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.809
 that a sociologist brings as a 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.580
 new but let's say that the approach 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.140
 psychological or psychiatric part of the 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.790
 principle that self-injury is a 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.909
 pathological behavior that would 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.470
 heal and that causes or 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.909
 the explanation of this behavior lies 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.750
 inside of individuals while 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.059
 me as a sociologist 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.650
 I tried to understand not in 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.449
 as long as pathological or 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.280
 normal what is the purpose of self harm in 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.720
 everyday life and seek 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.580
 the explanation in the situation in 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.470
 which are placed the individuals in 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.869
 their relationship to their surroundings by 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.119
 example the ccpt at the company place then 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.979
 we will try to define them already this 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.689
 self mutilation what is it then in all 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.390
 case me as stake defines it is 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.759
 as an aggressive auto activity 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.829
 regular and willful without purpose 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.020
 sexual aesthetic and without 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.130
 social recognition 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.850
 so to investigate you have you are 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.770
 went to psychiatric services 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.509
 that too is pretty classic but what 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.090
 which is more original spread on 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.500
 internet forums dedicated to this subject yes 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.570
 exactly there are forms 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.380
 specifically devoted to the practice of 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.270
 self mutilation 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.380
 there are some francophone and 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.810
 more on the English-speaking web it's 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.219
 mutual aid forums ie where the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.929
 Internet users connect to exchange 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.780
 experiences and exchange 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.590
 information to support himself also he 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.630
 are a lot of things going on 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.140
 in and by private message by mail 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.179
 instant 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.249
 also if by a surfer goes bad he 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.090
 a whole network of people who are there 

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:01.640
 to support him 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.469
 once he has integrated then that is 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.210
 self-harm concretely it can be 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.569
 a whole cd stabbing of 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.000
 the history of d2 compas burns 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.310
 so cuts from the burns of 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.450
 costs on oneself mostly on 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.180
 the forearms but it can be all 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.250
 the parts of the body labeaume 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.459
 thighs and good after all is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.109
 possible they each are different 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.689
 but in that they have in common that this 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.769
 that you have noted is that the purpose of 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.189
 this self- mutilation is to 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.340
 channel 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:33.370
 yes it is to self-control is to 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.980
 to say that the practice of self 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.659
 mutilation makes a change 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.670
 physical emotional one seeks to spread 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.040
 an emotion a sensation it can be 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.370
 from the anguish of sadness etc for 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.629
 self control and continue to 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.400
 live his daily activities is this 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.669
 that it can also be to refrain from 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.400
 to move to a criminal offense for example 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:56.680
 so criminal I never have I 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.439
 never heard that against that can 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.060
 to be a way of refraining from doing 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.609
 other things such as 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.200
 suicide attempts and what is 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.510
 young people say of reasons 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.919
 deep of those of which brings to this 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.829
 gesture what is it essentially 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.930
 socialization problems yes so me 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.519
 I worked talking about 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.689
 interviews with people concerned 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.900
 or who were concerned by this 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.569
 practice is what stands out is that 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.280
 mostly they accuse or so 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.799
 they make their family life 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.459
 one of the main causes of their harm 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.720
 to be this family configuration me 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.040
 I tried to analyze it in terms of 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.419
 social positioning ie 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.769
 I studied how the problem is 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.199
 formulated in terms of position in the 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.099
 society ie class position 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.349
 of success 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.840
 success or their gender position 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:50.560
 also have a man's identity a 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.810
 woman's identity is overall it's 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.340
 explain it end the explanation that 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.949
 given by people it's 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.389
 the explanation in itself is conflict 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.819
 that result from problem of 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.069
 social positioning for example of 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.389
 teenagers who say they suffer from 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.769
 pressure from their family 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:09.030
 for their academic success for the 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.459
 social success for them to show themselves 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.900
 as a world finally for example 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.670
 it's not necessarily children in check 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.620
 school it can be teenagers 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.329
 very bright who called me early 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.109
 self-help it's not at all linked by 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.880
 example at school level 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.889
 yes I find it important to emphasize 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.590
 than the people I met 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.180
 in my survey it's not teenagers 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.440
 completely marginalized young people 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.490
 desocialized whose opinion is 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.460
 apocalyptic it's often 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.050
 people who are more or less 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.919
 socially integrated if we can say 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.000
 that they succeed but precisely who 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.460
 serve their car practice 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.620
 mutilation to continue to hold the 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.430
 shot then what is that scoring 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.740
 also it is they are not 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.560
 exhibitionist a milk is said especially 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.470
 multi is not about to show it 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.970
 no no most people at 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.720
 contrary seek to conceal they 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.400
 implement genuine 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.169
 hiding strategy for not 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.430
 that we see their mark and that too 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.830
 this is an important point to emphasize 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.660
 since I have often heard that 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.010
 self-harm would be like a kind 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.100
 call for help turned outward 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.990
 but in fact even if it is a practice 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.970
 producing scars that are 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.200
 visible and durably visible and well 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.900
 finally the people concerned the 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.690
 hide and try to keep their 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.560
 practices for herself and you say 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.850
 that in general when they stop 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.110
 self-injury is to go to 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.580
 something else that will relieve them 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:29.130
 also so yes there are possible 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.539
 changes in practices for example the 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.880
 most common is the people who 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.750
 stop self mutilation or who is 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.370
 they then experiencing unrest 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.630
 anorexia or 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.830
 the downpour of people who stop 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.930
 become anorexic and who starts the 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.030
 use theme in a course 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.430
 actually difficult harcourt and often 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.900
 even people who stop 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.840
 to self-harm continually 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.550
 regularly continue to have this 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.350
 sort of provisions or reflex on 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.140
 could say to self aggression from 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.030
 that there is a difficult moment even though 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.800
 do not start again thank you 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.930
 many people hurt themselves 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.340
 youth self-control and baptist 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.650
 brushard which you understood well it is 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.060
 the eye of a sociologist on this on this 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.130
 gesture that we often analyze about 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.890
 Psychic side is at home publishers thank you 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.880
 a lot also at 2:30 pm at the doctor's going 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.880
 be devoted to infections
