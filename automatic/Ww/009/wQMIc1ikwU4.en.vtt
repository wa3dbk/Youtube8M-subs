00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
them you know i can't emphasize it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.330 
them you know i can't emphasize it
enough<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:54.200> know<00:01:54.320> how<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.920> would<00:01:55.010> have<00:01:55.160> saved

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
enough you know how it would have saved

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.450 
enough you know how it would have saved
me<00:01:55.610> in<00:01:55.850> my<00:01:56.690> accident<00:01:57.170> obviously<00:01:57.950> people<00:01:57.980> like

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
me in my accident obviously people like

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.210 
me in my accident obviously people like
GE<00:01:58.730> and<00:01:59.030> Penny<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.620> know<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.860> older

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
GE and Penny and you know the older

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.980 
GE and Penny and you know the older
riders<00:02:01.400> who<00:02:01.730> have<00:02:01.820> been<00:02:01.970> riding<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.480> long<00:02:02.750> time

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
riders who have been riding a long time

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.690 
riders who have been riding a long time
aren't<00:02:03.470> suddenly<00:02:03.830> going<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.070> swap<00:02:04.280> over<00:02:04.490> and

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
aren't suddenly going to swap over and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.400 
aren't suddenly going to swap over and
that's<00:02:04.970> lessens<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.720> reason<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.260> you<00:02:06.380> know

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
that's lessens the reason to you know

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.620 
that's lessens the reason to you know
but<00:02:06.800> I<00:02:07.010> think<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.610> younger<00:02:07.880> riders<00:02:08.149> coming

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
but I think the younger riders coming

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.080 
but I think the younger riders coming
through<00:02:08.660> I<00:02:09.100> think<00:02:10.100> if<00:02:10.220> they<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.610> learn<00:02:10.820> to

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
through I think if they can learn to

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.330 
through I think if they can learn to
ride<00:02:11.300> with<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.570> neck<00:02:11.750> brace<00:02:11.780> then<00:02:12.350> it's<00:02:13.070> only

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
ride with a neck brace then it's only

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.740 
ride with a neck brace then it's only
got<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.580> be<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> benefit<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.270> know<00:02:14.390> if<00:02:14.510> they<00:02:14.690> can

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
got to be a benefit you know if they can

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.870 
got to be a benefit you know if they can
get<00:02:15.410> through<00:02:15.470> their<00:02:15.830> careers<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.370> injury

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
get through their careers that injury

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.040 
get through their careers that injury
them<00:02:17.210> they're<00:02:17.390> going<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.540> ride<00:02:17.750> longer

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
them they're going to ride longer

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.530 
them they're going to ride longer
they're<00:02:18.320> going<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.500> be<00:02:18.590> more<00:02:18.740> confident<00:02:19.250> I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
they're going to be more confident I

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.270
