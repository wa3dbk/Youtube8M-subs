an upper brain it has the capability of
self-awareness<00:01:15.860> intellect<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.430> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
self-awareness intellect it is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.760 
self-awareness intellect it is
manipulating<00:01:18.509> something<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.380> does<00:01:19.590> not

have those that be the dog which it just

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.100 
have those that be the dog which it just
basically<00:01:23.490> lives<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.060> instinct<00:01:24.720> is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
basically lives on instinct is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.310 
basically lives on instinct is

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
the sole benefit of the upper brain

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.039 
the sole benefit of the upper brain
creature<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:38.560> being<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.340> douchebag<00:01:40.049> human

creature that being a douchebag human

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.469 
creature that being a douchebag human
being<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:42.100> let's<00:01:42.280> compare<00:01:42.640> that<00:01:42.700> what's

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
being so let's compare that what's

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.230 
being so let's compare that what's
compared<00:01:43.990> adult<00:01:44.380> fighting<00:01:44.950> with<00:01:45.579> Pokemon

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
compared adult fighting with Pokemon

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.469 
compared adult fighting with Pokemon
battles<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.799> but<00:01:48.219> first<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.880> have<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.060> look<00:01:49.270> at

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
battles so but first you have to look at

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.809 
battles so but first you have to look at
the<00:01:49.569> Pokemon<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.469> hidden<00:01:50.799> in<00:01:51.009> his<00:01:51.130> biology

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
the Pokemon and hidden in his biology

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.510 
the Pokemon and hidden in his biology
how<00:01:52.689> does<00:01:52.899> a<00:01:52.929> Pokemon<00:01:53.649> become<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.280> better

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
how does a Pokemon become a better

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.809 
how does a Pokemon become a better
version<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:55.060> itself<00:01:55.560> through<00:01:56.560> evolution<00:01:57.250> how

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
version of itself through evolution how

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.669 
version of itself through evolution how
does<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.149> achieve<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.719> or<00:01:58.959> well<00:01:59.409> for<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
does it achieve that or well for the

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.190 
does it achieve that or well for the
most<00:01:59.829> part<00:01:59.979> most<00:02:00.789> of<00:02:01.090> them<00:02:01.240> how<00:02:01.599> do<00:02:01.659> most<00:02:01.990> of

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
most part most of them how do most of

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.889 
most part most of them how do most of
them<00:02:02.349> evolve<00:02:02.789> through<00:02:03.789> battling<00:02:04.360> becoming

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
them evolve through battling becoming

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.550 
them evolve through battling becoming
stronger<00:02:05.439> and<00:02:05.890> more<00:02:06.039> skilled<00:02:06.489> in<00:02:06.810> battling<00:02:07.810> so

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
stronger and more skilled in battling so

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.319 
stronger and more skilled in battling so
what<00:02:08.769> does<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:08.979> tell<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.519> what<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.179> that

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
what does that tell you what is that

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.539 
what does that tell you what is that
where<00:02:10.569> does<00:02:10.750> that<00:02:10.899> line<00:02:11.110> up<00:02:11.140> thinking<00:02:11.680> where

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
where does that line up thinking where

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.250 
where does that line up thinking where
does<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.849> take<00:02:12.879> you<00:02:13.209> where<00:02:13.599> do<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.750> arrive<00:02:14.019> at

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
this is it's not wrong and it's not

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.499 
this is it's not wrong and it's not
abuse<00:04:22.800> especially<00:04:23.220> when<00:04:23.729> everybody<00:04:24.270> is

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
abuse especially when everybody is

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.420 
abuse especially when everybody is
willing<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.169> that's<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.620> capacity<00:04:26.250> to

willing and that's the capacity to
reason<00:04:26.699> and<00:04:27.180> decide<00:04:27.840> whether<00:04:28.650> they<00:04:28.860> want<00:04:29.099> to

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
reason and decide whether they want to

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.450 
reason and decide whether they want to
do<00:04:29.250> this<00:04:29.520> or<00:04:29.789> that<00:04:29.930> so<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.139> to<00:04:31.410> me<00:04:31.590> completely

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
do this or that so that to me completely

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.390 
do this or that so that to me completely
debunks<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:34.110> thought<00:04:34.590> process<00:04:35.160> behind

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
debunks the thought process behind

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.540 
debunks the thought process behind
saying<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.690> alleging<00:04:37.199> that<00:04:37.380> Pokemon<00:04:38.190> battles

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
saying and alleging that Pokemon battles

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.909 
saying and alleging that Pokemon battles
are<00:04:38.789> equivalent<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.449> animal<00:04:39.870> abuse<00:04:40.169> which

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
are equivalent to animal abuse which

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.640 
are equivalent to animal abuse which
leads<00:04:41.190> me<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.370> my<00:04:41.550> next<00:04:41.699> point<00:04:42.090> it's<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.169> pretty

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
leads me to my next point it's a pretty

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.379 
leads me to my next point it's a pretty
bold<00:04:43.979> statement<00:04:44.099> and<00:04:44.789> its<00:04:45.060> really<00:04:45.240> the

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
bold statement and its really the

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.070 
bold statement and its really the
complete<00:04:45.900> opposite<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:47.310> wave<00:04:47.970> for<00:04:48.479> office<00:04:48.930> in

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
complete opposite the wave for office in

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.730 
complete opposite the wave for office in
of<00:04:49.560> abuse<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:50.849> manipulation<00:04:51.720> I<00:04:51.900> believe<00:04:52.530> the

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
of abuse in manipulation I believe the

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.040 
of abuse in manipulation I believe the
Pokemon<00:04:53.310> absolutely<00:04:54.120> need<00:04:54.389> their<00:04:54.660> trainer

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
Pokemon absolutely need their trainer

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.520 
Pokemon absolutely need their trainer
think<00:04:56.009> of<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:56.220> like<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.669> a<00:04:56.970> football<00:04:57.840> team<00:04:58.050> as

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
think of it like this a football team as

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.040 
think of it like this a football team as
a<00:04:58.590> team<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:59.190> strategists<00:04:59.759> and<00:05:00.030> coaches<00:05:00.599> to

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
a team of strategists and coaches to

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.860 
a team of strategists and coaches to
come<00:05:01.259> up<00:05:01.440> with<00:05:01.530> plays<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.280> watch<00:05:03.090> videotapes

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
come up with plays and watch videotapes

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.110 
come up with plays and watch videotapes
and<00:05:04.199> work<00:05:04.740> on<00:05:05.039> different<00:05:05.400> ways<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.789> make<00:05:05.910> that

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
and work on different ways to make that

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.589 
and work on different ways to make that
team<00:05:06.360> better<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:07.169> provide<00:05:08.039> strategy<00:05:08.880> that's

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
team better to provide strategy that's

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.080 
team better to provide strategy that's
what<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.840> trainer<00:05:10.169> is<00:05:10.409> to<00:05:10.440> a<00:05:10.620> Pokemon<00:05:11.099> there<00:05:11.940> are

two halves to a whole the trainer is the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.520
