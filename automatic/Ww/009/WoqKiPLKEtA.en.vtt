00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:13.809
 so this situation is not really what nobody is really 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.049
 a performance 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.460
 a figure that will bring us closer to a corpus of texts and above all to an idea 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.570
 or for them r I really wanted to talk about them 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.020
 mckay what was the condition today of hunger is to say what is 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.859
 what it meant to be a woman today 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.689
 supposed to be in a feminist register 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.739
 we said it's really about telling ourselves 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.260
 if you have to be a woman today I read in the newspaper weapons 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.170
 young people who are currently saying the 166 seats because the 67 'supporters 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.760
 the debate finally is it really curious 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.080
 then options as a woman and I that I started some kind of mini 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.750
 survey with interviews 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.690
 he became 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.600
 no way about twenty monologues 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.350
 these models are also collected by actresses 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.350
 by phone because the idea also was the inverted the game 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.200
 the saint-viateur erotic school and really your word 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.989
 finally help them 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.270
 women talking about famines 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.300
 when you want to base yourself on safari scenery 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.900
 who are there to make pretty render but all of a sudden 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 what is happening in their country 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.740
 a certain sum actually this was done at servette de geneva 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.530
 it's really something of a story and the reconciliation 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.110
 and not at all in a big stadium 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.070
 m that same street 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.420
 the committee 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.600
 35 5% 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.960
 it reminds me of being adopted at the spa 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.960
 this is definitely a trick in his bag 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.990
 when I do not position myself as a director is not my case 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.480
 just like ottawa 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.540
 the idea was to find in a month 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.910
 a mean or a little then steve 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.100
 he gave in mind a personal experience 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.100
 other spectators who make him think finally on stage 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.100
 course as before 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.370
 as listener what ultimately today me I notice that people 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.550
 confide more calm 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.950
 the neighboring misfortunes when we thought we were going 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.630
 the forums abounds 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.349
 of duster world 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.239
 the two extremely personal confessions the trick is that sometimes 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.619
 rarely bearable to anything to say 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:19.249
 and it's exciting can question the stop today the privacy that 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.669
 is it in this way of intimacy archives 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.199
 of the order of the bearable what are we able to accept while 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.679
 finally this is happening 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.089
 % nearby your house 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:32.099
 sometimes this thesis that it is the opinion of us to align or not know how to go 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.979
 to win last chanted 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.449
 but they come from very sexy backgrounds and his secretary and sony 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:39.879
 the teacher even certain 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.909
 and finally% they need to do this job there sometimes because 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.919
 that they need to have money but also for other reasons and that 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.909
 a little questioned this sextape face down 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.919
 women launched women and these women 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.930
 however it's really important it's because it's a great feeling is 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:59.480
 past i'm not going to say i'm in libya 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.770
 Ben shit it gives away things it's really finding this season 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.889
 to think 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.389
 why there are still thirty tables around 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.389
 woman sexuality of women and power 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.069
 It is unfair 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.819
 you chose to wait for half an hour 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.759
 it's not a but is happening 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.159
 it does not happen to me that it was decided like that 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.139
 the princess was the proposal 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.129
 however not dead it was made to us but it is true that this performance 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.389
 halal he already existed a second time in the cities in a year in a 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.529
 large garden 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.839
 for the day six women in the public space and the couple 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.809
 except that it's interesting that this performance by grabbing a room 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.239
 class apart from an event do 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.569
 and I would even like this performance is due for the rush for 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.139
 hundred who can have defense of a blow spent his evening about thirty 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.459
 women that would be 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.609
 stop the ground do you interest me dr theater clients meeting 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.849
 interaction 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.279
 with the help of the door which some who is not exactly a spectator of 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:03.039
 theater 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:06.679
 but it's suddenly the forum I think it's not bad after audi in 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:07.499
 two and a half hours
