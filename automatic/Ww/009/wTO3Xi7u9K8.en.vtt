and<00:01:45.340> what's<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.579> waterproof<00:01:47.179> rating<00:01:47.390> on

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
and what's the waterproof rating on

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.809 
and what's the waterproof rating on
these<00:01:47.869> these<00:01:48.500> have<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.740> 10,000<00:01:49.520> mm
