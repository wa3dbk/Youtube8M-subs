00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.940
 little a little bit a little text stuff 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.980

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.580
 now so without craft quality 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.720
 while they are not necessarily going 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.100

 here with 3 stickers good it was 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.060
 not the one I wanted what I believe 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.530
 that they were not necessarily very 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.480

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.650
