00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.400
 the people here are in the series 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.900
 Natalyis barely gets a new video of this 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.279
 I've got a career mode gossip 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.020
 do not index him hpi at the English 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.250
 youtuber first seen i dont know 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.119
 whether he is in the german community already 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.009
 is known 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.390
 but I think at relatively handy for 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.160
 those who also like it 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.390
 maybe a career player too 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.860
 You do not usually buy them otherwise 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.030
 It can also be achieved relatively easily 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.950
 you have not somehow her a 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.630
 reverse back and triple 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.489
 Regentanz or so you can be relative 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.600
 remember well and I would say so 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.010
 I explain my first step, however 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.539
 of course it would be mega consider you 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.980
 the whole thumb up here 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.840
 Write and write a comment 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.129
 otherwise you can work with you 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.829
 I would like to help you again but 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.250
 I'm not asked on the xbox 360 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.750
 So xbox and ps3 are the ones that are the click 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.250
 Definitely feasible and I think 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.289
 the psp he should be feasible if 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.539
 it goes on the other consoles too 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.980
 so first of course here players 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.809
 Search I guess however clear 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.490
 of course every player choose from ms 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.909
 as because of the ventilation pretty much join 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.310
 wool 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.840
 wants to play for barcelona and gives there 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.030
 there are always a few problems with his 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.440
 contract of the end, but not more 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.000
 cristiano ronaldo that's it 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.500
 to have a very nice player 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.660
 Of course , there you go first and 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.520
 made a purchase request de madrid there 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.200
 Of course, this is a lot here 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.580
 Unfortunately, we only have to stash 55 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.350
 Million listed here first 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.640
 bit the whole coal is 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.140
 In the end, no matter you lose the money 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.520
 not he loses no player if 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.530
 plus there is to them I can see here 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.030
 sometimes without any consideration also any hazard 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.650
 Add the relatively high 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.420
 Market value that's why I hope that 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.790
 you will accept the offer too 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.260
 think that the abnormal dubai jersey like 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.070
 certainly not bad either 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.020
 the career 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.130
 and yes, we'll see each other once 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.780
 Hopefully , offer has accepted 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.700
 as hoped for three times, of course 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.260
 our transfer offer accepted in the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.240
 old do not worry you can 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.950
 quiet extremely high deals with 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.930
 the team will definitely accept 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.250
 and I have here in the Passat yet 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.540
 given you lose the player 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.830
 Of course not defined a 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.390
 transfer budget 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.130
 We can get involved in the negotiation here 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.660
 with cristian ronaldo we go offer 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.640
 Just give him the salary that he has 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.170
 would like to have the contract period 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.590
 No matter you like to spend five years 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.510
 but it does not have any here 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.489
 no real advantage evil longer 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.860
 contract to choose and the most important 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.019
 you have to watch the role in the squad 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.090
 In the future tribe give gives him 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.280
 playing the rotation gives you the other hand 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.660
 offered is not possible and unfortunately 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.280
 you should be an essential tribal player 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.750
 give would accept the contract offer 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.680
 that your future trio we 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.629
 See you soon if he hopes 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.629
 Of course the contract offer refuses 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.840
 So, as expected, Christian Roder 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.430
 Of course, every contract offer 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.379
 I declined my role in the team 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.790
 Of course way too bad and now 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.349
 here very important with which we now no 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.670
 new contract offer is coming now 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.099
 here's the real fishy we go 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.510
 back on transfers of course you too 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.799
 It is also important for players to go search 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.599
 and not if wunschschliste the player 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.849
 should even be registered here 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.129
 we can see again on the 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.450
 click mattrick contact sell 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.069
 Now we are writing our first one 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.390
 transfer offer given 0 euro 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.140
 we do not give you a transfer fee 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.849
 player 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.290
 real madrid will not offer 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.329
 can refuse because we still have the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.870
 message from cristiano ronaldo in the office 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.459
 to have 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.019
 That's why we can still stay in the week 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.000
 offer a contract and we have, so to speak 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.890
 the first transfer offers to say 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.840
 overwritten and of course means 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.730
 that we will not pay a transfer fee 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.799
 we're just going to go new here 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.560
 Quotation yes we forgot this 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.760
 ultimately have too little salary budget 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.200
 this does not do me any way 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.579
 Sorry so would fit to accept that 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.989
 no contracts are not represented 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.060
 stories gratton bit faded 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.200
 hurts me when mega lights are the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.239
 most of you probably already 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.880
 duly they commit themselves in the 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.459
 old 375,000 you want to have 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.900
 the length to five years but that the 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.489
 best he should still accept and 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.079
 very important here we give now 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.760
 First of all, we want his tribe player 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.049
 Of course this is accepted as an offer 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.730
 and who like us when he is 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.730
 hopefully the offer also accepted 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.900
 so christian ronal has our offer 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.609
 We can accept here now completely 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.370
 easy and current offer is accept 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.569
 top left that we buy the transfers 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.190
 of course, that have their fixed 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.019
 undertake for five years and to 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.579
 We do not pay any fee 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.019
 no additional player what 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.459
 Our first offer was, so to speak 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.440
 deleted have overwritten it 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.940
 we can easily accept her 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.739
 See the transfer budget from us 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.539
 salary budget, of course, unfortunately and 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.340
 that is why not completely free 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.750
 Actually we do not have to 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.680
 transfer pay no more sometimes even 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.900
 of prejudice 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.430
 certainly enough players to buy with 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.539
 big club makes in any case too 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.729
 a bit of fun you can of course 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.350
 here's the crazy thing to do 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.419
 of course, to pick up cristiano ronaldo 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.949
 that I still see other players you 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.330
 first added to the team here he is 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.039
 not borrowed or so completely 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.630
 normal clip can now synonymous completely 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.740
 play with him in our normal 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.509
 Of course, transfer budget is whole 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.710
 normal remained the same as I said 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.330
 Real video has fallen during the 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.650
 valuation quite cool it up 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.729
 I would be really excited and mega 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.800
 Write my comments too 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.060
 works as you should have said 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.410
 You can have problems in the video 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.699
 description was already I will that 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.320
 whole again in the individual steps 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.970
 maybe write it down as well 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.440
 I have a few confusing 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.030
 times here but we have already 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.020
 two o'clock at night again a bit 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.389
 it's already over 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.860
 that 's of course mega light and yes me 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.270
 would say lucky once on one 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.490
 channel over if it is not already 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.259
 subscribed since Schalke career outside like that 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.759
 I also invite a few faq videos 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.139
 because of course you have to be happy if 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.910
 one or the other when I look 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.400
 hope so much fun with gravel in 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.400
 People roddicks until the next video
