00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 good don jorge a pretty group 

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.080
 complex on paper at least a single 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.309
 difficult complex complex for 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.990
 characteristics of the equipment that we 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.470
 they played 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.059
 but good is always in him 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.830
 in the lapse of my career it has touched me 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.740
 face complicated situations 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.580
 and that has always strengthened me not 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.560
 nothing new 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.170
 try to know what something has touched me 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.000
 very complex and that I have to solve or 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.029
 be that we will now be 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.960
 competitive trying to reveal ourselves before 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.239
 the security of 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.800
 from the statistics that history 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.960
 indicates that the two classified in doing 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.199
 another team and not us then goes 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.989
 be on us to see what locks you 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.300
 we put that history marked as 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.040
 we modify it as we reveal it and as 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.989
 we confront him but clearly in the 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.430
 situation has changed a little bit over 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.690
 all for the good performances of chile 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.399
 speaks recently of Vicente del Bosque 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.440
 He pointed out that he did not feel very 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.970
 comfortable with the group not only for having 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.280
 holland who played the final in the 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.750
 previous world but also 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.210
 will receive chile that always catches us what 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.410
 complicated to say if we the 100 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.619
 we have always complicated it but not 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.820
 we have never won or 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.939
 but it has to be in a day in the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.920
 what the operation of the equipment 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.450
 individual collective is at a hundred 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.060
 hundred to win those teams so much 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.720
 holland like 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.880
 like Spain then 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.370
 without evading also australia that a 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.920
 very very orthodox team very hard very good 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.210
 aerial game where very much better 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.960
 with a team that closes a lot behind 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.370
 then the world cup for us is going to 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.740
 be extremely demanding to the 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.740
 reality the group 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.640
 idea is to try to equate ourselves with the 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:52.090
 better than the most complicated imagine or 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.850
 imagine or dream of promising to win the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.460
 group would be irresponsible 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.869
 it's not in my calculations that's trying 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.180
 to see match by match as the 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.220
 team works and becomes competitive and 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.740
 can be and can play equal to 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.729
 equal the elections are superior 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.930
 planning in terms of work the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.200
 number of friendly matches that 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.120
 can do in what comes computer 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.220
 will be modified by him to the rivals 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.620
 we allow there to play with 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.450
 similarities of elections that do not 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.819
 played to play for many more matches 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.050
 which has at least because the 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.530
 which come with many matches over 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.230
 and try a preparation is made 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.550
 according to how they arrive and the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.550
 need have we
