00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.909 
right here that seems like your stuff
can<00:02:38.639> fall<00:02:38.819> out<00:02:38.849> but<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.540> had<00:02:40.139> kept<00:02:40.409> it<00:02:40.500> stuffed

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:40.919 
can fall out but I had kept it stuffed

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.489 
can fall out but I had kept it stuffed
with<00:02:41.129> it<00:02:41.280> stuffing<00:02:41.760> until<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.269> used<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.749> so<00:02:42.959> this

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:43.499 
with it stuffing until I used it so this

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.099 
with it stuffing until I used it so this
has<00:02:43.769> kind<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.159> sunken<00:02:44.790> down<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.299> usually<00:02:45.719> sits

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
has kind of sunken down it usually sits

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.440 
has kind of sunken down it usually sits
up<00:02:46.379> like<00:02:46.709> straight<00:02:46.980> like<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.849> then

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
up like straight like this and then

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.240 
up like straight like this and then
that's<00:02:48.689> why<00:02:48.959> things<00:02:49.560> seem<00:02:49.799> like<00:02:49.889> they<00:02:50.010> go<00:02:50.129> out

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.309 
that's why things seem like they go out
but<00:02:50.669> it's<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.449> kind<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.780> gotten<00:02:52.019> stuck<00:02:52.290> in

in your purse during the spring season
I<00:07:37.400> personally<00:07:37.940> guess<00:07:38.330> what<00:07:38.539> I<00:07:38.570> would<00:07:38.750> say<00:07:39.080> is

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:39.320 
I personally guess what I would say is

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.959 
I personally guess what I would say is
lip<00:07:39.800> balm<00:07:40.010> but<00:07:40.219> that<00:07:40.400> should<00:07:40.550> be<00:07:40.639> for<00:07:40.849> all

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:40.969 
lip balm but that should be for all

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:42.060 
lip balm but that should be for all
seasons<00:07:41.360> just<00:07:41.599> because<00:07:41.839> you

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.070 
seasons just because you

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.800 
seasons just because you
in<00:07:42.250> the<00:07:42.340> summer<00:07:42.580> and<00:07:42.850> then<00:07:43.030> the<00:07:43.150> spring<00:07:43.390> is<00:07:43.540> hot

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810 
in the summer and then the spring is hot

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.840 
in the summer and then the spring is hot
you<00:07:44.290> don't<00:07:44.560> want<00:07:44.740> your<00:07:44.920> lips<00:07:45.340> to<00:07:45.400> ever<00:07:45.520> not<00:07:45.700> be

you don't want your lips to ever not be
moisturized<00:07:46.300> sore<00:07:46.690> monitor<00:07:47.020> probably<00:07:47.290> be<00:07:47.380> a

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:47.410 
moisturized sore monitor probably be a

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.730 
moisturized sore monitor probably be a
lip<00:07:47.740> balm<00:07:47.950> or<00:07:48.160> on<00:07:48.790> another<00:07:49.090> note<00:07:49.740> lotion
