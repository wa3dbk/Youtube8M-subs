00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.710
 the second part of the bayonet was the cause 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.930
 sadness for most fans of the genre 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.330
 personally, a slasher and a small army of fans 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.990
 the main character first because her 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.700
 canceled 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.980
 then from the fact that they decided to release 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.460
 only on the console view which are big 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.170
 openly not popular 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.150
 however, if you still have a view 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.320
 to be in at the 2 will be the best 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.820
 Acquisition why now tell 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.839
 how can you remember the first game 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.730
 ended well 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.559
 apparently bayonetta figured out with her 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.150
 past as well as competing 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.040
 treasure of bright sages in addition 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.229
 preventing merging hopeless 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.729
 a mess of 3 universes of human 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.830
 angelic and demonic 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.500
 then settled in the city like 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.510
 on new york and started to lead a normal life 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.100
 lasted a break of 2 weeks exactly to 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.440
 Christmas sales fell down 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.659
 trouble first on the heroine and her 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.030
 Giovanna 's girlfriend was attacked by angels again 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.689
 then summoned to hell dragon 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.610
 gamora 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.470
 rebelled and hurt the soul 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.990
 friends in infernal depths 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.670
 to rescue a job slowly dying 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.080
 somewhere in hell bayonet 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.049
 goes to the sacred mountain 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.939
 fimbulwinter according to legend this place 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.340
 the only thing on earth where there are passages in 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.170
 hell and heaven but already at the approaches to harry 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.929
 it turns out that the heroine strive there 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.179
 1 up for an untrained person 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.490
 the plot of the button accordion is two may seem 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.799
 strange odious personality some 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.899
 parallel universes of villains in place 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.939
 heroes and angels as bad guys 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.369
 the game was obviously done first 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.350
 for fans even for fanatics first 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.140
 series but because the setting is revealed 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.450
 slow enough almost reluctantly mau 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.399
 who needs to know everything for a long time but to 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.350
 happiness scenes pretentious dialogues and 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.749
 screensavers with bayonet style views 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.969
 studio brothers are interspersed with the very same 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:57.659
 spectacular speed and adrenaline 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.249
 fights that made the glory of the first part 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.829
 they fall in love and don't feel like 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:04.869
 made the local duel impossible in 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.409
 the basis of the combo-strike system and 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.569
 kicked 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.640
 exactly what combinations will be effective 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.860
 depends on the opponent and equipped 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.900
 weapons correctly executed series 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.000
 blows accumulate magic and ta 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.130
 queue allows you to perform powerful attacks 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.940
 with invoking otherworldly forces and yet 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.440
 important in 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.970
 dodge blows to 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.160
 activate time delay and 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.290
 conduct powerful counterattacks as well 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.300
 use special moves part of which 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.700
 purchased at the store for dropping out 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.080
 of the enemies and the golden ones it would seem that 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.690
 all elementary watson 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.580
 you know mikom bass dodge urge 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.800
 titanic demons for the final as well 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.960
 and eyes on half-naked heroine but 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.970
 layouts weapons special moves and 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.430
 accessories affecting 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.650
 the parameters of the witch are very many not all 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.180
 Ammunition gets right to deal with 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.850
 go how best to approach any 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.770
 the enemy does not always succeed like that 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.080
 image of the game leave a huge scope 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.360
 for improvement during the second and 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.400
 subsequent passages experienced in heard 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.680
 their gamers are learning and purchasing the necessary 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.480
 tricks and putting in the arms and legs fighting on 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.430
 wheelbarrow correct swords or pistol and 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.680
 can literally cut heavenly 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.480
 legions getting the coveted status net 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.340
 dam in every single battle 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.470
 and lovers artificially complicate yourself 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.050
 life will also be able to expose more 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.580
 high difficulty single 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.430
 minus bohivki is that it is practically 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.530
 not changed over the past 5 years but how 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.010
 it says if something is not broken fix 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.010
 do not 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.480
 but outside of the battle and the plot is not here 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.200
 so much content yes you can run on 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.180
 corners 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.040
 causing unnecessary enemies collecting 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.319
 hidden increase or the ruler of life and 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.750
 magicians and vinyl records for 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.640
 which issued a new weapon yes there is 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.650
 a lot of in-game literature about 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.930
 angels with demons place events and 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.359
 the universe but in general the second part is military 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.040
 it's almost undiluted rampant battle 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.290
 and compared to the first game 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.389
 his entertainment clearly increased 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.459
 there are repetitive battles with one and 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.470
 same character almost equal and 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.720
 the witch is fit during them around 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.030
 going on something phenomenal beating 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.220
 call a couple of giant demons and those 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.139
 echoing your successful or not-so attacks 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.030
 beat each other to the accompaniment 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.040
 crazy special effects look 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.349
 approximately as if the final battle 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.660
 of anniversary by gigantism and darksiders 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.970
 or dynamics mixed shook 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.810
 and multiplied by a factor of three and such a fight 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.810
 will no 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.520
 the growth of dynamism and entertainment is associated with 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.789
 moving to a more powerful comparison with 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.949
 ps3 and xbox360 game platform not only 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.910
 look better the first part she also 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.919
 became bigger 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.630
 if you tear down whole trains here and 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.460
 skyscrapers if beads 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.470
 then such that did not fit on the screen and 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.599
 all this with very decent by the standards in 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.550
 you detail and but absolutely smooth 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.650
 speeds of 60 frames per second 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.990
 considering that the nintendo consoles are not 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.240
 so many adult military projects then 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.009
 two sets the standard on which 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.960
 absolutely everyone can be equal 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.560
 will want to make a serious action for this 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.900
 platforms 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.520
 another crucial reason 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.530
 that the game does not bother even with 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.960
 subsequent passages became extremely 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.090
 good tempo script writers and planners 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.250
 episodes very accurately felt when 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.360
 a player can get bored with cacophony of fights and 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.520
 and it is worth interrupting 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.830
 world exploration storyline or 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.840
 dialogue and when it is worth pushing 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.120
 stun you not standard level on 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.870
 surf under water in the sky or supply 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.819
 new weapon 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.860
 Due to this, I always want 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:30.990
 move forward find out what else 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.990
 invented Japanese magicians there ahead 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.150
 if for some reason rush 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.220
 get bored you can always stop at 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.900
 cooperative mode he offers 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.150
 play certain plot 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.250
 battle only with a mate who 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.319
 can be like a random japanese pulled up 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.050
 student so and your friend who has 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:53.090
 copies of the game this mode tg climax 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.190
 in addition, well integrated into the main 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.199
 story line because it allows 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.300
 would earn him so instead 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.490
 so that once again you can run through the levels 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.250
 find an ally and fill your pockets with local 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.780
 currency in two is not faster, we are long and 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.120
 diligently tried to find in the game 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.099
 some significant flaws but it 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.900
 it was not easy to eat a little 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.789
 the problem is that sometimes due to 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.129
 frank angles and vulgar jokes 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.289
 bayonet 2 seems to be a teenage game 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.120
 and personality sexy feast versions but 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.400
 this can be attributed to a strange Japanese 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.900
 culture is perhaps the most serious gap 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.819
 in the adventures the immortals are visible and 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.129
 management and it's not about what it is 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:29.930
 bad in itself is rather a relic 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:31.909
 the fact that the game was on the system from 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.530
 nintendo by chance a tablet 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:35.629
 the controller is not too convenient for 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.819
 quickly pressing different buttons he 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:39.620
 still heavy and cumbersome fortunately 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:41.900
 fully supported pro controller 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.979
 with which excellent rankings are knocked out 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.590
 noticeably lighter 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.750
 word and brainchild sega saved not in vain 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.819
 the second part turned out a bit but 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.800
 better chic 1 and not only because 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:53.979
 to find and go very short 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.979
 hairstyle 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.809
 Verdict 9 points 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:22.749
 one hundred and sixty 

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:22.749
 percent should be taken
