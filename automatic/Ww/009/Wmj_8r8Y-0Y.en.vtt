00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.700 
one was what Bryce talked about the
number<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.180> jobs<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.750> very<00:01:52.200> debatable

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
number of jobs is very debatable

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.380 
number of jobs is very debatable
Republicans<00:01:53.670> were<00:01:53.759> coming<00:01:54.000> out<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.210> saying

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
Republicans were coming out and saying

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.120 
Republicans were coming out and saying
that<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.720> would<00:01:54.869> create<00:01:55.020> tens<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.710> thousands

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
that this would create tens of thousands

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.940 
that this would create tens of thousands
of<00:01:56.189> jobs<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.000> administration<00:01:57.090> says<00:01:57.899> well<00:01:58.469> we

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
of jobs the administration says well we

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.620 
of jobs the administration says well we
have<00:01:59.100> reports<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.820> may<00:01:59.969> create<00:02:00.119> five<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
have reports that it may create five to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.120 
have reports that it may create five to
six<00:02:00.810> thousand<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.409> those<00:02:01.590> jobs<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:02.040> just

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
six thousand and those jobs are just

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
six thousand and those jobs are just
going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> simply<00:02:02.549> move<00:02:02.939> right<00:02:03.390> there's<00:02:03.600> an

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
going to simply move right there's an

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.810 
going to simply move right there's an
out-of-town<00:02:04.320> state<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.770> state<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.640> they're

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
out-of-town state to state so they're

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.520 
out-of-town state to state so they're
not<00:02:05.939> going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.630> long<00:02:06.840> lasting<00:02:07.259> jobs

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
not going to be the long lasting jobs

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.109 
not going to be the long lasting jobs
that<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.280> create<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that we want to create here in the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.170 
that we want to create here in the
administration<00:02:09.569> also<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.340> economic<00:02:12.060> impact

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
administration also the economic impact

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.720 
administration also the economic impact
is<00:02:12.629> really<00:02:12.989> no

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
is really no

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.850 
is really no
that<00:02:14.060> vital<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.440> country<00:02:15.940> it's<00:02:16.940> simply

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
that vital to the country it's simply

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.399 
that vital to the country it's simply
renegotiating<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.890> way<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.430> which<00:02:19.640> crude<00:02:20.060> oil

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
renegotiating the way in which crude oil

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.850 
renegotiating the way in which crude oil
gets<00:02:21.409> down<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.569> southernmost<00:02:23.860> refineries

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
gets down to the southernmost refineries

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.530 
gets down to the southernmost refineries
in<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.280> Gulf<00:02:25.519> which<00:02:25.790> are<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.030> most<00:02:26.209> needed

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
in the Gulf which are the most needed

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.190 
in the Gulf which are the most needed
and<00:02:27.379> and<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:28.220> Canada<00:02:28.730> back<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.420> forth<00:02:29.629> so

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
and and to Canada back and forth so

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.039 
and and to Canada back and forth so
there's<00:02:31.099> already<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.459> network<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.420> trains<00:02:32.810> and

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
there's already a network of trains and

we're going to be able to refine doesn't

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.780 
we're going to be able to refine doesn't
affect<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.560> one<00:02:48.739> where<00:02:48.920> yet<00:02:49.220> right<00:02:49.459> we<00:02:49.640> also

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
affect the one where yet right we also

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.990 
affect the one where yet right we also
already<00:02:50.239> have<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.569> large<00:02:51.349> capacity<00:02:52.069> in<00:02:52.790> the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
already have a large capacity in the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.420 
already have a large capacity in the
transnational<00:02:53.900> pipelines<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:55.310> we're

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
transnational pipelines that that we're

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.970 
transnational pipelines that that we're
already<00:02:55.579> seeing<00:02:55.879> of<00:02:56.090> crude<00:02:56.540> oil<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:57.019> you<00:02:57.890> know

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
already seeing of crude oil so you know

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.619 
already seeing of crude oil so you know
the<00:02:58.069> estimates<00:02:58.430> over<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.730> 10<00:02:58.910> Evan<00:02:59.269> over<00:02:59.540> the

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
the estimates over the 10 Evan over the

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.880 
the estimates over the 10 Evan over the
next<00:02:59.780> ten<00:03:00.170> years<00:03:00.310> is<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:02.200> economically<00:03:03.200> this

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
next ten years is that economically this

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.470 
next ten years is that economically this
isn't<00:03:04.310> going<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.459> make<00:03:04.640> that<00:03:05.060> big<00:03:05.329> of<00:03:05.359> a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
isn't going to make that big of a

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.300 
isn't going to make that big of a
difference<00:03:05.629> so<00:03:05.959> while<00:03:06.290> Republicans<00:03:06.829> in<00:03:06.950> GOP

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
difference so while Republicans in GOP

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.099 
difference so while Republicans in GOP
are<00:03:07.400> coming<00:03:07.670> out<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:07.940> saying<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:08.959> is

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
are coming out and saying that this is

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.530 
are coming out and saying that this is
just<00:03:09.319> huge<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.250> it's<00:03:10.430> going<00:03:10.579> to<00:03:10.640> destroy

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
just huge and it's going to destroy

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.630 
just huge and it's going to destroy
parts<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:12.019> our<00:03:12.170> economy<00:03:12.200> okay<00:03:12.980> Paul<00:03:13.160> it's<00:03:13.400> it's

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
parts of our economy okay Paul it's it's

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.060 
parts of our economy okay Paul it's it's
all<00:03:13.879> political
