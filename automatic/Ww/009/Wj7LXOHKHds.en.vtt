00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
here you can see the difference in the

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.050 
here you can see the difference in the
way<00:01:17.740> this<00:01:17.950> one<00:01:18.159> and<00:01:18.340> this<00:01:18.399> one's<00:01:18.640> made<00:01:18.820> the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
way this one and this one's made the

way this one and this one's made the
difference<00:01:19.270> in<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:19.630> heaviness<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.369> if<00:01:21.670> you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
difference in the heaviness so if you

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.480 
difference in the heaviness so if you
replace<00:01:22.329> an<00:01:22.540> idler<00:01:22.810> arm<00:01:23.020> 1gm<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:23.710> suggest<00:01:24.369> you

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
replace an idler arm 1gm I suggest you

replace an idler arm 1gm I suggest you
buy<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.729> better<00:01:25.060> one<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.570> use<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.799> because<00:01:27.250> it

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
buy the better one and use it because it

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.910 
buy the better one and use it because it
should<00:01:27.729> last<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.180> lot<00:01:28.270> longer<00:01:28.329> you<00:01:28.869> can<00:01:29.590> see<00:01:29.770> the

should last a lot longer you can see the
difference<00:01:30.280> in<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.490> size<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:30.969> the<00:01:31.149> socket

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570

there's<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.659> zerk<00:01:52.869> fitting<00:01:53.170> here<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:54.310> there's

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
there's a zerk fitting here and there's

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.359 
there's a zerk fitting here and there's
one<00:01:54.640> here<00:01:54.820> on<00:01:54.939> the<00:01:54.969> very<00:01:55.240> bottom<00:01:55.750> I<00:01:56.189> might<00:01:57.189> just

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
one here on the very bottom I might just

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.609 
one here on the very bottom I might just
go<00:01:57.429> ahead<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.670> put<00:01:57.789> them<00:01:57.939> in<00:01:58.439> because<00:01:59.439> it's

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
go ahead and put them in because it's

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.959 
go ahead and put them in because it's
not<00:01:59.740> like<00:01:59.859> I'm<00:02:00.009> gonna<00:02:00.130> be<00:02:00.250> pressing<00:02:00.579> on<00:02:00.789> them

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
not like I'm gonna be pressing on them

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.639 
not like I'm gonna be pressing on them
and<00:02:01.210> have<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.420> chance<00:02:01.689> to<00:02:01.840> break<00:02:02.020> them<00:02:02.289> off<00:02:02.409> and

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
and have a chance to break them off and

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:03.719 
and have a chance to break them off and
I<00:02:02.679> think<00:02:02.859> it'll<00:02:02.950> be<00:02:03.039> a<00:02:03.070> lot<00:02:03.159> easier<00:02:03.219> to<00:02:03.460> put<00:02:03.640> it

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
I think it'll be a lot easier to put it

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.880 
I think it'll be a lot easier to put it
now<00:02:03.909> than<00:02:04.149> they<00:02:04.240> will<00:02:04.390> be<00:02:04.450> in<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.750> car<00:02:04.990> you

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
now than they will be in the car you

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.380 
now than they will be in the car you
just<00:02:06.070> got<00:02:06.219> to<00:02:06.250> look<00:02:06.429> at<00:02:06.549> that<00:02:06.700> sometimes<00:02:07.179> it's

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
just got to look at that sometimes it's

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.999 
just got to look at that sometimes it's
better<00:02:07.539> to<00:02:07.719> put<00:02:07.869> zerk<00:02:08.110> fittings<00:02:08.470> in<00:02:08.590> before

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
better to put zerk fittings in before

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.460 
better to put zerk fittings in before
and<00:02:09.490> sometimes<00:02:10.150> it's<00:02:10.630> better<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:11.050> wait<00:02:11.410> till

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
and sometimes it's better to wait till

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.320 
and sometimes it's better to wait till
later<00:02:11.920> but<00:02:12.040> hang<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:12.970> this

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
later but hang in this

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.740 
later but hang in this
distance<00:02:13.570> is<00:02:13.690> better<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.140> go<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.410> do<00:02:14.500> it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
distance is better just go and do it

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.870 
distance is better just go and do it
okay<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.410> got<00:02:17.650> them<00:02:17.860> bolts<00:02:18.220> back<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.430> there

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
okay so I got them bolts back in there

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.830 
okay so I got them bolts back in there
and<00:02:19.470> tight<00:02:20.880> now<00:02:21.880> those<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.270> use<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.690> impact<00:02:23.050> on

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
and tight now those I use the impact on

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.660 
and tight now those I use the impact on
and<00:02:25.840> then<00:02:26.020> over<00:02:26.260> here<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.620> can<00:02:26.920> see<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.130> got<00:02:27.430> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and then over here you can see I got the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.830 
and then over here you can see I got the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
stud where the cotter pin goes through

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.470 
stud where the cotter pin goes through
all<00:02:56.740> times<00:02:57.100> it<00:02:57.280> will<00:02:57.340> help<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:57.790> if<00:02:58.090> before<00:02:58.270> you

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
even put the nut on just look and see

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.890 
even put the nut on just look and see
where<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.760> hole<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.420> know<00:03:01.630> where<00:03:01.870> to

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
where the hole is so you know where to

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.590 
where the hole is so you know where to
get<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.620> start<00:03:02.860> looking<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:04.360> this<00:03:04.420> is

grease<00:03:11.050> on<00:03:11.380> here<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:11.890> then<00:03:12.880> we're<00:03:13.060> gonna<00:03:13.150> put

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
grease on here and then we're gonna put

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.640 
grease on here and then we're gonna put
these<00:03:13.510> shields<00:03:13.810> back<00:03:14.080> on<00:03:16.230> okay<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.260> had<00:03:17.530> this

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
these shields back on okay I had this

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.440 
these shields back on okay I had this
all<00:03:17.860> Bolin<00:03:18.400> hearing<00:03:18.670> on<00:03:18.760> what<00:03:18.880> degrees<00:03:19.209> it

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
all Bolin hearing on what degrees it

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.570 
all Bolin hearing on what degrees it
thought<00:03:19.630> I'd<00:03:19.750> done<00:03:19.959> good<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.560> don't<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.489> you

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
thought I'd done good I don't of you

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.220 
thought I'd done good I don't of you
will<00:03:21.730> see<00:03:21.940> if<00:03:22.060> there's<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.360> straight<00:03:22.959> circ

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
will see if there's a straight circ

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.860 
will see if there's a straight circ
fitting<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.620> put<00:03:23.860> in<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.010> bottom<00:03:24.600> well<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:25.630> would

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
fitting I put in the bottom well I would

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.720 
fitting I put in the bottom well I would
say<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.170> 90<00:03:26.530> degrees<00:03:26.800> or<00:03:27.010> fitting<00:03:27.310> goes<00:03:27.519> in

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
say the 90 degrees or fitting goes in

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.180 
say the 90 degrees or fitting goes in
there<00:03:28.230> because<00:03:29.230> there's<00:03:29.620> no<00:03:29.769> way<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:29.980> get<00:03:30.160> a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
there because there's no way to get a

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.090 
there because there's no way to get a
grease<00:03:30.400> gun<00:03:30.430> on<00:03:30.790> there<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:32.470> can<00:03:32.739> get<00:03:33.040> a

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
grease gun on there and you can get a

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.199 
grease gun on there and you can get a
grease<00:03:33.370> gun<00:03:33.400> straight<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.450> other<00:03:34.600> side<00:03:34.870> so

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
grease gun straight to the other side so

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.699
