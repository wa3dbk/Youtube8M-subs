 to discover with similar games 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.040
 on mmo who for example pick up games for 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.079
 for example, city ​​skylines or 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.210

 And here we go and see what is here 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.489
 Well, there is no such thing at the moment 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.350

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:56.780
 maicon well off with it now here again 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.780
 a few 7 half capex 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.430
 Now take everything back into the world 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.560
 you see you close to 30,000 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:13.399
 elements which are very much or 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:15.009
 items ok i think we will be fine 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.869
 do not pull ronaldo 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.759
 but probably the ronaldo I have 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.710
 not asked whether you deserve it now 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.799
 finds that the ronaldo after the match 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:30.190
 has become , although it actually 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:32.360
 Korea has lost her hold 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.479
 should have been backcountry 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.100
 but who has money is that the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.759
 Of course they do the standard answer 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.590
 somehow you can do the ronaldo epex 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.409
 understand 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.710
 in the end, os wein has what you are 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.060
 in the end you have well madrid 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.990
 become if you go back and forth 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.990
 together will okay it was a it was a 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.049
 yes ok 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.679
 next prokopec yes I do not know if 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.970
 I asked that anyway 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.700
 once like your opinion about it 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.739
 schalke only missed a goal very much 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.349
 pity and shame how often do I have that 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.670
 already drawn 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.090
 my goodness and the drobs shot is 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.500
 still shitty so that's why 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.549
 It does not get better by stopping 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.560
 this price granger so funny yes yes yes 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.560
 yes just kept looking and hoping 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.970
 Yes 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.070
 hey good at it i wish we did 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.610
 would something good but it pull the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.610
 not so long out 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.830
 so 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.209
 but still one or two I have to do 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.920
 I do not know how I do here sometimes 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.280
 so fast I can not count 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:09.250
 because he's been confusing since then 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:12.730
 Although I already have de Rossi if it 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.870
 already 150 does not actually start then 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.599
 At least I think so well 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.299
 believe me once more of them to 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:27.000
 German 45 o'clock wow not even one 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.939

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.299

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.980
 day and we just do not pull anything 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.140
 nothing is cool for that 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.900
 Formal men would have the ronal 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.300
 norbert yes you know the klevern 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.520
 I've seen a picture of something 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.319
 with age the gamer were sent the 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:58.060
 I have both human and male 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:04:02.860
 a pennystock fifa fierce ronaldo and 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.860
 they are called others 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:18.079
 kimi and porto london at the packers 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.190
 fiercely now at least I would 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.190
 that's exactly how it came from 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.700
 gomis 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.360
 if you would now get a ronaldo 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.610
 would put the removal 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:39.330
 about the award he just he 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:44.220
 not so hot compare between 1 and 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:47.390
 11 1000 to 1500 not even okay 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.390
 So I'll just put it in 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:59.660

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.660

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.909
 deeper 15 peco to make conditional again 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.280
 White no longer there at the last 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.520
 team forever is going to be natural too 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.840
 an option just 414 continue 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.659
