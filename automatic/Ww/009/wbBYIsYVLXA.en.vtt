hole is seven point four millimeters it
goes<00:01:00.450> pretty<00:01:01.450> much<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.809> right<00:01:01.930> size<00:01:02.200> for<00:01:02.230> that

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
goes pretty much the right size for that

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.340

screw<00:01:03.280> on<00:01:03.489> this<00:01:03.640> Innova<00:01:04.210> Chuck<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:04.930> how<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.199> do

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
screw on this Innova Chuck so how I do

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.499 
screw on this Innova Chuck so how I do
this<00:01:05.790> might<00:01:06.790> look<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:07.030> little<00:01:07.149> bit<00:01:07.329> dangerous

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
this might look a little bit dangerous

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.929 
this might look a little bit dangerous
but<00:01:08.070> when<00:01:09.070> you<00:01:09.189> think<00:01:09.399> about<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.729> it's<00:01:09.850> not

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
but when you think about it it's not

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.380 
but when you think about it it's not
because<00:01:10.570> when<00:01:10.750> you're<00:01:10.930> putting<00:01:11.320> this<00:01:11.500> on<00:01:12.390> when

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
because when you're putting this on when

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.569 
because when you're putting this on when
the<00:01:13.509> wood<00:01:13.719> touches<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.710> chuck<00:01:15.009> of<00:01:15.219> course<00:01:15.460> the

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
the wood touches the chuck of course the

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.819 
the wood touches the chuck of course the
woods<00:01:15.789> gonna<00:01:15.999> spin<00:01:16.479> and<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:17.350> still<00:01:17.590> hanging

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
woods gonna spin and you still hanging

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.109 
woods gonna spin and you still hanging
it<00:01:17.889> on<00:01:18.009> through<00:01:18.189> that<00:01:18.369> point<00:01:18.639> it's<00:01:18.789> gonna<00:01:18.880> hurt

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
it on through that point it's gonna hurt

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.239 
it on through that point it's gonna hurt
so<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.289> just<00:01:20.530> put<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.770> on<00:01:20.889> you<00:01:21.130> know

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
so I just put it on you know

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:23.010 
so I just put it on you know
three-quarters<00:01:21.969> of<00:01:21.999> the<00:01:22.119> way<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.539> and<00:01:22.810> then<00:01:22.929> I

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
three-quarters of the way on and then I

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.660 
three-quarters of the way on and then I
stop<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.380> lathe<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.679> I<00:01:23.799> finish<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.280> job<00:01:24.459> by

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
stop the lathe and I finish the job by

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.309 
stop the lathe and I finish the job by
hand

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:25.319 
hand

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.169 
hand
it's<00:01:26.319> the<00:01:26.829> lathe<00:01:27.130> has<00:01:27.310> had<00:01:27.429> a<00:01:27.459> low<00:01:27.639> speed<00:01:27.939> on

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
it's the lathe has had a low speed on

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.209 
it's the lathe has had a low speed on
his<00:01:28.270> head<00:01:28.389> of<00:01:28.450> there<00:01:28.539> about<00:01:28.719> 200<00:01:29.170> rpm<00:01:29.289> and<00:01:29.859> it

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
his head of there about 200 rpm and it

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.309 
his head of there about 200 rpm and it
just<00:01:30.399> I<00:01:30.579> find<00:01:30.939> doing<00:01:31.240> this<00:01:31.389> by<00:01:31.569> hand<00:01:31.810> told<00:01:32.139> me

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
just I find doing this by hand told me

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.109 
just I find doing this by hand told me
it's<00:01:32.770> much<00:01:33.219> more<00:01:33.369> difficult<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.819> get<00:01:33.909> it<00:01:33.999> on

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
it's much more difficult to get it on

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.969 
it's much more difficult to get it on
straight<00:01:34.479> you<00:01:34.539> end<00:01:34.779> up<00:01:34.899> kind<00:01:35.079> of<00:01:35.200> wobbling<00:01:35.709> and

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
straight you end up kind of wobbling and

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.590 
straight you end up kind of wobbling and
the<00:01:36.219> threads<00:01:36.490> aren't<00:01:36.670> cut<00:01:36.880> as<00:01:36.999> cleanly<00:01:37.329> words

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
the threads aren't cut as cleanly words

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.959 
the threads aren't cut as cleanly words
if<00:01:37.719> you<00:01:37.779> do<00:01:37.929> this<00:01:38.079> under<00:01:38.319> power<00:01:38.529> the<00:01:39.459> first<00:01:39.700> you

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
if you do this under power the first you

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.910 
if you do this under power the first you
know<00:01:40.090> bit<00:01:40.659> of<00:01:40.779> the<00:01:40.929> screw<00:01:41.170> anyways<00:01:41.499> I<00:01:41.679> find

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
know bit of the screw anyways I find

through

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.390

we can just come back here and I'm going
to

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:04.949 
to

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:06.719 
to
it's<00:07:05.189> very

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729 
it's very

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:10.090 
it's very
slightly<00:07:07.059> injustice

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:16.330 

take<00:07:10.310> care<00:07:10.610> a<00:07:10.820> little<00:07:11.060> bit<00:07:11.180> rounder

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.070 

I<00:07:16.430> know<00:07:16.940> I'm<00:07:17.120> cutting<00:07:17.389> the<00:07:17.449> wrong<00:07:17.570> way<00:07:17.810> but

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:21.970 
permission so it doesn't really matter

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.220
