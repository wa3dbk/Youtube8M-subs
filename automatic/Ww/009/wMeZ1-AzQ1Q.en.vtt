00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
almost everybody has something like this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.009 
almost everybody has something like this
in<00:00:26.789> their<00:00:26.910> wardrobe<00:00:27.269> already<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.900> don't

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
in their wardrobe already so you don't

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.630 
in their wardrobe already so you don't
have<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.170> go<00:00:28.260> out<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.439> buy<00:00:28.590> something<00:00:28.859> but

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
have to go out and buy something but

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.690 
have to go out and buy something but
this<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.179> pretty<00:00:30.390> classic<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
this is pretty classic and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.880 
this is pretty classic and
straightforward<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.380> I<00:00:34.380> think<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.800> like

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
straightforward and I think this is like

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.440 
straightforward and I think this is like
an<00:00:35.040> ideal<00:00:35.430> outfit<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.180> your<00:00:36.270> closet

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
an ideal outfit to have in your closet

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.540 
an ideal outfit to have in your closet
for<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:37.620> work<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.280> great

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
for for work I think it's great

for for work I think it's great
obviously<00:00:39.390> my<00:00:39.870> red<00:00:40.350> lips<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.329> well<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.629> red

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
obviously my red lips and well my red

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.240 
obviously my red lips and well my red
lips<00:00:43.050> probably<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> liner<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.950> could<00:00:44.160> do

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
lips probably not the liner you could do

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.799 
lips probably not the liner you could do
for<00:00:44.430> work<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> wouldn't<00:00:45.329> suggest<00:00:45.539> doing

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
for work but I wouldn't suggest doing

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.979 
for work but I wouldn't suggest doing
that<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.410> work<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.219> bright<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:48.480> I

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that for work a little bright and I

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.600 
that for work a little bright and I
would<00:00:49.260> say<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.039> weren't<00:00:50.309> doing<00:00:50.430> this

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610

would say that if you weren't doing this
necessarily<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> serious<00:00:51.989> serious
