blatant commercialism ring any bells I
think<00:02:47.660> that<00:02:47.750> there's<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.959> lot<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.230> really<00:02:48.410> good

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
think that there's a lot of really good

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.210 
think that there's a lot of really good
bands<00:02:48.800> in<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.040> United<00:02:49.250> States<00:02:49.520> who<00:02:51.220> travel

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
bands in the United States who travel

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.680 
bands in the United States who travel
around<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.730> maybe<00:02:52.910> don't<00:02:53.090> get<00:02:53.239> their<00:02:53.390> video

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
around and maybe don't get their video

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.140 
around and maybe don't get their video
shown<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.410> don't<00:02:54.560> get<00:02:54.650> on<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.770> radio<00:02:55.150> still

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
shown and don't get on the radio still

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.259 
shown and don't get on the radio still
after<00:02:56.750> all<00:02:56.900> these<00:02:57.019> years<00:02:57.080> who<00:02:58.070> who<00:02:58.730> are<00:02:58.760> doing

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
after all these years who who are doing

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.370 
after all these years who who are doing
good<00:02:59.390> stuff<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.810> I<00:02:59.870> think<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.110> lot<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.260> the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
good stuff and I think a lot of the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.660 
good stuff and I think a lot of the
bands<00:03:00.560> who<00:03:00.709> are<00:03:00.830> commercial<00:03:01.250> are<00:03:01.340> doing<00:03:01.580> good

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
bands who are commercial are doing good

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.000 
bands who are commercial are doing good
stuff<00:03:01.880> too<00:03:02.090> but<00:03:02.300> I<00:03:02.510> think<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.230> like<00:03:03.500> these

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
stuff too but I think this like these

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.400 
stuff too but I think this like these
gigantic<00:03:04.850> magnet<00:03:05.239> or<00:03:05.420> stadium<00:03:06.019> things<00:03:06.260> are

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
gigantic magnet or stadium things are

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.540 
gigantic magnet or stadium things are
pretty<00:03:06.590> weird

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
pretty weird

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
pretty weird

imagine there should be room for that in

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.960 
imagine there should be room for that in
the<00:03:10.750> other<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.980> pretty<00:03:12.190> difficult<00:03:12.460> to<00:03:12.850> get

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
the other it's pretty difficult to get
