00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.889
 For this occasion we have organized a day of fishing for carp in the 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.889
 Marsh of San Rafael de Navallana 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.079
 two days before we made the waxing of the chosen area 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.600
 the seed selected for this occasion was the corn we put in 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.130
 soak three days then we were for three hours 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.870
 replenishing the water that was consumed until completing the concession of the same 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.870
 the cooking water or throw it away but we reserve it to soak 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.390
 local corn enhanced with tandil activator 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.780
 we mix the pellets with the corn and let it rest so that together with the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.780
 water absorb the aroma 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.300
 then we prepare what I'm going 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.840
 we had decided to make a priming deduced with vanilla cream and peach 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.020
 pineapple and another one of salty with booksellers kopeks 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.520
 close 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 all of them from the series impac of tandeo 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.470
 and we mix it, consult and correspond to them before adding the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.900
 activator to further enhance the aroma of them we take water from 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.720
 swamp so that the hairs can absolve together with the water the roma 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 mix and let stand 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.130
 in another bucket we have prepared mobility 18 and 12 millimeters 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.819
 boosted with the activator for a better distribution of the bait and 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.819
 fishing scenario 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.140
 the weather did not accompany us during the day of priming because it did not stop raining 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.490
 at no time but this was not an impediment to carry out the priming 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.540
 of the area something very important that sometimes we do not value properly 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.989
 two days later the sun shone in all its splendor 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.149
 the first morning was a morning of waiting 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.519
 we observed marsh activity 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.519
 but the tent did not decide to bite the hook 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.759
 this lack of mincing did not make us discouraged we knew with total 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.759
 security that we would have enough bites 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:54.479
 while we waited we saw how there was more activity outside the area 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.479
 of this value 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:09.659
 We decided to prime with a few handfuls of bayly city a cane with a 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.659
 epic and we were not wrong 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:22.159
 it did not take long to produce the first whistle even in some moments 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.159
 we did doublets 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.389
 so we were forced to remove the tent without leaving vega 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.900
 while my partner took out the other 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.900
 It is important to carry one sack per person 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.609
 each of the copies did not give away some unforgettable moments showing 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.609
 all your strength in the fight 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:42.370
 day ended with a total of 50 fish 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.950
 and his weight oscillated between the 5 and 8 kilos approximately 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.300
 we finished satisfied 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:31.289
