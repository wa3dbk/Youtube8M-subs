00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
ber activity I made this this morning

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.450 
ber activity I made this this morning
and<00:00:08.330> we<00:00:09.330> tested<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.139> out<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.559> Daisy<00:00:11.040> really

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
and we tested it out and Daisy really

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.940 
and we tested it out and Daisy really
likes<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:12.030> it's<00:00:12.599> definitely<00:00:13.380> something<00:00:13.710> that

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
likes it it's definitely something that

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.630 
likes it it's definitely something that
is<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.910> would<00:00:15.750> say<00:00:15.990> about<00:00:16.260> six<00:00:16.619> months<00:00:16.949> ahead<00:00:17.400> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
is I would say about six months ahead of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.609 
is I would say about six months ahead of
where<00:00:18.150> she's<00:00:18.420> at<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.289> purely

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
where she's at so this is purely

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.460 
where she's at so this is purely
practice<00:00:20.279> right<00:00:20.520> now<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.000> think<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.930> about<00:00:22.050> six

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
practice right now I think in about six

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.410 
practice right now I think in about six
months<00:00:22.650> she'll<00:00:23.279> be<00:00:23.430> developmentally<00:00:23.880> ready

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
months she'll be developmentally ready

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.679 
months she'll be developmentally ready
to<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.350> activity<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.029> more<00:00:27.210> solo

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
to do this activity in a more solo

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.810 
to do this activity in a more solo
manner<00:00:27.960> right<00:00:28.830> now<00:00:28.980> it's<00:00:29.189> something<00:00:29.519> fun<00:00:29.789> that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
manner right now it's something fun that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.440 
manner right now it's something fun that
you<00:00:30.090> know<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.510> could<00:00:30.840> sit<00:00:31.050> down<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.560> her<00:00:31.800> for

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
you know I could sit down with her for

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.319 
you know I could sit down with her for
maybe<00:00:33.450> five<00:00:33.840> or<00:00:33.870> ten<00:00:34.290> minutes<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:35.880> but

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
maybe five or ten minutes and do but

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.119 
maybe five or ten minutes and do but
it's<00:00:36.480> definitely<00:00:37.110> not<00:00:37.260> something<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.860> could

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
it's definitely not something that could

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.569 
it's definitely not something that could
hold<00:00:38.460> her<00:00:38.700> attention<00:00:38.820> or<00:00:40.430> something<00:00:41.430> that

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
hold her attention or something that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.430 
hold her attention or something that
she's<00:00:41.760> coordinated<00:00:42.480> enough<00:00:42.660> like<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.050> said<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
she's coordinated enough like I said to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.100 
she's coordinated enough like I said to
do<00:00:43.590> solo<00:00:44.149> but<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.180> did<00:00:45.390> want<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> introduce<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
do solo but I did want to introduce the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.590 
do solo but I did want to introduce the
idea<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.739> I'm<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:47.579> starting<00:00:47.789> weekly

idea and I'm going to be starting weekly

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
idea and I'm going to be starting weekly
themes<00:00:49.760> coming<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:52.070> probably<00:00:53.070> next

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
sure it's just you know the timing of it

and prewriting oriented activities for
her<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:20.189> long<00:01:20.909> story

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
her to do so this is a long story

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.760 
her to do so this is a long story
activity<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.280> it's<00:01:23.280> typically<00:01:23.939> used<00:01:24.770> with

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
activity and it's typically used with

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.810 
activity and it's typically used with
sand<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.570> tracing<00:01:27.570> cards<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.549> I've<00:01:29.549> seen

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
sand and tracing cards and I've seen

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.190 
sand and tracing cards and I've seen
well<00:01:30.090> I've<00:01:30.240> seen<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.479> use<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.840> sand<00:01:31.049> paper

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
well I've seen that use of sand paper

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.710 
well I've seen that use of sand paper
cards<00:01:31.619> too<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.640> more<00:01:32.850> often<00:01:33.000> than<00:01:33.299> not<00:01:33.360> you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
cards too but more often than not you

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.640 
cards too but more often than not you
see<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> letter<00:01:34.259> card<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:35.570> kind<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.750> outline

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
see a letter card with kind of a outline

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.800 
see a letter card with kind of a outline
of<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.890> letter<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.549> dot<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.360> dot<00:01:39.390> would

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
of a letter and a dot and the dot would

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.469 
of a letter and a dot and the dot would
signify<00:01:40.400> where<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.610> would<00:01:41.759> start<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.210> your

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
signify where you would start with your

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.810 
signify where you would start with your
finger<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.170> were<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.100> trace<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.520> letter

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
finger as you were to trace this letter

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.350 
finger as you were to trace this letter
so<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> letter<00:01:46.590> D<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.030> were

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so this is the letter D and if this were

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.530 
so this is the letter D and if this were
a<00:01:48.960> tracing<00:01:49.710> card<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.430> would<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
a tracing card it would just have the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.490 
a tracing card it would just have the
lines<00:01:52.070> not<00:01:53.070> connected<00:01:53.700> fully<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.689> then<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
lines not connected fully and then the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.260 
lines not connected fully and then the
dot<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.979> show<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.460> where<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> child<00:01:57.060> would

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
dot to show like where the child would

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.789 
dot to show like where the child would
start<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.869> there'd<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.170> dot<00:01:58.350> up<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:58.530> and

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
start so there'd be a dot up here and

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.609 
start so there'd be a dot up here and
the<00:01:58.860> child<00:01:59.130> would<00:01:59.250> notice<00:01:59.549> start<00:01:59.850> either<00:02:00.840> one

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the child would notice start either one

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.389 
the child would notice start either one
of<00:02:01.740> these<00:02:01.890> lines<00:02:02.250> from<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.299> top<00:02:03.659> area<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.829> I

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
of these lines from this top area so I

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.719 
of these lines from this top area so I
chose<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.689> make<00:02:07.229> sandpaper<00:02:07.860> letters<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.580> go

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
chose to make sandpaper letters to go

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.999 
chose to make sandpaper letters to go
along<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.300> activity<00:02:09.690> because<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.800> feel

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
along with this activity because I feel

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.309 
along with this activity because I feel
like<00:02:11.039> those<00:02:11.459> are<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:12.180> better<00:02:12.599> place<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:12.900> Daisy

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
like those are a better place for Daisy

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.880 
like those are a better place for Daisy
to<00:02:13.470> start

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to start

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.290 
to start
tracing<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:15.319> they're<00:02:16.319> very<00:02:16.470> tactile<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.580> I

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
tracing and they're very tactile and I

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.390 
tracing and they're very tactile and I
had<00:02:19.140> all<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.410> materials<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.069> make<00:02:20.130> them

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
had all the materials to make them

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.130 
had all the materials to make them
easily<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.610> made<00:02:23.610> three<00:02:24.360> sandpaper<00:02:24.930> letters

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
easily so I made three sandpaper letters

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.520 
easily so I made three sandpaper letters
to<00:02:25.500> go<00:02:25.620> with<00:02:25.740> this<00:02:25.860> activity<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.750> then<00:02:27.750> this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
to go with this activity and then this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
to go with this activity and then this
box<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.340> actually<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:31.350> box<00:02:31.590> from<00:02:32.010> daisies

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
box is actually the box from daisies

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.310 
box is actually the box from daisies
lace<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.330> trace<00:02:34.790> by<00:02:35.790> Melissa<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.420> Doug<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
lace and trace by Melissa and Doug and I

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.670 
lace and trace by Melissa and Doug and I
chose<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.890> box<00:02:38.190> because<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.760> had<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.180> large

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
chose this box because it had this large

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.140 
chose this box because it had this large
front<00:02:40.680> portion<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.340> then<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.580> back<00:02:41.820> portion

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
front portion and then a back portion

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.240 
front portion and then a back portion
that<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.570> could<00:02:42.870> kind<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.350> stick<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.920> letters

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
that I could kind of stick the letters

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.960 
that I could kind of stick the letters
and<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.780> idea<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.230> activity<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:47.100> is

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
and so the idea of this activity is is

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.890 
and so the idea of this activity is is
that<00:02:48.840> she<00:02:49.110> would<00:02:49.790> she<00:02:50.790> would<00:02:50.940> start<00:02:51.300> here<00:02:51.720> with

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
that she would she would start here with

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.479 
that she would she would start here with
the<00:02:52.080> letter<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.680> she<00:02:53.160> would<00:02:53.280> practice

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
the letter and she would practice

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.610 
the letter and she would practice
tracing<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.690> with<00:02:54.840> her<00:02:54.989> finger<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.940> then

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
tracing it just with her finger and then

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.500 
tracing it just with her finger and then
after<00:02:58.620> doing<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:59.040> like<00:02:59.370> three<00:02:59.730> times<00:03:00.060> and

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
after doing that like three times and

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.300 
after doing that like three times and
sounding<00:03:00.989> out<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.260> letter<00:03:01.470> by<00:03:01.830> saying<00:03:02.130> like

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
sounding out the letter by saying like

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.310 
sounding out the letter by saying like
duh<00:03:02.810> she<00:03:03.810> would<00:03:04.220> take<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.640> then<00:03:06.540> trace<00:03:07.290> it

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
duh she would take it and then trace it

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.710 
duh she would take it and then trace it
in<00:03:07.680> here<00:03:08.660> with<00:03:09.660> her<00:03:09.900> finger<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:11.480> then<00:03:12.480> she

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
in here with her finger and then she

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.120 
in here with her finger and then she
could<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.320> know<00:03:13.440> mix<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.280> up<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.610> try<00:03:14.910> again

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
could you know mix it up and try again

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.750 
could you know mix it up and try again
this<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.430> rolled<00:03:17.940> oats<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.829> didn't<00:03:19.829> want<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.340> use

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
this is rolled oats I didn't want to use

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.500 
this is rolled oats I didn't want to use
a<00:03:21.390> sand<00:03:22.170> because<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:23.220> didn't<00:03:24.090> want<00:03:24.269> something

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
a sand because I didn't want something

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.990 
a sand because I didn't want something
that<00:03:24.690> fine<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.560> granulated<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.700> wouldn't

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that fine and granulated that I wouldn't

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.509 
that fine and granulated that I wouldn't
see<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.570> had<00:03:27.750> spilt<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:29.100> didn't<00:03:29.370> want<00:03:29.489> to

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
see if it had spilt and I didn't want to

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.370 
see if it had spilt and I didn't want to
use<00:03:29.670> salt<00:03:29.940> just<00:03:30.450> because<00:03:30.810> we<00:03:30.989> didn't<00:03:31.170> have<00:03:31.230> a

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
use salt just because we didn't have a

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.160 
use salt just because we didn't have a
lot<00:03:31.769> of<00:03:31.890> salt<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.489> sugar<00:03:33.390> for<00:03:33.690> obvious

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
lot of salt and sugar for obvious

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.390 
lot of salt and sugar for obvious
reasons<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.750> rolled<00:03:37.470> oats<00:03:37.769> just<00:03:38.160> seemed

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
reasons and so rolled oats just seemed

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.569 
reasons and so rolled oats just seemed
like<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:39.110> good<00:03:40.110> thing<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.350> use<00:03:40.620> it's<00:03:40.890> it's<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.370> in

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
like a good thing to use it's it's it in

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.720 
like a good thing to use it's it's it in
itself<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.239> very<00:03:42.420> pleasing<00:03:43.040> sensory<00:03:44.040> wise<00:03:44.340> and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
itself is very pleasing sensory wise and

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.330 
itself is very pleasing sensory wise and
it's<00:03:45.540> just<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.810> very<00:03:46.019> thin<00:03:46.320> layer<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:46.920> the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
it's just a very thin layer on the

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.330 
it's just a very thin layer on the
bottom<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.870> said<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.590> know<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:50.130> can

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
bottom and like I said you know you can

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.479 
bottom and like I said you know you can
easily<00:03:50.519> trace<00:03:51.120> out<00:03:51.709> letter<00:03:52.709> patterns<00:03:53.160> with<00:03:53.340> it

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
easily trace out letter patterns with it

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.110 
easily trace out letter patterns with it
just<00:03:53.640> as<00:03:53.850> well<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:55.280> this<00:03:56.280> activity<00:03:56.670> didn't

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
just as well and this activity didn't

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.759 
just as well and this activity didn't
cost<00:03:57.360> me<00:03:57.660> anything<00:03:57.690> because<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.290> had<00:03:58.590> the

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
cost me anything because I had the

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.960 
cost me anything because I had the
rolled<00:03:58.980> oats<00:03:59.600> already<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.799> just<00:04:02.579> used<00:04:02.790> some

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
rolled oats already and I just used some

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.620 
rolled oats already and I just used some
cardstock<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.079> chose<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.650> use<00:04:04.680> red<00:04:05.220> for

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
cardstock I chose to use red for

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.750 
cardstock I chose to use red for
consonants<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:06.989> so<00:04:07.380> D<00:04:07.829> is<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:07.980> consonant<00:04:08.519> and

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
consonants and so D is a consonant and

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.590 
consonants and so D is a consonant and
so<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.570> has<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:10.230> red<00:04:10.799> card<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.400> then<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:11.880> just<00:04:12.150> I

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
so it has a red card and then I just I

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.219 
so it has a red card and then I just I
just<00:04:13.230> free<00:04:13.829> handed<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.340> D<00:04:14.579> onto<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.359> light<00:04:15.959> a

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
just free handed a D onto a light a

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.460 
just free handed a D onto a light a
piece<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:17.060> fine<00:04:18.060> sandpaper<00:04:18.539> I<00:04:18.810> didn't<00:04:19.169> use<00:04:19.289> the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
piece of fine sandpaper I didn't use the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.830 
piece of fine sandpaper I didn't use the
really<00:04:19.739> rough<00:04:19.919> stuff<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.609> then<00:04:21.359> I<00:04:21.390> just<00:04:21.630> cut

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
really rough stuff and then I just cut

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.870 
really rough stuff and then I just cut
it<00:04:21.989> out<00:04:22.080> I<00:04:22.320> got<00:04:22.560> for<00:04:23.310> one<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.580> those<00:04:23.669> like

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
it out I got for one of those like

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.290
