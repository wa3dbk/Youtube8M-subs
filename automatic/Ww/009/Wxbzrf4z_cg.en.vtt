saw<00:00:23.390> you<00:00:24.390> need<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> sliding<00:00:25.109> table<00:00:25.340> this<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.519> my

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
saw you need a sliding table this is my

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.810 
saw you need a sliding table this is my
sliding<00:00:27.119> table<00:00:27.300> I've<00:00:27.599> had<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.019> for<00:00:28.289> 20<00:00:28.710> years

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
sliding table I've had this for 20 years

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.519 
sliding table I've had this for 20 years
has<00:00:29.820> two<00:00:30.269> runners<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.080> fit<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
has two runners on it that fit in the

has two runners on it that fit in the
slots<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.160> table<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.829> use<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.190> cutting

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
slots on the table so use it for cutting

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.910 
slots on the table so use it for cutting
true<00:00:35.790> 90<00:00:36.059> degrees<00:00:36.420> instead<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.469> worrying<00:00:37.710> with

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
true 90 degrees instead of worrying with

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.850 
true 90 degrees instead of worrying with
your<00:00:38.040> miter<00:00:38.190> gauge<00:00:38.460> all<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> time<00:00:39.649> to<00:00:40.649> cut<00:00:40.829> a

your miter gauge all the time to cut a
circle<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.879> draw<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> line<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.899> radius<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
circle you draw a line the radius of the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.430 
circle you draw a line the radius of the
circle<00:00:44.040> away<00:00:44.520> from<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.969> blade<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.510> then

circle away from the blade and then

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.490 
circle away from the blade and then
you're<00:00:46.620> going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> put<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> pivot<00:00:47.879> point<00:00:47.910> right

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
you're going to put a pivot point right

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.400 
you're going to put a pivot point right
here<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.789> line<00:00:51.920> nail<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
here on that line nail it in and you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.680 
here on that line nail it in and you
need<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.890> cut<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> about<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.000> quarter<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.539> an

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
need to cut it about a quarter of an

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.220 
need to cut it about a quarter of an
inch<00:00:57.809> or<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.289> above<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.489> surface<00:00:59.789> of<00:01:00.120> the

inch or so above the surface of the

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.899 
inch or so above the surface of the
table<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:02.629> file<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> point<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
table and file it to a point so that you

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.810 
table and file it to a point so that you
can<00:01:06.090> use<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.720> as<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.290> pivot<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.670> you're

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
can use it as a pivot when you're

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.920 
can use it as a pivot when you're
cutting<00:01:09.060> your<00:01:10.070> circle<00:01:14.240> that's<00:01:15.240> important

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
cutting your circle that's important

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.060 
cutting your circle that's important
when<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> put<00:01:17.159> your<00:01:17.750> board<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.229> saw<00:01:19.470> that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
when you put your board on the saw that

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.399 
when you put your board on the saw that
you<00:01:20.280> put<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.939> center<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.570> board<00:01:21.780> so

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you put it on the center of the board so

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.140 
you put it on the center of the board so
I'm<00:01:22.439> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.280> slightly

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
I'm going to have it just slightly

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.560 
I'm going to have it just slightly
overhanging<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.670> kerf<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.150> sliding

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
overhanging the kerf in the sliding

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.490 
overhanging the kerf in the sliding
table<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.979> want<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.280> put<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.610> right<00:01:29.939> down<00:01:30.500> on

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
table and I want to put it right down on

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.170 
table and I want to put it right down on
that<00:01:31.950> pivot<00:01:32.820> point<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.960> middle<00:01:38.180> and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that pivot point right in the middle and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.499 
that pivot point right in the middle and
nail<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> down<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.950> want<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.460> cut<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.880> into

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
nail it down now I want to cut this into

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.020 
nail it down now I want to cut this into
an<00:01:42.630> octagon

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.290 

you<00:01:50.030> got<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.330> hold<00:01:50.480> it<00:01:50.630> down<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:52.160> table<00:01:52.610> to

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
you got to hold it down to the table to

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:01.540 
you got to hold it down to the table to
keep<00:01:53.480> it<00:01:53.690> from<00:01:53.840> spinning<00:01:59.350> so<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.440> just<00:02:00.680> cut

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
keep it from spinning so you just cut

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.820 
keep it from spinning so you just cut
the<00:02:01.700> corners<00:02:02.120> off<00:02:03.790> and<00:02:05.290> then<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.440> cut<00:02:06.680> the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
the corners off and then you cut the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.499 
the corners off and then you cut the
corners<00:02:07.160> off<00:02:07.340> again<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.240> you're<00:02:08.420> actually

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
corners off again so you're actually

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:21.210 
corners off again so you're actually
making<00:02:08.899> sort<00:02:09.679> of<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.860> sixteen<00:02:10.520> sided<00:02:11.120> figure

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.030 

just<00:02:22.220> keep<00:02:22.489> cutting<00:02:23.560> pinning<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.680> slowly

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
just keep cutting pinning it slowly

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:34.930 
just keep cutting pinning it slowly
around<00:02:30.040> then<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.250> sort<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.300> advance<00:02:33.850> sort<00:02:34.850> of

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
around then you sort of advance sort of

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.740 
around then you sort of advance sort of
advance<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.660> work<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.310> spin<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:38.600> you

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
advance the work and spin it and you

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.940 
advance the work and spin it and you
just<00:02:38.780> nibbling<00:02:39.500> off<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.709> little<00:02:40.220> bit<00:02:40.370> at<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.520> time

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
just nibbling off a little bit at a time

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.040 
just nibbling off a little bit at a time
just<00:02:42.950> nibbling<00:02:43.489> off<00:02:43.700> then<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.690> move<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:44.989> a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
just nibbling off then you move it a

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.920 
just nibbling off then you move it a
little<00:02:45.080> forward<00:02:45.320> take<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> little<00:02:46.520> more<00:02:46.730> off
