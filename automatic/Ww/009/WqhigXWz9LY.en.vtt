00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
stamina as their fourth perk so as you

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.509 
stamina as their fourth perk so as you
see<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:23.100> bullet

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
see one bullet

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.970 
see one bullet
if<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.789> shoot<00:00:24.029> once<00:00:24.359> obviously<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:25.769> shoots

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
if you shoot once obviously just shoots

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.070 
if you shoot once obviously just shoots
out<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.369> bullet<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.480> what<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.750> didn't<00:00:28.050> know

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
out one bullet but what you didn't know

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.200 
out one bullet but what you didn't know
is<00:00:28.170> they<00:00:28.439> added<00:00:28.830> into<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> game<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:30.000> once

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
is they added into the game is that once

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.209 
is they added into the game is that once
you<00:00:30.359> buy<00:00:30.510> double<00:00:30.900> tap<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> increases

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
you buy double tap that it increases

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.370 
you buy double tap that it increases
that<00:00:32.520> one<00:00:32.790> bullet<00:00:33.120> actually<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.809> two<00:00:34.020> bullets

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
that one bullet actually is two bullets

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.020 
that one bullet actually is two bullets
so<00:00:34.710> if<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.890> shoot<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.280> bullet<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.700> will<00:00:35.850> shoot

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
so if you shoot one bullet it will shoot

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.049 
so if you shoot one bullet it will shoot
two<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.469> saw<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.710> speed<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> weapon

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
two as you saw the speed of the weapon

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.420 
two as you saw the speed of the weapon
when<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.329> shoot<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> lot<00:00:40.290> slower<00:00:40.530> without

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
when you shoot is a lot slower without

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.819 
when you shoot is a lot slower without
it<00:00:41.610> look<00:00:41.879> at<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.510> shoots<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.110> much<00:00:43.320> faster

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it look at that it shoots so much faster

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.410 
it look at that it shoots so much faster
and<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.579> come<00:00:44.730> over<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.329> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and then you come over here and you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.810 
and then you come over here and you
shoot<00:00:45.629> one<00:00:45.809> bullet<00:00:46.020> into<00:00:46.559> anything<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.309> boom

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
shoot one bullet into anything and boom

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
shoot one bullet into anything and boom
there's<00:00:48.120> two<00:00:48.329> bullets<00:00:48.690> that's<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> new<00:00:49.680> thing

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
there's two bullets that's a new thing

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.830 
there's two bullets that's a new thing
that<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:50.129> added<00:00:50.579> into<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.120> black<00:00:51.390> ops<00:00:51.600> they

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
that they added into this black ops they

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.450 
that they added into this black ops they
didn't<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> last<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:53.010> they

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
didn't have it in the last one they

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.010 
didn't have it in the last one they
didn't<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:53.969> any<00:00:54.210> zombies<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
didn't have it in any zombies with a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.160 
didn't have it in any zombies with a
double<00:00:55.530> tab<00:00:55.739> at<00:00:55.890> all<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:57.059> yeah<00:00:57.390> when<00:00:57.989> you're

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
double tab at all so yeah when you're

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.959 
double tab at all so yeah when you're
using<00:00:58.410> light<00:00:58.800> machine<00:00:59.190> guns<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.789> would

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
using light machine guns I would

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.410 
using light machine guns I would
recommend<00:01:00.539> using<00:01:01.460> stamin<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:03.239> it's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
recommend using stamin up because it's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.060 
recommend using stamin up because it's
gonna<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:04.019> difficult<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.559> run<00:01:04.860> if

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
gonna be really difficult to run if

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.980 
gonna be really difficult to run if
you're<00:01:05.189> trying<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.180> high<00:01:06.479> rounds

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
you're trying to just get high rounds

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.840 
you're trying to just get high rounds
but<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.860> doing<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.250> challenge<00:01:08.280> like

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
but if you are doing a challenge like

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.510 
but if you are doing a challenge like
pistols<00:01:09.420> only<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.979> want<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
pistols only or just want to have the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.190 
pistols only or just want to have the
ray<00:01:11.670> gun<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> ray<00:01:12.270> gun<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.510> probably<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> most

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
ray gun the ray gun is probably the most

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.390 
ray gun the ray gun is probably the most
reliable<00:01:13.439> weapon

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
reliable weapon

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.490 
reliable weapon
when<00:01:14.700> having<00:01:15.030> double<00:01:15.299> tap<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.320> ray

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
when having double tap because the ray

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
when having double tap because the ray
gun<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:17.280> shoot<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:18.060> shoot<00:01:18.270> at<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> decent

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
gun can shoot can shoot at a decent

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.270 
gun can shoot can shoot at a decent
speed<00:01:19.170> when<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.439> hold<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> down<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.070> when<00:01:20.159> it

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
speed when you hold it down but when it

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.410 
speed when you hold it down but when it
shoots<00:01:20.460> double<00:01:20.759> tap<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.030> pretty<00:01:21.210> much<00:01:21.360> like

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
shoots double tap it's pretty much like

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.260 
shoots double tap it's pretty much like
rapid<00:01:22.080> fire<00:01:22.340> like<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.490> see<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> speed<00:01:24.060> right

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
rapid fire like you see the speed right

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.870 
rapid fire like you see the speed right
there<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.840> okay<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:26.009> lot<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.670> speed

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
there it's okay it's not a lot of speed

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
there it's okay it's not a lot of speed
but<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:27.540> when<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.780> buy<00:01:27.900> double<00:01:28.350> tap<00:01:28.590> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
but then when you buy double tap it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.399 
but then when you buy double tap it
increases<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> speed<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.090> lot<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.659> makes<00:01:31.259> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
increases the speed a lot and makes you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.929 
increases the speed a lot and makes you
get<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> lot<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.159> points<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> lot<00:01:32.909> more

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
get a lot more points in a lot more

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.350 
get a lot more points in a lot more
kills<00:01:33.360> people<00:01:34.170> are<00:01:34.470> saying<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.790> ruins

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
kills people are saying that it ruins

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.300 
kills people are saying that it ruins
your<00:01:36.420> ammo<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.259> runs<00:01:37.439> out<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.770> ammo<00:01:38.100> but

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
your ammo and it runs out your ammo but

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.859 
your ammo and it runs out your ammo but
now<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.820> black<00:01:39.030> ops<00:01:39.270> 2<00:01:39.420> how<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.750> shoots

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
now in this black ops 2 how it shoots

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.050 
now in this black ops 2 how it shoots
two<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.409> one<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.740> doesn't<00:01:41.400> two<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.939> your

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
two and one it doesn't two of your

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.030 
two and one it doesn't two of your
bullets<00:01:42.390> from<00:01:42.509> your<00:01:42.689> cartridge<00:01:43.170> at<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:43.740> time

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
bullets from your cartridge at one time

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.370 
bullets from your cartridge at one time
so<00:01:44.700> when<00:01:44.880> shooting<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.390> it'll<00:01:45.630> only<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:46.110> one

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
so when shooting it it'll only get one

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.469 
so when shooting it it'll only get one
bullet<00:01:46.619> erased<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:48.000> will<00:01:48.149> be<00:01:48.240> shooting

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
bullet erased and you will be shooting

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.170 
bullet erased and you will be shooting
two<00:01:48.869> bullets<00:01:49.229> pretty<00:01:49.530> much<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:50.970> pretty

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
two bullets pretty much so that's pretty

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.240 
two bullets pretty much so that's pretty
much<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> for<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.899> perk<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.829> now<00:01:53.009> we're<00:01:53.159> gonna

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
much it for this perk so now we're gonna

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.130 
much it for this perk so now we're gonna
move<00:01:53.490> over<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.880> stem<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.329> up<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.079> is

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
move over to stem and up but this is

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.170 
move over to stem and up but this is
just<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:55.710> gameplay<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.310> RPD<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
just a little gameplay with the RPD and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.940 
just a little gameplay with the RPD and
double<00:01:57.479> tap<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.990> see<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.680> shooting

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
double tap as you see it's shooting

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.459 
double tap as you see it's shooting
wicked<00:01:59.399> fast<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.390> amazing<00:02:00.719> so

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
wicked fast and I think it's amazing so

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.200 
wicked fast and I think it's amazing so
I<00:02:01.500> think<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.950> perk<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.369> good<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.969> when

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
I think this perk is good for when

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.789 
I think this perk is good for when
you're<00:02:03.360> trying<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:04.020> too<00:02:04.170> high<00:02:04.350> rounds

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
you're trying to get too high rounds

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.740 
you're trying to get too high rounds
with<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.219> ray<00:02:05.399> gun<00:02:05.670> or<00:02:05.880> maybe<00:02:06.479> you're<00:02:06.630> not

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
with the ray gun or maybe you're not

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.150 
with the ray gun or maybe you're not
trying<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.079> run<00:02:07.259> trains<00:02:07.590> you're<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.950> kind<00:02:08.129> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
trying to run trains you're just kind of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.820 
trying to run trains you're just kind of
trying<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.489> camp<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.830> light

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
trying to camp with the light

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.339 
trying to camp with the light
machineguns<00:02:11.430> but<00:02:12.090> definitely<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.140> perk

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
machineguns but definitely it's a perk

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.640 
machineguns but definitely it's a perk
that

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.830 
that
I<00:02:13.680> would<00:02:13.829> recommend<00:02:14.159> to<00:02:14.430> buy<00:02:14.610> when<00:02:15.269> using<00:02:15.659> all

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I would recommend to buy when using all

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.869 
I would recommend to buy when using all
the<00:02:15.989> pistols<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.890> stuff<00:02:17.159> so<00:02:17.430> now

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
the pistols and all that stuff so now

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.140 
the pistols and all that stuff so now
we're<00:02:18.000> going<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.180> move<00:02:18.390> over<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.870> some<00:02:19.500> stamina

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
we're going to move over to some stamina

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.240 
we're going to move over to some stamina
each<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.390> these<00:02:21.510> perks<00:02:21.870> cost<00:02:22.290> 2,000<00:02:23.099> points

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
each of these perks cost 2,000 points

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.009 
each of these perks cost 2,000 points
they<00:02:23.819> don't<00:02:24.000> cost<00:02:24.239> more<00:02:24.540> than<00:02:24.689> one<00:02:24.810> another

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
they don't cost more than one another

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.750 
they don't cost more than one another
they<00:02:25.290> both<00:02:25.470> cost<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.920> same<00:02:26.159> so<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.670> think

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
they both cost the same so I think

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.420 
they both cost the same so I think
that's<00:02:27.060> an<00:02:27.180> upside<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.569> this<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.250> see

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
that's an upside of this so as you see

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.099 
that's an upside of this so as you see
running<00:02:29.730> with<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.970> pistol<00:02:30.390> gets<00:02:30.569> your<00:02:30.689> decent

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
running with the pistol gets your decent

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.190 
running with the pistol gets your decent
speed<00:02:31.349> but<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.159> lot<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.870> then<00:02:33.870> when<00:02:34.049> you're

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
speed but not a lot and then when you're

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.229 
speed but not a lot and then when you're
running<00:02:34.349> with<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.890> white<00:02:35.129> machine<00:02:35.579> gun<00:02:35.819> it

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
running with the white machine gun it

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.270 
running with the white machine gun it
runs<00:02:36.569> with<00:02:36.720> wicked<00:02:37.079> slow<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.709> can<00:02:37.890> barely

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
runs with wicked slow and you can barely

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.280 
runs with wicked slow and you can barely
move<00:02:38.459> around<00:02:38.760> if<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.209> trying<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.840> train

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
move around if you are trying to train

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.800 
move around if you are trying to train
and<00:02:40.560> get<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.829> very<00:02:41.040> high<00:02:41.280> rounds<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.540> I'm<00:02:42.629> going

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
and get to very high rounds so I'm going

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.750 
and get to very high rounds so I'm going
to<00:02:42.840> show<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.019> how<00:02:43.470> fast<00:02:43.799> you<00:02:44.129> can<00:02:44.430> run

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
to show you how fast you can run

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.710 
to show you how fast you can run
when<00:02:45.359> using<00:02:45.829> stamina<00:02:46.829> so<00:02:47.819> as<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.180> see<00:02:48.420> you

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
when using stamina so as you see you

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.170 
when using stamina so as you see you
increase<00:02:49.230> by<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.440> watt<00:02:49.829> maybe<00:02:50.220> by<00:02:50.430> an<00:02:50.609> extra<00:02:50.909> two

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
increase by a watt maybe by an extra two

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.089 
increase by a watt maybe by an extra two
seconds<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.379> could<00:02:52.530> squeeze<00:02:52.829> out<00:02:53.069> a

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
seconds that you could squeeze out a

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.000 
seconds that you could squeeze out a
zombies<00:02:53.579> when<00:02:53.730> you're<00:02:53.879> in<00:02:53.970> trouble<00:02:54.859> and<00:02:55.859> then

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
zombies when you're in trouble and then

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.520 
zombies when you're in trouble and then
with<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.280> pistols<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.209> just<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.720> kind<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.349> runs

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
with the pistols it just it kind of runs

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.110 
with the pistols it just it kind of runs
the<00:02:58.680> same<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.099> don't<00:02:59.129> see<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> difference<00:02:59.760> with

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the same I don't see a difference with

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.360 
the same I don't see a difference with
the<00:03:00.269> pistols<00:03:00.689> so<00:03:01.290> that's<00:03:01.560> why<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.769> recommend

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
the pistols so that's why I recommend

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.860 
the pistols so that's why I recommend
having<00:03:02.459> double<00:03:02.939> tap<00:03:03.120> for<00:03:03.359> all<00:03:03.450> them<00:03:03.659> and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
having double tap for all them and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.720 
having double tap for all them and
definitely<00:03:04.680> stammen<00:03:05.159> up<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.519> light

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
definitely stammen up for the light

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.679 
definitely stammen up for the light
machine<00:03:05.909> guns<00:03:06.359> I<00:03:07.189> do<00:03:08.189> believe<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.090> when<00:03:09.659> you

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
machine guns I do believe that when you

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.300 
machine guns I do believe that when you
buy<00:03:09.959> stamina<00:03:10.470> up<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.859> just<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.159> belief

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
buy stamina up this is just a belief

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.270 
buy stamina up this is just a belief
it's<00:03:11.700> not<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.879> fact<00:03:12.299> I<00:03:12.569> do<00:03:12.930> believe<00:03:13.139> that<00:03:13.470> you're

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
it's not a fact I do believe that you're

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.240 
it's not a fact I do believe that you're
switching<00:03:15.150> weapons<00:03:15.299> speed<00:03:15.750> increases<00:03:16.530> as<00:03:16.739> you

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
switching weapons speed increases as you

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.189 
switching weapons speed increases as you
see<00:03:17.459> if<00:03:17.699> you<00:03:17.819> switch<00:03:18.090> weapons<00:03:18.510> without<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.049> I

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
see if you switch weapons without it I

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.589 
see if you switch weapons without it I
think<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:20.040> will<00:03:20.069> switch<00:03:20.579> weapon<00:03:20.940> slowly<00:03:21.239> that

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
think you will switch weapon slowly that

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.449 
think you will switch weapon slowly that
might<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.959> speed<00:03:22.230> Cola<00:03:22.530> I'm<00:03:22.799> not<00:03:23.010> sure<00:03:23.250> which

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
