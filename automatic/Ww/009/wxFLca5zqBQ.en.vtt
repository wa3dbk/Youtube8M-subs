00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.030
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.960
 me 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.960
 My 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.560
 Arrive at Mihamaba, Fukui Prefecture 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:24.199
 That day the town's Tanabata event is held and I 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.199
 Have a per sang look forward to a lot of people before people are less station is usually 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.600
 We experienced a sense of presence for some 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.650
 Enter a nearby restaurant to have lunch 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:41.060
 Asking about Mihama 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.060
 It is because I thought if I could hear the cause of the measures related to it 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:53.290
 The daughter of the restaurant is embarrassed to tell me some of the local storytelling 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:57.210
 If you ask about the damage situation during the war, people in the neighboring town of Shiga will be miserable. 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.210
 Mihama is a secret ground from there 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:07.040
 Now it's targeted by nuclear power, though 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.040
 It is impressive to have a smile on his own 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.470
 We are swayed by the bus while thinking such a thing 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.010
 Also designated as a government-registered international sightseeing inn 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:27.220
 Fixing of the sea ordered to the Sea of Japan 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.300
 This hotel is also crowded with people during the swimming season 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.790
 There is almost no 100 off the season 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.810
 I stayed at the student district mayor of Mikunioka junior high school here 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.810
 I saw the Spirit 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.620
 You can 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.890
 We were guided to the top and we headed to the room 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.880
 peach 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.880
 At that time 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.369
 Hmm 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.530
 And Tsu screen 035 Great's will 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:11.980
 It contains presentation-chan 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:14.190
 And if good Oh for a'll head up much higher from the entrance of the d in reference hydrofluoric key 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:20.940
 Because it becomes a color 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:23.220
 Having witnessed Jizo from the corridors of the hotel we decided to take a walk around 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.069
 If you look around the entrance 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.120
 Do the same kind of Jizo what was visible from the corridor is enshrined here as well Tei 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:36.780
 The figure of a two-piece round stone is 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.780
 I was reminded of something red and was creepy 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.760
 Although next to the Jizo there was a cave reminiscent of north-proof 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.460
 The entrance is closed 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:53.860
 Put not do during the 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.860
 Going clouds are also suspicious, and the dimness of the surrounding mountains is a sign beyond mediocre 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.080
 Proceed a earnestly promenade road to sew between the mountains and the sea 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.950
 Jizo also here also here yet again 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.450
 Yup 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:16.530
 I say what kind of body Jizo is there 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:21.860
 Hundreds of persistent people who failed to face the mountain 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.190
 What the hell are these elephants put for? 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.560
 interesting 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.560
 I'm trying to calm down some kind of spirit 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.560
 Hmm 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.230
 Passing through numerous Jizo 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:48.310
 Finally arrived to Taishido 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:48.310
 It is a lonesome place where there is a temple and statues that are believed to be related to Kobo Daishi . 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.780
 But there we made an unexpected discovery 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.160
 Oh 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.880
 There is something 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.460
 Where I turned around casually 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.450
 There was a secret cave hidden by the king in the grass 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.450
 And there 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.549
 I found something like an altar mixed with something in the back of a cave 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.599
 One thing 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.599
 What is this 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.130
 If you go a little further there is a trace that someone has collected and stacked stones 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.300
 I decided to listen to the surrounding residents 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.830
 Set the tool pool zone 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.180
 There is Arthur 's 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.320
 me 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.750
 Is only that view 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.130
 I think, but I have good news 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.130
 I hope you use it most 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:00.650
 Yes Is this was Taiu Honda asked very Kai Branch 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:07.880
 I want to face it 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:08.660
 Ishihara who played there is a lot of fireworks Thai writing around there , or this is flow support 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.190
 Arashi 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.600
 Do the other country 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:18.480
 No, if you can do it naturally, it is completely natural 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.139
 It is written me in the fall because there is no pressure in the 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.580
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:32.190
 But I'm going back tomorrow it something from the other before and each other to make here softening high 2-year-old Coast 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:35.430
 It's Is the guy was a tampon in the exhibit and pieces of Oolong Yes Domo 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:39.380
 None of the above can provide useful information 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.600
 It is a mysterious altar that local residents are not aware of 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.340
 One body 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.340
 What was done 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:53.889
 We went back to the hotel in the late afternoon and we asked the government about the story of Jizo 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.330
 While speaking 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:04.160
 As a child grows up quickly 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:07.420
 I had went out To hurriedly only communicated with the 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:13.740
 I wonder if I'm hiding something 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.740
 Is there anything to do with the remarks students witnessed 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.940
 I returned to the room and we were witnessed at the hotel 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:28.970
 Attempt to shoot an example 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.970
 I kept shooting the inside of the night room with a night vision camera 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:49.030
 I did not find any particular side of what I tried to copy the inside also 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.289
 And visit of night vision camera 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.919
 That what appears to the United States objects appear is 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:53.919
 It was not 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:06.100
 I am examining the history of Mihama the next day 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:08.100
 I was able to find a strange description 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:15.830
 Living during the war Oh 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:15.830
 Several states have been introduced along with Mihama's history, including the decision to accept nuclear power plants 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:27.980
 One of them 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:27.980
 Is a thing called to play the children that are no longer stacked stones in the futile effort 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.430
 Jizo that lined up strangely 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.409
 Stone sent to you 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:40.689
 Cave altar 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:44.910
 What students who came to experience learning felt in this place 

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:50.030
 I wonder was 9 what to go what you see 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:50.030
 We are currently under investigation
