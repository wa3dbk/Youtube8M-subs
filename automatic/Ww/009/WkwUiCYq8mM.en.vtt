00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.570
 but the expectation of us are 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.990
 great we not only said that we put a 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.250
 goal to get to the league we know the 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.099
 situation that is very we know the 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.420
 rivals that we have but we instead 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.539
 to think about river we have to think about 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.039
 the young quality that we have and the 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.050
 confidence that we can grab match 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.820
 to party to be able to achieve what 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.600
 what we want we not only have to go 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.570
 step by step 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.300
 the first of o'higgins we know for something 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.100
 they are in the first place the first 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.710
 places and the quality player who has 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.110
 let's face the game the best 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.420
 way 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.670
 to win that is where it has to go 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.860
 Always color and hopefully if you can not 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.980
 of the result to start thinking for 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.870
 already start thinking big I felt 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.770
 pretty good even though it's not 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.170
 in my position 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.270
 try tito asked me a lot that 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.030
 will catch the ball that will play a lot with 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.960
 emiliano what is what we came 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.940
 doing a Spanish and nothing I think 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.260
 that my attitude changed a lot the 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.410
 team attitude also changed 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.700
 we went out to slow down the game of 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.409
 the best way we know that he runs what 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.880
 I was coming to win 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.530
 and I think that after a while we did it a lot 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.719
 well and we saw mind and tone shelf in 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.030
 the personal thing when he spoke with me he told me 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:28.209
 that I had fun that wanted what I 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.069
 I know and I put what what out there 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:34.030
 they were questioning me a little bit 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:35.979
 was when I did not have the ball to me 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.409
 gave the best possible freedom to play 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.049
 and I think my partner also think that 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.079
 the disposition of the equipment was of the minute 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:48.239
 0 at minute 93 I have not had to leave 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:50.739
 goal was the same we fought each ball and 

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:53.289
 We also had the luck that we 

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:56.400
 we were having in the other party yes 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.710
 obviously I want 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.690
 and I want to prove it because they brought me 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.090
 here I want to show it to play that 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.850
 I am and obviously I take it as a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.119
 revenge and so I have players 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.019
 who are better 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.370
 they are also very good players who 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.319
 they are also fighting the position as 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.239
 mauro olivi felipe flÃ³rez and the same 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.500
 nicolÃ¡s channels that came out collection as well 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.390
 I have to be careful everyone is 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.829
 demonstrating minute by minute match to 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.720
 party and if I get to be this week 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.079
 will try to cell better way and 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.849
 obviously the blow to an important plus 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.810
 had not marked that time and the first 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.209
 match that I played starter in this 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.770
 championship was given to me so it 's pretty 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.410
 happy 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.420
 we the truth that of those subjects 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.790
 we try to be on the sidelines I can 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.950
 speak for the teacher or I know him 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.880
 pretty good and I know the quality person 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.520
 that he has always believed 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.770
 with the player then only for 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.970
 give my support that is a person 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.710
 extraordinary and but later more no longer 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.020
 are going to be we try to be 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.370
 apart from that I can speak for 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.130
 Claudio the truth that I know him 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.450
 pretty good but that's where I said it in 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.430
 A note in tourist is not good to talk 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.280
 from another technician knowing that he's just 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.620
 making little eyes so they deserve the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.760
 greater respect and everything but by claudio 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.140
 I can talk is a person 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.560
 extraordinary I know it pretty well 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.070
 I had been in Argentina with him and I 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.550
 It seems that it's pretty good people and very 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.500
 good technician I will not say 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.950
 to me classic 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.660
 obviously with the uv but what I say the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.960
 true that they do not listen to it or I did not read anything 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:40.470
 I do not know what he 'll think I do not know 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.960
 sometimes you have to shut up a little bit and 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.570
 show it more by talking on the court like this 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.800
 that the truth that I have no idea what 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.960
 I speak only I can say that the 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.470
 classic the archrival of us in the 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.460
 wii 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.460
 and only that
