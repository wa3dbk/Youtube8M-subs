00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
that she could get another treatment

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.809 
that she could get another treatment
with<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.160> laser<00:03:16.630> it's<00:03:17.630> really<00:03:18.140> difficult<00:03:18.380> to

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
with the laser it's really difficult to

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.630 
with the laser it's really difficult to
traffic<00:03:19.819> at<00:03:20.030> drive<00:03:20.959> them<00:03:21.200> someplace<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.040> have

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
traffic at drive them someplace and have

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.309 
traffic at drive them someplace and have
the<00:03:22.790> treatment<00:03:23.269> done<00:03:23.420> but<00:03:23.720> we<00:03:23.870> felt<00:03:24.080> like<00:03:24.110> it

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
the treatment done but we felt like it

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.809 
the treatment done but we felt like it
was<00:03:24.440> so<00:03:24.590> important<00:03:25.100> because<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.549> really

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
was so important because it really

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.309 
was so important because it really
seemed<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.180> have<00:03:26.360> helped<00:03:26.630> her<00:03:26.750> in<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.989> early

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
seemed to have helped her in the early

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.140 
seemed to have helped her in the early
stages<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:27.830> we<00:03:28.220> wanted<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.519> give<00:03:28.730> her<00:03:28.850> another

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
stages so we wanted to give her another

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:42.559 
stages so we wanted to give her another
treatment

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.479 

so<00:03:43.110> we're<00:03:43.469> doing<00:03:43.739> treatment<00:03:44.099> with<00:03:44.250> some<00:03:44.400> of

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
so we're doing treatment with some of

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.470 
so we're doing treatment with some of
the<00:03:44.549> cats<00:03:44.790> using<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.540> K<00:03:45.840> laser<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.650> was<00:03:47.480> lent

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
the cats using the K laser that was lent

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.959 
the cats using the K laser that was lent
to<00:03:48.540> us<00:03:48.780> by<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.079> company<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.890> one<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.790> cats

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:50.969

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
better action in this film and it's

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.390 
better action in this film and it's
their<00:06:54.330> higher-end<00:06:54.930> model<00:06:55.470> and<00:06:55.710> its<00:06:55.889> twenty

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
their higher-end model and its twenty

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.820 
their higher-end model and its twenty
five<00:06:56.610> thousand<00:06:57.210> nine<00:06:57.360> hundred<00:06:57.630> dollars<00:06:58.169> the

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
five thousand nine hundred dollars the

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.530 
five thousand nine hundred dollars the
one<00:06:59.010> that<00:06:59.160> we're<00:06:59.310> currently<00:06:59.610> using<00:06:59.850> here<00:07:00.510> I

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
one that we're currently using here I

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.140 
one that we're currently using here I
think<00:07:00.900> is<00:07:01.020> close<00:07:01.320> to<00:07:01.530> twenty<00:07:01.830> thousand<00:07:02.370> but

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150
