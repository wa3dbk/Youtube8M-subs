00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
continue to do this section by section

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.700 
continue to do this section by section
break<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.549> product<00:01:08.970> through<00:01:09.350> make<00:01:10.350> sure<00:01:10.380> it's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
break the product through make sure it's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.859 
break the product through make sure it's
nice<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:10.950> saturated<00:01:11.450> especially<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
nice and saturated especially at the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.530 
nice and saturated especially at the
scalp<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.490> towards<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> end<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> your

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
scalp and towards the end of the your

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.730 
scalp and towards the end of the your
natural<00:01:15.990> hair<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.799> extension<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
natural hair in the extension here and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.429 
natural hair in the extension here and
just<00:01:19.740> take<00:01:20.009> them<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.229> it's

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
just take them out as you can see it's

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.490 
just take them out as you can see it's
easy<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.950> unravel<00:01:24.140> especially<00:01:25.140> because<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
easy to unravel especially because the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.370 
easy to unravel especially because the
senegalese<00:01:26.040> twists<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.450> twist<00:01:27.780> method

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
senegalese twists or it's a twist method

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.160 
senegalese twists or it's a twist method
so<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.799> easier<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.490> unravel<00:01:30.390> as<00:01:30.570> opposed<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
so it's easier to unravel as opposed to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:40.590 
so it's easier to unravel as opposed to
braids<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.860> three<00:01:32.340> strand<00:01:32.700> braid

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.410 

and<00:01:41.770> I<00:01:42.770> basically<00:01:42.950> just<00:01:43.310> continue<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:44.090> do<00:01:44.240> this

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
and I basically just continue to do this

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.660 
and I basically just continue to do this
until<00:01:44.479> I'm<00:01:45.020> done<00:01:45.290> with<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.619> entire<00:01:45.950> head<00:01:46.369> it

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
until I'm done with the entire head it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.050 
until I'm done with the entire head it
took<00:01:47.360> me<00:01:47.540> about<00:01:48.009> 15<00:01:49.009> minutes<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.490> get<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:49.850> all

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
took me about 15 minutes to get this all

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.770 
took me about 15 minutes to get this all
done<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.720> as<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:51.770> can<00:01:51.950> see<00:01:51.979> my<00:01:52.909> natural<00:01:53.479> hair

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
done and as you can see my natural hair

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.060 
done and as you can see my natural hair
is<00:01:54.020> back<00:01:54.440> in<00:01:54.920> action<00:01:56.500> looks<00:01:57.500> really<00:01:57.710> pretty

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
is back in action looks really pretty

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.700 
is back in action looks really pretty
because<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.210> coiling<00:01:59.780> or<00:02:00.020> curling<00:02:00.470> action

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
because of the coiling or curling action

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.040 
because of the coiling or curling action
from<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.220> twist<00:02:02.290> method<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.119> can't<00:02:05.479> wait<00:02:05.720> to

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
from the twist method so I can't wait to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.570 
from the twist method so I can't wait to
go<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.440> next<00:02:06.619> step<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.190> this<00:02:07.369> would<00:02:07.550> be

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
go to the next step and this would be

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.259 
go to the next step and this would be
deep<00:02:08.570> conditioning<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.410> hair<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.009> I<00:02:10.850> chose

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
deep conditioning this hair and I chose

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.390 
deep conditioning this hair and I chose
to<00:02:11.450> do<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.630> protein<00:02:12.230> /<00:02:12.590> d<00:02:12.860> conditioning

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
to do a protein / d conditioning

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.090 
to do a protein / d conditioning

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.440 
hair I decide to bundle it up to keep it
so<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.320> can<00:02:21.590> wash<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.340> then<00:02:22.430> reuse<00:02:22.910> because

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
so I can wash and then reuse because

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.509 
so I can wash and then reuse because
this<00:02:23.720> Marley<00:02:24.110> hair<00:02:24.320> can<00:02:24.530> be<00:02:24.560> reused<00:02:24.980> over<00:02:25.250> and

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
this Marley hair can be reused over and

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.380 
this Marley hair can be reused over and
over<00:02:25.730> again<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:28.280> that's<00:02:28.430> basically<00:02:28.700> what<00:02:29.209> i<00:02:29.239> do

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
over again so that's basically what i do

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.740 
over again so that's basically what i do
and<00:02:30.489> ready<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:32.330> for<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.930> wash<00:02:33.140> day<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.440> guess
