00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
shapes at the bottom this you can do

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.760 
shapes at the bottom this you can do
just<00:01:19.190> by<00:01:19.280> supporting<00:01:20.120> the<00:01:20.930> back<00:01:21.110> of<00:01:21.290> your<00:01:21.470> card

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
just by supporting the back of your card

but gently pushing forward these

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.660 
but gently pushing forward these
elements<00:01:29.299> separately<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.490> only<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.640> a

elements separately and only to a
shallow<00:01:32.600> degree<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:34.130> don't<00:01:34.430> overdo<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.420> at

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
shallow degree so don't overdo it at

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.300 
shallow degree so don't overdo it at
this<00:01:36.049> stage<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:37.090> can<00:01:38.090> just<00:01:38.330> see<00:01:38.720> how<00:01:39.110> the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
this stage and you can just see how the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.450 
this stage and you can just see how the
shapes<00:01:40.310> start<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.299> emerge<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:43.190> just

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
shapes start to emerge and just

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.210 
shapes start to emerge and just
progressively<00:01:44.090> go<00:01:44.690> along<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.650> bottom<00:01:46.040> of

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
progressively go along the bottom of

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.480 
progressively go along the bottom of
your<00:01:46.280> design<00:01:47.110> always<00:01:48.110> just<00:01:48.500> pressing<00:01:49.040> right

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
your design always just pressing right

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.719 
your design always just pressing right
at<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.820> bottom<00:01:50.180> with<00:01:50.900> your<00:01:51.080> finger<00:01:51.520> from<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
at the bottom with your finger from the

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.859 
at the bottom with your finger from the
back<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.439> then<00:01:54.439> just<00:01:54.909> helping<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.030> helping

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
back and then just helping it helping

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.700 
back and then just helping it helping
the<00:01:57.020> shapes<00:01:57.290> along<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:58.810> at<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.900> same<00:02:00.080> time<00:02:00.409> it

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
the shapes along and at the same time it

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.740 
the shapes along and at the same time it
can<00:02:00.920> sometimes<00:02:01.220> be<00:02:01.549> useful<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:02.210> press

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
can sometimes be useful to just press

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.010 
can sometimes be useful to just press
down<00:02:03.110> on<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:04.070> top<00:02:04.430> plane<00:02:04.790> whilst<00:02:05.540> holding

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
down on this top plane whilst holding

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.740 
down on this top plane whilst holding
onto<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.380> bottom<00:02:06.710> with<00:02:06.890> your<00:02:07.070> left<00:02:07.939> hand<00:02:08.179> I'm

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
onto the bottom with your left hand I'm

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.359 
onto the bottom with your left hand I'm
left-handed<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.830> might<00:02:09.979> be<00:02:10.039> slightly

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
left-handed so it might be slightly

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.360 
left-handed so it might be slightly
different<00:02:10.610> for<00:02:10.879> you<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.830> once<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:13.010> get<00:02:13.189> to

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
different for you and once you get to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.009 
different for you and once you get to
this<00:02:13.519> tower<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.670> can<00:02:16.700> actually<00:02:17.480> just<00:02:17.780> turn

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
this tower you can actually just turn

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.599 
this tower you can actually just turn
your<00:02:18.260> card<00:02:18.500> around<00:02:18.799> and<00:02:20.650> work<00:02:21.650> at<00:02:21.980> your<00:02:22.219> design

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
your card around and work at your design

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.180 
your card around and work at your design
from<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.269> top<00:02:23.450> as<00:02:23.629> well

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
from the top as well

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.160 
from the top as well
this<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.430> makes<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.970> more<00:02:26.240> consistent<00:02:26.990> and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
this just makes it more consistent and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.130 
this just makes it more consistent and
you<00:02:28.010> have<00:02:28.190> less<00:02:28.430> chance<00:02:28.460> of<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.870> paper

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
you have less chance of the paper

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.750 
you have less chance of the paper
buckling<00:02:31.720> increasing<00:02:32.720> in<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.960> wrong<00:02:33.140> places

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
buckling increasing in the wrong places

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.200 
buckling increasing in the wrong places
the<00:02:34.760> last<00:02:35.030> part<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.810> our<00:02:35.870> fold<00:02:36.260> will<00:02:36.500> be<00:02:36.620> this

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
the last part of our fold will be this

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.920 
the last part of our fold will be this
skyscraper<00:02:38.210> here<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:40.240> just<00:02:41.240> progressively
