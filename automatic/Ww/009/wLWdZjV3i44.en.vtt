00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.119
 welcome back on vitor happens in Italy 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.680
 will take care of our personalized intro 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.270
 of the master months here with us 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.460
 Today, good morning, good evening, I feel 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.620
 the more I like the goodnight but not in the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.739
 sense of baiano and goodnight we are 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.730
 rock potato then damage or of thing 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.089
 let's talk 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.870
 today we will talk about another exercise for 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.309
 hand enlargement is an exercise 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.339
 I call it a bit slick 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.390
 because it is difficult but easy it is 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.539
 hard 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.719
 we will wait for the fingers of the left hand 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:04.140
 this exercise was suggested by a 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.830
 a well-known musician but not a great one 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.070
 musician who reported on his 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.430
 method that is is devastating is its own 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.500
 nice nice 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.160
 we see it project is called the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.160
 spider 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:36.430
 these are noticed that is the four 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:40.990
 quarters I put a note on each movement 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:49.930
 yes therefore a note every fourth 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:52.800
 now I put more 22 octaves up to 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.800
 put four 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.329
 you will tell me it sounds easy but it is not for 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.869
 what reason why fingers alternate 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:10.720
 on the first with the third and the second with 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:14.450
 the fourth one is then vice versa therefore 1 3 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.450
 2 4 3 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.450
 142 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.930
 the next exercise is in the e 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.290
 here at first parenthesis how difficult it is 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.060
 jump from one rope to another 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.060
 we will treat a rope so we will do the 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.950
 same thing we did with before 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.360
 with the first one with the second one now 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.310
 we will do with the first with the head then 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.310
 see the hand you start to enlarge 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.230
 oo 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.400
 you can even go as far as you can 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:03.090
 even making a mistake has happened to walk 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.120
 you can go wrong a good exercise will be 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.819
 but then it is not over here well you can 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.319
 always alternate with the first string with 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.879
 the fourth you will see you will see the hand sees 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.859
 in the hand because it is called the spider 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.140
 because it looks like a comb of a 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:29.959
 spider climbing on keyboard 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:29.959
 and note use this one 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.620
 sure and as long as it's four 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.549
 6 agreements when they become problematic 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:44.780
 how interesting this is me 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:48.469
 I always recommend the metronome or 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.849
 advice I can give 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.859
 there are lots of batteries 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.370
 electronics are a lot on 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.939
 therefore, no mobile phones 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.040
 electronic battery always right 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.989
 slow time medium time I wanted 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.079
 certainly then we say this 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.540
 exercise doing a progression of 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.790
 learning starts from the first 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.810
 and the second string and take it there 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.060
 hand while we get used to doing 13 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.910
 perform 4 and return scrolling then we pass 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.709
 first and third string then first and fourth 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.900
 rope is talking about the human sense 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.550
 exercise that started as a beginner 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.440
 arrive that you are advanced and still you are 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.750
 doing it for us does all the first of 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.550
 start my every concert 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.409

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:41.510
 flowing in the hands has among other things are there 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.400

 nico shows us all the stretching 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.880
 business before because in short 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.260
 remember that we talk about activity 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.120
 psychomotor and muscle paradise e 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.370
