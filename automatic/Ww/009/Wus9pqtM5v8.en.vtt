00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420

FM I think it's quite an underrated
little<00:00:50.809> truck<00:00:51.129> something<00:00:52.129> about<00:00:52.519> the<00:00:52.670> way

little truck something about the way

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.540 
little truck something about the way
that<00:00:53.059> it<00:00:53.180> handles<00:00:53.710> smaller<00:00:54.710> lower<00:00:55.010> profile

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
that it handles smaller lower profile

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.149 
that it handles smaller lower profile
cab<00:00:55.879> I<00:00:56.180> mean<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.989> is<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.170> great<00:00:57.530> truck<00:00:57.890> for

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.410 

yeah<00:01:11.710> I'm<00:01:11.890> here<00:01:12.070> with<00:01:12.249> Mitch<00:01:12.819> Payton<00:01:13.060> from

Volvo<00:01:13.719> Group<00:01:13.869> Australia<00:01:14.700> FMX

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
Volvo Group Australia FMX

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.120 
Volvo Group Australia FMX
it's<00:01:16.149> kind<00:01:16.450> of<00:01:16.539> like<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.780> FM<00:01:17.140> with<00:01:17.380> steel<00:01:17.920> cat

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
it's kind of like the FM with steel cat

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.859 
it's kind of like the FM with steel cat
boots<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.609> our<00:01:18.700> hope<00:01:18.850> is<00:01:19.030> best<00:01:19.240> that's<00:01:19.479> Roger

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
boots and our hope is best that's Roger

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.959 
boots and our hope is best that's Roger
so<00:01:20.140> what's<00:01:20.439> let's<00:01:20.740> deal<00:01:20.920> with<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.100> FMX<00:01:21.670> if<00:01:21.789> it

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
so what's let's deal with the FMX if it

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.260 
so what's let's deal with the FMX if it
makes<00:01:22.149> it<00:01:22.359> some<00:01:22.630> I<00:01:22.960> guess<00:01:23.500> it's<00:01:24.179> previous<00:01:25.179> it

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
makes it some I guess it's previous it

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.819 
makes it some I guess it's previous it
was<00:01:25.359> probably<00:01:25.569> more<00:01:25.659> cosmetic<00:01:26.109> but<00:01:26.439> now<00:01:26.590> with

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
was probably more cosmetic but now with

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.260 
was probably more cosmetic but now with
our<00:01:26.950> new<00:01:27.069> model<00:01:27.369> it's<00:01:27.490> probably<00:01:27.850> pocket<00:01:28.119> might

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
our new model it's probably pocket might

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.550 
our new model it's probably pocket might
of<00:01:28.359> the<00:01:28.450> skin<00:01:28.659> as<00:01:28.780> well<00:01:28.929> like<00:01:29.289> really

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
of the skin as well like really

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.279 
of the skin as well like really
strengthening<00:01:30.159> arm<00:01:30.750> under<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.840> chassis<00:01:32.020> this

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
strengthening arm under the chassis this

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.230 
strengthening arm under the chassis this
is<00:01:32.439> like<00:01:32.679> that<00:01:32.829> off-road<00:01:33.219> application<00:01:33.909> who

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
is like that off-road application who

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.999 
is like that off-road application who
are<00:01:34.420> being<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.810> strong<00:01:35.079> to<00:01:35.229> play<00:01:35.439> to<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.649> table

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
now about getting those off-road needs

i<00:01:53.079> shipped<00:01:53.560> as<00:01:53.739> an<00:01:54.159> automated<00:01:54.489> transmission

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
i shipped as an automated transmission

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.029 
i shipped as an automated transmission
traditionally<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.289> either<00:01:56.409> had<00:01:56.709> a<00:01:56.739> torque

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
traditionally it either had a torque

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.919 
traditionally it either had a torque
converter<00:01:57.099> automatic<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:58.060> power<00:01:58.390> shift<00:01:58.599> or<00:01:58.810> day

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
or just a manual transmission so really

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.069 
or just a manual transmission so really
opens<00:02:03.099> a<00:02:03.250> lot<00:02:03.399> more<00:02:03.579> scope<00:02:03.939> for<00:02:03.969> the<00:02:04.209> efi

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
opens a lot more scope for the efi

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.529 
opens a lot more scope for the efi
as<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:06.219> first<00:02:06.369> time<00:02:06.579> I've<00:02:06.759> driven<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.179> FE

as the first time I've driven the FE
this<00:02:08.050> one's<00:02:08.429> got<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.509> torque<00:02:10.509> converter

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
this one's got the torque converter

also on taking all the the bumps and
stuff<00:03:10.410> out<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.800> driving<00:03:11.220> experience<00:03:11.730> and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
sort of settle I think I need to go and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.900 
sort of settle I think I need to go and
try<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.100> for<00:03:17.280> myself

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
startling the difference it makes I'm

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.170 
startling the difference it makes I'm
actually<00:03:53.710> over<00:03:54.250> steering<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.760> vehicle

actually over steering the vehicle

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.490 
actually over steering the vehicle
because<00:03:55.630> I'm<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.020> used<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.320> making

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.460 
because I'm so used to making
corrections<00:03:57.480> it's<00:03:58.480> very<00:03:58.900> difficult<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.350> get

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
yourself out of it I find I'm wobbling

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.630 
yourself out of it I find I'm wobbling

dynamic steering it's a really

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.680 
dynamic steering it's a really
interesting<00:04:30.389> concept<00:04:31.100> it<00:04:32.240> seems<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.540> me<00:04:33.660> like

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
interesting concept it seems to me like

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.200 
interesting concept it seems to me like
it<00:04:34.139> lacks<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.560> little<00:04:34.770> bit<00:04:34.889> of<00:04:34.979> Road<00:04:35.160> feel<00:04:35.490> in

it lacks a little bit of Road feel in

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.030 
it lacks a little bit of Road feel in
you<00:04:36.690> know<00:04:36.810> especially<00:04:37.050> on<00:04:37.350> broken<00:04:37.800> roads

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
you know especially on broken roads

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.830 
you know especially on broken roads
there<00:04:38.639> isn't<00:04:38.970> any<00:04:39.120> kickback<00:04:39.510> through<00:04:39.720> the

there isn't any kickback through the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.530 
there isn't any kickback through the

from the road surface as well but I can

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.480 
from the road surface as well but I can
see<00:04:45.810> there's<00:04:46.050> applications<00:04:46.919> where<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.160> really

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
see there's applications where it really

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.960 
see there's applications where it really
will<00:04:47.669> shine<00:04:47.910> in<00:04:48.889> local<00:04:49.889> distribution<00:04:50.220> local

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
will shine in local distribution local

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.719 
will shine in local distribution local
b-double<00:04:51.510> truck<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:52.229> dog<00:04:52.400> rolls<00:04:53.400> where

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
b-double truck and dog rolls where

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.280 
b-double truck and dog rolls where
drivers<00:04:54.030> are<00:04:54.270> really<00:04:54.600> cranking<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.110> wheel

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
drivers are really cranking the wheel

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.379 
drivers are really cranking the wheel
all<00:04:55.560> day<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.160> that<00:04:56.490> will<00:04:56.639> really<00:04:56.820> take<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.150> lot

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
all day and that will really take a lot

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.540 
all day and that will really take a lot
of<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.660> stress<00:04:58.050> out<00:04:58.380> of<00:04:58.830> out<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.160> a<00:04:59.340> drive

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
of the stress out of out of a drive

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.909 
of the stress out of out of a drive
during<00:04:59.850> their<00:04:59.970> work<00:05:00.120> day<00:05:00.320> it's<00:05:01.320> not<00:05:01.500> it's<00:05:01.740> a

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
during their work day it's not it's a

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.320 
during their work day it's not it's a
six<00:05:02.130> thousand<00:05:02.460> dollar<00:05:02.490> option<00:05:02.940> so<00:05:03.090> it's<00:05:03.240> not

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
six thousand dollar option so it's not

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.860 
six thousand dollar option so it's not
like<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.630> turns<00:05:03.870> up<00:05:04.050> with<00:05:04.229> the<00:05:04.410> track<00:05:05.870> so

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
like it turns up with the track so

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.360 
like it turns up with the track so
ultimately<00:05:07.380> I<00:05:07.500> suppose<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.919> market<00:05:08.250> will

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
ultimately I suppose the market will

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.930 
ultimately I suppose the market will
decide

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.000
