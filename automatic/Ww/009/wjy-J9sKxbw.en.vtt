okay we're gonna find a straight down in
this<00:03:18.129> position<00:03:31.500> here's<00:03:32.500> where<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.769> gets

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
this position here's where it gets

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.099 
this position here's where it gets
slightly<00:03:33.280> different<00:03:33.790> we're<00:03:34.299> gonna<00:03:34.450> go<00:03:34.599> to<00:03:34.660> the
