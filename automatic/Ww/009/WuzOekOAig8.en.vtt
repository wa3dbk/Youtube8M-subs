00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.160
 but me I have and what repellent 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.320
 the special feature of this 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.240
 village 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.219
 different existing products for 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.980
 facades especially of application 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.320
 outside give us very characteristics 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.419
 punctual the special feature of 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.480
 This product is made 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.460
 also under a special resin that 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.769
 It is the resin of intelligent particles 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.259
 the smart particles are going to 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.720
 give the specialized feature of 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.449
 that this product may be applicable in 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.739
 different types of surfaces 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.629
 really a little more focused on what 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.970
 which is the application the outside in 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.050
 surfaces as we see it here 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.890
 surfaces that are not pilot 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.660
 they have protection 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.480
 They are usually stained with water 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.579
 rain or pollution effects in the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.719
 case of perm to latex and repellent goes to 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.190
 be the ideal product in this 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.949
 recommendation of surfaces because 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.020
 because it's going to wash and it's going to prevent 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.390
 that type of spots last for the 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.070
 time a very important question is 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.750
 what people do if only the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.489
 product is from an external application or 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.680
 interior in this case we have a 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.390
 double action product a product that 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.280
 may be applicable on surfaces 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.100
 outside as well as the surfaces 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.020
 interiors in any way not if 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.860
 there is a type of external moisture in the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.560
 facade is going 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.270
 can have that kind of humidity 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.870
 let's understand this as a new component 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.520
 a new technology and before nonexistent 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.160
 in our country that gives us the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.010
 feature that can us 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.500
 this painting give it a resistance to what 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.729
 that with that kind of factors in some 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.710
 longer life time in the 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.080
 surface that that is the true and 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.760
 only motive of the painting not true the 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.050
 system with dermis that has this 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.030
 product gives us the ease of 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.850
 apply it in different types of colors 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.560
 for different types of facades this 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.330
 painting will give us the characteristic 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.729
 special to form a component 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.380
 plastic that will prevent that water 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.970
 enter so easily to a 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.250
 surface this painting to have 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.869
 nanotechnological- type components we 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.330
 is going to give a much more gray finish or 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.890
 first place and free of low splashes what 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.720
 that will facilitate cleaning in the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.490
 paint application this for example 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.770
 having the rain the rain will do 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.800
 that this type of dirt is exterior 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.450
 Car wash latex perma paint hydro 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.760
 and repel a painting that we have 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.290
 applied outside we subject it to the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.980
 water stain and it was completely 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.980
 clean
