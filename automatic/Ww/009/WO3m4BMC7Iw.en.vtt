00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
left hand corner right now so basically

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.750 
left hand corner right now so basically

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.840 
beat I don't know maybe can lay them in
the<00:01:39.960> things<00:01:40.560> when<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.920> run<00:01:41.070> across<00:01:41.189> them<00:01:41.700> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the things when you run across them you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.160 
the things when you run across them you
get<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.270> cool<00:01:42.390> sound<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:43.140> something<00:01:45.170> but

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
get a really cool sound or something but

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.660 
get a really cool sound or something but
anyways<00:01:46.530> I'm<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> show<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> guys

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
anyways I'm just going to show you guys

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.090 
anyways I'm just going to show you guys
behind<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.890> it's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
behind this so this is what it is it's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.080 
behind this so this is what it is it's
really<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.729> simple

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
really really simple

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.940 
really really simple
it<00:01:51.420> two<00:01:51.659> people<00:01:51.990> are<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.530> starting<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.799> with

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it two people are just starting out with

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.130 
it two people are just starting out with
redstone<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.490> may<00:01:53.670> look<00:01:53.909> extremely<00:01:54.450> confusing

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
redstone it may look extremely confusing

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.060 
redstone it may look extremely confusing
but<00:01:55.409> don't<00:01:55.649> worry

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
but don't worry

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.219 
but don't worry
it<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.670> probably<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> simplest

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it is probably one of the simplest

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.749 
it is probably one of the simplest
things<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.740> build<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.579> went

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
things you can build and if you went

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.940 
things you can build and if you went
ahead<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.060> followed<00:02:00.390> my<00:02:00.570> computer<00:02:01.079> tutorial

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
ahead and followed my computer tutorial

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.709 
ahead and followed my computer tutorial
over<00:02:02.100> my<00:02:02.219> tic-tac-toe<00:02:02.700> tutorial<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.420> far

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
over my tic-tac-toe tutorial this is far

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.389 
over my tic-tac-toe tutorial this is far
more<00:02:03.930> simple<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.860> should<00:02:04.979> only<00:02:05.100> be<00:02:05.369> a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
more simple in it this should only be a

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.779 
more simple in it this should only be a
few<00:02:05.490> uh<00:02:05.759> few<00:02:06.719> episodes<00:02:06.869> okay<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.640> first

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
few uh few episodes okay so the first

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.369 
few uh few episodes okay so the first
thing<00:02:09.030> we're<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:09.420> today<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.899> when<00:02:10.259> we

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
thing we're going to do today is when we

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.580 
thing we're going to do today is when we
focused<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:11.009> building<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.270> launch<00:02:12.629> pad<00:02:12.959> it's

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
focused on building the launch pad it's

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.920 
focused on building the launch pad it's
and<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.340> screen<00:02:14.700> itself<00:02:15.270> okay<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.750> we're

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and the screen itself okay so we're

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.620 
and the screen itself okay so we're
gonna<00:02:16.020> start<00:02:16.290> off<00:02:16.380> really<00:02:16.770> really<00:02:16.800> simple<00:02:17.630> so

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
size of the button and like I said you

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.220 
size of the button and like I said you
can<00:02:38.310> make<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.520> as<00:02:38.670> big<00:02:38.940> as<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.480> want<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:40.050> many

can make this as big as you want as many
you<00:02:40.470> know<00:02:40.560> pressure<00:02:40.830> plates<00:02:41.130> for<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.459> buttons

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
you know pressure plates for the buttons

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.340 
you know pressure plates for the buttons
or<00:02:41.910> whatever<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.660> really<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.110> gonna<00:02:43.170> be

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
or whatever but really this is gonna be

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.300 
or whatever but really this is gonna be
ten<00:02:43.470> pieces<00:02:43.709> we're<00:02:43.950> gonna<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.250> two<00:02:44.850> four<00:02:45.239> six

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
ten pieces we're gonna have two four six

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.540 
ten pieces we're gonna have two four six
of<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.489> actual<00:02:47.730> pressure<00:02:47.940> plates<00:02:48.269> okay<00:02:49.550> so

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
of the actual pressure plates okay so

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.690 
of the actual pressure plates okay so
two<00:02:50.760> sets<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.660> know<00:02:51.780> four<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.700> then

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
two sets of you know four and then

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.490 
two sets of you know four and then
there's<00:02:53.910> gonna<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.239> blocks<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:55.050> between

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
there's gonna be blocks in between

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.840 
there's gonna be blocks in between
okay<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:55.890> right<00:02:56.160> now<00:02:56.310> we're<00:02:56.459> just<00:02:56.580> going<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.730> go

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
okay so right now we're just going to go

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.430 
okay so right now we're just going to go
ahead<00:02:56.940> with<00:02:57.180> our<00:02:57.239> pressure<00:02:57.510> plates<00:02:57.840> we're

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
ahead with our pressure plates we're

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.140 
ahead with our pressure plates we're
just<00:02:58.560> using<00:02:58.739> regular<00:02:58.860> stone<00:02:59.580> pressure<00:02:59.880> plates

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
just using regular stone pressure plates

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.180 
just using regular stone pressure plates
you<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.269> use<00:03:00.540> whatever<00:03:00.840> pressure<00:03:01.560> plates<00:03:01.830> you

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
you can use whatever pressure plates you

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.559 
you can use whatever pressure plates you
know<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.370> heavy<00:03:02.580> weighted<00:03:02.880> or<00:03:03.090> whatever<00:03:03.360> but

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
know the heavy weighted or whatever but

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.440 
know the heavy weighted or whatever but
I'm<00:03:03.660> just<00:03:03.780> doing<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:04.080> very<00:03:04.440> simply<00:03:05.330> lay<00:03:06.330> em

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
I'm just doing this very simply lay em

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.420 
I'm just doing this very simply lay em
on<00:03:06.569> top<00:03:06.780> okay<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.200> basically<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.130> then<00:03:08.340> we

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
on top okay so basically be this then we

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.600 
on top okay so basically be this then we
need<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.700> get<00:03:09.530> another<00:03:10.530> row<00:03:10.800> in<00:03:12.290> oops<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.610> then

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
need to get another row in oops and then

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.740 
need to get another row in oops and then
one<00:03:14.850> more<00:03:15.030> final<00:03:15.390> row<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:16.470> give<00:03:16.620> us<00:03:16.800> our<00:03:17.010> nine

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
one more final row to give us our nine

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.330 
one more final row to give us our nine
total<00:03:18.750> buttons<00:03:19.140> I'm<00:03:19.500> gonna<00:03:19.769> keep<00:03:20.010> referring

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
total buttons I'm gonna keep referring

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.280 
total buttons I'm gonna keep referring
to<00:03:20.459> as<00:03:20.790> buttons<00:03:21.390> because<00:03:21.660> I'm<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.019> actual

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
to as buttons because I'm the actual

device not like I said a lot smaller

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.750 
device not like I said a lot smaller
than<00:04:01.350> normally<00:04:01.829> would<00:04:02.010> be<00:04:02.160> but<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.489> just

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
than normally would be but this is just

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.120 
than normally would be but this is just
for<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:02.970> simple<00:04:03.299> sake<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.620> know<00:04:04.709> saving

you can make it as big or as small as

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:09.770 
you can make it as big or as small as
you<00:04:09.359> want

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
the launch pad itself larger than the

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.100 
the launch pad itself larger than the
one<00:06:04.260> of<00:06:04.530> you<00:06:04.979> know<00:06:05.100> nine<00:06:05.370> which<00:06:06.360> is<00:06:06.600> the<00:06:06.840> three

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
one of you know nine which is the three

one of you know nine which is the three
by<00:06:07.260> three<00:06:07.620> launch<00:06:07.919> pad<00:06:08.100> we<00:06:08.220> have<00:06:08.340> over<00:06:08.550> there

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
by three launch pad we have over there

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.390 
by three launch pad we have over there
see<00:06:09.360> what<00:06:09.690> made<00:06:09.960> one<00:06:10.229> that<00:06:10.440> has<00:06:10.560> five<00:06:10.919> by<00:06:11.130> five

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
see what made one that has five by five

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.659 
see what made one that has five by five
we'll<00:06:11.729> then<00:06:11.910> just<00:06:12.120> build<00:06:12.330> five<00:06:12.600> by<00:06:12.810> five<00:06:13.139> of

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
we'll then just build five by five of

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.230 
we'll then just build five by five of
these<00:06:14.669> sort<00:06:15.450> of<00:06:15.510> color<00:06:16.789> displays<00:06:17.789> and<00:06:18.090> light

these sort of color displays and light
displays<00:06:18.630> rather<00:06:19.880> well<00:06:20.880> that'd<00:06:21.000> be<00:06:21.030> cool<00:06:21.300> if

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
displays rather well that'd be cool if

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:22.790 
displays rather well that'd be cool if
there<00:06:21.510> was<00:06:21.600> actually<00:06:21.720> color<00:06:22.050> displays<00:06:22.470> added
