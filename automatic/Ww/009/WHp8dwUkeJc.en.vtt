the line you are able just to save
enough<00:03:11.800> coins<00:03:12.100> for<00:03:12.340> non<00:03:12.460> inform<00:03:12.820> or<00:03:12.940> another

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
enough coins for non inform or another

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.570 
enough coins for non inform or another
or<00:03:13.300> even<00:03:13.420> better<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.140> inform<00:03:14.590> try<00:03:15.250> them<00:03:15.400> out

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
or even better the inform try them out

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.030 
or even better the inform try them out
because<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.210> just<00:03:16.240> won't<00:03:16.720> be<00:03:17.050> disappointed

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
because you just won't be disappointed

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.940 
because you just won't be disappointed
so<00:03:18.430> therefore<00:03:18.790> another<00:03:19.360> gets<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.230> ten<00:03:20.530> out<00:03:20.890> of
