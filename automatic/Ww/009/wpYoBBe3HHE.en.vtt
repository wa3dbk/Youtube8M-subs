was<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> there's<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.549> cause<00:01:11.790> behind<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.420> it's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
was a there's a cause behind it it's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.550 
was a there's a cause behind it it's

about it's giving war a face making it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.950 
about it's giving war a face making it
human<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.909> important<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.570> not<00:01:18.630> just

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
human and it's important it's not just

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.859 
human and it's important it's not just
being<00:01:19.140> macho<00:01:19.439> as<00:01:19.920> such<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:21.299> is

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
being macho as such it's just that is

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.929 
being macho as such it's just that is
something<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.500> needs<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:22.979> told<00:01:23.250> over<00:01:23.640> and
