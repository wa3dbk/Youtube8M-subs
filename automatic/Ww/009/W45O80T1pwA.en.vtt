I've<00:04:02.940> lived<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.360> crow<00:04:03.599> freely<00:04:03.959> for<00:04:04.409> a<00:04:04.440> while

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
I've lived it crow freely for a while

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.850 
I've lived it crow freely for a while
and<00:04:05.450> come<00:04:06.450> back<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.200> do<00:04:07.349> something

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860

after more foil agent Ian branches have
come<00:04:12.510> through<00:04:12.750> I'll<00:04:13.590> probably<00:04:13.890> take<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.549> couple

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
sweat I have managed to reduced the

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.270 
sweat I have managed to reduced the

rescued stumps to to just one big clump
and<00:05:17.700> now<00:05:17.970> I've<00:05:18.780> ended<00:05:19.080> up<00:05:19.200> with<00:05:19.440> two<00:05:19.970> this<00:05:20.970> one

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
and now I've ended up with two this one

appears to be in alignment right beside

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.310 
appears to be in alignment right beside
him<00:05:30.389> this<00:05:31.229> one<00:05:31.410> is<00:05:31.560> alive<00:05:31.860> but<00:05:32.190> there's

him this one is alive but there's
nothing<00:05:34.320> there<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:35.300> thought<00:05:36.300> I<00:05:36.510> would<00:05:36.630> separate

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
nothing there I thought I would separate

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.230 
nothing there I thought I would separate
the<00:05:37.260> two<00:05:37.639> as<00:05:40.039> too<00:05:41.039> much<00:05:41.220> and<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:41.610> was<00:05:41.849> didn't

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
the two as too much and it was didn't

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.269 
the two as too much and it was didn't
look<00:05:42.330> very<00:05:42.510> interesting

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
look very interesting

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.059 
look very interesting
and<00:05:44.369> if<00:05:45.029> it<00:05:45.179> works<00:05:45.449> I<00:05:45.839> will<00:05:46.169> end<00:05:46.319> up<00:05:46.469> with<00:05:46.679> two

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069 
and if it works I will end up with two

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.939 
and if it works I will end up with two
plants<00:05:47.699> if<00:05:47.849> it<00:05:47.969> doesn't<00:05:48.359> I<00:05:48.599> will<00:05:49.409> have<00:05:49.499> rescue

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
plants if it doesn't I will have rescue
