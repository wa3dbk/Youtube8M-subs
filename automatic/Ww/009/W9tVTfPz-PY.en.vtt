00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.550
 for the baby 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.940
 hello how are football friends for the 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.830
 band we had already made a video about 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.439
 goalkeepers with the good yo oscar gutiÃ©rrez 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.270
 there we talk a little about how it should 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.920
 grab the ball a goalie like you should 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.810
 warm up before the game and some 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.340
 very simple exercises for that 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.500
 position but a training of 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.300
 goalkeeper has many variants apart from 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.579
 that rest and maximum for example there 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.010
 specific exercises to learn to 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.930
 fly to catch the ball in the air others 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.489
 exercises on the resistance of a 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.200
 mortar but today we will 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.910
 talk about another type of training 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.250
 for goalies they say that these are the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.890
 heavier workouts and that there are no 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.989
 doubt who knows, let's talk about the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.989
 speed and reflexes of goalkeepers 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.780
 let's see how your reflexes are 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.339
 mate should give you passes and you 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.800
 return them until the arrival 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.970
 when I obviously pulled the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.970
 point is that you do not goal goal 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.850
 no no no 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.350
 no no no 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.280
 you must be aware of the ball that falls 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.960
 so that you can throw aside the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.960
 point is that you do not drop the ball 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.140
 hands behind and reflexes of feline not 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.009
 you must let the ball enter your 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.899
 goal 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.899
 you must react fast and get the ball 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.920
 let's go to the rebounds a partner should 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.750
 hit the ball to the wall just behind 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.099
 of you so that you do not miss the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.099
 Attentive bounce huh 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.000
 I'm looking to let the ball pass this way 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.250
 exercise will serve you to react more 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.920
 fast if the ball is behind you 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.460
 the most important thing is that you do it fast 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.460
 and non-stop 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.340
 yes 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.420
 do not 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.480
 now 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.760
 here 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.570
 that front does not do this in a match 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.400
 You must be attentive when your partner 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.660
 turn around and shoot 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.660
 if they hit you a zape 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.970
 This is my favorite because it makes you 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.800
 think and act fast every ball should 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.260
 have a number and your partner at 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.660
 moment to launch you should say that 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.240
 number and will only stop said 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.130
 number must also be very fast 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.130
 reaction if no use to us 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.280
 Y 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.379
 i 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.620
 you must put some balls on the floor 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.870
 then there must be some collector the 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.480
 joke is that you throw and throw but if a 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.550
 ball touched another you must stop both 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.600
 your only objective as a goalkeeper is that 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.600
 pass nor the wind 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.870
 this is another one of my favorites 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:59.180
 his partner must be in charge of two 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.550
 One ball with the foot and another with the 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.789
 hand you just have to avoid getting in 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.789
 Golf 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.729
 ah 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.730
 I almost got tired imagine your as 2 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.920
 liters and they were only exercises for 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.380
 the speed of the reflections just one 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.450
 part of a complete training 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.970
 of a goalkeeper by fingers I hope they have 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.380
 served this little tutorial if you have not 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.120
 done any of these exercises 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.620
 apply them on the court you will see that if 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.480
 they do them in their workouts if they 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.100
 they come back faster I say goodbye to them 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.500
 I say here my social networks 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.390
 comment, suggest me, believe me 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.150
 I am aware of each and every one 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.380
 of their comments because we have in 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.150
 contact and see you in the next 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.150
 game by the country band 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.810
 who does not
