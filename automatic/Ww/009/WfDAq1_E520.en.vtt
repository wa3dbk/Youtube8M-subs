00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.820
 hello everyone in today's video os 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.190
 I bring a haul of school material in the 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.870
 that I'll show you how I decorate the agenda and 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.510
 what utensils have I bought for the 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.510
 moment to start the good school and 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.050
 Here I leave it 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.760
 this is the calculator I have decorated 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.910
 with some stickers that I bought in the 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.760
 However, I'm going to decorate it 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.150
 even more sure that you have touched some 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.039
 tattoo in two challenges or things so 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.200
 you have bought this summer to me has 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.180
 touched this one of the dolphin what I'm going to 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.680
 do is going to be trimming each dolphin by 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.850
 separate so I will place the dolphins 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.850
 where do I want to put them 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.090
 and now pour water on it and that's how 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.090
 I have stayed 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.170
 as a box I bought this 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.390
 well this plastic that the lips 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.560
 they are bright even if it is not seen is 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.510
 h &amp; m and it cost me three euros if you do not want 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.900
 use of the case as you can use it for 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.810
 put anything is very good has 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.670
 a zipper like that is how it would look 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.280
 filling 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.490
 there is room for much more so I 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.680
 I recommend it there were also donuts 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.460
 and of eyes 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.850
 as a notebook I have this subject and 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.850
 is 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.770
 that have a web page 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.710
 there's a weird pulpit because it's a bird 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.360
 as well 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.440
 and inside, it's like that and all the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.440
 pages are striped 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.420
 of the agenda I bought this very 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.420
 simple 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.590
 you have every day of the week in 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.480
 the two pages that is what I wanted 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.819
 I bought it in the field 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.280
 it was the mark look but you can well 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.840
 buy the one you want and decorate it 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.930
 I bought this paper good paper is from 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.770
 rubber eva and it's bright and I'm going to 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.730
 show you how I'm going to decorate it 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.990
 once you have cut two pieces of the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.270
 size of the main sheet of the agenda 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.590
 we will use a silicone gun or 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.260
 it is also worth any other glue 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.530
 strong tail type or something like that you know 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.680
 that does not take off and nothing will proceed 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.750
 to paste this 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.750
 and that's how I've stayed 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.670
 if you wanted 6 you could have 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.710
 cut here a rectangle and for 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.860
 under paste a paper putting your 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.920
 name of your course or whatever you want 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.740
 our next day and white is going to be 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.200
 a hair pin for which 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.300
 you will obviously need the pin 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.790
 hair is bought in the Chinese and is worth a 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.180
 euro and you come as four 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.830
 you will need a stamped paper or the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.190
 color or whatever you want for your 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.940
 pigtail in my case I have taken a cut 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.920
 from a few bolis that I liked how it came 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.350
 and then you will need some adornito 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.820
 I for example have chosen a little ball 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.490
 gold and good could choose rhinestones or 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:50.920
 anything the first thing we will do 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:53.770
 will put our past on paper 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.300
 where we want approximately and what 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.300
 we will double more or less 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.770
 to have the mark of where it's going 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.319
 once we have it, we will cut the 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.840
 rectangle that we have left 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.930
 when you already have it trimmed what 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.199
 we will do it will be to paste it for it 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.880
 use a silicone gun but 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.370
 I also suppose it will serve any 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:28.370
 strong glue so let's go there 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:31.340
 when you have already pasted the paper 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.900
 to the clip I 'll pick up the ornaments that I'm going to 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.630
 paste that in this case are the balls 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.919
 golden ones and I'll put them then for the best in 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.919
 a circle if one 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.770
 and that's how I 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.870
 I hope you liked this video 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.180

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.950
