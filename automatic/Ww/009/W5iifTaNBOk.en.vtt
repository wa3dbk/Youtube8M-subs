00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.780
 important that you do not know mario kart 3 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:13.030
 mark friendships are lost 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:15.220
 I see that they are lost because they do not wait 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.140
 it was for the meter left that was 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.140
 confused area there is a flag 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.360
 because he has not taken your powers 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.800

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.990

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.830

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:53.440
 in the middle in a hole and today in tenth 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.330
 place that happens to you for taking away my third 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.320
 place 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:02.380
 press f5 and for each time you do 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:08.290
 you die bill and until victory guides me 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:14.640
 the victory walk is much easier 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.640

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.259
 in tenth place 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:45.919
 I imagine that green is like 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.919
 normal shells true 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:56.240

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.790
 tenth place ok I'm going in fifth sixth 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.740
