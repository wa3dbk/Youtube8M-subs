00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
this work how does the battery life work

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.080 
this work how does the battery life work
and<00:01:07.680> why<00:01:07.830> was<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.100> complaining<00:01:08.580> about<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.909> so

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and why was I complaining about it so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.080 
and why was I complaining about it so
the<00:01:09.360> battery<00:01:09.720> life<00:01:09.900> works<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.439> based<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the battery life works on based on the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.670 
the battery life works on based on the
amount<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.450> projectiles<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.200> blocked<00:01:13.470> so

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
amount of projectiles you blocked so

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.050 
amount of projectiles you blocked so
when<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.860> shoot<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.159> projectile<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:14.820> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
when you shoot a projectile out it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.670 
when you shoot a projectile out it
explodes<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.810> projectile<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> doesn't

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
explodes the projectile it doesn't

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.980 
explodes the projectile it doesn't
launch<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.070> away<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.939> doesn't<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.600> protect

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
launch it away it doesn't just protect

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.570 
launch it away it doesn't just protect
you<00:01:19.350> from<00:01:19.470> damage<00:01:19.920> from<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.369> actually

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you from damage from it it actually

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.670 
you from damage from it it actually
blows<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.450> thing<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.869> before<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.500> gets

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
blows that thing up before it gets

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.070 
blows that thing up before it gets
anywhere<00:01:22.920> near<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.540> also<00:01:24.659> protects

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
anywhere near you so it also protects

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.300 
anywhere near you so it also protects
your<00:01:25.229> teammates<00:01:25.560> too<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
your teammates too so if you have a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.740 
your teammates too so if you have a
teammate<00:01:26.549> right<00:01:26.820> beside<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.330> won't<00:01:27.479> take

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
teammate right beside you it won't take

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.749 
teammate right beside you it won't take
your<00:01:27.960> they<00:01:28.229> won't<00:01:28.470> take<00:01:28.680> any<00:01:28.890> damage<00:01:29.220> from<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
your they won't take any damage from the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.810 
your they won't take any damage from the
projectile<00:01:30.270> either<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.189> kind<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.610> good

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
projectile either so it's kind of good

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.780 
projectile either so it's kind of good
for<00:01:32.850> game<00:01:33.630> modes<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.140> momentum<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.280> hard

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
for game modes like momentum or hard

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.160

shooting a lot of projectiles towards
it's<00:01:40.860> very<00:01:41.100> good<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.780> however<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.259> was

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
it's very good for that however I was

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.960 
it's very good for that however I was
complaining<00:01:44.070> about<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> battery<00:01:44.700> life<00:01:44.729> and

complaining about the battery life and

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.460

the<00:01:45.060> way<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> battery<00:01:45.479> life<00:01:45.750> works<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.290> it's

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the way the battery life works is it's

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.410 
the way the battery life works is it's
based<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> amount<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.520> size<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
based on the amount and size of

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.469 
based on the amount and size of
projectiles<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.140> block<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.820> were<00:01:50.970> using

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
projectiles you block so we were using

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.700 
projectiles you block so we were using
in<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.020> circumstance<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.920> were<00:01:53.070> using<00:01:54.710> EXO

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
in this circumstance we were using EXO

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.800 
in this circumstance we were using EXO
trophy<00:01:56.070> system<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.820> overcharged<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:57.689> make

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
trophy system with overcharged what make

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.870 
trophy system with overcharged what make
which<00:01:58.049> makes<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> battery<00:01:58.710> last<00:01:58.920> longer<00:01:59.070> so

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
which makes the battery last longer so

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
which makes the battery last longer so
it<00:02:00.180> would<00:02:00.299> block<00:02:00.600> with<00:02:01.140> overcharge<00:02:01.799> about

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
it would block with overcharge about

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.880 
it would block with overcharge about
three<00:02:02.490> frag<00:02:02.790> grenades<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.719> would<00:02:04.140> only<00:02:04.530> block

three frag grenades it would only block

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.210 
three frag grenades it would only block

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
one Stinger missile so that kind of

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.550 
one Stinger missile so that kind of
shows<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.670> what<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.440> you're

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
not using overcharge it blocks about two

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.890 
not using overcharge it blocks about two
your<00:02:13.550> name's<00:02:13.760> if<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.180> you're<00:02:14.540> using

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
overcharge it blocks about three frag

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.940 
overcharge it blocks about three frag
grenades<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:18.140> gives<00:02:18.349> you<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.470> little<00:02:18.709> bit

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
grenades so that gives you a little bit

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.800 
grenades so that gives you a little bit
of<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.130> reference<00:02:19.489> plus<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:19.940> slowly<00:02:20.300> goes<00:02:20.569> down

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
of a reference plus it slowly goes down

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.870
