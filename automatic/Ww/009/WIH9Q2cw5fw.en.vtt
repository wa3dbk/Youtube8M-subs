00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
week I've done some videos for that I've

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.540 
week I've done some videos for that I've
kind<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.110> finished<00:02:34.800> my<00:02:34.920> little<00:02:35.099> series<00:02:35.400> for

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
kind of finished my little series for

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.880 
kind of finished my little series for
now<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.849> is<00:02:36.030> actually<00:02:36.269> really<00:02:36.630> fun<00:02:37.019> but<00:02:37.860> I

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
now it is actually really fun but I

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.589 
now it is actually really fun but I
guess<00:02:38.220> for<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.459> type<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:38.910> game<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.330> pretty

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
guess for this type of game is pretty

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.380 
guess for this type of game is pretty
expensive<00:02:39.930> still<00:02:40.560> but<00:02:41.489> now<00:02:41.670> if<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:41.940> get<00:02:42.269> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
expensive still but now if you get the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.870 
expensive still but now if you get the
cross<00:02:42.840> by<00:02:43.019> 420<00:02:43.530> pounds<00:02:43.950> that's<00:02:44.580> obviously

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
cross by 420 pounds that's obviously

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.130 
cross by 420 pounds that's obviously
much<00:02:45.150> better<00:02:45.690> value<00:02:45.930> for<00:02:46.380> money<00:02:46.580> um<00:02:48.110> finally<00:02:49.110> I

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
much better value for money um finally I

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.100 
much better value for money um finally I
just<00:02:49.440> wanted<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:50.010> show<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.519> from<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.110> new

we'll<00:03:28.579> have<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.609> little<00:03:29.790> look<00:03:30.060> into<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.840> one

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
we'll have a little look into that one

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.059 
we'll have a little look into that one
okay<00:03:33.209> let's<00:03:33.359> come<00:03:33.540> back<00:03:33.569> out<00:03:33.840> there<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
okay let's come back out there and the

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.819 
okay let's come back out there and the
actual<00:03:35.340> game<00:03:35.370> if<00:03:35.730> i<00:03:35.819> go<00:03:36.000> back<00:03:36.030> in<00:03:36.450> was<00:03:36.870> yet<00:03:37.260> 1299

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
actual game if i go back in was yet 1299

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.680 
actual game if i go back in was yet 1299
so<00:03:38.819> that's<00:03:39.810> pretty<00:03:40.410> much<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.739> for<00:03:40.980> their<00:03:41.700> if<00:03:42.239> i

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
so that's pretty much it for their if i

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.190 
so that's pretty much it for their if i
