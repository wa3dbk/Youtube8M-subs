00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
this is how I hollow out tell the guitar

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.269 
this is how I hollow out tell the guitar
bodies<00:00:03.510> what<00:00:04.230> I've<00:00:04.350> done<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.680> I've<00:00:04.830> taken<00:00:04.859> a

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
bodies what I've done is I've taken a

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.080 
bodies what I've done is I've taken a
standard<00:00:05.700> tele<00:00:05.940> template<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:07.080> I've<00:00:07.200> cut<00:00:07.529> out

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
standard tele template and I've cut out

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.970 
standard tele template and I've cut out
with<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> scroll<00:00:09.510> saw<00:00:09.540> how<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.380> want<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.800> hollow

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
with a scroll saw how I want to hollow

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.919 
with a scroll saw how I want to hollow
out<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.400> guitar<00:00:11.730> got<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> couple<00:00:12.690> different

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
out the guitar got a couple different

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.350 
out the guitar got a couple different
cavities<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.030> depending<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.120> how<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.269> want

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
cavities and depending on how you want

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.029 
cavities and depending on how you want
to<00:00:15.540> build<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.839> guitar<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.260> can<00:00:16.320> always<00:00:16.710> you

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
to build the guitar you can always you

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.800 
to build the guitar you can always you
know<00:00:17.070> knock<00:00:17.490> these<00:00:17.670> out<00:00:17.850> with<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.150> chisel<00:00:18.570> or

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
know knock these out with the chisel or

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.630 
know knock these out with the chisel or
with<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.080> router<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:19.890> what<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.039> do<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.400> add

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
with a router but what I do is I add

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.240 
with a router but what I do is I add
these<00:00:20.910> bars<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.720> some<00:00:21.900> stability<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.650> then<00:00:23.160> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
these bars for some stability and then I

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.670 
these bars for some stability and then I
go<00:00:23.369> ahead<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.730> screw<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.330> at<00:00:24.689> multiple

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
go ahead and I screw in at multiple

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.349 
go ahead and I screw in at multiple
points<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.189> template<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.880> doesn't<00:00:27.210> move

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
points this template so it doesn't move

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.570 
points this template so it doesn't move
and<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:27.689> really<00:00:27.840> rigid<00:00:28.320> against<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.369> body

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and it's really rigid against the body

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.089 
and it's really rigid against the body
so<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> corinna<00:00:31.019> back<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.009> I'll

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
so this is a corinna back and what I'll

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.940 
so this is a corinna back and what I'll
do<00:00:32.279> then<00:00:32.430> after<00:00:32.850> I'm<00:00:32.969> done<00:00:33.410> guys<00:00:34.410> I'll<00:00:34.620> take<00:00:34.800> my

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
do then after I'm done guys I'll take my

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.100 
do then after I'm done guys I'll take my
maple<00:00:35.160> tap<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.700> I'll<00:00:35.760> fit<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.059> maple<00:00:36.420> top<00:00:36.630> I'll

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
maple tap and I'll fit my maple top I'll

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840 
maple tap and I'll fit my maple top I'll
cut<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:37.829> into<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> template<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.790> know

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
cut this out into the template I know

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.209 
cut this out into the template I know
I've<00:00:39.600> got<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.020> perfect<00:00:40.230> line<00:00:40.590> once<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.010> draw

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
I've got the perfect line once I draw

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.220 
I've got the perfect line once I draw
this<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.570> really<00:00:42.600> important<00:00:43.170> when

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
this on so it's really important when

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.529 
this on so it's really important when
you're<00:00:43.559> building<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.250> hollow<00:00:44.460> body<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.059> that

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
you're building a hollow body is that

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.250 
you're building a hollow body is that
you<00:00:45.660> take<00:00:45.870> some<00:00:46.309> stock<00:00:47.309> removal<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.940> before<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you take some stock removal out before a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.869 
you take some stock removal out before a
lot<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.649> times<00:00:49.739> I'll<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.280> guys<00:00:50.399> drill

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
lot of times I'll see you guys drill

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.360 
lot of times I'll see you guys drill
with<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> drill<00:00:51.690> press<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:52.530> remove<00:00:52.949> most<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
with a drill press to remove most of the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.220 
with a drill press to remove most of the
stack<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:54.000> don't<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.110> it

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
stack that we don't really get at it

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
stack that we don't really get at it
with<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.440> router<00:00:55.620> bits<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:57.000> me<00:00:57.090> I've

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
with your router bits or for me I've

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.330 
with your router bits or for me I've
taken<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.690> big<00:00:57.870> router<00:00:58.140> bit<00:00:58.410> done<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.160> in

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
taken one big router bit done this in

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.340 
taken one big router bit done this in
the<00:00:59.430> middle<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.879> get<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.149> started<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.140> since

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the middle to get it started and since

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.690 
the middle to get it started and since
I've<00:01:01.590> got<00:01:01.820> this<00:01:02.820> router<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> 3/4<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.700> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
I've got this router with a 3/4 bit this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.870 
I've got this router with a 3/4 bit this
is<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> nice<00:01:06.470> 3/4<00:01:07.470> bit<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.220> know<00:01:08.340> brand-new

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
is a nice 3/4 bit you know brand-new

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.270 
is a nice 3/4 bit you know brand-new
I'll<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.570> able<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> go<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.830> my<00:01:10.979> depth

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
I'll be able to go in here get my depth

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.859 
I'll be able to go in here get my depth
set<00:01:11.580> correctly<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.330> I'll<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.479> able<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> clean

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
set correctly and I'll be able to clean

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.780 
set correctly and I'll be able to clean
this<00:01:12.900> out<00:01:13.170> relatively<00:01:13.590> quickly<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.729> know

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
this out relatively quickly you know

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.039 
this out relatively quickly you know
when<00:01:14.939> you're<00:01:15.060> using<00:01:15.180> these<00:01:15.420> bigger<00:01:15.659> bits<00:01:15.900> you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
when you're using these bigger bits you

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.390 
when you're using these bigger bits you
want<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> make<00:01:16.350> sure<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.860> got<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> speed

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
want to make sure that you got the speed

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.760 
want to make sure that you got the speed
correct<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.630> get<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.110> large<00:01:19.409> bit

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
correct if you get a really large bit

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.870 
correct if you get a really large bit
over<00:01:20.100> an<00:01:20.189> inch<00:01:20.310> you're<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
over an inch you're going to have to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.719 
over an inch you're going to have to
slow<00:01:21.180> down<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.570> motor<00:01:22.250> but<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:23.670> I

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
slow down your motor but for this one I

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.310 
slow down your motor but for this one I
could<00:01:23.970> keep<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.240> at<00:01:24.360> about<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.689> same<00:01:24.750> speed

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
could keep it at about that same speed

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.920 
could keep it at about that same speed
it's<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.340> bigger<00:01:26.580> than<00:01:26.729> 1<00:01:26.880> inch<00:01:27.030> 3/4

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it's not you know bigger than 1 inch 3/4

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.030 
it's not you know bigger than 1 inch 3/4
with<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.280> inch<00:01:29.280> depth<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.840> other<00:01:31.259> key<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> this

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
with a inch depth so other key to this

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.010 
with a inch depth so other key to this
is<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.729> I've<00:01:32.850> got<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> router<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> large

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
is that I've got a router with a large

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.109 
is that I've got a router with a large
plate<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.430> there's<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.909> no

tipping<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.049> DeWalt<00:01:37.439> router<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.920> have

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
tipping the DeWalt router that I have

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.010 
tipping the DeWalt router that I have
that's<00:01:38.340> my<00:01:38.549> favorite<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.479> little<00:01:39.750> bit<00:01:39.840> too

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
that's my favorite is a little bit too

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.749 
that's my favorite is a little bit too
thin<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.680> don't<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> new<00:01:41.250> base<00:01:41.430> for

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
thin and if I don't have a new base for

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.060 
thin and if I don't have a new base for
it<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:42.840> happens<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.380> get<00:01:43.500> close<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it what happens is you get close to the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.010 
it what happens is you get close to the
edges<00:01:44.250> you'll<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.180> some<00:01:45.390> tipping<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.960> you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
edges you'll get some tipping and you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.499 
edges you'll get some tipping and you
won't<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.470> much<00:01:46.619> stability<00:01:47.329> so<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> just

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
won't have as much stability so I just

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.429 
won't have as much stability so I just
make<00:01:48.630> sure<00:01:48.659> I've<00:01:48.869> got<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.079> write<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
make sure I've got to write it with a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.980 
make sure I've got to write it with a
big<00:01:49.710> base<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.820> good<00:01:51.180> sized<00:01:51.420> bit<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
big base you know a good sized bit and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.569 
big base you know a good sized bit and
then<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.680> want<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> make<00:01:53.040> sure<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.460> go

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
then you want to make sure that you go

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.490 
then you want to make sure that you go
ahead<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.970> drill<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:55.110> way<00:01:55.290> you've<00:01:55.470> got

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
ahead and drill out that way you've got

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.530 
ahead and drill out that way you've got
some<00:01:56.369> relief<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.939> you're<00:01:57.270> not<00:01:57.390> really

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
some relief and you're not really

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.620 
some relief and you're not really
forcing<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> wood<00:01:58.409> down<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.299> you've<00:02:00.299> got<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
forcing the wood down and you've got the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.510 
forcing the wood down and you've got the
template<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.829> here<00:02:01.979> I'll<00:02:02.040> show<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.280> how<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> do

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
template so here I'll show you how I do

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:54.300 
template so here I'll show you how I do
it

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.950 

all<00:02:55.310> right<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.550> here<00:02:55.700> we<00:02:55.730> are<00:02:55.850> got<00:02:56.330> all<00:02:56.600> three

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
all right so here we are got all three

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.600 
all right so here we are got all three
sides<00:02:57.230> routed<00:02:57.710> I'm<00:02:57.950> going<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.190> just<00:02:58.310> take<00:02:58.460> my

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
sides routed I'm going to just take my

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.210 
sides routed I'm going to just take my
pencil<00:02:59.500> make<00:03:00.500> sure<00:03:00.710> I've<00:03:00.800> got<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.190> outline

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
pencil make sure I've got the outline

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.500 
pencil make sure I've got the outline
drawn<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:03.580> know<00:03:04.580> exactly<00:03:04.940> where<00:03:05.210> I<00:03:05.300> need<00:03:05.480> to

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
drawn I know exactly where I need to

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.199 
drawn I know exactly where I need to
line<00:03:05.690> up<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.960> body

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.569 

now<00:03:13.720> use<00:03:13.930> these<00:03:14.170> nibs<00:03:14.439> here<00:03:14.739> on<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.040> end<00:03:15.220> to

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
now use these nibs here on the end to

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.640 
now use these nibs here on the end to
make<00:03:15.700> sure<00:03:15.939> I've<00:03:16.090> got<00:03:16.360> just<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.260> little<00:03:17.470> more

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
make sure I've got just a little more

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.649 
make sure I've got just a little more
stability<00:03:17.860> I<00:03:18.459> could<00:03:19.000> probably<00:03:19.150> do<00:03:19.329> it<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:19.510> each

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
stability I could probably do it on each

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.130 
stability I could probably do it on each
side<00:03:19.930> but<00:03:20.319> this<00:03:20.500> is<00:03:20.709> just<00:03:20.950> for<00:03:21.220> use<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:22.030> know<00:03:22.959> I

side but this is just for use you know I

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.720 
side but this is just for use you know I
get<00:03:23.349> a<00:03:23.379> lot<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.590> stability<00:03:23.860> by<00:03:24.250> having<00:03:24.610> these

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
get a lot of stability by having these

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.649 
get a lot of stability by having these
extra<00:03:25.090> nibs<00:03:25.480> in<00:03:26.730> that's<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:27.909> now<00:03:28.290> unscrew<00:03:29.290> this

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
extra nibs in that's it now unscrew this

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.809 
extra nibs in that's it now unscrew this
there<00:03:31.659> we<00:03:31.810> go<00:03:31.959> nice<00:03:32.230> how<00:03:32.470> about<00:03:32.709> tele<00:03:33.519> shape

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.610 
I just completed we'll go ahead and do
another<00:04:00.730> tap<00:04:01.269> with<00:04:01.450> an<00:04:01.569> F<00:04:01.720> all<00:04:01.930> I'll<00:04:02.409> show<00:04:02.439> how

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
another tap with an F all I'll show how

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.729 
another tap with an F all I'll show how
to<00:04:02.709> do<00:04:02.799> that<00:04:03.629> alright<00:04:04.629> so<00:04:04.689> this<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.049> my<00:04:05.079> setup<00:04:05.500> I

to do that alright so this is my setup I

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.610 
to do that alright so this is my setup I
take<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.459> pin<00:04:06.730> I've<00:04:07.599> got<00:04:07.930> an<00:04:08.019> eighth<00:04:08.109> inch<00:04:08.290> pin

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
take the pin I've got an eighth inch pin

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.849 
take the pin I've got an eighth inch pin
here<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:09.879> change<00:04:10.659> out<00:04:10.840> my<00:04:10.870> bit<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.500> have<00:04:11.739> an

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
here and I change out my bit to have an

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.429 
here and I change out my bit to have an
eighth<00:04:11.980> inch<00:04:12.159> bit<00:04:12.689> it's<00:04:13.689> real<00:04:13.840> simple<00:04:14.079> to<00:04:14.290> do

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
eighth inch bit it's real simple to do

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.479 
eighth inch bit it's real simple to do
all<00:04:15.010> do<00:04:15.400> is<00:04:15.489> drop<00:04:15.670> my<00:04:15.819> template<00:04:16.239> on<00:04:16.389> here<00:04:17.489> get

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
all do is drop my template on here get

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.520 
all do is drop my template on here get
it<00:04:18.639> set<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.030> right<00:04:19.239> depth<00:04:19.539> and<00:04:19.810> then<00:04:20.320> rot

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
it set to the right depth and then rot

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.589 
it set to the right depth and then rot

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.200 

one<00:05:06.229> point<00:05:06.530> of<00:05:06.650> caution<00:05:07.040> I<00:05:07.100> want<00:05:07.250> to<00:05:07.310> make<00:05:07.490> is

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
one point of caution I want to make is

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.670 
one point of caution I want to make is
that<00:05:08.270> when<00:05:08.509> you're<00:05:08.630> routing<00:05:08.810> out<00:05:09.139> the<00:05:09.290> edges

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
that when you're routing out the edges

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.249 
that when you're routing out the edges
here<00:05:09.919> these<00:05:10.280> little<00:05:10.490> corners<00:05:11.030> if<00:05:11.389> you<00:05:11.960> get<00:05:12.229> a

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
here these little corners if you get a

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.219 
here these little corners if you get a
lot<00:05:12.440> of<00:05:12.560> end<00:05:12.740> grain<00:05:13.630> you<00:05:14.630> end<00:05:14.780> up<00:05:14.900> tearing

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
lot of end grain you end up tearing

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.540 
lot of end grain you end up tearing
these<00:05:15.350> out<00:05:15.560> so<00:05:15.710> it<00:05:15.800> was<00:05:15.860> going<00:05:16.009> to<00:05:16.070> be<00:05:16.160> careful

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
these out so it was going to be careful

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.100 
these out so it was going to be careful
when<00:05:16.669> you're<00:05:16.789> routing<00:05:17.180> here<00:05:17.419> that<00:05:17.840> you<00:05:17.990> give

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
when you're routing here that you give

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.480 
when you're routing here that you give
yourself<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.500> little<00:05:18.650> bit<00:05:18.800> extra<00:05:19.130> room<00:05:19.280> that

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
yourself a little bit extra room that

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.860 
yourself a little bit extra room that
you're<00:05:19.610> not<00:05:19.729> taking<00:05:20.060> off<00:05:20.210> too<00:05:20.419> much<00:05:20.570> on<00:05:20.780> the

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
you're not taking off too much on the

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.800 
you're not taking off too much on the
beginning<00:05:21.970> always<00:05:22.970> take<00:05:23.180> a<00:05:23.210> little<00:05:23.419> bit<00:05:23.660> of<00:05:23.750> a

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
beginning always take a little bit of a

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.719 
beginning always take a little bit of a
short<00:05:24.110> pass<00:05:24.350> here<00:05:24.710> and<00:05:24.889> a<00:05:24.949> short<00:05:25.160> pass<00:05:25.400> there

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
short pass here and a short pass there

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.790 
short pass here and a short pass there
and<00:05:25.940> work<00:05:26.539> your<00:05:26.690> way<00:05:26.750> into<00:05:27.139> this<00:05:27.289> corners

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
and work your way into this corners

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.950 
and work your way into this corners
because<00:05:28.669> if<00:05:28.940> you<00:05:29.060> get<00:05:29.240> too<00:05:29.419> much<00:05:29.570> corner

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
because if you get too much corner

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.120 
because if you get too much corner
you'll<00:05:30.080> get<00:05:30.229> tear<00:05:30.470> out<00:05:30.620> since<00:05:30.830> you've<00:05:30.949> got<00:05:31.100> a

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
you'll get tear out since you've got a

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.529 
you'll get tear out since you've got a
real<00:05:31.340> thin<00:05:31.580> piece<00:05:31.610> of<00:05:31.850> wood<00:05:32.120> that's<00:05:32.270> always<00:05:32.449> a

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
real thin piece of wood that's always a

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.919 
real thin piece of wood that's always a
point<00:05:33.229> of<00:05:33.410> question<00:05:33.740> there
