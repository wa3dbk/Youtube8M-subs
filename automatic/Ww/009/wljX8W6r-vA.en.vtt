00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
so yeah like so so there's two

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.959 
so yeah like so so there's two
variations<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:58.020> wake<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.710> there's<00:00:59.370> ones<00:00:59.670> where

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
variations of wake up there's ones where

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.810 
variations of wake up there's ones where
you<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.510> sides<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.160> static<00:01:02.160> view<00:01:02.340> or

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you go to the sides of static view or

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.549 
you go to the sides of static view or
those<00:01:03.210> ones<00:01:03.480> where<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.780> right<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.229> front<00:01:04.260> of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
those ones where it's right in front of

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.480 
those ones where it's right in front of
you<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.610> front<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:06.060> nose

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
you so it's like in front of your nose

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.700 
you so it's like in front of your nose
so<00:01:08.490> those<00:01:08.670> were<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> two<00:01:09.180> variations<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
so those were the two variations of the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.830 
so those were the two variations of the
basic<00:01:10.830> leg<00:01:11.250> wraps<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.060> there's<00:01:12.210> also<00:01:12.420> many

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
basic leg wraps but there's also many

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020 
basic leg wraps but there's also many
more<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.830> another<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.580> when<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.850> hold

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
more so another one is when you hold

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.609 
more so another one is when you hold
your<00:01:15.150> leg<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:15.720> hand<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.590> want<00:01:16.710> this

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
your leg with one hand and you want this

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.200 
your leg with one hand and you want this
so<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.340> take<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.549> step<00:01:20.850> first

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
so what you do is you take a step first

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.780 
so what you do is you take a step first
and<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.500> you're<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> righty<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.460> step<00:01:23.700> with

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and so if you're a righty you step with

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.249 
and so if you're a righty you step with
your<00:01:23.939> left<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.360> you're<00:01:24.570> left<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.140> if

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
your left if you're left in you so if

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.890 
your left if you're left in you so if
you're<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.790> hold<00:01:27.090> same<00:01:27.570> arm

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
