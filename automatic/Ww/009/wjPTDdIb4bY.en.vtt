00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
want to try you want to go with a little

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.880 
want to try you want to go with a little
bigger<00:00:45.130> but<00:00:45.670> we<00:00:45.910> use<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.120> box<00:00:46.660> cutter<00:00:46.899> with<00:00:47.860> a

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
bigger but we use a box cutter with a

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.889 
bigger but we use a box cutter with a
really<00:00:48.190> sharp<00:00:48.370> blade<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.120> I'm<00:00:49.570> just<00:00:49.720> going<00:00:49.840> to

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
really sharp blade and I'm just going to

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.139 
really sharp blade and I'm just going to
cut<00:00:50.110> it<00:00:50.140> on<00:00:50.350> top<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.649> a<00:00:50.890> metal<00:00:51.070> or<00:00:51.399> wooden<00:00:51.850> ruler

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.420 
cut it on top of a metal or wooden ruler
and<00:00:52.480> I'm<00:00:53.020> basically<00:00:53.350> just<00:00:53.530> going<00:00:53.829> to<00:00:53.890> cut

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
and I'm basically just going to cut

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.780 
and I'm basically just going to cut
straight<00:00:54.940> through<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.980> a<00:00:57.070> little<00:00:57.309> tough<00:00:57.489> but

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
straight through it's a little tough but

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.630 
straight through it's a little tough but
if<00:00:58.270> you<00:00:58.420> just<00:00:58.989> muscle<00:00:59.440> it<00:00:59.530> down<00:00:59.770> and<00:01:00.309> through

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
if you just muscle it down and through

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.810 
if you just muscle it down and through
then<00:01:01.120> we're<00:01:01.600> going<00:01:01.899> to<00:01:02.290> basically<00:01:03.250> make<00:01:03.460> our

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
then we're going to basically make our

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.200 
then we're going to basically make our
bracelet<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:05.439> I've<00:01:05.619> got<00:01:05.770> my<00:01:05.890> leather<00:01:06.070> I<00:01:06.430> picked

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
bracelet so I've got my leather I picked

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.039 
bracelet so I've got my leather I picked
out<00:01:07.299> just<00:01:07.569> a<00:01:07.719> real<00:01:07.929> simple<00:01:09.389> silver<00:01:10.389> tube<00:01:10.659> and

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
out just a real simple silver tube and

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.969 
out just a real simple silver tube and
I've<00:01:11.709> got<00:01:11.829> a<00:01:11.859> magnetic<00:01:12.219> clasp<00:01:12.609> which<00:01:13.679> is<00:01:14.679> one

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
I've got a magnetic clasp which is one

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.010 
I've got a magnetic clasp which is one
of<00:01:15.009> our<00:01:15.249> favorite<00:01:16.030> class<00:01:16.179> now<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.479> can<00:01:16.840> see

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
of our favorite class now you can see

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.840 
of our favorite class now you can see
that<00:01:17.170> that's<00:01:17.380> stuck<00:01:17.799> a<00:01:17.829> little<00:01:18.069> bit<00:01:18.340> when<00:01:18.759> I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
that that's stuck a little bit when I

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.949 
that that's stuck a little bit when I
was<00:01:18.969> trying<00:01:19.149> to<00:01:19.270> get<00:01:19.389> it<00:01:19.479> through<00:01:19.509> and<00:01:19.810> that's

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
was trying to get it through and that's

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:23.309 
was trying to get it through and that's
because<00:01:20.380> I<00:01:20.709> when<00:01:21.549> I<00:01:21.579> cut<00:01:21.880> it<00:01:22.090> sometimes<00:01:22.659> at

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
because I when I cut it sometimes at

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.109 
because I when I cut it sometimes at
least<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.889> edges<00:01:24.189> are<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.369> little<00:01:24.429> rough<00:01:24.850> so

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
least the edges are a little rough so

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.019 
least the edges are a little rough so
I'm<00:01:25.209> going<00:01:25.389> to<00:01:25.420> just<00:01:25.539> take<00:01:25.689> a<00:01:25.749> real<00:01:26.020> fine<00:01:26.319> a

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:27.029 
I'm going to just take a real fine a

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:29.580 
I'm going to just take a real fine a
nail<00:01:28.029> file<00:01:28.299> or<00:01:28.539> you<00:01:28.659> can<00:01:28.810> use<00:01:28.899> a<00:01:28.929> fine

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
nail file or you can use a fine

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.300 
nail file or you can use a fine
sandpaper<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:34.679> smooth<00:01:35.679> out<00:01:35.859> the<00:01:36.009> edges<00:01:36.159> a

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
sandpaper and smooth out the edges a

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.830 
sandpaper and smooth out the edges a
little<00:01:36.399> bit<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:38.259> that's<00:01:38.409> how<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.799> works<00:01:38.950> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
little bit so that's how that works and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.339 
little bit so that's how that works and
hopefully<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.560> then<00:01:41.770> sometimes<00:01:42.159> also<00:01:42.609> if<00:01:42.909> you

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
hopefully and then sometimes also if you

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.739 
hopefully and then sometimes also if you
you<00:01:44.349> can<00:01:44.499> flip<00:01:44.859> the<00:01:45.219> component<00:01:45.999> around<00:01:46.329> and<00:01:46.630> it

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:46.749 
you can flip the component around and it

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:48.569 
you can flip the component around and it
will<00:01:46.840> fit<00:01:47.289> in<00:01:47.409> there<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.590> little<00:01:47.740> better<00:01:48.009> but

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
will fit in there a little better but

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.370 
will fit in there a little better but
I'm<00:01:48.700> using<00:01:48.849> the<00:01:49.060> matte<00:01:49.270> black<00:01:49.299> leather<00:01:50.020> which

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
I'm using the matte black leather which

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.099 
I'm using the matte black leather which
again<00:01:51.069> not<00:01:51.399> shiny<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:52.209> again<00:01:52.509> something<00:01:52.899> that

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
again not shiny and again something that

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.569 
again not shiny and again something that
I<00:01:53.259> think<00:01:53.560> most<00:01:54.099> guys<00:01:54.429> would<00:01:54.789> like<00:01:54.999> and<00:01:56.579> I'm

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
I think most guys would like and I'm

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.819 
I think most guys would like and I'm
going<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:57.789> use<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.060> magnetic<00:01:58.569> clasp<00:01:58.829> which

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
going to use the magnetic clasp which

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.519 
going to use the magnetic clasp which
basically<00:02:00.520> when<00:02:00.969> you<00:02:01.090> put<00:02:01.299> it<00:02:01.389> on<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:05.289> just

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:05.529 
basically when you put it on you it just

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:08.870 
basically when you put it on you it just
basically<00:02:05.829> pushes<00:02:06.609> one<00:02:07.509> side<00:02:07.810> pushes<00:02:08.289> down

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
basically pushes one side pushes down

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.610 
basically pushes one side pushes down
its<00:02:09.880> until<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.300> kind<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.630> get<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.840> situated<00:02:11.140> so

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
its until you kind of get it situated so

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.130 
its until you kind of get it situated so
on

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
on

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.650 
on
a<00:02:12.200> little<00:02:12.830> tricky<00:02:13.190> but<00:02:13.370> that's<00:02:14.210> how<00:02:14.450> that

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
a little tricky but that's how that

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.840 
a little tricky but that's how that
works<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.200> now<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:15.920> I've<00:02:16.130> got<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.310> kind<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.700> on

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
works so now that I've got it kind of on

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.360 
works so now that I've got it kind of on
there<00:02:17.030> in<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.209> right<00:02:17.390> way<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:18.220> want<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.280> make

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
there in the right way I want to make

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.130 
there in the right way I want to make
sure<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.760> keep<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.240> positioned<00:02:20.840> correctly

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
sure that I keep it positioned correctly

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.699 
sure that I keep it positioned correctly
so<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.800> get<00:02:22.550> it<00:02:22.640> glued<00:02:22.790> on<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:24.230> way<00:02:24.590> it

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
so that I get it glued on the way it

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.120 
so that I get it glued on the way it
needs<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.040> go<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:26.270> not<00:02:26.930> backwards<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.830> we

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
needs to go and not backwards and we

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.490 
needs to go and not backwards and we
recommend<00:02:28.550> using<00:02:28.730> super<00:02:29.240> new<00:02:29.390> glue<00:02:29.470> which<00:02:30.470> is

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
recommend using super new glue which is

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.410 
recommend using super new glue which is
a<00:02:30.650> great<00:02:30.890> glue<00:02:31.070> for<00:02:31.310> metal<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.820> leather<00:02:32.000> and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
a great glue for metal and leather and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.570 
a great glue for metal and leather and
I'm<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:33.020> going<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.200> basically<00:02:33.380> put<00:02:34.070> a<00:02:34.250> bunch

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
I'm just going to basically put a bunch

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.729 
I'm just going to basically put a bunch
of<00:02:34.730> glue<00:02:35.030> inside<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.930> clasp<00:02:37.360> like<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:38.739> and

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
of glue inside the clasp like that and

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.400 
of glue inside the clasp like that and
then<00:02:40.670> again<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.030> wanted<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.540> make<00:02:41.750> sure<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:41.989> I

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
then again I wanted to make sure that I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.880 
then again I wanted to make sure that I
had<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:43.030> positioned<00:02:44.030> down<00:02:44.750> because<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:45.709> know

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
had it positioned down because I know

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.250 
had it positioned down because I know
the<00:02:46.160> other<00:02:46.610> component<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.209> going<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.390> meet<00:02:48.110> it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
the other component is going to meet it

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.590 
the other component is going to meet it
at<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.620> other<00:02:48.830> end<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.700> then<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.150> want<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.420> put

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
at the other end and then I want to put

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.780 
at the other end and then I want to put
this<00:02:51.130> put<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:52.160> bunch<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.519> glue<00:02:52.670> on<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:53.060> one<00:02:54.790> and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
this put a bunch of glue on this one and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.360 
this put a bunch of glue on this one and
and<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.959> want<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.260> make<00:02:57.350> sure<00:02:57.380> that<00:02:57.739> I'll<00:02:57.890> meet

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
and I want to make sure that I'll meet

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.199 
and I want to make sure that I'll meet
so<00:02:58.670> I'm<00:02:58.730> going<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:58.910> put<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.300> glue<00:02:59.750> there<00:03:00.739> and

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
so I'm going to put that glue there and

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.190 
so I'm going to put that glue there and
then<00:03:02.209> I'm<00:03:02.300> going<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.450> let<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.630> set<00:03:02.870> for<00:03:03.170> a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
then I'm going to let it set for a

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.280 
then I'm going to let it set for a
minute<00:03:03.560> before<00:03:03.739> I<00:03:03.980> clasp<00:03:04.250> but<00:03:04.550> basically

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
minute before I clasp but basically

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.740 
minute before I clasp but basically
that's<00:03:06.880> what<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:08.000> got<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.300> got<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.480> great

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
that's what you got you got a great

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.739 
that's what you got you got a great
bracelet<00:03:09.290> for<00:03:09.470> your<00:03:09.560> guide
