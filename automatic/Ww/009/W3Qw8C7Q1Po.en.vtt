00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
you're using a high-speed blender or

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.020 
you're using a high-speed blender or
Vitamix<00:00:09.630> machine<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.880> because<00:00:11.880> these

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
Vitamix machine is that because these

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.480 
Vitamix machine is that because these
blades<00:00:12.360> spin<00:00:12.599> at<00:00:12.750> 240<00:00:13.530> miles<00:00:13.650> an<00:00:13.889> hour<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.309> get

blades spin at 240 miles an hour you get
will<00:00:14.670> actually<00:00:15.059> create<00:00:15.210> enough<00:00:15.509> friction<00:00:15.660> to

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
will actually create enough friction to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.650 
will actually create enough friction to
bring<00:00:16.890> room<00:00:17.699> temperature<00:00:18.119> water<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> boil

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
bring room temperature water to a boil

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.849 
bring room temperature water to a boil
and<00:00:18.779> eight<00:00:18.869> minutes<00:00:19.140> we're<00:00:19.289> not<00:00:19.410> going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.710> do

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
and eight minutes we're not going to do

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.500 
and eight minutes we're not going to do
that<00:00:19.890> we're<00:00:20.279> going<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.550> warm<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.119> until<00:00:21.390> it's

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
that we're going to warm it until it's

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.109 
that we're going to warm it until it's
just<00:00:21.930> warm<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.439> touch<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:23.490> doesn't<00:00:23.970> take

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
just warm to the touch that doesn't take

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.939 
just warm to the touch that doesn't take
it<00:00:24.210> above<00:00:24.390> 105<00:00:24.960> degrees<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.800> have

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
it above 105 degrees so we have

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.700 
it above 105 degrees so we have
destroyed<00:00:26.279> any<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> healthy<00:00:26.880> enzymes<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:28.260> in

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
destroyed any the healthy enzymes but in

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.200 
destroyed any the healthy enzymes but in
these<00:00:28.920> cooler<00:00:29.310> months<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.789> get<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> sensation

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
