really<00:02:09.560> it's<00:02:09.709> it's<00:02:10.099> it's<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.910> cross<00:02:11.150> between<00:02:11.180> a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
really it's it's it's a cross between a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.110 
really it's it's it's a cross between a
photo<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.349> fine<00:02:12.560> art<00:02:12.800> paper<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.640> exhibits

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
photo and a fine art paper that exhibits

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.660 
photo and a fine art paper that exhibits
kind<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.450> nice<00:02:14.599> soft<00:02:14.930> gloss<00:02:15.349> to<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.950> very

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
kind of a nice soft gloss to it a very

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.390 
kind of a nice soft gloss to it a very
subtle<00:02:17.060> texture<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:17.900> brings<00:02:18.230> out<00:02:18.470> some<00:02:19.280> of

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
subtle texture that brings out some of

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.770 
subtle texture that brings out some of
the<00:02:19.459> beauty<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:19.880> some<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.270> portraits<00:02:20.690> that

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the beauty in some of the portraits that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.910 
the beauty in some of the portraits that
would<00:02:20.959> be<00:02:21.080> used<00:02:21.319> in<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:21.709> particular

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
would be used in this particular

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.130 
would be used in this particular
industry<00:02:22.610> as<00:02:22.730> well<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.180> guess<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:23.750> sort<00:02:24.020> of

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
industry as well I guess you sort of

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.809 
industry as well I guess you sort of
reference<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.650> back<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.950> like<00:02:25.099> an<00:02:25.250> F<00:02:25.430> service

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
reference it back to like an F service

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.760 
reference it back to like an F service
on<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:25.970> civil<00:02:26.330> gelatin<00:02:26.720> paper<00:02:26.900> that's<00:02:27.319> exactly

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
on a civil gelatin paper that's exactly

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.460 
on a civil gelatin paper that's exactly
it<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.160> has<00:02:28.310> kind<00:02:28.490> of<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:29.090> romantic<00:02:29.870> feel<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.439> I

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
it it has kind of a romantic feel that I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.600 
it it has kind of a romantic feel that I
think<00:02:30.739> takes<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:31.010> lot<00:02:31.159> of<00:02:31.189> these<00:02:31.370> photographers

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
think takes a lot of these photographers

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.670 
think takes a lot of these photographers
back<00:02:32.299> a<00:02:32.329> few<00:02:32.599> years<00:02:32.900> well<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.260> think<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.530> thing

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
back a few years well I think the thing

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.050 
back a few years well I think the thing
too<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.099> mean<00:02:34.250> even<00:02:34.340> though<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.610> print

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
too is I mean even though you print

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.150 
too is I mean even though you print
print<00:02:35.300> out<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:36.319> you<00:02:36.410> stick<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.739> in<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.980> frame

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
print out and you stick it in a frame

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.890 
print out and you stick it in a frame
behind<00:02:37.340> glass<00:02:37.790> at<00:02:38.150> some<00:02:38.480> point<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.810> really

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
behind glass at some point it really

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.229 
behind glass at some point it really
doesn't<00:02:39.020> matter<00:02:39.440> as<00:02:40.040> long<00:02:40.580> as<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.000> front

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
doesn't matter as long as the front

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.030 
doesn't matter as long as the front
looks<00:02:41.420> beautiful<00:02:41.810> okay<00:02:42.110> but<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
looks beautiful okay but the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.470 
looks beautiful okay but the
photographer<00:02:43.580> itself<00:02:43.940> there's<00:02:44.150> something<00:02:44.420> to

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
photographer itself there's something to

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.839 
photographer itself there's something to
do<00:02:44.599> with<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.900> tactile<00:02:45.349> experience<00:02:46.069> holding

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
do with the tactile experience holding

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.930 
do with the tactile experience holding
it<00:02:47.150> your<00:02:47.300> hand<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:48.410> doesn't<00:02:48.830> have<00:02:49.610> anything<00:02:49.849> to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
it your hand it doesn't have anything to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.160 
it your hand it doesn't have anything to
do<00:02:50.090> or<00:02:50.209> what<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.390> looks<00:02:50.569> like<00:02:50.690> in<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.959> frame

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
do or what it looks like in the frame

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.050 
do or what it looks like in the frame
it's<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.470> actual<00:02:51.620> day<00:02:51.890> physical<00:02:52.459> experience

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
it's the actual day physical experience

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.059 
it's the actual day physical experience
of<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.780> print<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.290> that's<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.769> that's

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
of the print that that's a that's

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.530 
of the print that that's a that's
absolutely<00:02:55.700> correct<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:56.330> been<00:02:56.510> that

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
absolutely correct and it's been that

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.509 
absolutely correct and it's been that
way<00:02:56.690> in<00:02:56.780> photography<00:02:57.440> for<00:02:57.650> many<00:02:57.800> years<00:02:58.069> but<00:02:58.489> I

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
way in photography for many years but I

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.430 
way in photography for many years but I
think<00:02:58.790> even<00:02:58.880> more<00:02:59.239> important<00:02:59.690> in<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.959> wedding

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
think even more important in the wedding

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.290 
think even more important in the wedding
and<00:03:00.560> portrait<00:03:00.680> photography<00:03:01.489> where<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.090> sale

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
family yeah it makes a big difference

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.110 
family yeah it makes a big difference
when<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.800> can<00:03:06.920> actually<00:03:07.069> hand<00:03:07.519> someone<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:07.910> raw

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
when you can actually hand someone a raw

feel<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.760> way<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:11.090> just<00:03:11.330> there's<00:03:11.930> it's

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
feel it the way it just there's it's

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.470 
feel it the way it just there's it's
different<00:03:12.860> between<00:03:13.130> like<00:03:13.519> an<00:03:13.640> RC<00:03:14.000> paper<00:03:14.269> and

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
different between like an RC paper and

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.030 
different between like an RC paper and
some<00:03:14.600> where<00:03:14.750> we<00:03:14.810> find<00:03:14.989> nice<00:03:15.290> stuff<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.799> makes<00:03:15.890> a

some where we find nice stuff it makes a

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.620 
some where we find nice stuff it makes a
big<00:03:16.130> difference<00:03:16.190> it's<00:03:16.700> an<00:03:16.910> extension<00:03:17.450> of<00:03:17.510> the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
big difference it's an extension of the

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
of cool stuff well originally we tried

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.979 
of cool stuff well originally we tried
to<00:03:30.440> come<00:03:31.010> up<00:03:31.040> with<00:03:31.190> papers<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.970> were<00:03:32.180> an<00:03:32.630> easy

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
to come up with papers that were an easy

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.530 
to come up with papers that were an easy
transition<00:03:33.410> for<00:03:34.269> photographers<00:03:35.269> that<00:03:35.299> were

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
transition for photographers that were

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.870 
transition for photographers that were
going<00:03:35.900> from<00:03:36.170> traditional<00:03:36.980> analog<00:03:37.280> prints<00:03:37.730> to

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
going from traditional analog prints to

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.420 
going from traditional analog prints to
digital<00:03:38.299> I<00:03:38.480> think<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.890> industry<00:03:40.340> has

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430
