00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
fatality rate of over 99% in fact only

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.400 
fatality rate of over 99% in fact only
three<00:00:14.400> people<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:15.210> survived<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.929> amoeba

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
three people have survived this amoeba

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.320 
three people have survived this amoeba
infection<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.730> last<00:00:17.940> 50<00:00:18.390> years<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.289> US

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
infection in the last 50 years in the US

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.460 
infection in the last 50 years in the US
where<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.750> found

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
where is it found

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.970 
where is it found
it's<00:00:23.279> found<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.789> freshwater<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.470> ideal

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
it's found in freshwater and it's ideal

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.359 
it's found in freshwater and it's ideal
neighborhood<00:00:26.240> is<00:00:27.240> high<00:00:27.720> temperature<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.619> low

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
neighborhood is high temperature and low

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.389 
neighborhood is high temperature and low
water<00:00:29.820> levels<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.470> amoeba<00:00:31.830> doesn't<00:00:32.219> get

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
water levels so the amoeba doesn't get

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.450 
water levels so the amoeba doesn't get
to<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.759> during<00:00:33.270> winter<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.620> September<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
to you during winter but September is a

pretty good month for it to get to you
so<00:00:39.600> July<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.410> August<00:00:41.030> how<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.329> get

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
so July and August how do you get

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.970 
so July and August how do you get
infected<00:00:43.940> if<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.329> infected<00:00:45.840> water<00:00:46.230> goes<00:00:46.770> up

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
infected if this infected water goes up

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.270 
infected if this infected water goes up
your<00:00:47.160> nose<00:00:47.660> you'd<00:00:48.660> probably<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.680> dead<00:00:49.980> very

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
your nose you'd probably be dead very

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.939 
your nose you'd probably be dead very
soon<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.710> you're<00:00:52.920> swimming<00:00:53.690> jumping

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
soon so if you're swimming jumping

diving or playing in water you are a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.459 
diving or playing in water you are a
prime<00:00:59.070> target<00:00:59.690> it<00:01:00.690> gets<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.320> little

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
prime target it gets a little

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.950 
prime target it gets a little
complicated<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:02.609> kids<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.480> water<00:01:03.840> up

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
complicated because kids get water up
