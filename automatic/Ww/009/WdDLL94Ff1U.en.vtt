here for a right-handed goalie it's a
little<00:02:23.380> easier<00:02:23.709> because<00:02:23.920> my<00:02:24.040> stick<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:25.270> now

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
little easier because my stick is now

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.600 
little easier because my stick is now
pipe<00:02:26.170> side<00:02:26.500> alright<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:26.950> what<00:02:27.340> we're<00:02:27.459> trying

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
pipe side alright and what we're trying

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.460 
pipe side alright and what we're trying
to<00:02:27.730> do<00:02:27.880> again<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.180> force<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.110> shooter<00:02:29.380> to

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
to do again is force this shooter to

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.110 
to do again is force this shooter to
carry<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.950> ball<00:02:30.070> as<00:02:30.250> long<00:02:30.430> as<00:02:30.580> possible<00:02:30.760> so

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
carry the ball as long as possible so

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.699 
carry the ball as long as possible so
it's<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.450> little<00:02:31.540> more<00:02:31.660> predictable<00:02:32.200> trying<00:02:32.650> to

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
it's a little more predictable trying to

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.170 
it's a little more predictable trying to
get<00:02:32.830> him<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.040> shoot<00:02:33.220> across<00:02:33.430> my<00:02:33.730> body

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
the longer would I force this shooter to

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.220 
the longer would I force this shooter to
carry<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.670> ball<00:02:36.790> up<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.060> field<00:02:37.450> alright<00:02:38.080> the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
from the crease and we try to slide as

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.270 
from the crease and we try to slide as
the<00:02:46.209> guy<00:02:46.360> comes<00:02:46.390> up<00:02:46.989> between<00:02:47.320> 2<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:47.860> 3<00:02:48.040> yards

above<00:02:48.489> galling<00:02:48.880> just<00:02:49.090> he's<00:02:49.209> becoming

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
above galling just he's becoming

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.300 
above galling just he's becoming
dangerous<00:02:50.019> we're<00:02:50.560> trying<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.920> get<00:02:51.100> their<00:02:51.280> own
