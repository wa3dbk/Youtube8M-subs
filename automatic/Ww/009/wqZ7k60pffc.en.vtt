as<00:03:08.790> well<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.090> I'd<00:03:09.210> say<00:03:09.620> stick<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.830> PC

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010

as well but I'd say stick to the PC
players<00:03:11.370> when<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.640> comes<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:11.940> silver<00:03:12.300> and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
players when it comes to silver and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.880 
players when it comes to silver and
bronze<00:03:12.600> is<00:03:12.900> because<00:03:13.440> that's<00:03:13.560> how<00:03:13.770> you're

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
going to make the most amount of profit

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.060 
going to make the most amount of profit
because<00:03:15.360> people<00:03:15.900> are<00:03:16.320> going<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.710> be<00:03:16.770> picking

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
actually quite a bit expensive at the

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.110 
actually quite a bit expensive at the
moment<00:03:46.740> I<00:03:46.800> think<00:03:47.040> they're<00:03:47.160> starting<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.730> going

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
moment I think they're starting to going

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.990 
moment I think they're starting to going
price<00:03:48.390> already<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.680> if<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.220> was<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.610> look<00:03:50.820> like
