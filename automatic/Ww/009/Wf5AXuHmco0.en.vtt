00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
much easier my first piece of advice

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.420 
much easier my first piece of advice
would<00:01:10.450> be<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.930> deep<00:01:11.200> condition<00:01:11.770> your<00:01:11.799> hair<00:01:12.159> the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
would be to deep condition your hair the

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.170 
would be to deep condition your hair the
night<00:01:12.640> before

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
night before

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.899 
night before
now<00:01:13.689> since<00:01:14.020> chlorine<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.830> salt<00:01:15.130> water<00:01:15.400> can<00:01:15.670> be

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
now since chlorine and salt water can be

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.300 
now since chlorine and salt water can be
super<00:01:16.330> damaging<00:01:16.900> and<00:01:17.140> drying<00:01:17.530> on<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:17.979> hair

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
super damaging and drying on the hair

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.850 
super damaging and drying on the hair
it's<00:01:18.610> important<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.689> so<00:01:20.259> much<00:01:20.409> easier<00:01:20.619> just

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
it's important and so much easier just

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.219 
it's important and so much easier just
to<00:01:21.130> go<00:01:21.340> into<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.790> situation<00:01:22.479> with<00:01:22.780> your<00:01:23.020> hair
