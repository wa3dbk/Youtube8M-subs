pad now this is just a patent and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.440 
pad now this is just a patent and
Nintendo<00:00:32.489> doesn't<00:00:32.790> always<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.059> anything<00:00:33.300> with

the patents that they register but of

the patents that they register but of
course<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.460> leaves<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.730> speculation<00:00:36.180> that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
course it leaves a speculation that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.639 
course it leaves a speculation that
maybe<00:00:36.660> Nintendo's<00:00:37.200> thinking<00:00:37.469> about

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
maybe Nintendo's thinking about

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.319 
maybe Nintendo's thinking about
unveiling<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.100> another<00:00:38.340> revision<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> 3gs

unveiling a another revision of the 3gs

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.389 
unveiling a another revision of the 3gs
at<00:00:39.540> e3<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.379> shoot<00:00:40.530> all<00:00:40.739> these<00:00:40.920> rumors<00:00:41.100> down

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
at e3 but to shoot all these rumors down

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.069 
at e3 but to shoot all these rumors down
an<00:00:41.579> internal<00:00:41.969> representative<00:00:42.510> has<00:00:42.660> confirmed

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
an internal representative has confirmed

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.569 
an internal representative has confirmed
that<00:00:43.200> they<00:00:43.350> definitely<00:00:43.710> aren't<00:00:44.040> announcing

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
that they definitely aren't announcing

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
that they definitely aren't announcing
hardware<00:00:45.000> at<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.270> year's<00:00:45.480> e3<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
hardware at this year's e3 so that's a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.959 
hardware at this year's e3 so that's a
pretty<00:00:46.680> straightforward<00:00:47.010> answer<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
pretty straightforward answer this is a

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.580 
pretty straightforward answer this is a
rare<00:00:48.239> thing<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> Nintendo<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> say<00:00:49.289> because

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
rare thing for a Nintendo to say because

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.630 
rare thing for a Nintendo to say because
they<00:00:49.710> usually<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.100> say<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.520> they<00:00:50.610> don't

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
they usually just say that they don't

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.639 
they usually just say that they don't
comment<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.210> rumors<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> speculations<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
comment on rumors and speculations so it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.810 
comment on rumors and speculations so it
could<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.010> they<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.430> want<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> put<00:00:53.789> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
could be that they just want to put this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.549 
could be that they just want to put this
rumor<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.300> rest<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.020> course<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.410> is

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
rumor to rest but of course there is

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.990 
rumor to rest but of course there is
always<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.860> doubt<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.160> maybe<00:00:56.520> Nintendo's

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
always a doubt that maybe Nintendo's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.369 
always a doubt that maybe Nintendo's
line<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.539> are<00:00:57.750> actually<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.320> be

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
line and they are actually going to be

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.020 
line and they are actually going to be
announcing<00:00:58.680> something<00:00:58.859> at<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.190> year's<00:00:59.399> e3<00:00:59.579> I

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
announcing something at this year's e3 I

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.639 
announcing something at this year's e3 I
doubt<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> successor<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
doubt it's going to be the successor to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.770 
doubt it's going to be the successor to
the<00:01:01.800> wii<00:01:02.039> u<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.820> anything<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.359> might<00:01:03.570> just

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the wii u and if anything it might just

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.359 
the wii u and if anything it might just
be<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.960> quality<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.409> life<00:01:04.619> thing<00:01:04.860> moving<00:01:05.280> away

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.219 
that same question was posed to the vice

president of avalanche software and he
pretty<00:01:16.470> much<00:01:16.590> works<00:01:16.920> around<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> question

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
pretty much works around the question

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.370 
pretty much works around the question
and<00:01:17.790> doesn't<00:01:18.150> give<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> direct<00:01:18.570> answer<00:01:18.810> he

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.719 
announcing Disney infinity people were
asking<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.560> Marvel<00:01:22.890> stuff<00:01:23.040> would<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.280> added<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
asking if Marvel stuff would be added to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.980 
asking if Marvel stuff would be added to
the<00:01:23.759> game<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.390> even<00:01:24.720> though<00:01:24.810> they<00:01:24.930> were

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the game and even though they were

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.480 
the game and even though they were
working<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.590> content<00:01:26.040> at<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.280> time

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
working on that content at that time

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.249 
working on that content at that time
they<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.939> couldn't<00:01:27.150> talk<00:01:27.390> about<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
they just couldn't talk about it so I

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.020 
they just couldn't talk about it so I
guess<00:01:28.590> he<00:01:28.710> could<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:29.009> alluding<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:29.790> are

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
guess he could be alluding that they are

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.609 
guess he could be alluding that they are
working<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.450> some<00:01:30.570> Star<00:01:30.780> Wars<00:01:30.990> content<00:01:31.439> but

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
working on some Star Wars content but

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.260 
working on some Star Wars content but
they<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.950> can't<00:01:32.100> talk<00:01:32.340> about<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.700> Disney

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
they just can't talk about it Disney

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.340 
they just can't talk about it Disney
infinity<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.689> pretty<00:01:33.840> much<00:01:33.960> an<00:01:34.079> annual

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
infinity is pretty much an annual

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.870 
infinity is pretty much an annual
franchise<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:34.979> two<00:01:35.100> point<00:01:35.369> O<00:01:35.430> coming<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:35.790> in

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
franchise with two point O coming out in

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.969 
franchise with two point O coming out in
2014<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.869> inevitable<00:01:37.170> three-point<00:01:37.920> Oh

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
2014 and the inevitable three-point Oh

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
2014 and the inevitable three-point Oh
probably<00:01:38.400> coming<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.790> 2015<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.659> maybe

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
probably coming out in 2015 and maybe

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.960 
probably coming out in 2015 and maybe
we'll<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.619> focused<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.009> Star<00:01:41.250> Wars<00:01:41.490> content

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
we'll be focused on Star Wars content

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.100 
we'll be focused on Star Wars content
and<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.240> would<00:01:42.329> definitely<00:01:42.509> make<00:01:42.720> sense

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
and it would definitely make sense

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.899 
and it would definitely make sense
because<00:01:43.350> Star<00:01:43.710> Wars<00:01:43.860> Episode<00:01:43.950> 7<00:01:44.220> comes<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:44.820> in

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
because Star Wars Episode 7 comes out in

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.940 
because Star Wars Episode 7 comes out in
2015<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.689> there's<00:01:46.110> also<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.500> Star<00:01:46.770> Wars

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
2015 and there's also that Star Wars

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.740 
2015 and there's also that Star Wars
rebel<00:01:47.250> cartoon<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.149> be<00:01:48.270> done<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.630> them

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
rebel cartoon it would be done for them

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.270 
rebel cartoon it would be done for them
not<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.960> cash<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> franchise<00:01:49.890> because

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
not to cash in on the franchise because

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.399 
not to cash in on the franchise because
in<00:01:50.520> 2015<00:01:51.149> people<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.540> probably<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.960> hyping<00:01:52.320> up

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
in 2015 people are probably be hyping up

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.109 
in 2015 people are probably be hyping up
episode<00:01:52.799> 7<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.280> would<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> perfect<00:01:54.000> way<00:01:54.090> for

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
episode 7 it would be a perfect way for

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.819 
episode 7 it would be a perfect way for
them<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> make<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.630> ton<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.899> money<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.530> really

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
them to make a ton of money but really

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.080 
them to make a ton of money but really
we<00:01:55.950> don't<00:01:56.070> know<00:01:56.219> what<00:01:56.340> Disney<00:01:56.610> strategy<00:01:57.000> is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
we don't know what Disney strategy is

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.459 
we don't know what Disney strategy is
going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:57.840> I'm<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.170> guess<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
going to be but I'm going to guess and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.990 
going to be but I'm going to guess and
say<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.619> Disney<00:01:59.070> infinity<00:01:59.189> three<00:01:59.700> pointer

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
say that Disney infinity three pointer

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.789 
say that Disney infinity three pointer
will<00:02:00.299> indeed<00:02:00.600> get<00:02:00.750> strong<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.200> content<00:02:01.619> it

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
will indeed get strong was content it

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.620 
will indeed get strong was content it
just<00:02:02.040> makes<00:02:02.189> sense<00:02:02.430> moving<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.240> into<00:02:03.420> the
