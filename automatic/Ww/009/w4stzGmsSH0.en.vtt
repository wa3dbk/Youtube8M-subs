hello I'm dye Roberts from the insight

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.690 
hello I'm dye Roberts from the insight
school<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.509> art<00:00:06.859> and<00:00:07.859> I'm<00:00:08.220> going<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.519> show<00:00:08.670> you

school of art and I'm going to show you

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.330 
school of art and I'm going to show you
some<00:00:09.059> simple<00:00:09.210> drawing<00:00:09.750> exercises<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.190> hope

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
some simple drawing exercises and I hope

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.890 
some simple drawing exercises and I hope
you<00:00:11.490> enjoy<00:00:11.759> them<00:00:13.880> I'm<00:00:14.880> going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.210> show<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.750> how

you enjoy them I'm going to show you how

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.400 
you enjoy them I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:15.929> draw<00:00:16.289> an<00:00:16.440> ear<00:00:17.210> I've<00:00:18.210> chosen<00:00:18.750> an<00:00:19.109> image

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
to draw an ear I've chosen an image

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.859 
to draw an ear I've chosen an image
that's<00:00:20.720> random<00:00:21.720> any<00:00:22.470> ear<00:00:23.430> you'll<00:00:24.359> find<00:00:24.720> that

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
that's random any ear you'll find that

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.320 
that's random any ear you'll find that
no<00:00:25.019> two<00:00:25.080> ears<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> same<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:27.029> like<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
no two ears are the same it's like a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.779 
no two ears are the same it's like a
shell<00:00:27.720> no<00:00:28.380> two<00:00:28.439> shells<00:00:28.890> are<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> same<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.730> in

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
shell no two shells are the same and in

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.279 
shell no two shells are the same and in
fact<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> technique<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.720> fairly<00:00:30.960> similar

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
fact the technique is fairly similar

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.560 
fact the technique is fairly similar
you're<00:00:31.949> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> draw<00:00:32.369> what<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.520> see<00:00:32.610> you're

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you're going to draw what you see you're

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.990 
you're going to draw what you see you're
copying<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.320> shapes<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.070> an<00:00:35.520> ear<00:00:36.000> generally

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
copying the shapes and an ear generally

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.479 
copying the shapes and an ear generally
starts<00:00:39.000> off<00:00:39.180> with<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.660> sort<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> shape<00:00:40.489> it's

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
starts off with this sort of shape it's

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.299 
starts off with this sort of shape it's
like<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> backwards<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.420> see<00:00:43.309> obviously

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
like a backwards to see obviously

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.590 
like a backwards to see obviously
depending<00:00:44.700> which<00:00:44.789> way<00:00:44.850> round<00:00:45.180> you're<00:00:45.420> drawing

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
depending which way round you're drawing

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.799 
depending which way round you're drawing
it<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.829> within<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.460> top<00:00:47.700> layer<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.329> top<00:00:48.570> line

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it and within the top layer the top line

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.590 
it and within the top layer the top line
of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.050> sea<00:00:49.350> there's<00:00:49.649> an<00:00:49.770> echo<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:51.210> wraps

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
of the sea there's an echo that wraps

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.189 
of the sea there's an echo that wraps
around<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.160> why<00:00:53.510> ears<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.870> known<00:00:55.020> as

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
around and this is why ears are known as

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
around and this is why ears are known as
shell-like<00:00:55.800> because<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:56.670> are<00:00:56.850> there's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
shell-like because they are there's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.459 
shell-like because they are there's
lines<00:00:58.469> within<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> lines<00:00:59.899> curves<00:01:00.899> within

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
lines within the lines curves within

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.590 
lines within the lines curves within
curves<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.399> they're<00:01:03.059> actually<00:01:03.210> quite

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
curves and they're actually quite

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.170 
curves and they're actually quite
beautiful<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.470> draw<00:01:04.680> even<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> line

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
beautiful to draw even just as a line

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.940 
beautiful to draw even just as a line
drawing<00:01:06.770> but<00:01:07.770> they<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.460> require<00:01:09.020> tone<00:01:10.020> shading

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
drawing but they do require tone shading

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.469 
drawing but they do require tone shading
to<00:01:11.280> make<00:01:11.310> them<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:11.790> bit<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.180> realistic

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
to make them a little bit more realistic

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.830 
to make them a little bit more realistic
you<00:01:13.369> could<00:01:14.369> carry<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.760> some<00:01:15.210> people<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.659> got

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you could carry on some people have got

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.670 
you could carry on some people have got
ears<00:01:16.080> where<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.040> area<00:01:17.869> continues<00:01:18.869> down<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
ears where this area continues down and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.880 
ears where this area continues down and
round<00:01:20.360> some<00:01:21.360> people<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.780> got<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> huge<00:01:22.470> area

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
round some people have got a huge area

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.679 
round some people have got a huge area
here<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> lobe<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.210> ER<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
here this is the lobe of the ER that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.140 
here this is the lobe of the ER that
traditionally<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:26.100> most<00:01:26.340> cultures<00:01:26.640> that's

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
traditionally in most cultures that's

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.480 
traditionally in most cultures that's
where<00:01:27.509> you'd<00:01:27.750> put<00:01:27.780> an<00:01:28.200> earring<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.310> quite

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
where you'd put an earring so it's quite

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.690 
where you'd put an earring so it's quite
a<00:01:29.549> large<00:01:29.939> flat<00:01:30.509> area<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.110> flappy<00:01:31.500> skin<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.579> we

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
a large flat area of flappy skin but we

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.149 
a large flat area of flappy skin but we
then<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.060> lot<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.509> large<00:01:33.960> bit<00:01:34.380> pieces<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.950> sort

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
then get lot of large bit pieces of sort

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.480 
then get lot of large bit pieces of sort
of<00:01:35.220> quite<00:01:35.759> bony<00:01:36.119> cartilage<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> hard<00:01:37.860> areas

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
of quite bony cartilage and hard areas

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.819 
of quite bony cartilage and hard areas
so<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.119> hard<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.570> soft<00:01:39.840> its<00:01:40.020> curves<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
so it's hard and soft its curves and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.639 
so it's hard and soft its curves and
then<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.640> shading<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:43.049> part<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.409> means

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
then it's shading one part that means

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.130 
then it's shading one part that means
the<00:01:43.890> darkest<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.479> where<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the darkest is here this is where the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.109 
the darkest is here this is where the
hole<00:01:46.380> goes<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> brain<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:47.790> know

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
hole goes into the brain I don't know

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.120 
hole goes into the brain I don't know
the<00:01:48.240> technical<00:01:48.659> term<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.950> how<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the technical term I just know how to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.749 
the technical term I just know how to
draw<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.579> which<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.119> very<00:01:51.479> heavy<00:01:51.780> dark<00:01:52.079> shading

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
draw it which is very heavy dark shading

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.850 
draw it which is very heavy dark shading
that<00:01:53.759> gradually<00:01:54.240> lightens<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> lot<00:01:55.829> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
that gradually lightens up so a lot of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.990 
that gradually lightens up so a lot of
this<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.310> about<00:01:56.990> tonal<00:01:57.990> variation<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:59.790> get

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
this is about tonal variation to get

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.560 
this is about tonal variation to get
depth<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:01.200> need<00:02:01.380> more<00:02:01.619> tone<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:03.090> bring<00:02:03.360> an

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
depth you need more tone to bring an

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.600 
depth you need more tone to bring an
area<00:02:03.930> forward<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.649> need<00:02:04.770> contrasts<00:02:05.490> between

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
area forward you need contrasts between

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.520 
area forward you need contrasts between
light<00:02:06.000> and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
light and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.580 
light and
and<00:02:06.890> that's<00:02:07.130> all<00:02:07.750> available<00:02:08.750> for<00:02:08.990> you<00:02:09.140> within

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
and that's all available for you within

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.360 
and that's all available for you within
an<00:02:09.979> ear<00:02:11.230> whether<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.380> drawing<00:02:12.590> from<00:02:12.950> an<00:02:13.100> image

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
and clean up areas if I wanted to but

what<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:14.420> can<00:04:14.780> do<00:04:15.019> is<00:04:15.230> use<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.769> carbon<00:04:16.459> and

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
what I can do is use the carbon and

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.900 
what I can do is use the carbon and
graphite<00:04:17.239> that's<00:04:17.720> on<00:04:17.840> my<00:04:17.959> finger<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.680> blend<00:04:19.519> a
