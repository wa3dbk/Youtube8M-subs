00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.100 
you know I was quite good in drawing and
I<00:00:08.670> was<00:00:08.849> quite<00:00:09.120> good<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.420> tinkering<00:00:09.870> and

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
I was quite good in tinkering and

I was quite good in tinkering and
repairing<00:00:10.770> stuff<00:00:12.170> so<00:00:13.170> one<00:00:13.380> day<00:00:13.560> I<00:00:13.590> came<00:00:13.830> across

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
repairing stuff so one day I came across

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.410 
repairing stuff so one day I came across
this<00:00:14.310> school<00:00:14.640> where<00:00:14.970> they<00:00:15.059> did<00:00:15.240> these

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
this school where they did these

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.900 
this school where they did these
drawings<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:16.230> they<00:00:16.320> did<00:00:16.470> model<00:00:17.430> building<00:00:17.789> and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
drawings and they did model building and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.029 
drawings and they did model building and
since<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.840> was<00:00:18.960> always<00:00:19.110> into<00:00:19.470> bikes<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.010> I

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
since I was always into bikes so I

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.250 
since I was always into bikes so I
thought<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.820> something<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.360> can<00:00:21.570> do

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260

thought this is something I can do
it's<00:00:23.160> quite<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> natural<00:00:23.550> development<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.449> I

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
it's quite a natural development that I

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:36.800 
it's quite a natural development that I

fascinating<00:01:02.380> because<00:01:03.190> basically<00:01:03.430> I<00:01:03.700> think<00:01:03.850> it

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
fascinating because basically I think it

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.260 
fascinating because basically I think it

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
giving away a child more or less so I

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.060 
giving away a child more or less so I

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.350 
don't want to give away any more of my
bikes<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:05.920> this<00:02:06.160> is<00:02:06.280> why<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:06.430> ended<00:02:06.760> up<00:02:06.820> with<00:02:07.000> 16

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
bikes so this is why I ended up with 16

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.070 
bikes so this is why I ended up with 16
bikes<00:02:07.570> now<00:02:10.680> the<00:02:11.680> K<00:02:11.920> 1200<00:02:12.730> r<00:02:12.940> came<00:02:13.600> at<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> time

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
bikes now the K 1200 r came at a time

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.780 
bikes now the K 1200 r came at a time
where<00:02:14.410> B&amp;W<00:02:14.830> motorbike<00:02:15.340> was<00:02:15.490> already

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
where B&amp;W motorbike was already

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.390 
where B&amp;W motorbike was already
consolidated<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.990> could<00:02:17.170> say<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.100> did<00:02:18.370> a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
consolidated I could say so I did a

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.120 
consolidated I could say so I did a
pretty<00:02:18.640> provocative<00:02:19.350> design<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.770> my<00:02:20.920> big

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
pretty provocative design to my big

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.000 
pretty provocative design to my big
surprise<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.850> design<00:02:22.180> was<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.480> chosen<00:02:23.010> it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
surprise this design was in chosen it

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.410 
surprise this design was in chosen it
was<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.190> design<00:02:24.580> which<00:02:24.790> was<00:02:25.000> not<00:02:25.210> really

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
was a design which was not really

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.870 
was a design which was not really
reasonable<00:02:26.020> just<00:02:26.260> by<00:02:26.470> technology<00:02:27.370> quality

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
reasonable just by technology quality

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.780 
reasonable just by technology quality
precision<00:02:28.600> but<00:02:29.410> also<00:02:29.740> by<00:02:29.980> emotion<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.700> that

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
precision but also by emotion and that

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.790 
precision but also by emotion and that
was<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.480> was<00:02:31.600> pretty<00:02:31.810> new<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.320> very

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
was that was pretty new and very

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:43.250 
was that was pretty new and very
different<00:02:32.890> from<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.850> designs<00:02:34.150> before

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.979 

motorbike<00:02:44.260> design<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:45.520> combination<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.570> art

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
motorbike design is a combination of art

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.170 
motorbike design is a combination of art
and<00:02:47.380> craftsmanship<00:02:47.830> what<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.489> would<00:02:48.730> say<00:02:48.910> it's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
and craftsmanship what I would say it's

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.940 
and craftsmanship what I would say it's
more<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.540> craftsmanship<00:02:50.320> than<00:02:50.680> or<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:52.950> think

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
more of craftsmanship than or I think

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.160 
more of craftsmanship than or I think
you<00:02:54.190> have<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.550> have<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:55.030> big<00:02:55.450> understanding<00:02:56.050> of

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
you have to have a big understanding of

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.830 
you have to have a big understanding of
how<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.800> motorbike<00:02:57.370> works<00:02:57.700> what<00:02:58.330> is<00:02:58.450> underneath

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
how a motorbike works what is underneath

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.199 
how a motorbike works what is underneath
an<00:02:59.200> engine<00:02:59.590> cover<00:02:59.890> what<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:00.730> behind<00:03:00.880> this

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
an engine cover what is behind this

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.360 
an engine cover what is behind this
fairing<00:03:01.750> thing<00:03:02.110> it's<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.860> pretty<00:03:03.040> complicated

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
fairing thing it's a pretty complicated

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.820 
fairing thing it's a pretty complicated
complex<00:03:04.209> thing<00:03:04.630> or<00:03:04.840> crude<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.380> loud<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:06.580> loud

complex thing or crude and loud and loud

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.020 
complex thing or crude and loud and loud
you<00:03:08.830> define<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.250> bike<00:03:09.519> first<00:03:09.760> by<00:03:09.910> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
you define a bike first by the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.000 
you define a bike first by the
proportion<00:03:10.540> if<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.959> proportion<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.530> not

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
proportion if the proportion is not

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.650 
proportion if the proportion is not
correct<00:03:12.430> Asians<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:13.030> can<00:03:13.209> forget<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.510> rest

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
correct Asians you can forget the rest

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.270 
correct Asians you can forget the rest
then<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.290> have<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.590> find<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.890> right<00:03:15.040> gesture

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
then you have to find the right gesture

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.220 
then you have to find the right gesture
right<00:03:15.700> design<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.390> red<00:03:16.510> formal<00:03:16.870> language

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
right design in the red formal language

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.900 
right design in the red formal language
and<00:03:17.560> then<00:03:17.980> you<00:03:18.010> have<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.310> make<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.519> details

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
and then you have to make the details

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.930 
and then you have to make the details
and<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.900> details<00:03:19.930> are<00:03:20.560> again<00:03:20.980> defined<00:03:21.610> by<00:03:21.880> the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
and the details are again defined by the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.150 
and the details are again defined by the
segment<00:03:22.480> during<00:03:22.600> audio<00:03:23.260> off-road<00:03:23.620> talking<00:03:24.010> or

segment during audio off-road talking or

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.250 
segment during audio off-road talking or
your<00:03:24.430> race<00:03:24.549> by<00:03:24.790> talking<00:03:25.239> or<00:03:25.450> your<00:03:25.690> crews<00:03:26.110> are

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
your race by talking or your crews are

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.300 
your race by talking or your crews are
talking<00:03:26.620> whatever

talking whatever

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.400 
talking whatever
I<00:03:27.340> mean<00:03:27.640> proportion<00:03:28.120> everything<00:03:28.180> is<00:03:28.540> perfect

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
I mean proportion everything is perfect

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.039 
I mean proportion everything is perfect
I<00:03:29.560> would<00:03:29.709> say<00:03:29.950> it's<00:03:30.250> difficult<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:31.180> say<00:03:31.390> how<00:03:31.780> a

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
I would say it's difficult to say how a

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.979 
I would say it's difficult to say how a
good<00:03:32.680> design<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.549> defined<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.330> would<00:03:34.720> say<00:03:34.840> the

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
good design is defined I would say the

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.020 
good design is defined I would say the
good<00:03:35.200> design<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:35.739> when<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.070> have<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.250> perfect

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
good design is when you have a perfect

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.530 
good design is when you have a perfect
combination<00:03:37.330> of<00:03:38.250> technology<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.580> aesthetics

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
combination of technology and aesthetics

for us a bike is not finished as long as

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.690 
for us a bike is not finished as long as
the<00:03:47.480> rider<00:03:47.689> is<00:03:47.930> not<00:03:48.109> on<00:03:48.349> the<00:03:48.500> bike<00:03:48.709> if<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.519> sit

like this on a bike with a hand ball
like<00:03:52.069> that<00:03:52.099> it's<00:03:52.549> kind<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:52.849> a<00:03:52.909> bit<00:03:53.079> ok

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
like that it's kind of a bit ok

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.110 
like that it's kind of a bit ok
non-active<00:03:56.569> well<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.349> just<00:03:57.650> bend<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:58.849> hand

non-active well you just bend the hand
more<00:03:59.329> a<00:03:59.359> little<00:03:59.629> bit<00:03:59.659> out<00:03:59.900> use<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.650> very

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
more a little bit out use it very

to<00:04:11.389> the<00:04:11.510> outside<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:12.290> motorbike<00:04:13.189> is<00:04:13.430> the

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:13.969 
to the outside a motorbike is the

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:19.810 
to the outside a motorbike is the
biggest<00:04:14.269> accessory<00:04:14.719> you<00:04:14.959> can<00:04:14.989> wear

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.250 

I<00:04:21.070> did<00:04:22.070> lots<00:04:22.160> of<00:04:22.310> off-road<00:04:22.670> riding<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.260> I

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
I did lots of off-road riding and I

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.560 
I did lots of off-road riding and I
always<00:04:24.650> wanted<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.370> have<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:25.580> boxer<00:04:26.210> engine

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
always wanted to have a boxer engine

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.910 
always wanted to have a boxer engine
with<00:04:26.750> not<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:27.260> much<00:04:27.410> weight

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
with not so much weight

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.730 
with not so much weight
finally<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:29.390> job<00:04:29.630> came<00:04:29.930> along<00:04:30.200> that<00:04:30.230> we<00:04:30.620> had

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
finally the job came along that we had

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.460 
finally the job came along that we had
to<00:04:30.860> do<00:04:30.980> a<00:04:31.010> new<00:04:31.250> GS<00:04:31.750> basically<00:04:32.750> I<00:04:32.960> think<00:04:33.380> the

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
to do a new GS basically I think the

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.530 
to do a new GS basically I think the
bike<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.830> wanted<00:04:34.220> to<00:04:34.310> do<00:04:34.460> for<00:04:34.490> me<00:04:34.790> that<00:04:35.000> was

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
bike I wanted to do for me that was

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.310 
bike I wanted to do for me that was
actually<00:04:35.840> or<00:04:36.380> 1200<00:04:36.920> GS<00:04:37.130> I<00:04:37.990> really<00:04:38.990> believe

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
actually or 1200 GS I really believe

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.860 
actually or 1200 GS I really believe
that<00:04:39.350> our<00:04:39.830> 1200<00:04:40.550> GS<00:04:40.730> was<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.390> bike<00:04:41.600> which

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
that our 1200 GS was the bike which

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.140 
that our 1200 GS was the bike which
would<00:04:42.230> be<00:04:42.380> MW<00:04:42.800> motor<00:04:43.040> rod<00:04:43.250> on<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.520> map<00:04:43.910> of

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
would be MW motor rod on the map of

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.080 
would be MW motor rod on the map of
global<00:04:44.420> motor<00:04:45.110> bike<00:04:45.350> manufacturers<00:04:46.160> it<00:04:46.850> was

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
global motor bike manufacturers it was

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.750 
global motor bike manufacturers it was
actually<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.600> best<00:04:47.900> sold<00:04:48.290> plus<00:04:48.800> 750<00:04:49.340> bike

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
actually the best sold plus 750 bike

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:59.650 
actually the best sold plus 750 bike
worldwide<00:04:56.650> yeah<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:57.710> was<00:04:58.040> out<00:04:58.550> in<00:04:58.730> India<00:04:59.450> for

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
worldwide yeah I was out in India for

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.230 
worldwide yeah I was out in India for
three<00:04:59.720> years<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:01.190> decision<00:05:01.580> to<00:05:01.700> do<00:05:01.850> this<00:05:02.030> was

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
three years the decision to do this was

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.930 
three years the decision to do this was
a<00:05:02.270> very<00:05:02.480> personal<00:05:03.170> one<00:05:03.320> I<00:05:03.590> mean<00:05:03.830> I<00:05:04.070> kind<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.460> saw

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
a very personal one I mean I kind of saw

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.910 
a very personal one I mean I kind of saw
myself<00:05:05.180> on<00:05:05.570> this<00:05:05.720> railroad<00:05:06.110> track<00:05:06.590> you<00:05:06.800> know

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
myself on this railroad track you know

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.620 
myself on this railroad track you know
and<00:05:07.130> you<00:05:07.250> see<00:05:07.490> know<00:05:07.880> exactly<00:05:08.300> what<00:05:08.510> you're

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
doing until retirement and I was a bit

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.150 
doing until retirement and I was a bit
scared<00:05:11.270> about<00:05:11.690> this<00:05:12.140> you<00:05:12.440> know<00:05:12.590> so<00:05:12.830> I<00:05:12.860> thought

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
on result bikes is that you see the

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.250 
on result bikes is that you see the
mechanics<00:05:57.340> in<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.670> see<00:05:57.850> the<00:05:57.970> semantics<00:05:58.750> in

the<00:05:59.560> mechanics<00:06:00.070> you<00:06:00.940> have<00:06:00.970> lots<00:06:01.300> of<00:06:01.360> these

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
the mechanics you have lots of these

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.120 
the mechanics you have lots of these
gadgets<00:06:01.780> nowadays<00:06:02.350> like<00:06:02.590> computers

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
not see how they work and this is

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.310 
not see how they work and this is
something<00:06:09.670> which<00:06:09.790> is<00:06:09.940> inherent<00:06:10.510> to<00:06:10.690> mankind

to have a balance on these things to a

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.610 
to have a balance on these things to a
certain<00:06:21.669> extent<00:06:22.210> mechanics<00:06:22.930> is<00:06:23.110> the<00:06:23.260> luxury

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
certain extent mechanics is the luxury

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.309 
certain extent mechanics is the luxury
of<00:06:23.710> the<00:06:23.950> future

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:34.989 

I<00:06:30.849> actually<00:06:31.849> customized<00:06:32.839> them<00:06:33.199> or<00:06:33.469> 51<00:06:34.219> I<00:06:34.460> mean

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:34.999 
I actually customized them or 51 I mean

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:36.339 
I actually customized them or 51 I mean
this<00:06:35.119> is<00:06:35.270> like<00:06:35.389> 10<00:06:35.629> years<00:06:35.839> ago<00:06:36.050> or<00:06:36.199> something

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349 
this is like 10 years ago or something

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:38.799 
this is like 10 years ago or something
and<00:06:36.710> we<00:06:37.279> drove<00:06:37.430> up<00:06:37.610> at<00:06:37.759> work<00:06:37.969> and<00:06:38.270> we<00:06:38.539> showed<00:06:38.779> it

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:38.809 
and we drove up at work and we showed it

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:40.689 
and we drove up at work and we showed it
and<00:06:39.169> everybody<00:06:39.619> loved<00:06:39.889> the<00:06:40.009> bike<00:06:40.189> and<00:06:40.369> we<00:06:40.490> said

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:40.699 
and everybody loved the bike and we said

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:42.249 
and everybody loved the bike and we said
now<00:06:40.849> we<00:06:40.909> have<00:06:41.119> to<00:06:41.240> do<00:06:41.360> something<00:06:41.779> like<00:06:41.990> this

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:42.259 
now we have to do something like this

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:45.339 
now we have to do something like this
