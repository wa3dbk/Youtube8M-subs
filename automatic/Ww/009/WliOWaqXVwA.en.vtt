 conducted 1 0 the Toulouse start to 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.719

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.659
 djalo loaned by the benfica lisbon he 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.720
 is not qualified yet 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.830
 with this long iago balloon towards the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.800
 surface to repair 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.450

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.180
 donuts nerves one approached the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.530
 any end of the 89th minute match 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.750
 the equalization of Toulouse 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.670
 it was not until 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.190
 Toulouse are dangerous 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.709
 decisive pass of the young yago and this 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.440
 superb recovery of ben yedder his 3rd goal 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.989
 since the beginning of the season he is one 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.620
 top scorers of the championship 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.620
 with his three achievements 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.360
 the beautiful shot of ben yedder and 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.890
 saving the Toulouse who 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.000
 would like to snatch the three 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.120
 points with a last opportunity 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.099
 maybe and the super parade of kossi 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.829
 agased the Togolese goalkeeper very 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.660
 experienced in order to reims that's 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.040
 that he will be very solicited in the end 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.129
 of match he saves his camp a first 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.370
 times a second maybe the typing goes 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.870
 to be countered no success for them 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.700
 Toulouse at the end of the match but they 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.480
 have attacked a little too late score 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.480
 final a goal everywhere
