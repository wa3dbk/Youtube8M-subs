00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.779
 minecraft 1.7 point of this that was the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.430
 reports are asking what if the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.860
 video before it's earlier 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.710
 the video of 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.830
 the solution to are the sound that we 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.300
 they listen at the seven point microphone 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.760
 points of 7.1 points two and that's good 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 but you do not have to do is go to home 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.430
 let's put percent app 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.430
 sorry 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.760
 and they will go croft and then they will go to do 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.540
 virtual 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.050
 and so and here are how to copy all 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.050
 these 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.270
 control is or together with right click to 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.740
 copy 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.970
 after the jons 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.170
 and the vain 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.299
 they are going to hit everything not 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.030
 in the presentation of these two elements 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.350
 sexual they say yes and I still do not 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.299
 to do because they are already here 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.509
 and well, this is here, but I'm going to 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.360
 leave in the description so that what 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.580
 can go down and have the sounds if 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.070
 is that they do not have any 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.360
 and well, it's the same as in the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.000
 black entity to be virtual thesis and 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.420
 they are and ready 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.330
 nothing more than in the previous 90 we are going to 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.120
 virtual I think here you're showing up 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.860
 sound and all that but well that has been 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.070
