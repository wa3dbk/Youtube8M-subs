and<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.790> way<00:03:22.910> in<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.269> waistband<00:03:24.160> we're<00:03:25.160> in

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
and the way in the waistband we're in

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.979 
and the way in the waistband we're in
the<00:03:25.430> way<00:03:25.580> started<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:26.150> determined<00:03:26.600> by<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.750> not

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
the way started is determined by the not

00:03:26.989 --> 00:04:00.040 
the way started is determined by the not
adding<00:03:27.980> or<00:03:28.100> removing<00:03:28.220> the

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.360 

by<00:04:01.050> changing<00:04:01.260> these<00:04:01.560> parameters<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.160> will

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
by changing these parameters you will

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.070 
by changing these parameters you will
see<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:02.580> drastic<00:04:03.120> difference<00:04:03.270> in<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.720> pumping

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
see a drastic difference in the pumping

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.190 
see a drastic difference in the pumping
cycle<00:04:08.030> now<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.090> can<00:04:09.270> see<00:04:09.390> there's<00:04:09.750> more<00:04:09.960> steps

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200
