00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.089 
going to apply a lot nicer so brushes I
know<00:02:25.940> are<00:02:26.060> an<00:02:26.180> investment<00:02:26.629> but<00:02:27.110> they're<00:02:28.069> a

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
know are an investment but they're a

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.039 
know are an investment but they're a
very<00:02:28.400> good<00:02:28.519> investment<00:02:29.269> as<00:02:29.420> far<00:02:29.750> as<00:02:29.780> I'm

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
very good investment as far as I'm

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:37.720 
very good investment as far as I'm
concerned

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.429 

and<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.180> add<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.360> little<00:02:39.659> bit<00:02:39.870> more<00:02:40.140> you

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
and you can add a little bit more you

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.140 
and you can add a little bit more you
know<00:02:40.530> depending<00:02:40.890> on<00:02:41.040> where<00:02:41.189> you<00:02:41.310> need<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.519> but

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
know depending on where you need it but

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.809 
know depending on where you need it but
like<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.989> said<00:02:43.049> she<00:02:43.349> doesn't<00:02:43.650> need<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:44.010> all<00:02:44.189> over

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
like I said she doesn't need it all over

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.000 
like I said she doesn't need it all over
the<00:02:44.939> face<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.629> put<00:02:45.689> it<00:02:45.959> where<00:02:46.799> she

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
the face so I just put it where she

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.130 
the face so I just put it where she
needed<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.549> foundation<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.299> her<00:02:48.540> skin<00:02:48.780> still

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
needed the foundation and her skin still

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.159 
needed the foundation and her skin still
looks<00:02:49.170> natural<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.890> glowy
