nightmare the bolt head froze to the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.319 
nightmare the bolt head froze to the
inside<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.259> had<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.469> pull<00:01:19.710> just

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
inside of that and I had to pull just

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:27.440 
inside of that and I had to pull just
bracket<00:01:21.329> off<00:01:21.479> let<00:01:21.810> me<00:01:21.840> show<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:25.969> this<00:01:26.969> bracket

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
bracket off let me show you this bracket

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.060 
bracket off let me show you this bracket
here<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.780> retains<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:29.659> that<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.020> had<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
here that retains it on that I had to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.620 
here that retains it on that I had to
pull<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.460> off<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.939> could<00:01:33.119> take<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.450> over

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
pull it off so I could take it over

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.200 
pull it off so I could take it over
there<00:01:33.899> drive<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.070> bolt<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:35.520> by<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.030> I'd

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
there drive the bolt out by then I'd

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
there drive the bolt out by then I'd
already<00:01:36.390> destroyed<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> bolt<00:01:37.140> practically

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
already destroyed the bolt practically

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.190 
already destroyed the bolt practically
so<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> had<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.549> put<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> new<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.149> it<00:01:39.329> luckily

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
