already written an article on it and for
me<00:00:48.100> I<00:00:48.130> think<00:00:48.310> the<00:00:48.580> most<00:00:48.730> important<00:00:49.180> thing<00:00:49.330> is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
me I think the most important thing is

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.900 
me I think the most important thing is
really<00:00:49.720> just<00:00:49.840> you<00:00:50.800> know<00:00:50.920> how<00:00:51.280> good<00:00:51.670> the

really just you know how good the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.420 
really just you know how good the
graphics<00:00:52.330> graphics<00:00:52.840> look<00:00:53.320> can<00:00:54.010> you<00:00:54.160> get<00:00:54.310> up

graphics graphics look can you get up
and<00:00:54.610> down<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.730> course<00:00:55.090> using<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.780> move<00:00:55.990> and<00:00:56.380> the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
and down a course using the move and the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.850 
and down a course using the move and the
answer<00:00:56.980> is<00:00:57.130> yes<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.730> graphics<00:00:58.210> are<00:00:58.420> fantastic

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860

I<00:01:00.070> can't<00:01:00.700> wait<00:01:00.880> personally<00:01:01.510> to<00:01:01.720> get<00:01:01.810> the<00:01:01.960> full

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
I can't wait personally to get the full

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.319 
I can't wait personally to get the full
game<00:01:02.380> because<00:01:02.800> I<00:01:03.100> don't<00:01:03.880> think<00:01:04.059> many<00:01:04.239> people

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
game because I don't think many people

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.310 
game because I don't think many people
argue<00:01:05.079> with<00:01:05.290> me<00:01:05.470> this<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.700> Tiger<00:01:07.030> Woods

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
argue with me this the Tiger Woods

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.840 
argue with me this the Tiger Woods
series<00:01:08.320> by<00:01:08.980> EA<00:01:09.190> is<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.330> best<00:01:10.890> golf<00:01:11.890> series

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
series by EA is the best golf series

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.970 
series by EA is the best golf series
pretty<00:01:13.810> much<00:01:13.960> on<00:01:14.080> any<00:01:14.260> system

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
pretty much on any system

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.430 
pretty much on any system
it<00:01:15.310> certainly<00:01:15.670> is<00:01:15.820> better<00:01:15.940> than<00:01:16.240> John<00:01:17.020> Daly

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
it certainly is better than John Daly

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.290 
it certainly is better than John Daly
although<00:01:18.130> John<00:01:18.400> Daly<00:01:18.640> if<00:01:18.820> you<00:01:18.909> want<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.120> save<00:01:19.270> a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
although John Daly if you want to save a

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.240 
although John Daly if you want to save a
few<00:01:19.540> bucks<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:20.110> you<00:01:20.380> know<00:01:20.500> our<00:01:20.620> concern<00:01:21.040> would

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
few bucks and you know our concern would

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.610 
few bucks and you know our concern would
have<00:01:21.400> an<00:01:21.550> absolute<00:01:21.790> best<00:01:22.420> that's<00:01:23.110> certainly<00:01:23.530> a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
have an absolute best that's certainly a

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.020 
have an absolute best that's certainly a
viable<00:01:23.920> option<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.550> don't<00:01:24.700> know<00:01:24.790> if<00:01:24.880> they'll

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
viable option I don't know if they'll

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.210 
viable option I don't know if they'll
make<00:01:25.060> another<00:01:25.450> game<00:01:25.690> this<00:01:25.840> year

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
make another game this year

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.160 
make another game this year
so<00:01:27.270> first<00:01:28.270> shot<00:01:28.510> you<00:01:28.630> can<00:01:28.780> see<00:01:28.990> I've

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
so first shot you can see I've

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.190 
so first shot you can see I've
definitely<00:01:29.350> kind<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.800> a<00:01:29.830> push<00:01:30.460> fade<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.049> was

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
definitely kind of a push fade but I was

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.750 
definitely kind of a push fade but I was
able<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.530> safely<00:01:32.890> hit<00:01:33.100> out<00:01:33.250> which<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.580> should

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
able to safely hit out which you should

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.760 
able to safely hit out which you should
do<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:33.940> real<00:01:34.120> golf<00:01:34.360> as<00:01:34.540> well<00:01:34.720> right<00:01:35.350> here<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.560> hit

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
do in real golf as well right here I hit

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.120 
do in real golf as well right here I hit
the<00:01:35.830> trigger<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.340> down<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:38.590> gives<00:01:38.950> you

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
the trigger and down and it gives you

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.070 
the trigger and down and it gives you
kind<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.850> perspective<00:01:40.090> on<00:01:40.570> where<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.900> ball

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
kind of a perspective on where the ball

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.890 
kind of a perspective on where the ball
is<00:01:41.190> with<00:01:42.190> respect<00:01:42.370> to<00:01:42.729> your<00:01:43.120> feet<00:01:43.390> above<00:01:43.720> your

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
feet below your feet and if you play a

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.370 
feet below your feet and if you play a
real<00:01:46.479> golf<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.900> know<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.200> has<00:01:47.350> a

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
real golf you know that has a

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.969 
real golf you know that has a
significant<00:01:48.190> impact<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:50.080> here<00:01:50.229> we<00:01:50.380> go<00:01:50.590> little

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
significant impact so here we go little

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.149 
significant impact so here we go little

of custom custom aiming this is

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.530 
of custom custom aiming this is

the<00:04:57.600> past<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.380> this<00:04:58.530> shot<00:04:58.800> definitely<00:04:59.190> turned

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
the past and this shot definitely turned

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.190 
the past and this shot definitely turned

out very well the nice thing about when

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.530 
out very well the nice thing about when
you<00:05:01.320> do<00:05:01.530> use<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.040> move<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:03.090> when<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.390> hit<00:05:03.480> a

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540

nice<00:05:03.750> shot<00:05:03.840> like<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.590> feels<00:05:04.830> better<00:05:05.100> than<00:05:05.490> if

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
nice shot like it feels better than if

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.130

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
to push you over the edge

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.890 
to push you over the edge

six<00:06:02.130> axis<00:06:02.520> is<00:06:02.730> plug<00:06:03.180> it<00:06:03.300> in<00:06:03.590> so<00:06:04.590> it<00:06:04.710> doesn't

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
six axis is plug it in so it doesn't

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.959 
six axis is plug it in so it doesn't
turn<00:06:05.100> off

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969
