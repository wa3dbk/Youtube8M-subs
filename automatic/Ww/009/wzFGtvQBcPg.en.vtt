00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.620

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.580
 hello very good everyone good today 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.530
 I bring the third chapter of during 105 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.970
 the two previous ones are the works 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.340
 Christians 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.789
 we're not going to go up here to the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.789
 Montana 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.969
 well we have arrived we are up 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.390
 let's see what we find here 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.760
 these mountains and climbing them with cars 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.070
 normal is a little shit is 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.060
 checked and the doll over either 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.890
 up sometimes it does not look good just which one or 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.150
 so they go up watching the SUVs 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.290
 but good depends on the car you get 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.290
 here 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.830
 now we are up 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:35.780
 and guarantees for the bike out there to see if 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.780
 I found a way in iraq and afghanistan 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.600
 As they are mountaineers I think they are 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.550
 let's throw it 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.410
 follow here below 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.500
 I'm going to fuck 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.300
 it goes rolling down where is the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.610
 another one we are java 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.690
 ace 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.690
 but others to husband 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.070
 one ear 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.390
 to find it 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.260
 go that does not go up 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.260
 lightning gives me 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.290
 Well first let's go on a bike then 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.560
 climb again I'll cut it and clear up 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.120
 again and I will bring you on a parachute 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.319
 so you can see the parachute jump 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.439
 as well 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.019
 but I'm delighted with tÃ©lam on a motorbike I do not know 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:43.420
 what they are apparently very bad 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.569
 I'm no longer talking about what 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.980
 surely they kill me quickly 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.980
 sometimes find a lawful path 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.530
 or 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.480
 how will you say these 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.480
 like the one I have 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.489
 how it jumps 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.470
 I'm taking too long austria that I 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.470
 I passed it in Argentine lands hua 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:27.510
 I know that at this age 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:31.210
 it helps me adjust to bursting my face 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.210
 Frank blood to the air facts 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.950
 for the doll is pissed with me a 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.220
 look that they have thrown me reminds me of 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.560
 father this character did not load it the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.560
 Host is remembered from an air 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.960
 efe 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.600
 you must have put the helmet but 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:55.360
 well let's die anyway we're going to 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.360
 die we are going to die it will be just down 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.819
 no longer 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.450
 as to today 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.400
 like this you have to prove it when 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.800
 set your standards, you have not done it yet 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.300
 what you have is going to do it 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.300
 as the march live 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.780
 As we had everywhere, it is not 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.070
 number does not think he has keep ten 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.760
 restaurants 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.760
 dissipating 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:36.979
 so here you go high designs to 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:39.550
 ostia fuck is still tough esther 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.550
 like rambo 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.960
 well we are already up 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:58.720
 and now I do not leave parachute names 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.610
 we're going to throw in the test once 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.770
 I do it I've never done it yet 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.770
 I felt like we are going to throw ourselves 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.860
 yes 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.849
 but well I've already taught you everything 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.620
 you can do the mountain basically 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.900
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.490
 and well we will continue to see more 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.889
 chapters 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.220
 and not cousin's video bed until the 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.220
 next 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:08.909
 sometimes it's good
