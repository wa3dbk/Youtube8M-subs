00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
nice facial structure here and I hate to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.289 
nice facial structure here and I hate to
say<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.280> Taylor<00:01:08.490> Lautner<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.090> does

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
say it but Taylor Lautner really does

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.719 
say it but Taylor Lautner really does
have<00:01:09.810> almost<00:01:10.140> generic<00:01:10.650> features<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.310> those

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
have almost generic features and those

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.060 
have almost generic features and those
are<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> hardest<00:01:12.299> Sims<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.840> make<00:01:13.020> some<00:01:13.920> one

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
are the hardest Sims to make some one

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.130 
are the hardest Sims to make some one
most<00:01:14.520> recently<00:01:14.670> request<00:01:15.270> making<00:01:15.600> Nicki<00:01:15.780> Minaj

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
most recently request making Nicki Minaj

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.460 
most recently request making Nicki Minaj
and<00:01:16.530> even<00:01:16.950> though<00:01:17.070> she<00:01:17.250> has<00:01:17.580> very<00:01:18.470> different

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and even though she has very different

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.620 
and even though she has very different
style<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.610> believe<00:01:20.939> it'll<00:01:21.090> almost<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.540> easier

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
style I believe it'll almost be easier

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.660 
style I believe it'll almost be easier
than<00:01:22.259> creating<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.830> sim<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.189> Taylor<00:01:23.490> Lautner

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
than creating a sim like Taylor Lautner

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.819 
than creating a sim like Taylor Lautner
because<00:01:24.600> he<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.680> very<00:01:26.189> easy<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:27.420> look<00:01:27.990> just

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
because he is very easy to look just

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.289 
because he is very easy to look just
like<00:01:28.950> everyone<00:01:29.400> else<00:01:29.579> whereas<00:01:29.880> Nicki<00:01:30.060> Minaj

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
like everyone else whereas Nicki Minaj

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.649 
like everyone else whereas Nicki Minaj
has<00:01:30.509> very<00:01:30.780> defined<00:01:31.740> features<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.479> be

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
