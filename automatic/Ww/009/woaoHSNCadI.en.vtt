00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:03.560
 all this and one of the cheapest apartments 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.560
 phones from this dice keyboard 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.629
 and the case is very convenient 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.629
 no, it seems necessary to believe that she 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.990
 let's look for help 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.990
 bilingual keyboard 4 trouble 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.550
 in general, a new type 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.390
 the keyboard is just like the older ones 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.339
 models 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.859
 in the keyboard part this is a parade 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:31.899
 Suffered 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.159
 plastic enough doctors covers up 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:34.980
 screen 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.300
 for the screen in general improvement 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.620
 nothing holy 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 but the device deserve attention 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.800
 even the fact that here 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 metal fine 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.550
 here she is 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.980
 this is metal 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.280
 on competing devices for example in 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.130
 chat from samsung 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.110
 corporation 30 to 22 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.240
 clear metal board 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.130
 so look ahead 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.800
 easy to forget still being built enough 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.940
 heavy 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.160
 securely fastened 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
 memory card slots 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.770
 no request for connector 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.799
 so what that is more reliable 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.690
 two megapixel camera definitely 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.840
 not autofocus but also in general quality 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.880
 so-so 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.860
 that me he 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.330
 upset this lack of key 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.000
 volume control 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.450
 for example there 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.860
 speaking from the shelves organization 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.050
 here 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.650
 clutch bag 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.830
 active phone book a 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.250
 then rub 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.640
 your mistake is silver 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.350
 little thing 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.350
 But there are message keys 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.210
 but I want to close 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.690
 pskovich message 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.690
 whatever 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800
 in the press like this 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.879
 often the publication refers to his 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:14.430
 a place 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.499
 Tula are built in as you need 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.279
 that is, you can choose 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.279
 this hand was about 500 thousand 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.349
 here with it is not only those who open budget 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.849
 need to build other types of thousand 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.879
 that is, you can choose 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.949
 practically 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.949
 any display option 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.779
 but at the same time 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.779
 as you understand 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.579
 it looks not 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.289
 is always 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.609
 OK 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.569
 but 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.040
 how to treat 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.040
 such mode 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.249
 when will be just an ordinary tap 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.249
 as they say someone likes 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.319
 This device is pleasant because 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.319
 on the menu 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.639
 all clear 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.879
 habitual 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.689
 most models here 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.879
 we can see 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.659
 organizer for example 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.659
 you need to make ap contacts 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.349
 but 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.869
 aa 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.889
 all the usual on the phone 8 rubles 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.789
 mail client 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:49.029
 our case here has its favorites 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.439
 it's in cyprus 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.260
 Here in the car wash here I started a few 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
 postal service cheek 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.289
 Medvedev interview points follow from 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.439
 me 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.840
 let's get a look 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.840
 what's going on here 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.919
 but unfortunately again 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.649
 the screen of life looks better than he 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:14.979
 get dreams here look kulbid and 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:16.499
 download 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.049
 he supposed to be some sort of general 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.389
 does not look like five thousand rubles 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.769
 expect much not worth beacons not 

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:27.139
 as bad as he looks 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.780
 I will continue to rush 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.620
 for some reason 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.210
 messages 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.210
 I do not know why this is happening 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.189
 these will see the law 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.189
 at all 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
 maybe there would be a problem with 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.289
 rat meant km h 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.199
 but already needed 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.260
 not 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.039
 generally fairly simple customers 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.199
 take a word 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.469
 photos can be viewed using 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:07.529
 timeline 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:10.529
 them 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.949
 for debt repayment 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.559
 have your own albums and say we can 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.369
 add 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.219
 surely opened so on 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:26.999
 in Ukraine 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:29.220
 you can even 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.699
 edit that graphics 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.699
 guys will go 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.960
 but the messages are all clear the community is 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.490
 twitter and facebook 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:06.069
 we will not be a doctor 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:07.169
 ap 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:08.889
 not only begins

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.050
 usually toys 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.930
 with 

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:25.110
 by the way 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.219
 everything 

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:31.439
 in xx 

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:33.169
 generally 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:36.139
 for 5 thousand rubles 

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.909
 this is a very good machine 

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:41.270
 new hall cost was not 

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.310
 noise 133 has a slightly small number 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.469
 competitors 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:47.599
 the model has frankly like
