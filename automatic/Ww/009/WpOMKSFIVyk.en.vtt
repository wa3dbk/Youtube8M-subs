you an overview of my tower you can see
I<00:00:13.049> have<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.259> cucumber<00:00:13.620> plant<00:00:14.070> coming<00:00:15.059> out<00:00:15.210> and

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
I have a cucumber plant coming out and

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.439 
I have a cucumber plant coming out and
it's<00:00:15.990> caged<00:00:16.350> or<00:00:17.100> it's<00:00:17.250> actually<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.210> wire

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
it's caged or it's actually on wire

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.689 
it's caged or it's actually on wire
cages<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.289> put<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.619> ground<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.189> I

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
cages that I put in the ground and I

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.939 
cages that I put in the ground and I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.089 
have yellow squash and I have tomatoes
so<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.300> tower<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.930> cage<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.470> very<00:00:25.710> useful

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
so on this tower a cage is very useful

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.630 
so on this tower a cage is very useful
and<00:00:26.279> I'll<00:00:26.580> show<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.789> how<00:00:27.029> first<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.019> all<00:00:28.140> you

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
and I'll show you how first of all you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.160 
and I'll show you how first of all you
want<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.789> make<00:00:29.970> sure<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.330> your<00:00:30.449> plants<00:00:30.929> I'll

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
want to make sure that your plants I'll

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.990 
want to make sure that your plants I'll
have<00:00:31.740> plenty<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.070> room<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.520> grow<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.730> that

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
have plenty of room to grow and that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.150 
have plenty of room to grow and that
means<00:00:33.210> pruning<00:00:33.630> some<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.110> leaves<00:00:34.860> and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
means pruning some of the leaves and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.560 
means pruning some of the leaves and
making<00:00:35.460> sure<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> plants<00:00:36.239> are<00:00:36.300> kind<00:00:36.510> of

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
making sure that the plants are kind of

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.860 
making sure that the plants are kind of
separated<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> did<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.840> made<00:00:39.840> sure

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
separated so what I did is I made sure

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.170 
separated so what I did is I made sure
that<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.290> tomato<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.950> resting<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.820> top<00:00:41.850> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
that this tomato is resting on top of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.869 
that this tomato is resting on top of
the<00:00:42.239> cage<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.649> grows<00:00:43.770> out<00:00:44.040> I'll<00:00:44.550> thread

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the cage and as it grows out I'll thread

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.869 
the cage and as it grows out I'll thread
it<00:00:45.000> onto<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.360> cage<00:00:45.719> outside<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> tower<00:00:47.250> but

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
it onto a cage outside of the tower but

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.389 
it onto a cage outside of the tower but
that<00:00:48.059> way<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.360> not<00:00:49.079> growing<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:49.860> into<00:00:50.280> my

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
that way it's not growing right into my

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.939 
that way it's not growing right into my
yellow<00:00:50.610> squash<00:00:50.969> my<00:00:51.809> yellow<00:00:52.079> squash<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.739> when

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
yellow squash my yellow squash at when

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.709 
yellow squash my yellow squash at when
the<00:00:53.039> leaves<00:00:53.250> pop<00:00:53.520> out<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:54.000> actually<00:00:54.239> tucking

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the leaves pop out I'm actually tucking

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.560 
the leaves pop out I'm actually tucking
them<00:00:54.870> under<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:56.190> cage<00:00:56.460> here<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> leaves

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
them under the cage here so the leaves

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
them under the cage here so the leaves
all<00:00:57.809> stay<00:00:58.050> contained<00:00:58.469> between<00:00:58.739> these<00:00:59.100> two

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
all stay contained between these two

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.060 
all stay contained between these two
bars<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.940> I'm<00:01:00.899> also<00:01:01.079> cutting<00:01:01.440> off<00:01:01.620> any<00:01:01.800> extra

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
bars and I'm also cutting off any extra

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.860 
bars and I'm also cutting off any extra
leaves<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.550> there's<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.969> cut<00:01:03.300> off<00:01:03.390> an<00:01:03.539> extra

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
leaves like there's I cut off an extra

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
leaves like there's I cut off an extra
least<00:01:04.049> there<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.250> getting<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> way

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
least there that was getting in the way

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.920 
least there that was getting in the way

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
between the pot and the edge of the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.730 
between the pot and the edge of the
tower<00:01:20.070> i<00:01:20.460> want<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.939> keep<00:01:21.060> trims<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.409> it

tower i want to keep trims so that it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.560 
tower i want to keep trims so that it
doesn't<00:01:22.950> turn<00:01:23.310> into<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.549> jungle<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
doesn't turn into a jungle in here and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.359 
him this way when the Sun comes out
he'll<00:01:36.630> his<00:01:37.049> leaves<00:01:37.320> will<00:01:37.530> flip<00:01:37.829> back<00:01:37.979> over<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
he'll his leaves will flip back over to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.830 
he'll his leaves will flip back over to
reach<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.729> Sun<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.060> he'll<00:01:39.299> grow<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.659> fine

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
reach the Sun and he'll grow just fine

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.600 
reach the Sun and he'll grow just fine
but<00:01:40.590> then<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> want<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.009> put<00:01:41.189> him<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> wire

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
but then I want to put him on a wire

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.240 
but then I want to put him on a wire
cage<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.390> also<00:01:46.250> my
