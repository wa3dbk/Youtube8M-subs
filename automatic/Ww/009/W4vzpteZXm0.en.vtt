00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
pressure monitor that is compatible with

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.140 

so<00:01:07.500> instead<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.770> having<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.160> big<00:01:08.340> control<00:01:08.730> panel

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
so instead of having a big control panel

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.580 
so instead of having a big control panel
that's<00:01:09.270> ice<00:01:09.540> cream<00:01:09.840> yeah<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.380> the

that's ice cream yeah and the
application<00:01:11.190> launch<00:01:11.460> automatically<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
application launch automatically so you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.140 
application launch automatically so you
don't<00:01:12.900> need<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.050> do<00:01:13.260> anything<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.650> credit

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
don't need to do anything just credit

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.390

to<00:01:30.780> typically<00:01:31.140> happen<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> plates<00:01:31.800> up<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to typically happen to the plates up to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.340 
to typically happen to the plates up to
a<00:01:32.250> certain<00:01:32.610> level<00:01:33.510> and<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> starts

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
a certain level and then it starts

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.980 
a certain level and then it starts
letting<00:01:34.650> go<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.250> looks<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.600> upper

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
letting go and then looks for the upper

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.090 
letting go and then looks for the upper
point<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.320> your<00:01:37.380> blood<00:01:37.560> pressure<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:37.979> then

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
point of your blood pressure and then

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.859 
point of your blood pressure and then
the<00:01:38.250> lower<00:01:38.400> part<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:39.090> yeah<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.750> know

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the lower part right yeah you know

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.230 
the lower part right yeah you know
everything<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.130> yeah<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.729> where

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
everything I do so yeah you know where

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.760 
everything I do so yeah you know where
your<00:01:42.390> blood<00:01:42.570> pressure<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.960> where<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
your blood pressure is where is it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.130 
your blood pressure is where is it
pumping<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.600> presents<00:01:45.600> right<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:47.220> why

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
pumping it presents right so that's why

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.109 
pumping it presents right so that's why
so<00:01:49.140> now<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.350> know<00:01:49.410> 122<00:01:50.100> over<00:01:50.280> 100<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.759> it's

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
so now we know 122 over 100 that it's

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.820 
so now we know 122 over 100 that it's
left<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> bet<00:01:51.660> it's<00:01:51.690> a<00:01:51.930> good<00:01:52.080> one<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.410> think<00:01:52.440> the

left to bet it's a good one I think the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.070 
left to bet it's a good one I think the
top<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.369> good<00:01:53.610> 101<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.600> good<00:01:54.810> yeah
