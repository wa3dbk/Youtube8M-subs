00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
and we print here with the discharge

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.830 
and we print here with the discharge
prints<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.680> machine<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.310> able<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.420> do<00:01:43.570> this

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
prints the machine is able to do this

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.160

terpenes<00:01:44.350> together<00:01:44.770> with<00:01:45.010> white<00:01:45.420> prints<00:01:46.420> so

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
terpenes together with white prints so

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
terpenes together with white prints so
you<00:01:47.230> can<00:01:47.440> mix<00:01:47.590> it<00:01:47.710> because<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:47.950> showed<00:01:48.130> me

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
you can mix it because you showed me

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.160 
you can mix it because you showed me
earlier<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.730> can<00:01:48.910> do<00:01:49.210> your<00:01:49.330> rip<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.840> can<00:01:49.960> say

earlier you can do your rip you can say

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.740 
earlier you can do your rip you can say

may be a little bit of under base white

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.979 
may be a little bit of under base white
would<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:00.640> then<00:03:00.760> do<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.940> highlight<00:03:01.360> on<00:03:01.569> top

would you then do a highlight on top
right<00:03:02.440> we<00:03:02.890> do<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.160> highlight<00:03:03.489> together<00:03:03.760> with

right we do the highlight together with
the<00:03:04.090> color<00:03:04.299> so<00:03:04.630> we<00:03:05.410> do<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.650> high-low<00:03:05.830> pump<00:03:06.069> I

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
the color so we do the high-low pump I

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.130 
the color so we do the high-low pump I
get<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.340> brighter<00:03:06.580> print<00:03:06.940> right<00:03:07.269> right<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.019> of

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
get a brighter print right right and of

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.420 
get a brighter print right right and of
course<00:03:08.319> with<00:03:08.530> discharge<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.069> wouldn't<00:03:09.310> see

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
course with discharge you wouldn't see

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.949 
course with discharge you wouldn't see
the<00:03:09.549> final<00:03:09.850> print<00:03:10.060> looking<00:03:10.390> correct<00:03:10.720> until

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959

going<00:04:22.240> i<00:04:22.419> mean<00:04:22.539> the<00:04:22.630> breeze<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:23.020> me<00:04:23.139> is<00:04:23.260> that

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
going i mean the breeze to me is that

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.710 
going i mean the breeze to me is that
nice<00:04:23.590> for<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.100> entry<00:04:24.580> guy<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:25.479> breeze<00:04:25.690> is

nice for the entry guy the breeze is

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.110 
nice for the entry guy the breeze is
going<00:04:26.020> very<00:04:26.200> well<00:04:26.320> it's<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:27.610> entry-level

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
going very well it's the entry-level

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.140 
going very well it's the entry-level
machine<00:04:29.070> little<00:04:30.070> bit<00:04:30.220> expensive<00:04:30.610> than<00:04:31.000> what

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
machine little bit expensive than what

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.420 
machine little bit expensive than what
we<00:04:31.270> see<00:04:31.450> here<00:04:31.599> in<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.810> market<00:04:32.169> but<00:04:33.070> it's<00:04:33.250> what

sixty thousand okay compared to like the

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.680 
sixty thousand okay compared to like the
Avalanche<00:04:39.250> which<00:04:39.490> will<00:04:39.670> do<00:04:39.790> dual<00:04:40.090> shirts<00:04:40.510> I

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
Avalanche which will do dual shirts I

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.170 
Avalanche which will do dual shirts I
mean<00:04:40.840> what<00:04:40.960> does<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.200> Avalanche<00:04:41.670> 70<00:04:42.670> how<00:04:43.060> much

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
mean what does the Avalanche 70 how much

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.690 
mean what does the Avalanche 70 how much
to<00:04:43.480> 70<00:04:43.990> 70<00:04:44.470> okay<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.220> will<00:04:45.310> simultaneously

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
to 70 70 okay and it will simultaneously

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.180 
to 70 70 okay and it will simultaneously
print<00:04:46.390> all<00:04:46.540> right<00:04:46.720> someone<00:04:47.590> Tennessee<00:04:47.950> brain

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
simultaneously print the white and the

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.550 
simultaneously print the white and the
colors<00:04:50.320> and<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:51.790> freeze<00:04:52.570> on<00:04:52.720> on<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.260> mushy<00:04:53.500> it

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
colors and a freeze on on the mushy it

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.930 
colors and a freeze on on the mushy it
on<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.920> machine<00:04:54.040> yeah<00:04:54.430> that's<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.790> big

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
on the machine yeah that's a big

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.420 
on the machine yeah that's a big
advantage<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.510> that's<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:56.530> main<00:04:56.770> reason<00:04:56.800> why

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
advantage and that's the main reason why

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.550 
advantage and that's the main reason why
the<00:04:57.490> breeze<00:04:57.940> is<00:04:58.210> more<00:04:58.480> expensive<00:04:58.690> than<00:04:59.290> the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
the breeze is more expensive than the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.650 
the breeze is more expensive than the
other<00:04:59.860> machines<00:05:00.340> first<00:05:00.640> of<00:05:00.760> all<00:05:00.910> we<00:05:01.030> use<00:05:01.150> the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
other machines first of all we use the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.180 
other machines first of all we use the
same<00:05:01.870> printers<00:05:02.290> that<00:05:02.440> we<00:05:02.590> use<00:05:02.710> for<00:05:02.740> all<00:05:03.070> the

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
same printers that we use for all the

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.950 
same printers that we use for all the
other<00:05:03.310> machines<00:05:03.700> right<00:05:04.000> which<00:05:04.360> is<00:05:04.390> spectra

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
other machines right which is spectra

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.070 
other machines right which is spectra
industrial<00:05:05.590> printed<00:05:05.950> but<00:05:06.580> we<00:05:07.150> insist<00:05:07.330> on<00:05:07.810> that

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
industrial printed but we insist on that

our chemistry which is the pretreatment

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
inside the machine and printing the wet

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.890 
inside the machine and printing the wet
on<00:05:15.010> wet<00:05:15.040> and<00:05:15.430> we<00:05:16.030> have<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.360> same<00:05:16.570> for<00:05:16.780> the

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
on wet and we have the same for the

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.090 
on wet and we have the same for the
breeze<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.110> that's<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.590> reason<00:05:17.710> why<00:05:17.920> the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
breeze and that's the reason why the

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.220 
breeze and that's the reason why the
breeze<00:05:18.370> is<00:05:18.520> a<00:05:18.550> little<00:05:18.850> bit<00:05:18.970> expensive<00:05:19.390> but<00:05:19.810> the

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
breeze is a little bit expensive but the

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.690 
breeze is a little bit expensive but the
quality<00:05:20.470> there<00:05:20.740> would<00:05:20.860> be<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:21.070> same<00:05:21.310> on<00:05:21.340> on

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
quality there would be the same on on

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.310 
quality there would be the same on on
any<00:05:22.180> of<00:05:22.300> your<00:05:22.420> machines<00:05:22.750> will<00:05:22.960> be<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.140> same

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
any of your machines will be the same

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.140 
any of your machines will be the same
kind<00:05:23.620> of<00:05:23.680> it's<00:05:24.100> the<00:05:24.250> same<00:05:24.460> inks<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:24.970> same

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
kind of it's the same inks the same

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.210 
kind of it's the same inks the same
printed<00:05:25.630> you<00:05:26.260> couldn't<00:05:26.590> you<00:05:26.650> discharge<00:05:27.100> on

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
printed you couldn't you discharge on

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.440 
printed you couldn't you discharge on
the<00:05:27.310> breeze<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:27.760> probably<00:05:28.060> cuz<00:05:28.210> you<00:05:28.270> have<00:05:28.360> me

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
the breeze so probably cuz you have me

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.660 
the breeze so probably cuz you have me
on<00:05:28.540> their<00:05:28.570> print<00:05:28.870> heads<00:05:29.050> right<00:05:29.590> exactly<00:05:30.280> we

on their print heads right exactly we

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.540 
on their print heads right exactly we
have<00:05:30.850> two<00:05:31.030> spots<00:05:31.390> available<00:05:32.140> for<00:05:32.740> a<00:05:33.040> discharge

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
have two spots available for a discharge

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.180 
have two spots available for a discharge
on<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.060> breeze<00:05:34.290> it's<00:05:35.290> something<00:05:35.620> that<00:05:36.010> it's

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
on the breeze it's something that it's

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.670 
on the breeze it's something that it's
doable<00:05:36.580> but<00:05:37.450> it's<00:05:37.660> not<00:05:37.840> in<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.110> pipeline<00:05:38.320> at

doable but it's not in the pipeline at
the<00:05:38.770> moment<00:05:39.220> right<00:05:39.550> and<00:05:39.850> there<00:05:40.150> are<00:05:40.210> other

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
the moment right and there are other
