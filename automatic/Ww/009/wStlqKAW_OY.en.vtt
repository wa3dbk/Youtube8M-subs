00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:15.649
 Let's talk a little about global environmental issues 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.509
 I think, but it is said to be a global environmental problem 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.869
 I love the fans better than anyone else in the world 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.659
 Because I know 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:29.599
 Ordinary people are a little different from u-19 environmental problem though 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.210
 Also from the same day 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.000
 al macro scale side from Telemacro Tennum Tada 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.640
 In terms of perspective, how to think about global environmental problems 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.290
 I'm going to talk like this 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.900
 Well, I will talk to you in February in the first half of the first half 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.250
 First of all 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.390
 Yes, how the global environment has changed and now 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.730
 Do you have reached 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.240
 Briefly introduce what you say 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.170
 In the present global environmental problems, especially things like global warming issues 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.560
 Talk related to what it is 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.250
 I think high school will do 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.870
 Eva's pre-selected horse of the global environment This is the history of the earth 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.930
 The global environment has changed on a scale of around 4.6 billion years 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.780
 Heel 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.390
 It means that 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.180
 My story of Ekko 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.570
 what is hq 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.610
 Like this 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.390
 The story of the paradox for Thailand in 2 places 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.660
 I think I did 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.190
 It is in the system 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:54.020
 Well, 19 is actually shown to what concrete example as that system 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.870
 It's about the sun 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.210
 There was no resistance in the past in Japan 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.280
 Yes I talked about this 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.350
 But in fact the earth goes back from the present to the past 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.869
 I couldn't do anything Kakogawa 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.860
 To the proposal agent 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.069
 Because it is north 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.580
 The real global environment has changed at the same time 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.249
 Considering what to say 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.389
 The song is actually the same amount of paradox 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.149
 The story is different from Aramachi 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.289
 Yes i got it 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:27.869
 Mobile phone backlight 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:32.369
 Although the correspondence is dark, what kind of state was the hand 19 born at first 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:34.379
 From a place like 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.289
 You must think of a hole. 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:42.499
 The fact is that it was very hot when 19 was born 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.389
 I think in the wind 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.469
 That's because there were people 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.419
 It's physically easy, you can do the earth 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.849
 You can compare vaio with movie theater 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.939
 The Earth was made apart 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.909
 Something like an icicle 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.489
 The example around the sun round and round example 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.690
 It's like this kind of black of Nes's fall apart 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.029
 The state is 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.879
 Well discovered that stone that can be said that Samsung is waiting 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.869
 It is thrown when it becomes this earth that is good with state 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:16.659
 Nesta 31 energy or something like gravity energy 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.109
 Calculate and compare 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.990
 Oh mark with this falling apart 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.429
 There is also Mario and the energy at the time of use is high 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:28.389
 It is not too low that it has been in the market since it became 9 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.159
 is 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.049
 It is this 3 that saying that the earth can do it 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.319
 Energy equivalent to 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.330
 It means that it will be released when the earth is made 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.270
 Speaking of example, the condition where water is accumulated in the hydroelectric dam 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.019
 I can do the earth 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.829
 Emise is a detained mini-state balloon 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:48.530
 Was done 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.480
 Greatly exceeded 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.819
 That's equivalent to saying that 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.999
 Oh, I would like to see it energetically. 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:03:59.329
 Order 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.169
 But from now on you have very little meaning 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:03.400
 Though 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.880
 For example, if all that 195 energy is lost with that energy 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.599
 If it will be 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.999
 If you 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:14.399
 It will be about the temperature of the exponential band if it is totally hit 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:16.359
 Maruo is difficult 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.380
 In fact most of its energy is released on the ground 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:21.319
 To be 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.419
 Copy in space 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.389
 Energy is visible 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.990
 It's a body, so it's almost impossible 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.330
 It is actually how long the station will remain 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.960
 When the feelings of the earth are actually being treated 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.240
 Not important 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.309
 Well that kind of calculation 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:43.579
 I used to pay around 3886 years old 

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:44.849
 It is called 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.180
 In a journal 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.729
 It has been raised by the maker and it is an alternative 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.970
 Well about 10% would be overheat 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:56.960
 f 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.110
 If the band is about 3 bands treble 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.090
 I wish I could have made the earth 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.309
 It is praised and thousands of degrees 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:09.229
 It's a few thousand degrees, so the balloon will fly in the air 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:10.370
 Right 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.279
 Yes, two Toki 19 were born 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.449
 Twisted parliament with the Diet 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.530
 It is the magma that is dissolved in rocks etc. 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.730
 It is said that the earth is finished with the gummy of magma 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.279
 It is a primitive earth 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.729
 I said a hole 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.910
 At that time 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.140
 Is about 10% of the heat energy honored in the south? 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.400
 Say 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.979
 When you can Odakyu 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.849
 Stones come to me 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.319
 It's because you're pre-collision When you're colliding 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.150
 Even if eco say that it is a collision 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.379
 Well there are at least 20 km and money 30 km there is a second speed 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.580
 Because it collides at 29-39 seconds per second 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.969
圓 圓 か 瞬間 圓 圓

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.569
 Everyone has evaporated 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.879
 When you leave it on 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.719
 Staying high in the fuss, keep on tracking 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.509
 With the one who disappears and becomes the answer 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.509
 A country will happen again 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.550
 Like a bus when tax duties are imposed and the earth is built 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.740
 There is something left over, I would like to dispatch true true 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.939
 When we calculate the western part of Yamahara city 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.819
 If there are a lot of things like previous steam 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:31.009
 Water vapor seems to have become a big money like most 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:33.300
 Then, this water vapor is actually right 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.460
 Even on the ground, for example, while the heat is released, the heat is 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.039
 I will run away to space 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:44.090
 I have something called the greenhouse effect. 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:44.999
 Is the same 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:47.839
 Just because there is a large amount of water vapor already 

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:50.449
 That that greenhouse effect is big but 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:55.180
 Oh this was a high showing of the water vapor greenhouse effect 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.059
 Is not enough to say that the light of the sun came in 

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:00.439
 Well I call it a moisturizing effect 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.539
 When discussing this, how long will it be open on the ground? 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:05.029
 Not 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:07.969
 It looks like it's worn unhappy, so you can say it's assault 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.300
 May be 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.949
 Perm It is about 10% to calculate such a thing neatly 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:14.869
 you know 

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:18.639
 By that means the state when the earth was born is 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.649
 I clarified how it was 

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:25.509
 Primitive Earth is a new kind of water vapor 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:26.369
 was there 

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:29.619
 Such a state when the arrangement table is carried out in the sea of ​​magma 

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:31.349
 Did you start from 

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:32.180
 It is said that
