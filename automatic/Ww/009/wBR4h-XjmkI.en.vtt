00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
front you here I have a rotary vise that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.020 
front you here I have a rotary vise that
spins<00:00:37.290> around<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.980> axis<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.489> there<00:00:38.850> are

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
spins around this axis but there are

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.900 
spins around this axis but there are
some<00:00:39.270> simpler<00:00:39.629> vices<00:00:40.050> there<00:00:40.610> stationary<00:00:41.610> or

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
some simpler vices there stationary or

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.990 
some simpler vices there stationary or
set<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.540> place<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.020> those<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.320> fine<00:00:43.620> for

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
set in place and those are fine for

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.779 
set in place and those are fine for
beginning<00:00:45.000> flight<00:00:45.390> tires<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:47.520> price

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
beginning flight tires and the price
