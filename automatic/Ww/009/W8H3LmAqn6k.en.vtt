00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.680
 a word that we did not have barcelona 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.650
 hcr announced 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.650
 he presented two 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:14.419
 asensi table and blood cognacs 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.710
 as it is mickaël marek 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.630
 marketing 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.630
 jobs buys on France 2 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.169
 he is then to follow the 7 inch tablet 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.349
 so it's a tablet that comes in two versions 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.349
 clara sanchez the passerby 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 the fruit of this news 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.390
 w &amp; s 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.390
 then the version 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.790
 who will come out on the market his insurance 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.730
 the club associated with seeing at the monoprix space 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.730
 that's exactly what I managed to manage 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.930
 everything starts already at the back of the accident 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.150
 by the way the young back 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.080
 I am pretty friendly 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.380
 meet to talk the party 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.120
 what is it? 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.410
 the reaction of a 5-megapixel sensor equipped with an ashdod port 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.350
 it is important also 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.930
 he fires his aggressor 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.450
 in facade for videoconferencing which is here 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 senegal alone 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.490
 we have shown that the Picardy 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.610
 at the level of connectivity and to do what we can see here is a button 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.090
 you lost blockade and the rotation of the screen 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.750
 so that allows for example 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.750
 his book was happy 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.730
 for example 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.160
 monks in the regime of vichy station 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
 work up to 32 gigatons in total 40 gb of storage 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.630
 so here it is 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.180
 for the sim card 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.129
 the hassan version 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.159
 attention in the pen 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.159
 for the relief officer 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:25.849
 what's the point for all 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.869
 would give the blackhawks 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:31.289
 an external hard drive exactly the disagreement country on this site 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.549
 so to have a docking station that's it 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.549
 it's on the table tonight 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.899
 like this is not sure to see 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:43.369
 the station document that can arrive from rest and it is with the recharge at the same time 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.829
 time 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.349
 we are also waiting to take place 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.829
 the accessory of the whole city 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.179
 ok he urged 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.309
 this incident 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:52.849
 in the av connector 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.209
 but who is nevertheless 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.229
 finally the important thing is that not everyone has 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:58.909
 exactly purse on this type of 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.149
 at the UN resolution level 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.289
 these offenses 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.549
 the public prosecutor is interested as long as the resolution procedures are 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.549
 before making his calls to Damascus 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.389
 energy companies a processor in 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.679
 on this machine 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:16.979
 250 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.649
 my old haven 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:20.899
 the actor jacques deschênes 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.899
 this chorus and each is clocked at 1 gigahertz 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:31.120
 we will see the badly embedded part 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.210
 so let's talk about whether the number of unemployed has, for example, 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.379
 and to name a few examples its facades com 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.739
 yet m 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.739
 that's how we approach this type of resolution 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.889
 philippe has well and well beautiful case of course capacitive 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.259
 it's now 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:58.259
 but an instant necessity 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.919
 going through the gospel are still things that I have left 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.149
 if not a good tablet must highlight overcapacity 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:08.149
 exactly what they are you have to take advantage of these two 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.409
 of course he had to be able to decode his marketing efforts from games on 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.449
 Internet 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.449
 in addition to the xvid format laurent gbagbo would console himself 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.340
 downloaded files 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.340
 we'll see what that gives for example is a thing 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.919
 this compatibility is in the club to archive 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.979
 I decided to stay it's something that has been redeemed compared 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:29.689
 to some 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:30.690
 his adoptive parents 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.930
 two bodies in the fighting 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.930
 so even though societies developed by some 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.249
 the steelworkers' union 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.120
 it's something that we could also have on the second 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.509
 little video 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.860
 10:22 p.m. 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.680
 finesse and friendly 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.680
 this level the screen 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.770
 but for example when traveling 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.819
 for sure it will be good 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.819
 koussa is held in one hand 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:19.419
 so we can talk about 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.029
 the social jogger app 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.749
 if if you want the application vazquez 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:25.749
 which brings together all these social networks 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:31.490
 so here in one application we can have 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.550
 the news of all these factors 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.509
 whatever the reason 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.999
 if we can choose only photos 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:41.189
 we can also quote 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:42.460
 these three categories 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.550
 it is about specific applications 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.550
 developed by as 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.039
 important in the application 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.289
 all these files 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.289
 with the different candidates 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.409
 we can also talk 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.789
 they set up you can see here 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:04.770
 multimedia 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.770
 social tourcoing 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:11.509
 end of December we can gather 6 9 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.059
 a simple pressure here six years 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:20.039
 we can simply have his little success 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.039
 even applications to download 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.360
 the part of the leaders 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.360
 the music multimedia computer part 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.999
 we are a little below this tablet okay for once I 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:43.999
 points out that the version 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.089
 federate% of what would be available which order 

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:56.089
 * publicis worldwide 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.409
 conversion parities 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.899

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:12.319
 for the sambre version 3g 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:14.649
 it's since the series was really very interesting because when we 

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:15.300
 is 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.090
 product parades transversely its extreme 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.409
 it's been a few months

 germain once very successful 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.150
 bought by brave and sisters 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.349
 the German manufacturer 

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:36.629
 whip and afp

 at the distribution store exactly one year his strategy this bestiary of 

00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:42.439
 democratization 

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:45.439
 so the products still accessible 

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:47.469
