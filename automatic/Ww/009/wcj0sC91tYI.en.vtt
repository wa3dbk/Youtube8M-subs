00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
blistering 140 degree attics we could

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.120 
blistering 140 degree attics we could
have<00:01:29.609> and<00:01:30.770> 130<00:01:31.770> 140<00:01:32.219> degree<00:01:32.549> air<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> attic

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
have and 130 140 degree air in the attic

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.699 
have and 130 140 degree air in the attic
58<00:01:35.130> degree<00:01:35.549> air<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.569> duct<00:01:36.959> I<00:01:37.200> mean<00:01:37.349> we<00:01:37.529> have

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
58 degree air in the duct I mean we have

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.469 
58 degree air in the duct I mean we have
an<00:01:37.859> 80<00:01:38.219> degree<00:01:38.429> temperature<00:01:39.299> difference

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
an 80 degree temperature difference

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.050 
an 80 degree temperature difference
between<00:01:39.779> the<00:01:40.109> air<00:01:40.380> inside<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.189> duct<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
between the air inside this duct and the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.819 
between the air inside this duct and the
air<00:01:42.209> right<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.109> little<00:01:43.319> bit<00:01:43.649> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
air right here with just a little bit of

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.219 
air right here with just a little bit of
insulation<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.520> between<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.389> what<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.990> means

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
insulation in between so what that means

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.739 
insulation in between so what that means
is<00:01:46.469> we<00:01:47.009> are<00:01:47.249> cooling<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.179> air<00:01:48.299> we're<00:01:48.539> paying

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749 
is we are cooling the air we're paying

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:50.300 
is we are cooling the air we're paying
to<00:01:48.899> cool<00:01:49.109> it<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.349> the<00:01:49.499> air<00:01:49.829> conditioning

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
to cool it at the air conditioning

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.309 
to cool it at the air conditioning
system<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.909> we're<00:01:51.450> distributing<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.079> through

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
system and we're distributing it through

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.589 
system and we're distributing it through
the<00:01:52.679> ducts<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:53.579> are<00:01:53.729> located<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.389> hot

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:54.599 
the ducts which are located in the hot

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:57.050 
the ducts which are located in the hot
attic<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.169> we're<00:01:55.619> heating<00:01:56.099> the<00:01:56.279> air<00:01:56.310> again<00:01:56.849> on

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
attic and we're heating the air again on

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.969 
attic and we're heating the air again on
its<00:01:57.239> way<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.899> rooms<00:01:58.169> that<00:01:58.349> makes

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
its way to the rooms that makes

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.760 
its way to the rooms that makes
absolutely<00:01:59.459> no<00:01:59.609> sense<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:01.069> here<00:02:02.069> we<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.429> a

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
absolutely no sense and here we have a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.069 
absolutely no sense and here we have a
supply<00:02:04.770> box<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.459> is<00:02:05.639> uninsulated<00:02:06.239> you<00:02:06.929> can

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
supply box that is uninsulated you can

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.010 
supply box that is uninsulated you can
see<00:02:07.289> there's<00:02:07.590> duct<00:02:07.919> tape<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.430> this<00:02:09.030> connection

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
see there's duct tape on this connection

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.630 
see there's duct tape on this connection
and<00:02:10.200> duct<00:02:10.350> tape<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.830> good<00:02:11.190> for<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.460> lot<00:02:11.580> of

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and duct tape is good for a lot of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.510 
and duct tape is good for a lot of
things<00:02:11.940> but<00:02:12.210> not<00:02:12.360> ducts<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.170> just
