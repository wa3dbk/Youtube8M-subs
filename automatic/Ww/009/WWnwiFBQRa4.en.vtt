00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.230
 when I started the race I say oysters 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.549
 my dressing room goes out everything goes for 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.870
 Wake me up, throw me a little bit 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.699
 idea the cove is called awake with 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.980
 theories of life and theories to play 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.430
 eye foot foot eye eye eye more 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.439
 line no uncle and I fall everything is going to be a 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.439
 screw in plan as a foreigner 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.969
 it's a bit strange acrobatics at the same time 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.100
 how cool while incentive to throw 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:42.020
 partner is going to catch no 9 so sir 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.020
 Car shine side seals 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.170
 us legal persons 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.270
 that 's could we can confirm that that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.129
 it's a turbo a turbo subscriber to know 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.530
 we are going to take it I have what I have 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.879
 second are the turbo that you can 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.649
 take and use them for your account 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.820
 turbo dgt has imposed on the turbos 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.820
 subscriber is that it's like 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.210
 you do not need to explain like that all the world 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.460
 has seen if it looks like something go 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.200
 seconds 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.100
 it's perfect they would tell me and because it's a 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:22.710
 back of the car because look at the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.600
 part raised with a pimp's face is that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.090
 I have a way of little ones that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.159
 all the cars I put faces I see 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.750
 the lights of a car both the back 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.159
 like the front and lepe a face instead 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.229
 of the lights 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.790
 it's weird was we not for me if 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.909
 nothing happens to me the same thing is that 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.710
 second are 55 missing a point of 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.800
 I control what you gain by denying my channel 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.330
 I won there is a theme to win the game not the 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.210
 point is far away is actually a 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.270
 expect to wait the vice has stuck 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.429
 I do not know what is happening 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.009
 this guy who goes first but you 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:02:02.829
 advance because it is the best in the world and 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.829
 I'm going to win like that because if so good 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.690
 in a second the incredible gods I think 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.310
 I'm here caught because he has 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.650
 picked up by where are the bars 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.299
 you already know that around the base 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.099
 military and a kind of passage in the 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.870
 which one can go out there that is like a 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.950
 hallway basically around the whole 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.930
 military base and I think it makes sense 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:28.840
 out there he hits it against something and pulls 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:31.930
 This is why it is intense but if 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.930
 see you
