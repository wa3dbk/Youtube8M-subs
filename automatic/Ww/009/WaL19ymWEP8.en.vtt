00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
can upgrade a Tesla but why don't we go

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.940 
can upgrade a Tesla but why don't we go
ahead<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.000> jump<00:00:42.450> into<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.710> will<00:00:43.770> be

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
ahead and jump into this and I will be

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.740 
ahead and jump into this and I will be
back<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.579> guys<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.090> few<00:00:45.120> seconds

back with you guys in a few seconds

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
back with you guys in a few seconds
which<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.020> find<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.469> base<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.370> can

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
which I find a base that I think we can

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.000 
which I find a base that I think we can
conquer<00:00:47.730> all<00:00:47.940> right<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:49.079> right<00:00:49.140> guys<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.829> are

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
conquer all right all right guys we are

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.040 
conquer all right all right guys we are
back<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.579> think<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.030> found<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> base<00:00:51.750> that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
back and I think I found the base that

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.680 
back and I think I found the base that
we<00:00:52.170> are<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.680> take<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.420> town

my<00:01:24.869> barbarian<00:01:25.290> King<00:01:25.619> right<00:01:25.830> there<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.689> then

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
my barbarian King right there and then

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.789 
my barbarian King right there and then
start<00:01:28.170> trickling<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.159> some<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.880> our<00:01:30.710> some<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
start trickling in some of our some of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.210 
start trickling in some of our some of
our<00:01:31.920> archers<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.759> well<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.770> golem<00:01:35.070> is

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
our archers as well so the golem is

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.010 
our archers as well so the golem is
inside<00:01:35.670> now<00:01:35.909> obviously<00:01:36.390> he's<00:01:36.630> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> be

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
inside now obviously he's going to be

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.130 
inside now obviously he's going to be
running<00:01:37.290> around<00:01:37.439> taking<00:01:38.930> hopefully<00:01:39.930> getting

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
running around taking hopefully getting

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.289 
running around taking hopefully getting
rid<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.770> many<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> defense's<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.180> you

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
rid of as many of the defense's as you

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.560 
rid of as many of the defense's as you
can<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:43.579> think<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.670> should<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.939> able<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
can I think we should be able to do this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.120 
can I think we should be able to do this
shouldn't<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.500> too<00:01:46.590> bad<00:01:48.380> once<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.890> all

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
shouldn't be too bad once we can get all

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
shouldn't be too bad once we can get all
of<00:01:50.159> our<00:01:50.460> archers<00:01:51.090> into<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.479> center

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
of our archers into the center

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.200 
of our archers into the center
compartment<00:01:52.710> there<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.220> should<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.490> looking

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
compartment there we should be looking

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.459 
compartment there we should be looking
pretty<00:01:55.820> um<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.420> mortars<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:57.990> taking<00:01:58.350> some

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
pretty um the mortars are taking some

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.899 
pretty um the mortars are taking some
pretty<00:01:58.649> big<00:01:58.829> hits<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.250> them<00:01:59.399> right<00:01:59.579> there<00:01:59.759> we

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
pretty big hits on them right there we

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.480 
pretty big hits on them right there we
lost<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.450> pretty<00:02:00.930> good<00:02:01.079> amount<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.649> our<00:02:02.189> golems

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
inside hopefully he can be a distraction

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.869 
inside hopefully he can be a distraction
as<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.560> can<00:02:36.650> see<00:02:36.829> that<00:02:36.860> wizard<00:02:37.519> tie<00:02:37.670> right

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.080 
it I'll just drop one and see how it
goes<00:03:00.950> um<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:03.250> yeah<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.519> wasn't<00:03:04.700> really<00:03:04.940> a

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
goes um so yeah that wasn't really a

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.559 
goes um so yeah that wasn't really a
fair<00:03:05.569> trade<00:03:06.069> for<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.549> cost<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:08.000> gold<00:03:08.239> for<00:03:08.420> that

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
fair trade for the cost of gold for that

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.880 
fair trade for the cost of gold for that
so<00:03:08.780> we're<00:03:08.930> not<00:03:09.019> going<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.230> drop<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.530> rest<00:03:09.739> of

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
so we're not going to drop the rest of

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.580 
so we're not going to drop the rest of
them<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:11.150> guys<00:03:11.329> that<00:03:11.359> is<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.750> victory

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
them but guys that is a victory

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.619 
them but guys that is a victory
seventy-nine<00:03:13.549> percent<00:03:13.760> we<00:03:14.180> might<00:03:14.390> even<00:03:14.510> be

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
seventy-nine percent we might even be

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.030 
seventy-nine percent we might even be
able<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.959> get<00:03:15.349> up<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.680> 80<00:03:16.280> once<00:03:16.609> we<00:03:16.760> get<00:03:16.909> this<00:03:17.120> um

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
able to get up to 80 once we get this um

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.319 
able to get up to 80 once we get this um
down<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.340> believe<00:03:19.609> this<00:03:19.760> wizard<00:03:20.180> might

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
down and I believe this wizard might

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.750 
down and I believe this wizard might
actually<00:03:20.480> even<00:03:20.840> get<00:03:20.959> taken<00:03:21.230> out<00:03:21.319> as<00:03:21.560> well<00:03:22.010> yep

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
actually even get taken out as well yep

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.659 
actually even get taken out as well yep
there<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.180> goes<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:24.950> looks<00:03:25.190> like<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.549> is

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
there it goes and that looks like it is

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.220 
there it goes and that looks like it is
going<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:26.030> be<00:03:26.060> hit<00:03:26.299> so<00:03:26.720> we<00:03:26.840> were<00:03:26.959> going<00:03:27.109> to<00:03:27.169> go

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
going to be hit so we were going to go

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.259 
going to be hit so we were going to go
ahead<00:03:27.319> and<00:03:27.500> in<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.769> battle<00:03:28.190> victorious<00:03:28.940> guys
