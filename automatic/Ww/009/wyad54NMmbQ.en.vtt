Bill south bellsouth mobility which was
really<00:01:27.810> good<00:01:28.549> then<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.640> became<00:01:29.820> singular<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
really good then it became singular and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.800 
really good then it became singular and
then<00:01:31.500> 18<00:01:31.920> t+<00:01:32.189> singular<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.299> back<00:01:33.659> up

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
then 18 t+ singular so now I'm back up

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.480 
then 18 t+ singular so now I'm back up
to<00:01:33.869> five<00:01:34.020> bars<00:01:34.259> even<00:01:34.439> even<00:01:34.950> been<00:01:35.100> holding<00:01:35.340> out

might some areas that don't have a good
reception<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.619> that's<00:01:49.740> anywhere<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.220> there's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.649 
holding it like this and i'm back at
five<00:01:56.280> bars<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.579> fact<00:01:56.759> that's<00:01:56.820> been<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.479> one<00:01:57.630> of

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
five bars of fact that's been not one of

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.109 
five bars of fact that's been not one of
the<00:01:57.810> screens<00:01:58.110> dimming<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:59.430> now<00:01:59.880> i'm<00:01:59.939> going<00:01:59.969> to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.880 
the screens dimming so now i'm going to
try<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> key<00:02:00.570> test<00:02:00.810> i'm<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.229> gonna<00:02:01.320> sit<00:02:01.560> down

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
try the key test i'm just gonna sit down

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.510 
try the key test i'm just gonna sit down
outside<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.909> I've<00:02:03.030> seen<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.420> other<00:02:03.540> videos

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.030 

we<00:02:06.969> still<00:02:07.210> see<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:10.349> yep<00:02:11.349> we<00:02:11.680> still<00:02:11.860> see<00:02:11.950> the

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
person i'm going to lake he across it

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.530 
person i'm going to lake he across it
maurice<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.360> camera<00:02:16.629> up<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.110> little<00:02:17.230> bit

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
maurice the camera up just a little bit

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.259 
maurice the camera up just a little bit
there<00:02:19.540> we<00:02:19.660> go<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:23.400> let<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.430> sit<00:02:24.730> there<00:02:24.760> for<00:02:24.910> a

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
there we go and let it sit there for a

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.030 
there we go and let it sit there for a
little<00:02:25.480> while<00:02:28.140> now<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.200> guy<00:02:29.379> who<00:02:29.440> did<00:02:29.980> the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
little while now the guy who did the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.920 
little while now the guy who did the
video<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.400> i<00:02:30.430> saw<00:02:30.610> earlier<00:02:30.940> he<00:02:31.750> had<00:02:31.840> to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
video that i saw earlier he had to

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.210 
video that i saw earlier he had to
adjust<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.530> whatnot<00:02:32.709> i<00:02:32.860> think<00:02:33.099> that's

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
adjust it and whatnot i think that's

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.490 
adjust it and whatnot i think that's
really<00:02:33.400> kind<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.700> overdoing<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.500> fidgeting

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
really kind of overdoing it fidgeting

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.170 
really kind of overdoing it fidgeting
but<00:02:35.680> up<00:02:35.830> i'll<00:02:36.160> do<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.459> in<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.640> second<00:02:36.970> i<00:02:37.060> mean

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
but up i'll do that in a second i mean

but up i'll do that in a second i mean
let's<00:02:37.390> say<00:02:37.480> i<00:02:37.510> don't<00:02:37.599> see<00:02:37.750> anything<00:02:37.900> drop<00:02:38.230> yet

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
let's say i don't see anything drop yet

let's say i don't see anything drop yet
oh<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:38.620> i'll<00:02:38.799> try<00:02:39.900> got<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.170> center<00:02:41.829> of<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.040> key

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
oh so i'll try got the center of the key

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.270 
oh so i'll try got the center of the key
right<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:42.940> top<00:02:43.319> oops<00:02:44.819> no<00:02:45.819> it<00:02:45.970> didn't<00:02:46.150> break

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
right on top oops no it didn't break

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.710 
right on top oops no it didn't break
wouldn't<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.340> be<00:02:48.459> funny<00:02:48.640> up<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.390> don't<00:02:49.540> want<00:02:49.660> a

wouldn't that be funny up I don't want a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.120 
wouldn't that be funny up I don't want a
facebook<00:02:52.410> center<00:02:53.410> leaky<00:02:53.650> right<00:02:53.860> on<00:02:53.980> top<00:02:54.099> of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
facebook center leaky right on top of

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.680 
facebook center leaky right on top of
the<00:02:54.280> little<00:02:54.819> bit<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.090> gap<00:02:55.269> between<00:02:55.450> the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
the little bit of the gap between the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.930 
the little bit of the gap between the
two<00:02:55.810> antennas<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:57.250> we'll<00:02:57.459> leave<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:57.700> here<00:02:57.880> for

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
two antennas and we'll leave it here for

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:07.780 
two antennas and we'll leave it here for
a<00:02:58.329> minute<00:02:58.540> or<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.069> that's<00:03:00.069> in<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:04.170> so

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.330 

still<00:03:08.510> full<00:03:08.719> five<00:03:08.900> bars<00:03:09.400> 18t<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.780> mean<00:03:12.340> AT&amp;T

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
still full five bars 18t so I mean AT&amp;T

higher population densities of course

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.099 
higher population densities of course

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
people who put in the infrastructure

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.140 
people who put in the infrastructure
they<00:03:28.250> basically<00:03:28.489> bought<00:03:28.670> up<00:03:28.790> other<00:03:28.909> cellular

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
they basically bought up other cellular

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.780 
they basically bought up other cellular
companies<00:03:29.569> and<00:03:29.720> one<00:03:29.840> oo<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.260> I'm<00:03:30.670> maybe<00:03:31.670> I'm

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790

deserves that 18th he's using down here
maybe<00:03:42.319> it's<00:03:42.530> just<00:03:42.590> better<00:03:43.040> equipment<00:03:43.340> or

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
maybe it's just better equipment or

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.270 
maybe it's just better equipment or
better<00:03:43.700> technology<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.150> don't<00:03:44.359> know<00:03:45.280> alright

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
better technology I don't know alright

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.170 
better technology I don't know alright
that's<00:03:46.430> long<00:03:46.609> enough<00:03:46.669> this<00:03:46.849> video<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.150> going

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
that's long enough this video is going

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.000 
that's long enough this video is going
to<00:03:47.299> take<00:03:47.569> long<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.959> upload<00:03:48.139> anyway<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:48.560> I'm

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
to take long to upload anyway so I'm

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.440 
to take long to upload anyway so I'm
going<00:03:49.159> to<00:03:49.189> stop<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.639> and<00:03:49.790> go<00:03:50.090> ahead<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.299> upload

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
going to stop it and go ahead and upload

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.540 
going to stop it and go ahead and upload
it
