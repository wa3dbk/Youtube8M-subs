00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello everyone today to tell about 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.150
 Tagaz Akvella 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 sorry once for quality shooting well 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.670
 how did this Russian car 1 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.509
 budget sports car like that you can 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.510
 to position 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.910
 with a motor of 1 6 liters 107 horsepower 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.400
 externally, the car looks but in my opinion 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.250
 personal opinion is very good but such 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.579
 unusual non-standard for Russia 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.520
 the design is not like 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.350
 seven in nine or there are 14 Lada 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.510
 which for so long we have been producing and here 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.200
 but all sorts of shortcomings in terms of 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.730
 plastic that is here in the cabin done 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.829
 tough enough buckets and stand that is 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.489
 behind . under what it is in sports 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.559
 car 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.199
 it will be very difficult to sit behind 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.789
 small very small mirrors in them 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.990
 no one can see 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.360
 and that's what I liked about it here 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.590
 steering adjustment is arranged 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.840
 and on the upper position raises the lower 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.320
 part here is the dashboard 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.600
 here everything plays everything staggers and cutout 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.450
 and when her kind down to the end is omitted 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.939
 it is clear that there is no equal back 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.990
 almost no glass review but 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.759
 sports car is forgivable trunk 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.420
 it opens from the salon with a button 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.610
 shoots and well he press 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.590
 shoots opens completely then 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.820
 there is if you go from the store with bags 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.460
 and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.350
 that is, you want to put something in the trunk 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.720
 respectively, you first need all this 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.030
 on the floor put or there to the cart in 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.960
 basket only then open the salon and 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.990
 trunk and it means if you put everything 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.000
 large enough trunk 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.850
 once you came to the car I noticed 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.920
 that the glass seal he leaves at all 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.500
 but here, in principle, everything is somehow 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.640
 made somewhere there departs all departs 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.970
 there is enough legroom at the back 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.920
 for the head does not understand the growth of 185 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:22.640
 centimeters man about my 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.390
 growth sits some kind of not such a pose 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.340
 what do i need because head ceiling 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.880
 not at all possible 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.060
 a place seems to be built here 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:40.489
 full of places very much to know him for 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:45.250
 you can even fall apart the field to 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.250
 Excellent ceiling heads rests 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.350
 well for a sports car such a space 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.030
 back forgivable even in the rear doors 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.910
 I can not not mark this button 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.320
 door locks like a classic 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.260
 AvtoVAZ must pay tribute 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.050
 designer and car designers 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.690
 equipped with 18 wheels on them 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:15.690
 low profile tires are very elegant 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:18.630
 Looks like I said motor here 16 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.590
 107 forces here air conditioning here is here 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.170
 from him the motor pipes are here 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.830
 accelerator pedal still cable 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.870
 the producer thus left 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.690
 opportunity for the user to garage 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.010
 tuning is just different for why here 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.630
 pedal with a rope well, not quite clear everything 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.650
 modern cars are completed 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.390
 electronic accelerator pedal 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.640
 all plastic body possible 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:53.720
 because of this many inconsistencies 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.720
 the gaps this here is the junction of the wing with 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.970
 front windshield rack somewhat large 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.970
 the crack 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:07.120
 rear bumper joint with the wing too 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.959
 uneven gap but overall car 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.500
 has its so aggressive sports 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.350
 appearance 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.310
 which has no analogues in Russia 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.000
 manufacturer 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.480
 and generally speaking about the price 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.840
 this particular car is worth 415,000 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.880
 today in this money 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.150
 analogs with this look well, just not 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.150
 to find 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.160
 well that 's all thanks for watching 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.090
