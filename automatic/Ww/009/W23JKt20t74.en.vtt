have<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.590> set<00:02:27.769> at<00:02:27.970> 450<00:02:28.970> degrees<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:31.180> think<00:02:32.180> you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
have it set at 450 degrees I think you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
have it set at 450 degrees I think you
might<00:02:32.480> actually<00:02:32.510> turn<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:32.900> down<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.230> little

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
might actually turn that down a little

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.880 
might actually turn that down a little
bit<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:34.030> don't<00:02:35.030> know<00:02:38.140> 450<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.200> as<00:02:39.380> hot<00:02:39.590> as<00:02:39.739> it

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
bit I don't know 450 is as hot as it

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.350 
bit I don't know 450 is as hot as it
gets<00:02:39.920> oh<00:02:40.400> yeah<00:02:40.549> I<00:02:40.579> think<00:02:40.760> I'm<00:02:40.910> gonna<00:02:41.000> turn<00:02:41.299> that

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
gets oh yeah I think I'm gonna turn that

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.860 
gets oh yeah I think I'm gonna turn that
down<00:02:41.660> just<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:42.049> little<00:02:42.079> bit<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.650> now<00:02:45.680> at<00:02:45.860> 390

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870

okay

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.630 

this<00:02:53.870> does<00:02:54.140> seem<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.500> glide<00:02:54.710> really<00:02:55.250> smoothly

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
this does seem to glide really smoothly

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.330 
this does seem to glide really smoothly
through<00:02:56.120> my<00:02:56.300> hair<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.320> that<00:02:57.890> was<00:02:58.010> just<00:02:58.160> one

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
through my hair and that was just one

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.470 
through my hair and that was just one
glide<00:02:58.520> through<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.000> feel<00:02:59.210> like<00:02:59.330> this

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
glide through and I feel like this

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.920 
glide through and I feel like this
really<00:02:59.720> did<00:03:00.110> smooth<00:03:00.800> my<00:03:00.980> hair<00:03:01.010> out<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:02.630> didn't

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
really did smooth my hair out it didn't

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.300 
really did smooth my hair out it didn't
pull<00:03:03.080> on<00:03:03.200> my<00:03:03.350> hair<00:03:03.530> at<00:03:03.590> all<00:03:03.710> which<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.070> good

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
pull on my hair at all which is good

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.790 
pull on my hair at all which is good
because<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.690> had<00:03:06.050> such<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:06.350> problem<00:03:06.650> with

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
because I just had such a problem with

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.270 
because I just had such a problem with
that<00:03:06.920> with<00:03:07.040> my<00:03:07.190> last<00:03:07.400> straightener<00:03:09.070> my<00:03:10.070> last

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
that with my last straightener my last

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.250 
that with my last straightener my last
straightener<00:03:10.610> was<00:03:10.790> just<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.300> drugstore<00:03:11.900> hair

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
straightener was just a drugstore hair

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.900 
straightener was just a drugstore hair
straightener<00:03:12.740> I<00:03:12.800> think<00:03:12.980> was<00:03:13.070> Remington<00:03:13.670> art

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
straightener I think was Remington art

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.580 
straightener I think was Remington art
Connie<00:03:14.570> or<00:03:14.780> something<00:03:15.140> like<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.500> was

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
Connie or something like that it was

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.800 
Connie or something like that it was
just<00:03:15.740> is<00:03:15.890> awful<00:03:16.400> honestly<00:03:22.210> yeah<00:03:23.210> that<00:03:23.450> glides

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
just is awful honestly yeah that glides

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.310 
just is awful honestly yeah that glides
so<00:03:24.320> nicely<00:03:24.860> through<00:03:25.130> my<00:03:25.250> hair<00:03:26.080> see<00:03:27.080> that's

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
so nicely through my hair see that's

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.100 
so nicely through my hair see that's
compared<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:28.480> frisbee<00:03:29.480> mask<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.050> I

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
compared to this frisbee mask that I

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:48.089 
compared to this frisbee mask that I
have<00:03:30.350> going<00:03:30.560> on<00:03:30.740> over<00:03:30.980> there

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
far I feel like it's really helping with

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.220 
far I feel like it's really helping with
the<00:03:52.540> frizz

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
the frizz

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.140
