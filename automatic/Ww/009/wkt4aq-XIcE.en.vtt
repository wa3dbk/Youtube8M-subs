00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.810

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.550
 how did you feel under the three poles 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.680
 well thank god I had the opportunity 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.160
 to vote a little nerves at the beginning 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.140
 but I'm still working to have 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.730
 another opportunity like this card now 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.290
 I will seek ownership since you 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.460
 you are young and you want to think about the 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.350
 team 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.440
 clear to seem to work every day 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.080
 for to be a holder we have 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.880
 great archers who are in the 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.100
 university is going to be a very job 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.080
 difficult you felt back as you saw the 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.250
 team how did you dress the whole game in the 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.550
 today the good thing is that it was a team 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.910
 very neat we were very well in shape 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.030
 defensive I think that for me 10 points do not 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.070
 could casey mistakes forward we are missing 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.990
 specify a little more but the team 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.520
 is on track to keep working 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.320
 to search for ownership and to search 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.360
 the next match to the three points 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.590
 clear they are still working in the three 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.720
 points are going to be ours to be able to 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.920
 achieve our goal the i7 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.230

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.760
 thanks to the teacher for the confidence that 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.460
 it gave 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.710
 very well I think I made a good match and 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.900
 the important thing is to add three points 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.280
 and we could get the victory here all 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.350
 it was one of the best matches I 've ever 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.540
 seen you ran everything how you felt with 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.230
 the weather here the humidity not the truth 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.980
 that this climate affects you a lot but 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.400
 professionally you have to be in the 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.390
 court and give all running the all 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.800
 fight it to the last thing we did 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.110
 with colleagues to bring to light 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.550
 forward college like you 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.440
 you say bring the three points home this 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.690
 it's very valuable if we keep adding to 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.490
 three that is how important the goal 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.070
 is still there that is to classify and climb the 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.290
 time and this match helps us to continue 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.420
 dreaming feels raise the day Wednesday 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.490

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.680
 right now we travel and we got there and 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.840
 keep working only with the 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.910
 work let's get ahead many 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.410
 thanks of thanks 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.640
 good axel express your lesson you had me 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.440
 the opportunity to debut how you 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.930
 felt within the field of play is 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.790
 good in the best way within what 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.610
 that the teacher indicated to me and the few 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.530
 minutes between the team cover 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.240
 we remain in a usual position in 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.160
 you and how you felt being the breaker 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.470
 of the team but good is a position 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.960
 that the teacher has been occupying me since 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.110
 I do a lot of workouts 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.760
 feeling comfortable good we can that the 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.280
 things continue to be given and win a 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.170
 starting job did you feel you 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.290
 with the weather since it's not the same here there 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.990
 a lot of humidity and deprive you ran yes 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.420
 a little bit the heat but one 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.520
 work for this we have to dock 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.200
 to any climate that touches us and make 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.520
 things the best way to work 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.740
 very hard then to recover the 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.530
 ownership is this goal if we do not 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.570
 it's time to work hard and nothing to follow 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.270
 forward and if the times you have to 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.360
 enter the field of play give the best of 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.680
 I can already perform with the team we are 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.780
 continue with the three team points 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.640
 so if you're happy and now you have to 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.530
 turn the page and go back 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.180
 and think about the day Wednesday we have a 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.600
 very short week you have to work it well 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.310
 you have to work it well to wait 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.620
 the teacher and good to work of the best 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.789
 way because this is very short and 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.680
 we need the three points that are 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:12.250
 valuable from there at home many times 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.250
 Thank you 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.720
 all right
