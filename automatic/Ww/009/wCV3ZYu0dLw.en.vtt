holding<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> gun<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.509> would<00:01:39.659> have

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
holding the gun and I would have

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.060 
holding the gun and I would have

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
of before and then they kind of

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.099 
of before and then they kind of
disappeared<00:03:12.129> so<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.510> game<00:03:13.689> Halo<00:03:13.870> Wars

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
disappeared so in the game Halo Wars

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.509 
disappeared so in the game Halo Wars
wasn't<00:03:14.439> actually<00:03:14.680> made<00:03:14.859> by<00:03:14.889> Bungie<00:03:15.310> was

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
wasn't actually made by Bungie was

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.440 
wasn't actually made by Bungie was
actually<00:03:15.760> made<00:03:15.879> by<00:03:15.909> a<00:03:16.030> company<00:03:16.359> called

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
actually made by a company called

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.750 
actually made by a company called
Ensemble<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.439> went<00:03:17.590> bankrupt<00:03:17.829> just<00:03:18.129> after

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
Ensemble that went bankrupt just after

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.520 
Ensemble that went bankrupt just after
they<00:03:18.849> finished<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.299> game<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:20.049> that<00:03:20.079> wasn't<00:03:20.500> a

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
they finished the game so that wasn't a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.270 
they finished the game so that wasn't a
really<00:03:20.650> good<00:03:20.889> thing

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
really good thing

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280 
really good thing
but<00:03:21.459> anyway<00:03:21.879> as<00:03:22.120> far<00:03:22.239> as<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.419> figures<00:03:22.690> go<00:03:22.840> they

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
but anyway as far as the figures go they

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.619 
but anyway as far as the figures go they
are<00:03:23.319> pretty<00:03:23.590> cool<00:03:24.209> articulation<00:03:25.209> in<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.419> head

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
are pretty cool articulation in the head

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.000 
are pretty cool articulation in the head
you<00:03:26.169> can<00:03:26.199> definitely<00:03:26.620> see<00:03:26.739> that<00:03:26.769> they're

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
you can definitely see that they're

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.740 
you can definitely see that they're
looking<00:03:27.280> around<00:03:27.340> it's<00:03:27.699> not<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.849> huge<00:03:28.359> range<00:03:28.569> of

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
looking around it's not a huge range of

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.750 
looking around it's not a huge range of
motion<00:03:29.109> but<00:03:29.260> they<00:03:30.040> aren't<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.280> aldrin<00:03:30.579> so<00:03:30.669> they

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
motion but they aren't of aldrin so they

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.759 
motion but they aren't of aldrin so they
can<00:03:30.909> rotate<00:03:31.060> 360<00:03:31.690> degrees<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.139> arms<00:03:32.379> can<00:03:32.530> open

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
can rotate 360 degrees the arms can open

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:33.569 
can rotate 360 degrees the arms can open
up<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:32.980> about<00:03:33.129> here

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
up to about here

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.250 
up to about here
very<00:03:33.909> nice<00:03:34.090> they<00:03:34.269> can<00:03:34.299> rotate<00:03:34.569> 360<00:03:35.199> degrees

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
very nice they can rotate 360 degrees

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.039 
very nice they can rotate 360 degrees
they<00:03:35.919> Bend<00:03:36.159> just<00:03:36.400> below<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.150> bicep<00:03:37.540> at<00:03:37.720> the

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
they Bend just below the bicep at the

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.930 
they Bend just below the bicep at the
elbow<00:03:38.470> they<00:03:38.829> also<00:03:39.069> rotate<00:03:39.370> up<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.579> forum<00:03:39.909> just

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
elbow they also rotate up the forum just

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.819 
elbow they also rotate up the forum just
after<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.449> elbow<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.870> then<00:03:41.199> you<00:03:41.260> also<00:03:41.409> have

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
after the elbow and then you also have

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.319 
after the elbow and then you also have
the<00:03:42.400> hand<00:03:43.180> joints<00:03:43.769> waist<00:03:44.769> articulation<00:03:45.329> and

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
the hand joints waist articulation and

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.300 
the hand joints waist articulation and
there's<00:03:46.690> a<00:03:46.750> pretty<00:03:46.930> good<00:03:47.109> range<00:03:47.319> there<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.829> like

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
there's a pretty good range there I like

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.009 
there's a pretty good range there I like
it<00:03:48.519> they<00:03:48.669> can<00:03:48.699> definitely<00:03:48.879> rotate<00:03:49.359> 360<00:03:49.569> it's

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
it they can definitely rotate 360 it's

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.899 
it they can definitely rotate 360 it's
pretty<00:03:50.199> cool<00:03:50.379> now<00:03:50.739> these<00:03:51.040> hips<00:03:51.579> that<00:03:51.760> they

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
pretty cool now these hips that they

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.699 
pretty cool now these hips that they
have<00:03:52.120> are<00:03:52.299> actually<00:03:52.690> more<00:03:52.870> based<00:03:53.079> off<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.500> when

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
have are actually more based off of when

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.379 
have are actually more based off of when
the<00:03:53.799> original<00:03:54.129> mongooses<00:03:54.909> came<00:03:55.120> out<00:03:55.239> for<00:03:55.329> the

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
the original mongooses came out for the

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.689 
the original mongooses came out for the
Halo<00:03:55.569> 3<00:03:55.810> line<00:03:55.959> so<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.739> legs<00:03:56.979> actually<00:03:57.250> can

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
Halo 3 line so the legs actually can

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.119 
Halo 3 line so the legs actually can
kind<00:03:57.879> of<00:03:57.909> open<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.840> way<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.680> kind<00:03:59.829> of<00:03:59.949> was

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
kind of open in a way that kind of was

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.030 
kind of open in a way that kind of was
made<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:00.489> that<00:04:00.579> they<00:04:00.669> could<00:04:00.819> sit<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:02.680> wasn't

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
made so that they could sit it wasn't

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.920 
made so that they could sit it wasn't
the<00:04:03.190> best<00:04:03.400> design<00:04:03.879> that<00:04:04.120> McFarlane<00:04:04.510> ever<00:04:04.599> did

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
the best design that McFarlane ever did

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.689 
the best design that McFarlane ever did
but<00:04:05.169> it<00:04:05.260> didn't<00:04:05.470> live<00:04:05.680> very<00:04:05.919> long<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.370> was<00:04:06.459> kind

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
but it didn't live very long it was kind

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.849 
but it didn't live very long it was kind
of<00:04:06.760> just<00:04:06.940> for<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.060> couple<00:04:07.329> of<00:04:07.389> figures<00:04:07.750> for<00:04:08.680> like

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
of just for a couple of figures for like

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.140 
of just for a couple of figures for like
two<00:04:09.040> series<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.400> they<00:04:09.639> got<00:04:09.790> rid<00:04:09.940> of<00:04:10.000> it

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
two series and they got rid of it

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.849 
two series and they got rid of it
thankfully<00:04:10.629> but<00:04:11.019> these<00:04:11.169> figures<00:04:11.500> are<00:04:11.680> still

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
thankfully but these figures are still

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.520 
thankfully but these figures are still
just<00:04:12.280> repaints<00:04:13.269> of<00:04:13.449> the<00:04:13.810> original<00:04:14.290> Jerome

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
just repaints of the original Jerome

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.140 
just repaints of the original Jerome
figure<00:04:14.739> that<00:04:14.889> came<00:04:15.010> out<00:04:15.159> years<00:04:15.400> ago<00:04:15.639> so<00:04:15.879> they

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
figure that came out years ago so they

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.050 
figure that came out years ago so they
weren't<00:04:16.329> probably<00:04:16.840> going<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.049> fix<00:04:17.229> that<00:04:18.060> so

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
weren't probably going to fix that so

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.659 
weren't probably going to fix that so
you<00:04:19.120> do<00:04:19.419> have<00:04:19.680> legs<00:04:20.680> can<00:04:20.949> kick<00:04:21.130> up<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.459> about

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
you do have legs can kick up to about

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.300 
you do have legs can kick up to about
here<00:04:22.360> it's<00:04:22.960> pretty<00:04:23.349> good<00:04:23.500> range<00:04:23.800> compared<00:04:24.219> to

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
here it's pretty good range compared to

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.860 
here it's pretty good range compared to
some<00:04:24.430> of<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.580> other<00:04:24.700> Spartan<00:04:25.029> figures<00:04:25.419> they

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
some of the other Spartan figures they

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.540 
some of the other Spartan figures they
can't<00:04:26.110> kick<00:04:26.289> back<00:04:26.529> real<00:04:26.800> far

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
can't kick back real far

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.129 
can't kick back real far
going<00:04:27.849> forward<00:04:28.090> they<00:04:28.270> definitely<00:04:28.479> cans<00:04:28.780> bends

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
going forward they definitely cans bends

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.379 
going forward they definitely cans bends
at<00:04:29.289> the<00:04:29.319> knee<00:04:29.409> can<00:04:30.190> rotate<00:04:30.400> just<00:04:30.970> above<00:04:31.210> the

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
at the knee can rotate just above the

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.969 
at the knee can rotate just above the
knee<00:04:31.539> then<00:04:32.050> you've<00:04:32.169> also<00:04:32.319> got<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.620> wide<00:04:32.770> range

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
knee then you've also got a wide range

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.189 
knee then you've also got a wide range
of<00:04:33.129> ankle<00:04:33.520> articulation<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.780> toe

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
of ankle articulation and toe

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.100 
of ankle articulation and toe
articulation<00:04:35.889> so<00:04:36.819> they<00:04:37.479> are<00:04:37.659> really<00:04:37.960> cool

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
articulation so they are really cool

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.649 
articulation so they are really cool
figures<00:04:38.500> for<00:04:38.740> that<00:04:38.860> now<00:04:39.759> if<00:04:39.970> you<00:04:40.000> happen<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.509> be

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
figures for that now if you happen to be

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.749 
figures for that now if you happen to be
having<00:04:40.810> a<00:04:40.990> problem<00:04:41.289> with<00:04:41.919> your<00:04:42.129> Alice<00:04:42.520> or<00:04:42.639> any

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
having a problem with your Alice or any

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.029 
having a problem with your Alice or any
of<00:04:42.849> these<00:04:42.909> figures<00:04:43.210> holding<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.599> SMG<00:04:44.139> ii<00:04:44.650> SMG

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
of these figures holding the SMG ii SMG

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.279 
of these figures holding the SMG ii SMG
I'll<00:04:45.520> show<00:04:45.669> you<00:04:45.759> what<00:04:45.879> I<00:04:45.909> did<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.599> first<00:04:46.629> SMG

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
I'll show you what I did the first SMG

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:48.869 
I'll show you what I did the first SMG
was<00:04:47.440> very<00:04:47.590> easy<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.949> get<00:04:48.310> into<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.520> hand<00:04:48.759> what

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
was very easy to get into the hand what

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.309 
was very easy to get into the hand what
I<00:04:48.909> did<00:04:49.090> I<00:04:49.120> did<00:04:49.479> have<00:04:49.569> to<00:04:49.690> take<00:04:49.840> out<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.080> weapon

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
I did I did have to take out the weapon

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.960 
I did I did have to take out the weapon
pegs<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:50.800> there<00:04:51.129> is<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.250> weapon<00:04:51.550> type<00:04:51.699> for<00:04:51.849> both

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
pegs and there is a weapon type for both

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.350 
pegs and there is a weapon type for both
the<00:04:52.120> SMGs<00:04:52.599> I<00:04:52.750> just<00:04:52.900> had<00:04:52.990> them<00:04:53.080> off<00:04:53.169> to<00:04:53.289> the<00:04:53.379> side

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
the SMGs I just had them off to the side

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.760 
the SMGs I just had them off to the side
but<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.389> second<00:04:55.840> one<00:04:55.960> what<00:04:56.259> you<00:04:56.349> do<00:04:56.560> is

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
but the second one what you do is

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.619 
but the second one what you do is
because<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.759> way<00:04:57.849> that<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.060> hands<00:04:58.330> are<00:04:58.479> open

00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:58.629 
because the way that the hands are open

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:59.999 
because the way that the hands are open
they're<00:04:58.900> like<00:04:59.020> reaching<00:04:59.289> for<00:04:59.409> that<00:04:59.620> invisible

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
they're like reaching for that invisible

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.040 
they're like reaching for that invisible
cup<00:05:00.340> that<00:05:00.639> somebody<00:05:01.389> spartan<00:05:01.719> figures<00:05:01.930> are

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
cup that somebody spartan figures are

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.230 
cup that somebody spartan figures are
reaching<00:05:02.289> for<00:05:02.409> you<00:05:02.560> take<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.919> gun<00:05:03.129> just<00:05:04.060> put

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
reaching for you take the gun just put

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.790 
reaching for you take the gun just put
it<00:05:04.330> in<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.479> hand<00:05:04.690> like<00:05:04.840> usual<00:05:05.169> but<00:05:05.349> then

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
it in the hand like usual but then

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.589 
it in the hand like usual but then
you're<00:05:05.919> going<00:05:06.009> to<00:05:06.069> use<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.310> index<00:05:06.490> finger<00:05:07.000> to

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
you're going to use the index finger to

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.529 
you're going to use the index finger to
loop<00:05:08.050> into<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.949> where<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.789> trigger<00:05:10.210> would<00:05:10.389> be

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
loop into the where the trigger would be

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.180 
loop into the where the trigger would be
that's<00:05:11.169> all<00:05:11.349> you<00:05:11.500> have<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:11.740> do<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:11.949> get<00:05:12.069> it<00:05:12.159> to

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
that's all you have to do to get it to

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.439 
that's all you have to do to get it to
hold<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.490> gun<00:05:13.319> it's<00:05:14.319> not<00:05:15.030> loose<00:05:16.030> as<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.270> can

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
hold the gun it's not loose as you can

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.119 
hold the gun it's not loose as you can
see<00:05:16.569> it's<00:05:16.690> not<00:05:16.780> falling<00:05:17.139> out<00:05:17.229> but<00:05:17.620> it's<00:05:17.770> not<00:05:17.919> in

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:18.129 
see it's not falling out but it's not in

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.589 
see it's not falling out but it's not in
there<00:05:18.370> in<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.639> way<00:05:18.759> you<00:05:18.819> just<00:05:19.180> don't<00:05:19.330> want<00:05:19.449> to<00:05:19.509> do

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
there in a way you just don't want to do

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:20.610 
there in a way you just don't want to do
it<00:05:19.690> too<00:05:19.840> much<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.110> where<00:05:20.199> you<00:05:20.289> break<00:05:20.469> the

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
it too much to where you break the

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.770 
it too much to where you break the
trigger<00:05:20.889> so<00:05:21.520> just<00:05:21.849> be<00:05:21.940> careful<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:22.479> doesn't

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
trigger so just be careful it doesn't

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.290 
trigger so just be careful it doesn't
have<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:23.080> be<00:05:23.199> really<00:05:24.099> snug<00:05:24.490> but<00:05:24.759> it<00:05:24.849> does<00:05:25.000> fit

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
have to be really snug but it does fit

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.899 
have to be really snug but it does fit
and<00:05:25.509> it's<00:05:25.599> not<00:05:25.719> falling<00:05:25.930> out<00:05:26.139> of<00:05:26.289> her<00:05:26.379> hands

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
and it's not falling out of her hands

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.909 
and it's not falling out of her hands
the<00:05:27.909> only<00:05:28.150> other<00:05:28.300> thing<00:05:28.599> about<00:05:29.080> this<00:05:29.469> series

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
the only other thing about this series

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.999 
the only other thing about this series
it<00:05:30.909> besides<00:05:31.419> it<00:05:31.569> being<00:05:31.779> I<00:05:32.080> think<00:05:32.380> personally

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
it besides it being I think personally

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.529 
it besides it being I think personally
it's<00:05:33.190> pretty<00:05:33.400> cool<00:05:33.580> that<00:05:33.969> they<00:05:34.090> did<00:05:34.300> include

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
it's pretty cool that they did include

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.959 
it's pretty cool that they did include
figures<00:05:34.960> from<00:05:35.110> Halo<00:05:35.469> Wars<00:05:35.650> I<00:05:35.949> mean<00:05:36.759> that<00:05:36.880> you

get the whole team there were three of
them<00:05:40.090> in<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.270> game<00:05:41.250> it's<00:05:42.250> just<00:05:42.460> probably<00:05:42.729> more

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
them in the game it's just probably more

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.480

of<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.810> hip<00:05:44.020> joints<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.469> hip<00:05:44.650> joints<00:05:45.039> tend<00:05:45.430> to

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
of the hip joints the hip joints tend to

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.879 
of the hip joints the hip joints tend to
get<00:05:45.610> a<00:05:45.639> bit<00:05:45.819> loose<00:05:46.120> over<00:05:46.930> time<00:05:47.139> but<00:05:47.560> if<00:05:47.740> you're
