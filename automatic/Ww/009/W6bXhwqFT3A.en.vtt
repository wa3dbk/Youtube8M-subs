against Pollock is key and this game

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.770 
against Pollock is key and this game
really<00:00:37.739> shocked<00:00:38.190> me<00:00:38.399> how<00:00:38.489> how<00:00:39.390> amazing<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.290> was

really shocked me how how amazing it was

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.190 
really shocked me how how amazing it was
so<00:00:42.780> let's<00:00:43.050> let's<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:43.770> right<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.960> so<00:00:45.960> they

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
so let's let's go right to it so they

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.319 
so let's let's go right to it so they
start<00:00:46.500> off<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> pretty<00:00:47.309> normal<00:00:47.969> opening

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
start off with a pretty normal opening

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.200 
start off with a pretty normal opening
the<00:00:48.809> old<00:00:49.020> Indian<00:00:50.989> then<00:00:52.520> just<00:00:53.520> regular

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the old Indian then just regular

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.529 
the old Indian then just regular
development<00:00:54.989> type<00:00:55.289> stuff<00:00:56.180> nothing<00:00:57.180> too<00:00:57.329> crazy

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
development type stuff nothing too crazy

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.630 
development type stuff nothing too crazy
yeah<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> game<00:00:58.410> starts<00:00:58.829> off<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.280> bit<00:00:59.430> so

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
yeah the game starts off a little bit so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.270 
yeah the game starts off a little bit so
this<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> smooth<00:01:00.530> shocks<00:01:01.530> me<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.010> another

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
this is the smooth shocks me but another

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.650 
this is the smooth shocks me but another
theory<00:01:02.640> anyway<00:01:03.120> don't<00:01:03.270> know<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.420> that's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
theory anyway don't know if that's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.929 
theory anyway don't know if that's
normal<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.320> abnormal<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:07.700> Queen<00:01:08.700> they're

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
normal or abnormal so here Queen they're

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
normal or abnormal so here Queen they're
surprises<00:01:09.510> me<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> bit<00:01:09.750> too<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.500> apparently

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
surprises me a bit too but apparently

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.190 
surprises me a bit too but apparently
it's<00:01:11.070> perfectly<00:01:11.430> fun<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:13.020> objectively

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
it's perfectly fun like it's objectively

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
it's perfectly fun like it's objectively
a<00:01:13.680> good<00:01:13.920> move<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:16.850> um<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:19.310> white<00:01:20.310> now

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
a good move so here um and white now

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
a good move so here um and white now
makes<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.180> mistake<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.869> small<00:01:22.229> mistake<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.860> not

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
makes a mistake a small mistake not not

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.649

there<00:04:05.150> now<00:04:06.889> what<00:04:07.889> has<00:04:08.040> two<00:04:08.250> options<00:04:08.430> in<00:04:08.970> the

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
there now what has two options in the

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.220 
there now what has two options in the
game<00:04:09.269> he<00:04:10.230> plays<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.560> rook<00:04:11.400> takes<00:04:11.579> h2<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.959> takes

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
game he plays a rook takes h2 and takes

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.550 
game he plays a rook takes h2 and takes
a<00:04:13.349> queen<00:04:13.560> but<00:04:14.340> he<00:04:14.700> could<00:04:14.940> have<00:04:15.169> taken<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.380> rook

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
a queen but he could have taken the rook

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.449 
a queen but he could have taken the rook
and<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:18.570> win<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:18.810> much<00:04:18.989> simpler<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.950> takes

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
and the win is much simpler it takes

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.850 
and the win is much simpler it takes
let's<00:04:21.000> go<00:04:21.150> over<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.359> anyway<00:04:21.509> so<00:04:21.959> C<00:04:22.590> takes

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
let's go over it anyway so C takes

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.379 
let's go over it anyway so C takes
throat<00:04:23.100> at<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.340> pond<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:24.410> take<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:26.389> it

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
throat at the pond and take this it

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.999 
throat at the pond and take this it
takes<00:04:28.099> takes<00:04:29.099> that<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:30.630> only<00:04:30.840> way<00:04:31.229> the

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
takes takes that and the only way the

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.249 
takes takes that and the only way the
only<00:04:32.039> way<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.490> White<00:04:32.759> has<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.300> Queen<00:04:33.569> take<00:04:33.810> C<00:04:34.050> 2

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
only way the White has is Queen take C 2

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.559 
only way the White has is Queen take C 2
so<00:04:35.130> that<00:04:35.370> basically<00:04:35.610> just<00:04:36.060> loses<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.419> game

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
so that basically just loses the game

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:43.189 
so that basically just loses the game
sax<00:04:37.349> is<00:04:37.530> clean<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.389> is<00:04:39.389> lost<00:04:40.039> so<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:43.080> yeah

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
sax is clean and is lost so so yeah

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.890 
sax is clean and is lost so so yeah
that's<00:04:43.349> why<00:04:43.680> back<00:04:44.039> here<00:04:44.340> he<00:04:44.639> is<00:04:44.759> typically<00:04:46.009> now

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
that's why back here he is typically now

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.260 
that's why back here he is typically now
this<00:04:48.900> position<00:04:49.440> at<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.400> moment<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.970> isn't

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
this position at the moment it isn't

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.999 
this position at the moment it isn't
really<00:04:51.479> that<00:04:51.599> clear<00:04:51.960> how<00:04:52.259> blacks<00:04:52.620> can

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
really that clear how blacks can

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.740 
really that clear how blacks can
complete<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.550> checkmate<00:04:54.000> because<00:04:54.419> there<00:04:54.599> are

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
complete the checkmate because there are

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.800 
complete the checkmate because there are
no<00:04:54.960> forcing<00:04:55.560> variations<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.460> just<00:04:56.910> finish

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
no forcing variations that just finish

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.379 
no forcing variations that just finish
it<00:04:57.930> off<00:04:58.080> like<00:04:58.770> in<00:04:58.919> most<00:04:59.099> situations<00:04:59.610> where<00:05:00.360> you

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
it off like in most situations where you

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.930 
it off like in most situations where you
