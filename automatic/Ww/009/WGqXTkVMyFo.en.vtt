00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
ways to score in the CFL game which I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.480 
ways to score in the CFL game which I
love<00:00:24.449> about<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.930> there's<00:00:25.740> no<00:00:25.859> such<00:00:26.070> thing<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.369> a

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
love about it there's no such thing as a

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.519 
love about it there's no such thing as a
fair<00:00:26.760> catch<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> punt<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.380> give<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
fair catch on a punt you have to give a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.679 
fair catch on a punt you have to give a
guy<00:00:28.680> five<00:00:28.980> yards<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.640> every<00:00:30.000> punters<00:00:30.330> return

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
guy five yards and every punters return

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.720 
guy five yards and every punters return
so<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> game<00:00:31.289> never<00:00:31.529> slows<00:00:31.830> down<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.430> fair

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
so the game never slows down for a fair

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.389 
so the game never slows down for a fair
catch<00:00:32.940> every<00:00:33.899> ball<00:00:33.930> has<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.649> returned<00:00:35.160> out

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
catch every ball has to be returned out

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.310 
catch every ball has to be returned out
of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.579> endzone<00:00:35.940> or<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.750> kicking<00:00:37.079> team

zones in some stadiums are as deep as 25
yards<00:00:44.070> long<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.850> throw<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> deep<00:00:45.300> ball

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.479 
yards long so you can throw a deep ball
on<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> 1-yard<00:00:45.899> line<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.680> want<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.280> a

on the 1-yard line if you want to so a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.940 
on the 1-yard line if you want to so a
lot<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.120> lot<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.329> differences<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.320> really

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
lot of a lot of differences but I really

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.410 
lot of a lot of differences but I really
like<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> game<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.820> was<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.120> fast

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
like the game because it was so fast

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
like the game because it was so fast
moving<00:00:51.809> there<00:00:52.440> was<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.710> many<00:00:52.829> different<00:00:52.920> ways

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
moving there was so many different ways

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.319 
moving there was so many different ways
to<00:00:53.520> score<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.090> were<00:00:54.180> always<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.899> I

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
to score that you were always in it I

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.819 
to score that you were always in it I
adjusted<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.480> all<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:58.710> know<00:00:58.800> I

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
adjusted to all that I don't know I

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.439 
adjusted to all that I don't know I
wouldn't<00:00:59.160> say<00:00:59.370> quickly<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.059> I'll<00:01:00.149> tell<00:01:00.359> you

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
wouldn't say quickly but I'll tell you

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.700 
wouldn't say quickly but I'll tell you
what<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.660> was<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.170> an<00:01:01.260> eye-opening

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
what it was it was an eye-opening

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.709 
what it was it was an eye-opening
experience<00:01:01.739> my<00:01:02.399> first<00:01:02.640> preseason<00:01:03.120> game<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
experience my first preseason game as a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
experience my first preseason game as a
rookie<00:01:03.960> watching<00:01:04.860> some<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> stuff<00:01:05.489> unfold

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
rookie watching some of the stuff unfold

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.880 
rookie watching some of the stuff unfold
I<00:01:06.180> remember<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> towards<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> end<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
I remember the towards the end of the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.820 
I remember the towards the end of the
game<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> tie<00:01:09.840> football<00:01:10.350> game<00:01:10.590> or

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
game it was like a tie football game or

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.560 
game it was like a tie football game or
I<00:01:10.860> think<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.189> were<00:01:11.369> ahead<00:01:11.490> by<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.540> two

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
I think we were ahead by one or two

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.300 
I think we were ahead by one or two
points<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.500> team<00:01:13.740> was<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> kick<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
points and a team was going to kick a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.580 
points and a team was going to kick a
field<00:01:14.580> goal<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.119> maybe<00:01:15.630> beat<00:01:15.930> us<00:01:16.080> well<00:01:16.470> they

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
field goal to maybe beat us well they

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.340 
field goal to maybe beat us well they
missed<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> field<00:01:17.100> goal<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.170> wouldn't

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
missed the field goal but if we wouldn't

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.710 
missed the field goal but if we wouldn't
have<00:01:19.409> returned<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.119> they<00:01:21.119> would<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.390> got<00:01:21.509> one

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
have returned it they would have got one

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.840 
have returned it they would have got one
point<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.350> would<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.590> tied<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> score<00:01:23.159> so

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
point and would have tied the score so

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.609 
point and would have tied the score so
but<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.180> were<00:01:24.299> able<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.570> punt<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> ball<00:01:25.110> back

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
but we were able to punt the ball back

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.170 
but we were able to punt the ball back
out<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.130> end<00:01:26.280> zone<00:01:26.400> believe<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> or<00:01:27.030> not

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
out of the end zone believe it or not

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.490 
out of the end zone believe it or not
and<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.659> were<00:01:27.780> able<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.080> catch<00:01:28.320> it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and then they were able to catch it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.080 
and then they were able to catch it
again<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.979> put<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.310> back<00:01:29.520> into<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> end<00:01:30.000> zone

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
again and put it back into the end zone

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.399 
again and put it back into the end zone

back to the NFL it wasn't any a big
adjustment<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.000> me<00:02:00.299> because<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.600> had<00:02:00.810> played

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079

that game all my life I played it from
the<00:02:03.180> time<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.420> was<00:02:03.689> ten<00:02:03.960> all<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> way<00:02:04.320> up

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the time I was ten all the way up

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.440 
the time I was ten all the way up
through<00:02:04.680> college<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:05.969> was<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.149> adjusting

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
through college so I was just adjusting

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.040 
through college so I was just adjusting
to<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.950> know<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.099> narrower<00:02:08.610> field<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
to you know a narrower field so the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.510 
to you know a narrower field so the
windows<00:02:10.349> weren't<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.830> be<00:02:10.950> as<00:02:11.069> big<00:02:11.280> as

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
windows weren't going to be as big as

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.670 
windows weren't going to be as big as
far<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:11.819> throwing<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> football

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
far as throwing the football

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.470

well<00:02:12.769> of<00:02:13.700> course<00:02:13.790> you're<00:02:14.150> playing<00:02:14.359> with

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
well of course you're playing with

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.819 
well of course you're playing with
better<00:02:14.659> players<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.319> National<00:02:15.709> Football

League every player at every position

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.929 
League every player at every position
was<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> great<00:02:18.140> player<00:02:18.439> so<00:02:19.310> those<00:02:19.700> are<00:02:19.849> the

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
was a great player so those are the

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.940 
was a great player so those are the
biggest<00:02:20.150> differences<00:02:20.420> for<00:02:20.870> me<00:02:21.079> learning<00:02:21.890> a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
biggest differences for me learning a

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.610 
biggest differences for me learning a
new<00:02:22.099> offense<00:02:22.549> coming<00:02:23.239> out<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.569> Canada<00:02:23.810> having

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
new offense coming out of Canada having

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.140 
new offense coming out of Canada having
been<00:02:24.799> in<00:02:24.890> one<00:02:25.069> offense<00:02:25.459> for<00:02:25.609> that<00:02:25.760> long<00:02:25.969> and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
been in one offense for that long and

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.059 
been in one offense for that long and
then<00:02:26.269> having<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.689> learn<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.870> new<00:02:27.049> offense<00:02:27.469> that

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
then having to learn a new offense that

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.679 
then having to learn a new offense that
was<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.280> change<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.000> then<00:02:29.120> learning<00:02:29.329> your<00:02:29.540> new

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
was a change and then learning your new

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.030 
was a change and then learning your new
personnel<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.439> players<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.859> you<00:02:30.920> were

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
personnel the players that you were

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.319 
personnel the players that you were
going<00:02:31.189> to<00:02:31.250> play<00:02:31.370> with<00:02:31.579> those<00:02:31.760> are<00:02:31.909> the<00:02:32.000> biggest

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
going to play with those are the biggest

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.240 
going to play with those are the biggest
differences<00:02:33.139> for<00:02:33.349> me<00:02:33.469> learning<00:02:33.739> new<00:02:33.980> players

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
differences for me learning new players

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.629 
differences for me learning new players
