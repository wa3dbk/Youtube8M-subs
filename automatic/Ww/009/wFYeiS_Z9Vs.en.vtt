00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.720 
few slides now and sliding is very
important<00:00:05.700> in<00:00:06.529> determining<00:00:07.550> whether<00:00:08.550> you're

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
right way to slide the first slide we're

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.500 
right way to slide the first slide we're
going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.260> talk<00:00:28.410> about<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.119> regular

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
foot first prevent leg slide what's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.910 
foot first prevent leg slide what's
going<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> happen

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
going to happen

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.630 
going to happen
as<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.250> get<00:00:35.370> close<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> base<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
as you get close to the base so the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.860 
as you get close to the base so the
thinnest<00:00:39.180> leg

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.690 

he's<00:00:43.199> live<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.710> innovate

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.040 

the<00:00:49.120> other<00:00:49.239> slide<00:00:49.420> we're<00:00:49.690> going<00:00:49.720> to<00:00:49.870> talk

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
the other slide we're going to talk

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.010 
the other slide we're going to talk
about<00:00:50.170> is<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.190> pop-up<00:00:51.520> slide<00:00:51.820> it's<00:00:52.780> very

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
about is the pop-up slide it's very

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.700 
about is the pop-up slide it's very
similar<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:54.149> except<00:00:55.149> when<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.390> go<00:00:55.570> in

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
similar to that except when you go in

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.610 
similar to that except when you go in
get<00:00:58.130> down<00:00:58.310> and<00:00:58.760> your<00:00:58.880> momentum<00:00:59.350> it's<00:01:00.350> going<00:01:00.560> to

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
get down and your momentum it's going to

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.740 
get down and your momentum it's going to
allow<00:01:00.740> you<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.920> hit<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.130> base<00:01:01.340> and<00:01:02.300> pop<00:01:02.540> up

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
allow you to hit the base and pop up

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.240 
allow you to hit the base and pop up
around<00:01:03.650> when<00:01:03.860> you<00:01:03.920> get<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.220> base<00:01:04.870> so<00:01:05.870> you

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
around when you get to the base so you

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.750 
around when you get to the base so you
utilize<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.810> spikes<00:01:09.140> on<00:01:09.350> your<00:01:09.470> shoes<00:01:09.760> are

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
utilize the spikes on your shoes are

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.620 
utilize the spikes on your shoes are
your<00:01:11.600> pleats<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.860> pop<00:01:13.070> up

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.370 

again<00:01:16.229> slides<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.970> down<00:01:18.479> gonna<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.110> sliding

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
again slides get down gonna be sliding

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.850 
again slides get down gonna be sliding
use<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:20.430> spices<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.000> stop<00:01:21.530> will<00:01:22.530> pop<00:01:22.740> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
use your spices to stop will pop you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.130 
use your spices to stop will pop you
back<00:01:22.890> up

slide<00:01:29.939> people<00:01:30.420> stealing<00:01:30.750> second<00:01:31.079> base<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
slide people stealing second base you

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.670 
slide people stealing second base you
might<00:01:32.250> want<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.460> avoid<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.850> more<00:01:33.060> when<00:01:33.240> you
