00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.120
 on the right date 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.450
 while others 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.940
 mistake it seems to me 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.560
 that's it and what makes us choose a technique rather than a 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.320
 other 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.809
 for sandra already here 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.190
 it is technical 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.610
 if she can not change 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.570
 until we find the right one 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.539
 he for example crew how 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:07.740
 to the die 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.130
 and that's okay it suits me 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.190
 they are in total a little more than twenty to follow these workshops 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.190

 on stage philip sion engineer existing 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.939
 here even when fishing is good the equation never ends in 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.240
 the plate all are released at the end of the session 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.970

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.460
 more and more alone 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.829
 the fisherman and the young fisherman 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.049
 release the fish 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.399
 to preserve the environment to focus on the intended product for whom it must 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.480
 still fun 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.850
 see go fishing 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.880

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.420
 An equation 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.440
 possible 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.640
