so<00:00:01.020> here<00:00:01.230> we're<00:00:01.350> going<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.530> change<00:00:01.740> out<00:00:01.920> each

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
so here we're going to change out each

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.220 
so here we're going to change out each
of<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.610> camper<00:00:03.360> arms<00:00:03.799> for<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.190> SPC<00:00:06.230> because

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
of a camper arms for the SPC because

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.259 
of a camper arms for the SPC because
these<00:00:08.189> ones<00:00:08.429> are<00:00:08.550> actually<00:00:08.639> maxed<00:00:09.120> out<00:00:09.240> to

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
these ones are actually maxed out to

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.410 
these ones are actually maxed out to
each<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.630> us<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.080> they<00:00:10.950> don't<00:00:11.130> give<00:00:11.460> us<00:00:11.610> even

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
each of us and they don't give us even

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.270 
each of us and they don't give us even
close<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:13.019> enough<00:00:13.049> positive<00:00:13.559> camber<00:00:14.009> to

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
close to enough positive camber to

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.090 
close to enough positive camber to
correct<00:00:14.610> what<00:00:14.880> we're<00:00:15.030> running<00:00:15.299> now<00:00:15.800> on<00:00:16.800> this

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
correct what we're running now on this

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.070 
correct what we're running now on this
particular<00:00:17.250> Z<00:00:17.760> we're<00:00:18.119> bottom<00:00:18.480> down<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.810> stance

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
particular Z we're bottom down on stance

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.279 
particular Z we're bottom down on stance
coilovers<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.660> we're<00:00:21.660> probably<00:00:21.869> running

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
coilovers and we're probably running

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.189 
coilovers and we're probably running
negative<00:00:22.980> five<00:00:23.369> camber<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.630> need<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> hell

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
negative five camber so we need a hell

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.990 
negative five camber so we need a hell
of<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.470> lot<00:00:25.650> more<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.340> able<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.550> correct<00:00:26.849> it

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
of a lot more to be able to correct it

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.570 
of a lot more to be able to correct it
and<00:00:27.260> these<00:00:28.260> two<00:00:28.560> are<00:00:28.740> actually<00:00:28.890> maxed<00:00:29.310> out<00:00:29.429> so

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and these two are actually maxed out so

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.729 
and these two are actually maxed out so
you<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.760> see<00:00:29.910> side-by-side<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:32.579> SPL<00:00:33.090> is

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
you can see side-by-side the SPL is

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.549 
you can see side-by-side the SPL is
almost<00:00:34.910> almost<00:00:35.910> an<00:00:36.210> inch<00:00:36.360> shorter<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.380> that's

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
almost almost an inch shorter so that's

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.110 
almost almost an inch shorter so that's
a<00:00:37.620> lot<00:00:37.860> more<00:00:37.980> camber<00:00:38.340> correction<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.940> you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
a lot more camber correction and you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.840 
a lot more camber correction and you
need<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.540> when<00:00:39.750> you're<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:39.989> low<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:41.040> we're

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
need that when you're this low so we're

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.400 
need that when you're this low so we're
going<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> toss<00:00:42.390> these<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.899> these<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.260> kind

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
going to toss these and these are kind

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.440 
going to toss these and these are kind
of<00:00:43.440> known<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.590> braking<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.100> well<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.520> kind<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
of known for braking as well so kind of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.630 
of known for braking as well so kind of
also<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.680> weight<00:00:46.860> difference<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
also the weight difference is of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.569 
also the weight difference is of
mentioning<00:00:48.350> this<00:00:49.350> one's<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.680> pop<00:00:50.219> metal

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
mentioning this one's like pop metal

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.610 
mentioning this one's like pop metal
steel<00:00:50.879> well<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> feels<00:00:52.050> much<00:00:52.379> more<00:00:52.559> like

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
steel well here it feels much more like

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.139 
steel well here it feels much more like
aluminum<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> welds<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.670> much<00:00:53.969> better

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
aluminum in the welds are much better

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.760 
aluminum in the welds are much better
quality<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.719> around<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> here's<00:00:58.559> where<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
quality all around so here's where the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.040 
quality all around so here's where the
stock<00:00:59.070> arm<00:00:59.280> placement<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
stock arm placement is you're going to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.139 
stock arm placement is you're going to
need<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.350> take<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.460> bolt<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.820> here

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
need to take out this bolt right here

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.170 
need to take out this bolt right here
and<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:04.650> lower<00:01:04.860> bolt<00:01:05.220> right<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.549> which<00:01:06.030> is

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and the lower bolt right here which is

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
and the lower bolt right here which is
the<00:01:06.299> adjustment<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:07.229> omit<00:01:07.530> bolts<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:07.950> only

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the adjustment just omit bolts so only

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.480 
the adjustment just omit bolts so only
one<00:01:08.460> side<00:01:08.700> comes<00:01:08.939> off<00:01:09.950> once<00:01:10.950> you've<00:01:11.130> taken

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
one side comes off once you've taken

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.640 
one side comes off once you've taken
those<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:12.380> you'll<00:01:13.380> drop<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.710> arm<00:01:14.580> out<00:01:14.729> and

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
those out you'll drop the arm out and

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.700 
those out you'll drop the arm out and
for<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> SPC<00:01:17.750> when<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.869> go<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.080> install<00:01:19.320> these

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
for the SPC when you go to install these

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.850 
for the SPC when you go to install these
newer<00:01:20.009> arms<00:01:20.340> you'll<00:01:21.090> need<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.420> cut<00:01:21.990> out<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.470> part

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
newer arms you'll need to cut out a part

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.429 
newer arms you'll need to cut out a part
of<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.840> subframe<00:01:24.840> right<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.259> where

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
of the subframe right here where

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.859 
of the subframe right here where
everything<00:01:25.740> bolts<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:27.720> I've

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
everything bolts up and you can see I've

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.480 
everything bolts up and you can see I've
already<00:01:27.990> put<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.680> template<00:01:29.189> which<00:01:29.310> they

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
already put on the template which they

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.120 
already put on the template which they
provide<00:01:29.850> okay<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.750> I'm<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.229> initially<00:01:31.680> cut<00:01:31.890> you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
provide okay so I'm to initially cut you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.999 
provide okay so I'm to initially cut you
can<00:01:32.280> see<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> blue<00:01:32.790> side<00:01:33.229> this<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> new<00:01:34.680> port

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
can see the blue side this is a new port

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.340 
can see the blue side this is a new port
that<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> cut<00:01:35.670> out<00:01:35.820> I'll<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.900> this

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that we have to cut out I'll use this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.569 
that we have to cut out I'll use this
bit<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:39.560> I'll<00:01:40.560> use<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.189> inside

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
bit and I'll use that on the inside

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.580 
bit and I'll use that on the inside
start<00:01:42.060> opening<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.659> tighten<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> up<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
start opening it up tighten it up and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770 
start opening it up tighten it up and
this<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> first<00:01:45.060> hole<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.600> one

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
this is for the first hole the one

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.330 
this is for the first hole the one
towards<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> rear<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.500> car<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.070> isn't

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
towards the rear of the car that isn't

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.660 
towards the rear of the car that isn't
blocked<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.270> use<00:01:48.450> my<00:01:48.479> drill<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:50.040> I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
blocked so I can use my drill and then I

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.420 
blocked so I can use my drill and then I
will<00:01:51.390> chase<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> these<00:01:52.920> two<00:01:53.220> it's

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
will chase it with one of these two it's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.550 
will chase it with one of these two it's
a<00:01:53.490> round<00:01:53.759> file<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.540> they're<00:01:55.320> very

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
a round file and they're very

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.830 
a round file and they're very
aggressively<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.610> work<00:01:56.909> very<00:01:56.939> nicely<00:01:57.570> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
aggressively they work very nicely it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.709 
aggressively they work very nicely it
was<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.229> much<00:01:58.350> effort<00:01:58.710> at<00:01:58.829> all<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
was not that much effort at all and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.870 
was not that much effort at all and
you'll<00:02:00.719> notice<00:02:00.990> these<00:02:01.110> are<00:02:01.170> smaller<00:02:01.729> than<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
you'll notice these are smaller than the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.950 
you'll notice these are smaller than the
curvature<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.329> need<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.689> use<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.619> file<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:05.130> so

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
curvature I need to use to file out so

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.600 
curvature I need to use to file out so
all<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:08.069> know<00:02:08.129> hold<00:02:08.459> up

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
all I have to do is you know hold up

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.240 
all I have to do is you know hold up
against<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.420> portion<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.989> need<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> cut

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
against the portion that I need to cut

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.070 
against the portion that I need to cut
make<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> cut<00:02:11.910> happen<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:12.870> take<00:02:13.050> your

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
make the cut happen you know take your

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.610 
make the cut happen you know take your
time<00:02:13.380> do<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.650> right<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.210> these<00:02:15.350> stencils<00:02:16.350> are

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
time do it right and these stencils are

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.770 
time do it right and these stencils are
actually<00:02:16.950> almost<00:02:17.880> spot-on<00:02:18.180> they're<00:02:18.510> really

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
actually almost spot-on they're really

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.170 
actually almost spot-on they're really
good<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.350> then<00:02:20.010> for<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> bottom<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.970> cut

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
good and then for the bottom of the cut

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.700 
good and then for the bottom of the cut
I'll<00:02:21.360> flatten<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.110> out<00:02:22.200> with<00:02:22.410> one<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
I'll flatten it out with one of the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.530 
I'll flatten it out with one of the
square<00:02:22.980> files<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.970> makes<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.300> really

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
square files and that makes a really

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:37.420 
square files and that makes a really
nice<00:02:24.750> clean<00:02:25.020> cut<00:02:25.350> all<00:02:25.500> around

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.210 

go<00:02:38.150> ahead<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.480> line<00:02:38.629> up<00:02:38.659> the<00:02:38.810> second<00:02:39.230> mark<00:02:39.440> I

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
go ahead and line up the second mark I

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.940 
go ahead and line up the second mark I
use<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.909> flat<00:02:41.150> part<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:42.019> notches<00:02:42.260> because

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
use the flat part of the notches because

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.470 
use the flat part of the notches because
you<00:02:43.069> can't<00:02:43.250> line<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.519> up<00:02:43.640> using<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:44.299> other

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
you can't line it up using the other

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.449 
you can't line it up using the other
side<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:45.440> other<00:02:45.470> side<00:02:45.739> has<00:02:45.860> bumps<00:02:46.159> it<00:02:46.280> just

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
side the other side has bumps it just

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.250 
side the other side has bumps it just
lines<00:02:46.640> right<00:02:46.849> up<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.569> side<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.900> got<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.110> line

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
lines right up this side you got to line

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.979 
lines right up this side you got to line
it<00:02:48.290> up<00:02:48.440> kind<00:02:48.769> of<00:02:48.830> with<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.159> crease<00:02:49.400> here<00:02:49.730> and

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
it up kind of with the crease here and

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.320 
it up kind of with the crease here and
make<00:02:50.989> sure<00:02:51.019> you're<00:02:51.349> going<00:02:51.500> level<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.000> adjust

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
make sure you're going level so adjust

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:03.699 
make sure you're going level so adjust
it<00:02:53.450> very<00:02:53.659> finely<00:03:00.010> then<00:03:01.010> use<00:03:01.549> a<00:03:01.579> clamp<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:03.560> get

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
it very finely then use a clamp to get

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:04.930 
it very finely then use a clamp to get
the<00:03:03.860> stencil<00:03:04.340> on<00:03:04.549> there

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
the stencil on there

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.869 
the stencil on there
clap<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.629> nice<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:05.810> tight<00:03:06.610> then<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.670> have<00:03:07.790> to

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
clap it nice and tight then you have to

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.330 
clap it nice and tight then you have to
carefully<00:03:08.269> go<00:03:08.390> in<00:03:08.540> there<00:03:08.690> with<00:03:08.810> your<00:03:08.930> marker

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
carefully go in there with your marker

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.039 
carefully go in there with your marker
which<00:03:10.340> if<00:03:10.609> you're<00:03:10.940> lucky<00:03:11.390> it'll<00:03:11.510> fit<00:03:11.810> through

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
which if you're lucky it'll fit through

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.789 
which if you're lucky it'll fit through
the<00:03:12.489> stock<00:03:13.489> hole<00:03:13.760> if<00:03:13.910> you're<00:03:14.030> using<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.329> Sharpie

the stock hole if you're using a Sharpie

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.309 
the stock hole if you're using a Sharpie
just<00:03:15.799> barely<00:03:16.099> and<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:17.660> can<00:03:17.810> mark<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.200> other

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
just barely and you can mark the other

washer is flush up against the back
really<00:04:12.610> nice<00:04:12.790> and<00:04:13.000> tight<00:04:13.120> until<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:13.510> hear

really nice and tight until you hear

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.110 
really nice and tight until you hear
everything<00:04:13.930> click<00:04:14.320> and<00:04:14.500> feels<00:04:14.680> solid<00:04:15.250> then

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
everything click and feels solid then

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.340 
everything click and feels solid then
you're<00:04:16.239> going<00:04:16.360> to<00:04:16.420> test<00:04:16.900> run<00:04:17.140> everything

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
you're going to test run everything

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.020 
you're going to test run everything
through<00:04:17.530> you<00:04:18.310> gotta<00:04:18.460> make<00:04:18.640> sure<00:04:18.700> that<00:04:18.880> this

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
through you gotta make sure that this

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.180 
through you gotta make sure that this
bolt<00:04:19.450> will<00:04:19.690> fully<00:04:20.050> rotate<00:04:20.560> around<00:04:20.710> the<00:04:20.980> back

bolt will fully rotate around the back

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.770 
bolt will fully rotate around the back
so<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:21.489> have<00:04:21.520> full<00:04:21.820> adjustability<00:04:22.360> and

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
so you have full adjustability and

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.170 
so you have full adjustability and
you'll<00:04:23.350> notice<00:04:23.560> mine<00:04:23.890> got<00:04:24.100> caught<00:04:24.400> right

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
you'll notice mine got caught right

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.900 
you'll notice mine got caught right
before<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.810> sweeps<00:04:26.230> all<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.530> way<00:04:26.620> back<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.850> I

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
before it sweeps all the way back so I

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.610 
before it sweeps all the way back so I
have<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.180> figure<00:04:28.390> out<00:04:28.540> which<00:04:28.840> one<00:04:29.080> that<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.410> and

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
have to figure out which one that is and

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.370 
have to figure out which one that is and
then<00:04:29.920> keep<00:04:30.520> filing<00:04:31.030> until<00:04:31.150> I<00:04:31.330> can<00:04:31.570> fully<00:04:31.780> clear

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
then keep filing until I can fully clear

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.290 
then keep filing until I can fully clear
so<00:04:33.070> once<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.490> know<00:04:33.520> everything<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.120> cut

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
so once you know everything is cut

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.030 
so once you know everything is cut
correctly<00:04:34.600> you'll<00:04:35.350> be<00:04:35.470> able<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.710> take<00:04:35.890> the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
correctly you'll be able to take the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.210 
correctly you'll be able to take the
bolt<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.580> rotate<00:04:37.450> it<00:04:37.570> and<00:04:37.800> you'll<00:04:38.800> get<00:04:38.950> full

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
bolt and rotate it and you'll get full

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.480 
bolt and rotate it and you'll get full
range<00:04:39.490> of<00:04:39.700> adjustment<00:04:41.010> so<00:04:42.010> when<00:04:42.160> you're<00:04:42.280> ready

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
range of adjustment so when you're ready

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.180 
range of adjustment so when you're ready
to<00:04:42.670> install<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.690> new<00:04:43.720> arms<00:04:44.230> you<00:04:44.830> want<00:04:44.950> to<00:04:45.070> make

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
to install the new arms you want to make

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.920 
to install the new arms you want to make
sure<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.670> threads<00:04:45.970> are<00:04:46.090> evenly<00:04:46.630> gapped

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
sure that the threads are evenly gapped

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.260 
sure that the threads are evenly gapped
on<00:04:47.110> both<00:04:47.290> sides<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:48.490> can<00:04:48.610> just<00:04:48.850> turn<00:04:49.030> you

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
on both sides and you can just turn you

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.910 
on both sides and you can just turn you
know<00:04:49.390> one<00:04:49.600> end<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:49.990> adjust<00:04:50.470> that<00:04:50.620> until

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
know one end to adjust that until

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.050 
know one end to adjust that until
they're<00:04:51.070> both<00:04:51.190> even<00:04:51.630> I<00:04:52.770> went<00:04:53.770> ahead<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.060> did

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
they're both even I went ahead and did

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.610 
they're both even I went ahead and did
the<00:04:55.900> hub's

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
the hub's

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.400 
the hub's
assembly<00:04:57.130> side<00:04:57.340> first<00:04:57.940> because<00:04:58.840> that<00:04:58.870> side<00:04:59.260> is

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
assembly side first because that side is

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.860 
assembly side first because that side is
a<00:04:59.440> little<00:04:59.710> easier<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.130> pull<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.790> once<00:05:01.600> you<00:05:01.720> go

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
a little easier to pull and once you go

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.350 
a little easier to pull and once you go
to<00:05:01.930> bolt<00:05:02.260> this<00:05:02.560> side<00:05:02.770> it<00:05:02.920> has<00:05:03.040> more<00:05:03.220> play

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.210 

so<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:06.990> like<00:05:07.259> to<00:05:07.289> clean<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.740> threads<00:05:07.949> on<00:05:08.129> the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
so I like to clean the threads on the

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.100 
so I like to clean the threads on the
bolts<00:05:08.460> before<00:05:08.729> putting<00:05:08.939> them<00:05:09.090> back<00:05:09.240> in<00:05:09.509> so

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
bolts before putting them back in so

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.480 
bolts before putting them back in so
that<00:05:10.229> when<00:05:10.349> you<00:05:10.500> go<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:10.770> spin<00:05:11.039> the<00:05:11.129> nut<00:05:11.310> back

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
that when you go and spin the nut back

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.339 
that when you go and spin the nut back
on<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:15.210> makes<00:05:15.419> things<00:05:15.629> a<00:05:15.719> lot<00:05:15.840> easier

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
on it makes things a lot easier

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.719 
on it makes things a lot easier
so<00:05:16.889> this<00:05:17.159> bolt<00:05:17.400> right<00:05:17.520> here<00:05:18.080> you<00:05:19.080> want<00:05:19.349> a<00:05:19.729> fifty

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
so this bolt right here you want a fifty

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.080 
so this bolt right here you want a fifty
nine<00:05:20.870> five<00:05:21.870> nine<00:05:21.900> two<00:05:22.650> seven<00:05:22.860> zero

be towards the rear again go ahead and

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.209 
be towards the rear again go ahead and
slide<00:05:50.039> the<00:05:50.129> bolts<00:05:50.370> in<00:05:51.560> and<00:05:52.560> you're<00:05:53.039> going<00:05:53.159> to

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:53.219 
slide the bolts in and you're going to

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.670 
slide the bolts in and you're going to
put<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.490> other<00:05:53.550> washer<00:05:54.270> on<00:05:54.419> of<00:05:54.539> course<00:05:54.680> but

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
put the other washer on of course but

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.950 
put the other washer on of course but
when<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:55.979> torque<00:05:56.310> this<00:05:56.819> bolt<00:05:57.180> you<00:05:57.719> have<00:05:57.840> to

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
when you torque this bolt you have to

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.430 
when you torque this bolt you have to
torque<00:05:58.229> it<00:05:58.409> on<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:59.370> nut<00:05:59.669> on<00:05:59.879> the<00:06:00.180> backside

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
torque it on the nut on the backside

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.469 
torque it on the nut on the backside
which<00:06:01.440> is<00:06:01.650> rather<00:06:01.860> hard<00:06:02.190> because<00:06:02.699> you<00:06:03.240> can't

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
which is rather hard because you can't

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.059 
which is rather hard because you can't
get<00:06:03.539> a<00:06:03.599> torque<00:06:03.870> wrench<00:06:03.990> on<00:06:04.169> it<00:06:04.199> unless<00:06:04.949> you

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
get a torque wrench on it unless you

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:06.890 
get a torque wrench on it unless you
have<00:06:05.159> the<00:06:05.250> rear<00:06:05.400> sway<00:06:05.669> bar<00:06:05.849> off<00:06:06.060> which<00:06:06.479> you

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
have the rear sway bar off which you

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.469 
have the rear sway bar off which you
know<00:06:07.020> you<00:06:07.080> notice<00:06:07.469> we<00:06:07.740> didn't<00:06:08.009> do<00:06:08.069> that<00:06:08.099> but<00:06:09.000> I

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
know you notice we didn't do that but I

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.480 
know you notice we didn't do that but I
just<00:06:10.199> got<00:06:10.379> my<00:06:10.409> torque<00:06:10.800> wrench<00:06:10.830> put<00:06:11.219> on<00:06:11.370> this

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
just got my torque wrench put on this

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.610 
just got my torque wrench put on this
side<00:06:11.759> and<00:06:12.029> I<00:06:12.389> gauged<00:06:12.690> about<00:06:12.990> how<00:06:13.169> much<00:06:13.349> force

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
side and I gauged about how much force

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.559 
side and I gauged about how much force
if<00:06:13.949> I'm<00:06:14.099> doing<00:06:14.340> it<00:06:14.400> equally<00:06:14.789> until<00:06:15.210> I<00:06:15.300> hear<00:06:15.539> a

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
if I'm doing it equally until I hear a

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:17.689 
if I'm doing it equally until I hear a
click<00:06:15.930> and<00:06:16.080> that's<00:06:16.590> how<00:06:16.800> I<00:06:16.830> torque<00:06:17.190> this<00:06:17.400> one

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
click and that's how I torque this one

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:22.279 
click and that's how I torque this one
and<00:06:17.909> again<00:06:18.330> it's<00:06:18.629> 48<00:06:19.050> to<00:06:19.199> 59<00:06:20.659> one<00:06:21.659> thing<00:06:21.930> on<00:06:22.080> the

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
and again it's 48 to 59 one thing on the

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.329 
and again it's 48 to 59 one thing on the
new<00:06:22.650> spc<00:06:23.370> hardware<00:06:24.000> is<00:06:24.150> the<00:06:24.810> rear<00:06:25.080> nut<00:06:25.770> here<00:06:26.159> on

00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:26.339 
new spc hardware is the rear nut here on

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:30.320 
new spc hardware is the rear nut here on
the<00:06:26.879> back<00:06:27.120> is<00:06:27.389> a<00:06:27.449> 19<00:06:27.990> as<00:06:28.229> well<00:06:28.500> so<00:06:29.039> it's<00:06:29.219> both<00:06:29.370> 19

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
the back is a 19 as well so it's both 19

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.110 
the back is a 19 as well so it's both 19

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
and 19 and then on the hub is 17 17

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.990 
and 19 and then on the hub is 17 17
which<00:06:33.750> the<00:06:33.990> old<00:06:34.199> om<00:06:34.949> hardware<00:06:35.370> is<00:06:35.639> 19<00:06:36.449> and<00:06:36.690> 17
