00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.700 
so that it's growing for you a savings
account<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.780> generally<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.469> sit

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
account is generally just going to sit

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.170 
account is generally just going to sit
there<00:00:58.920> sometimes<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.399> even<00:00:59.430> loses<00:00:59.969> money

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
there sometimes it even loses money

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.110 
there sometimes it even loses money
because<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.899> inflation<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.460> didn't<00:01:03.000> hear

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
because of inflation so I didn't hear

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.210 
because of inflation so I didn't hear
Tom<00:01:03.329> mentioning<00:01:03.809> anywhere<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.739> he<00:01:04.979> has

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220

started investing that would be my first

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.960 
started investing that would be my first
recommendation<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.830> most<00:01:08.369> people<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:08.790> do

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
recommendation so most people don't do

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.890 
recommendation so most people don't do
this<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.450> don't<00:01:09.659> know<00:01:09.750> how<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900

this because they don't know how to
invest<00:01:10.110> they're<00:01:10.439> really<00:01:10.650> nervous<00:01:10.890> they're

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
invest they're really nervous they're

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.219 
invest they're really nervous they're
like<00:01:11.640> oh<00:01:11.790> my<00:01:11.939> god<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> know<00:01:12.360> how<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> pick<00:01:12.780> stocks
