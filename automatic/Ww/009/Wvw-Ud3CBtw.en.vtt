00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
adjust the temperature with this side so

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.249 
adjust the temperature with this side so
that<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.729> minute<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:43.090> setting<00:01:43.390> 21<00:01:43.750> degrees<00:01:44.079> so

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
hot enough just go back to program then

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.740 
hot enough just go back to program then
you<00:01:51.159> can<00:01:51.340> up<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.789> temperature<00:01:52.330> what<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:53.380> do

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750

which<00:01:57.850> is<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.149> off<00:01:58.330> period<00:01:58.659> yeah<00:01:59.140> so<00:01:59.409> it<00:01:59.470> turns

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
which is the off period yeah so it turns

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.630 
which is the off period yeah so it turns
off<00:01:59.920> 8<00:02:00.130> o'clock<00:02:00.490> yep<00:02:00.880> cool<00:02:01.119> yes<00:02:02.159> right<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.429> lot

of people get stuck on this 18 yeah what

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.339 
of people get stuck on this 18 yeah what
that<00:02:06.789> is<00:02:06.939> is<00:02:07.330> called<00:02:07.599> a<00:02:07.659> night<00:02:07.840> set<00:02:08.170> back

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
that is is called a night set back

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.430 
that is is called a night set back
temperature<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.729> when<00:02:10.269> you're<00:02:10.450> heating<00:02:10.810> turns

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
temperature so when you're heating turns

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.250 
temperature so when you're heating turns
off<00:02:11.799> you're<00:02:12.760> saying<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.660> don't<00:02:13.900> want<00:02:14.049> the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
off you're saying you don't want the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.100 
off you're saying you don't want the
heat<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.980> drop<00:02:15.220> below<00:02:15.459> 16<00:02:16.299> degrees<00:02:16.660> as

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
heat in to drop below 16 degrees as

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.500 
heat in to drop below 16 degrees as
although<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.829> heat<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.370> switched<00:02:18.640> off<00:02:18.880> it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
although the heat and is switched off it

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.870 
although the heat and is switched off it
will<00:02:19.720> come<00:02:20.019> back<00:02:20.170> on<00:02:20.440> if<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.829> drops<00:02:21.070> below<00:02:21.220> 16

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
will come back on if it drops below 16

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.210 
will come back on if it drops below 16
okay<00:02:22.329> cool<00:02:22.630> because<00:02:23.019> they<00:02:23.140> reckon<00:02:23.739> it's<00:02:23.859> it's

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
okay cool because they reckon it's it's

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.310 
okay cool because they reckon it's it's
it's<00:02:24.609> more<00:02:24.850> efficient<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.420> keep<00:02:25.660> house<00:02:26.019> at<00:02:26.290> a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
it's more efficient to keep house at a

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.650 
it's more efficient to keep house at a
certain<00:02:26.709> temperature<00:02:27.130> than<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.180> it's

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
certain temperature than have it it's

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.840 
certain temperature than have it it's
only<00:02:28.870> north<00:02:29.140> Baron<00:02:29.500> stone<00:02:29.859> cold<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.400> heating

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
only north Baron stone cold and heating

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.210 
only north Baron stone cold and heating
it<00:02:30.910> by<00:02:31.150> only<00:02:31.540> going<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.870> stone<00:02:32.079> cold<00:02:32.109> so<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:32.920> I

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
it by only going to stone cold so I I

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.099 
it by only going to stone cold so I I
always<00:02:33.640> drop<00:02:33.819> it<00:02:34.000> down<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.180> about<00:02:34.359> 14<00:02:34.900> though

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
always drop it down to about 14 though

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.870 
always drop it down to about 14 though
so<00:02:35.530> okay<00:02:35.890> cool<00:02:36.100> if<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.340> want<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.549> walk<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.850> then

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
so okay cool if you want to walk it then

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.800 
very confusing I use this kind of
explain<00:04:46.789> what<00:04:47.789> you<00:04:47.909> then<00:04:48.090> do<00:04:48.300> once<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.780> settle

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
explain what you then do once you settle

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.260 
explain what you then do once you settle
that<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.620> put<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:49.889> to<00:04:49.979> auto<00:04:50.190> yeah<00:04:50.849> and<00:04:51.090> that

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
that you put it to auto yeah and that

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.510 
that you put it to auto yeah and that
will<00:04:51.389> automatically<00:04:52.139> use<00:04:52.620> at<00:04:52.889> times<00:04:53.220> and

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
will automatically use at times and

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.339 
will automatically use at times and
temperatures<00:04:53.849> you've<00:04:54.270> just<00:04:54.539> preset<00:04:54.810> into

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
temperatures you've just preset into

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.610 
temperatures you've just preset into
this<00:04:55.470> okay<00:04:56.070> because<00:04:56.940> it's<00:04:57.270> a<00:04:57.389> summer<00:04:57.659> now<00:04:58.560> you

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
this okay because it's a summer now you

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.469 
this okay because it's a summer now you
want<00:04:58.889> your<00:04:59.009> heating<00:04:59.280> off<00:04:59.430> push<00:04:59.940> this<00:05:00.150> all<00:05:00.449> the

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
want your heating off push this all the

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.540 
want your heating off push this all the
way<00:05:00.570> down<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:00.990> off<00:05:01.199> then<00:05:01.919> we<00:05:02.070> got<00:05:02.220> a<00:05:02.250> frost

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
way down to off then we got a frost

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.550 
way down to off then we got a frost
temperature<00:05:02.940> five<00:05:03.150> degrees<00:05:03.479> so<00:05:03.960> your<00:05:04.110> heating

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
temperature five degrees so your heating

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.620 
temperature five degrees so your heating
will<00:05:04.680> never<00:05:04.860> come<00:05:05.099> on<00:05:05.250> unless<00:05:05.970> it<00:05:06.180> drops<00:05:06.419> below

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
will never come on unless it drops below

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.110 
will never come on unless it drops below
five<00:05:06.900> degrees<00:05:07.289> but<00:05:07.979> then<00:05:08.159> if<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.699> want<00:05:08.909> to<00:05:08.970> put

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
five degrees but then if you want to put

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.850 
five degrees but then if you want to put
up<00:05:09.210> into<00:05:09.389> manual<00:05:09.720> what<00:05:10.229> you<00:05:10.349> can<00:05:10.500> do<00:05:10.650> is<00:05:10.770> open

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
up into manual what you can do is open

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.800 
up into manual what you can do is open
up<00:05:11.280> put<00:05:12.000> this<00:05:12.090> on<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.419> man

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
up put this on to man

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.749 
up put this on to man
for<00:05:13.080> manual<00:05:13.259> then<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:13.979> can<00:05:14.130> manually<00:05:14.460> put<00:05:14.550> a

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
for manual then you can manually put a

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.270 
for manual then you can manually put a
temperature<00:05:15.330> so<00:05:15.900> our<00:05:16.289> target<00:05:16.590> temperature<00:05:17.250> is

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
temperature so our target temperature is

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.310 
temperature so our target temperature is
26<00:05:17.820> degrees<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.509> little<00:05:18.690> flames<00:05:18.930> come<00:05:19.199> up

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
26 degrees so the little flames come up

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.430 
26 degrees so the little flames come up
so<00:05:20.070> the<00:05:20.699> room<00:05:20.940> temperature<00:05:21.270> is<00:05:21.810> twenty<00:05:22.289> four

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
so the room temperature is twenty four

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.740 
so the room temperature is twenty four
twenty<00:05:22.949> four<00:05:23.280> point<00:05:23.550> five<00:05:23.789> yeah<00:05:24.150> it<00:05:24.360> probably

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
twenty four point five yeah it probably

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.120 
twenty four point five yeah it probably
will<00:05:24.900> go<00:05:25.020> because<00:05:25.259> I'm<00:05:25.349> holding<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.889> stack

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
will go because I'm holding the stack

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.029 
will go because I'm holding the stack
because<00:05:26.490> I've<00:05:26.550> seen<00:05:26.729> my<00:05:26.820> body<00:05:27.030> heat<00:05:27.330> the

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
because I've seen my body heat the

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.749 
because I've seen my body heat the
temperature<00:05:29.039> up<00:05:29.130> so<00:05:29.280> if<00:05:29.539> this<00:05:30.539> box<00:05:30.870> not

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
temperature up so if this box not

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.269 
temperature up so if this box not
anywhere<00:05:32.759> else<00:05:32.820> well<00:05:33.659> wherever<00:05:34.620> you<00:05:34.860> put<00:05:35.070> this

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
anywhere else well wherever you put this

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.370 
anywhere else well wherever you put this
obviously<00:05:36.000> this<00:05:36.330> is<00:05:36.510> a<00:05:36.539> room<00:05:36.779> stat<00:05:37.110> so<00:05:37.320> you

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
obviously this is a room stat so you

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.469 
obviously this is a room stat so you
don't<00:05:37.529> want<00:05:37.650> to<00:05:37.710> be<00:05:37.800> sticking

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
don't want to be sticking

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.119 
don't want to be sticking
and<00:05:39.479> anywhere<00:05:40.139> that's<00:05:40.649> where<00:05:40.979> the

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:41.129 
and anywhere that's where the

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:42.709 
and anywhere that's where the
temperature<00:05:41.459> reading<00:05:41.789> kids<00:05:42.029> it<00:05:42.269> comes<00:05:42.539> from

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 
temperature reading kids it comes from

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.649 
temperature reading kids it comes from
this<00:05:42.989> no<00:05:43.619> no<00:05:43.949> so<00:05:44.489> it<00:05:45.029> won't<00:05:45.299> get<00:05:45.419> hawks

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
this no no so it won't get hawks

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.329 
this no no so it won't get hawks
obviously<00:05:45.989> I'm<00:05:46.079> holding<00:05:46.499> it<00:05:46.829> learn<00:05:47.009> the<00:05:47.099> same

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:47.339 
obviously I'm holding it learn the same

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.129 
obviously I'm holding it learn the same
hands<00:05:47.639> but<00:05:47.849> the<00:05:48.359> room<00:05:48.539> temperature<00:05:48.869> the

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
hands but the room temperature the

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.749 
hands but the room temperature the
minutes<00:05:49.409> twenty<00:05:49.709> four<00:05:49.919> point<00:05:50.159> five<00:05:50.339> so<00:05:50.579> if<00:05:50.669> I

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
minutes twenty four point five so if I

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.239 
minutes twenty four point five so if I
drop<00:05:51.029> below<00:05:51.239> that<00:05:51.619> so<00:05:52.619> if<00:05:52.709> I<00:05:52.829> set<00:05:53.099> our

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:53.249 
drop below that so if I set our

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:56.239 
drop below that so if I set our
temperature<00:05:53.789> down<00:05:53.819> to<00:05:53.969> say<00:05:54.599> twenty<00:05:54.929> two<00:05:55.249> it

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:56.249 
temperature down to say twenty two it

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:57.709 
temperature down to say twenty two it
will<00:05:56.369> say<00:05:56.489> target<00:05:56.789> temperature<00:05:57.299> twenty<00:05:57.599> to

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
will say target temperature twenty to

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:59.269 
will say target temperature twenty to
revert<00:05:58.259> back<00:05:58.289> to<00:05:58.559> the<00:05:58.769> room<00:05:59.039> temperature

00:05:59.269 --> 00:05:59.279 
revert back to the room temperature

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.789 
revert back to the room temperature
which<00:05:59.849> is<00:06:00.059> twenty<00:06:00.569> four<00:06:00.719> point<00:06:00.929> five<00:06:01.139> and<00:06:01.439> then

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:01.799 
which is twenty four point five and then

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:04.489 
which is twenty four point five and then
our<00:06:01.949> little<00:06:02.129> stats<00:06:02.429> gone<00:06:02.639> off<00:06:03.109> if<00:06:04.109> I<00:06:04.199> turn<00:06:04.379> it

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:04.499 
our little stats gone off if I turn it

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.669 
our little stats gone off if I turn it
back<00:06:04.529> up<00:06:04.799> again<00:06:04.889> will<00:06:05.159> take<00:06:05.189> up<00:06:05.489> to<00:06:05.609> twenty<00:06:05.849> six

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:06.679 
back up again will take up to twenty six

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:09.019 
back up again will take up to twenty six
the<00:06:07.679> old<00:06:07.829> flames<00:06:08.129> come<00:06:08.429> on<00:06:08.579> so<00:06:08.759> we're<00:06:08.849> trying

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.029 
the old flames come on so we're trying

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:12.829 
the old flames come on so we're trying
to<00:06:09.179> increase<00:06:09.769> from<00:06:11.209> where's<00:06:12.209> twenty<00:06:12.629> four

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:12.839 
to increase from where's twenty four

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.209 
to increase from where's twenty four
point<00:06:13.019> five<00:06:13.229> and<00:06:13.529> then<00:06:13.649> it's<00:06:13.829> just<00:06:13.979> picking

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
point five and then it's just picking

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.009 
point five and then it's just picking
signal<00:06:14.489> up<00:06:14.579> a<00:06:14.610> little<00:06:14.879> fired<00:06:15.149> or<00:06:15.269> boil<00:06:15.419> up<00:06:15.599> good

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:16.019 
signal up a little fired or boil up good

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:17.989 
signal up a little fired or boil up good
okay<00:06:16.349> and<00:06:16.379> obviously<00:06:16.559> that<00:06:16.919> is<00:06:16.949> on<00:06:17.219> manual<00:06:17.789> and

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:17.999 
okay and obviously that is on manual and

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:20.719 
okay and obviously that is on manual and
if<00:06:18.479> you<00:06:18.569> want<00:06:18.719> to<00:06:18.809> go<00:06:18.899> back<00:06:19.079> to<00:06:19.229> water<00:06:19.579> you<00:06:20.579> put

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
if you want to go back to water you put

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.449 
if you want to go back to water you put
it<00:06:20.849> back<00:06:20.939> to<00:06:21.089> water<00:06:21.239> unless<00:06:22.049> it<00:06:22.259> is<00:06:23.249> that

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:23.459 
it back to water unless it is that

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:23.899 
it back to water unless it is that
simple

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909

it gets just touch just leave it on two
off<00:06:40.919> yet<00:06:41.159> work<00:06:41.399> we've<00:06:41.609> got<00:06:41.729> to<00:06:41.819> run<00:06:42.269> up<00:06:42.389> the

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
off yet work we've got to run up the

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:50.929 
off yet work we've got to run up the
heating<00:06:42.689> first<00:06:43.110> so<00:06:49.189> this<00:06:50.189> is<00:06:50.369> the<00:06:50.519> tip<00:06:50.729> this<00:06:50.879> is

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:50.939 
heating first so this is the tip this is

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:52.699 
heating first so this is the tip this is
the<00:06:51.239> stat<00:06:51.509> for<00:06:51.749> the<00:06:51.809> heating<00:06:52.019> system<00:06:52.559> that

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:52.709 
the stat for the heating system that

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:55.159 
the stat for the heating system that
will<00:06:53.129> determine<00:06:53.489> how<00:06:53.879> hot<00:06:54.179> the<00:06:54.299> radiators<00:06:54.869> get

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
will determine how hot the radiators get

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.409 
will determine how hot the radiators get
you<00:06:55.739> want<00:06:55.949> to<00:06:55.979> be<00:06:56.129> leaving<00:06:56.579> it<00:06:56.699> quite<00:06:57.119> high<00:06:57.389> I

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 
you want to be leaving it quite high I

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:58.909 
you want to be leaving it quite high I
normally<00:06:57.929> leave<00:06:58.019> one<00:06:58.169> about<00:06:58.379> number<00:06:58.649> five

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
normally leave one about number five

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.949 
normally leave one about number five
because<00:06:59.610> you<00:06:59.879> want<00:07:00.029> the<00:07:00.119> rads<00:07:00.329> to<00:07:00.539> get<00:07:00.689> as<00:07:00.779> hot

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:00.959 
because you want the rads to get as hot

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:03.079 
because you want the rads to get as hot
as<00:07:01.110> they<00:07:01.229> possibly<00:07:01.739> can<00:07:02.099> in<00:07:02.429> a<00:07:02.549> short<00:07:02.579> space<00:07:03.029> of

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:03.089 
as they possibly can in a short space of

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.109 
as they possibly can in a short space of
time<00:07:03.299> and<00:07:03.839> then<00:07:03.989> you<00:07:04.019> just<00:07:04.319> use<00:07:04.469> this<00:07:04.709> for<00:07:04.979> the

00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:05.119 
time and then you just use this for the

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:07.669 
time and then you just use this for the
government<00:07:06.119> who<00:07:06.209> have<00:07:06.389> the<00:07:06.539> temperature<00:07:06.989> the

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:07.679 
government who have the temperature the

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:13.219 
government who have the temperature the
races<00:07:10.459> cool<00:07:11.489> do<00:07:12.360> I<00:07:12.419> need<00:07:12.539> to<00:07:12.689> remember<00:07:12.959> what

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229 
races cool do I need to remember what

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:15.529 
races cool do I need to remember what
those<00:07:13.379> plots<00:07:13.739> were<00:07:14.009> not<00:07:14.879> where<00:07:15.029> these<00:07:15.179> nine<00:07:15.360> I

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 
those plots were not where these nine I

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:17.239 
those plots were not where these nine I
was<00:07:15.569> just<00:07:15.839> telling<00:07:16.139> you<00:07:16.229> just<00:07:16.409> just<00:07:16.829> didn't
