00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
going full frame pretty soon so this one

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.190 
going full frame pretty soon so this one
being<00:01:24.030> used<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.330> too<00:01:24.540> much<00:01:24.689> longer<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.110> i'm

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
being used for too much longer and i'm

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.480 
being used for too much longer and i'm
probably<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:25.830> want<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.250> sell<00:01:26.460> it

for a couple of years had this about a
year<00:01:56.179> when<00:01:56.360> I<00:01:56.390> got<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.659> DNA<00:01:56.810> NC<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.070> is

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
year when I got the DNA NC and this is

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.830 
year when I got the DNA NC and this is
the<00:01:58.369> camera<00:01:58.789> that<00:01:58.820> up<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.390> know<00:01:59.509> who<00:01:59.630> learn

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
the camera that up you know who learn

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.279 
the camera that up you know who learn
photography<00:01:59.990> way<00:02:01.960> it's<00:02:02.960> not<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.170> most

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
photography way it's not the most

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.050 
photography way it's not the most
sophisticated<00:02:03.439> camera<00:02:04.280> but<00:02:04.579> I<00:02:04.610> took<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.939> to

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
sophisticated camera but I took it to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.840 
sophisticated camera but I took it to
New<00:02:05.179> York<00:02:05.420> handed<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:06.020> coal<00:02:06.890> chute<00:02:06.920> on<00:02:07.460> there

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
New York handed a coal chute on there

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.180 
New York handed a coal chute on there
took<00:02:08.149> about<00:02:08.390> nine<00:02:08.840> ten<00:02:09.140> thousand<00:02:09.619> shots<00:02:09.890> there

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
took about nine ten thousand shots there

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.479 
took about nine ten thousand shots there
and<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:11.030> worked<00:02:11.349> flawlessly<00:02:12.349> for<00:02:12.920> those<00:02:13.069> you

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
and it worked flawlessly for those you

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.539 
and it worked flawlessly for those you
know<00:02:13.610> four<00:02:13.849> or<00:02:13.880> five<00:02:14.090> days<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:16.220> battery

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
know four or five days and the battery

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.670 
know four or five days and the battery
lasts<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:17.030> really<00:02:17.120> long<00:02:17.480> time<00:02:17.599> as<00:02:18.019> well<00:02:18.200> not

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
this sigma lens is perfect isn't it it's

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.009 
this sigma lens is perfect isn't it it's
not<00:03:22.670> very<00:03:22.850> good<00:03:22.970> for<00:03:23.120> wide<00:03:23.420> shots<00:03:23.450> as<00:03:23.930> you

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
not very good for wide shots as you

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.830 
not very good for wide shots as you
would<00:03:24.139> think<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:25.459> lose<00:03:25.639> too<00:03:25.880> much<00:03:26.030> detail<00:03:26.540> it

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
would think you lose too much detail it

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.449 
would think you lose too much detail it
seems<00:03:27.200> a<00:03:27.290> bit<00:03:27.410> too<00:03:27.620> far<00:03:27.859> where<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.220> want<00:03:28.370> to

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
seems a bit too far where you want to

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.339 
seems a bit too far where you want to
pull<00:03:28.639> it<00:03:28.760> back<00:03:28.910> in<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.120> bit<00:03:29.269> but<00:03:29.900> what<00:03:30.079> it<00:03:30.230> is

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
pull it back in a bit but what it is

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.589 
pull it back in a bit but what it is
good<00:03:30.620> for<00:03:30.859> is<00:03:31.130> getting<00:03:31.730> really<00:03:31.970> up<00:03:32.150> close<00:03:32.209> to

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
good for is getting really up close to

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.879 
good for is getting really up close to
something<00:03:32.810> getting<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.319> really<00:03:33.500> interesting

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
something getting a really interesting

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.180 
something getting a really interesting
angle<00:03:34.540> or<00:03:35.540> really<00:03:35.959> sharp<00:03:36.230> angle<00:03:36.680> that's<00:03:37.069> what

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
angle or really sharp angle that's what

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.460 
angle or really sharp angle that's what
it's<00:03:37.280> really<00:03:37.400> good<00:03:37.639> for<00:03:37.819> this<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.599> quite<00:03:39.049> sharp

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
it's really good for this is quite sharp

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.400 
it's really good for this is quite sharp
copy<00:03:40.690> I've<00:03:41.690> got<00:03:41.750> some<00:03:41.989> really<00:03:42.139> good<00:03:42.349> shots

which is the sigma 18-200 which is

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.350 
which is the sigma 18-200 which is
pretty<00:04:29.780> basic<00:04:30.080> lens<00:04:31.870> it's<00:04:32.890> all<00:04:33.910> right<00:04:34.910> it's

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
pretty basic lens it's all right it's

not a very sharp coffee makes a hell of

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.130 
not a very sharp coffee makes a hell of
a<00:04:37.790> lot<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:37.970> noise<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.419> I<00:04:38.480> don't<00:04:38.720> think<00:04:38.990> the

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
a lot of noise and I don't think the

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.960 
a lot of noise and I don't think the
optical<00:04:39.560> stabilization<00:04:39.890> works<00:04:40.460> properly<00:04:40.669> on

optical stabilization works properly on

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.890 
optical stabilization works properly on
it<00:04:42.460> but<00:04:43.460> it<00:04:43.550> does<00:04:43.730> when<00:04:43.880> you<00:04:43.970> need<00:04:44.150> that<00:04:44.480> extra

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
it but it does when you need that extra

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.340 
it but it does when you need that extra
reach<00:04:45.820> but<00:04:46.820> I'd<00:04:47.419> soon<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.840> something<00:04:48.230> else

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
reach but I'd soon you something else

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.780 
reach but I'd soon you something else
really<00:04:48.620> for<00:04:48.890> the<00:04:49.040> you<00:04:49.430> know<00:04:49.810> wider<00:04:51.580> vocal<00:04:52.580> and

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
really for the you know wider vocal and
