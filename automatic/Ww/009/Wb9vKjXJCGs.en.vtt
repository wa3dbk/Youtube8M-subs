all right Omar we're going to look at a
number<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.560> things<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.189> data<00:00:32.489> points<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.059> call

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
number of things the data points we call

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.000 
number of things the data points we call
them<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> track<00:00:34.050> man<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.649> I'm<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.950> to

them on the track man and I'm going to

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.220 
them on the track man and I'm going to
point<00:00:35.280> out<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.520> couple<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.300> interesting

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
point out a couple of really interesting

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.590 
point out a couple of really interesting
things<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.250> think<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:39.030> will<00:00:39.239> help<00:00:39.450> you

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
things that I think really will help you

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.810 
things that I think really will help you
it's<00:00:40.200> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> show<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.710> how<00:00:41.070> critical<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
it's going to show you how critical the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.940 
it's going to show you how critical the
clubface<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.050> where<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> golf<00:00:43.530> ball<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
clubface is to where the golf ball is

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.279 
clubface is to where the golf ball is
going<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> driver<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.200> be

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
going with the driver it's going to be

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.500 
going with the driver it's going to be
about<00:00:46.530> 80<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.129> 90<00:00:47.489> percent<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:48.149> where<00:00:48.390> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
about 80 to 90 percent of where that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.700 
about 80 to 90 percent of where that
ball<00:00:48.780> goes<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.920> angle<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> face<00:00:51.000> okay

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
ball goes is the angle of the face okay

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.250 
ball goes is the angle of the face okay
so<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.250> ball<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.640> ending<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> right<00:00:54.600> we

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
so the ball is ending up to the right we

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.959 
so the ball is ending up to the right we
can<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.860> clearly<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> screen

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
can see that clearly on the screen

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.700 
can see that clearly on the screen
what's<00:00:57.360> interesting<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.899> look<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.680> is

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
what's interesting to look at here is

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.610 
what's interesting to look at here is
your<00:00:58.920> swing<00:00:59.190> Direction<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.850> minus<00:01:00.780> eleven

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
your swing Direction is minus eleven

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.640 
your swing Direction is minus eleven
point<00:01:01.890> two<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.670> simply<00:01:03.239> means<00:01:03.650> swing

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
point two now that simply means swing

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.700 
point two now that simply means swing
direction<00:01:05.220> which<00:01:05.580> way<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.210> club<00:01:06.689> swing<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
direction which way is the club swing so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.130 
direction which way is the club swing so
on<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> downswing<00:01:08.340> from<00:01:08.640> half<00:01:08.909> way<00:01:08.939> down<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
on the downswing from half way down to

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.440 
on the downswing from half way down to
half<00:01:10.409> way<00:01:10.680> through<00:01:11.100> your<00:01:11.670> club<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.090> actually

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
half way through your club is actually

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.149 
half way through your club is actually
swinging<00:01:12.810> way<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.500> left<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.010> would

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
swinging way to the left so you would

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.910 
swinging way to the left so you would
think<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> ball<00:01:14.670> would<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> left<00:01:15.920> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
think the ball would go to the left so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.380 
think the ball would go to the left so
the<00:01:16.950> next<00:01:17.369> data<00:01:17.549> point<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> look<00:01:18.210> at

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the next data point I'm going to look at

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.690 
the next data point I'm going to look at
is<00:01:18.540> path<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.770> don't<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.159> overwhelm

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
is path and I don't want to overwhelm

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
is path and I don't want to overwhelm
you<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.119> too<00:01:21.330> much<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.840> saw<00:01:22.020> your<00:01:22.170> swing

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
you with too much so we saw your swing

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.640 
you with too much so we saw your swing
direction<00:01:22.920> left<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.790> path<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.420> also<00:01:24.840> left<00:01:25.140> -

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
direction left the path is also left -

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.740 
direction left the path is also left -
five<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.400> left<00:01:26.700> all<00:01:26.880> -<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.560> it's<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.750> path

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
five to the left all - is it's the path

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.740 
five to the left all - is it's the path
of<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> club<00:01:31.439> -<00:01:31.920> being<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.909> outside<00:01:33.210> in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
of the club - being for you outside in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.620 
of the club - being for you outside in
to<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> left<00:01:34.409> five<00:01:35.340> degrees<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> left<00:01:36.000> now

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
to the left five degrees to the left now

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
to the left five degrees to the left now
when<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:36.900> combine<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.860> face<00:01:38.070> angle

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
when we combine that with the face angle

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.460 
when we combine that with the face angle
we<00:01:38.640> see<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.240> face<00:01:39.659> -<00:01:40.170> path<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:42.110> two<00:01:43.110> plus

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
we see that your face - path is two plus

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.069 
we see that your face - path is two plus
two<00:01:43.979> point<00:01:44.520> seven<00:01:44.970> let's<00:01:45.210> round<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.689> off<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
two point seven let's round it off to

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.679 
two point seven let's round it off to
three<00:01:46.380> degrees<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.549> your<00:01:47.700> face<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.060> three

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
three degrees so your face is three

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.460 
three degrees so your face is three
degrees<00:01:48.990> open<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.659> path<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> club<00:01:52.259> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
degrees open to the path of the club and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.310 
degrees open to the path of the club and
that's<00:01:53.430> what<00:01:53.670> makes<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.060> ball<00:01:54.329> spin<00:01:54.810> off<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
that's what makes that ball spin off to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.560 
that's what makes that ball spin off to
the<00:01:55.439> right<00:01:55.649> field<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.700> that's<00:01:57.060> we're<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.479> to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the right field so that's we're going to

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.830 
the right field so that's we're going to
work<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.960> now<00:01:58.530> also<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.399> and<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> very

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
work on now also and and this is a very

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.560 
work on now also and and this is a very
important<00:02:01.409> piece<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.799> -<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:03.119> attack

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
important piece of this - is your attack

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.340 
important piece of this - is your attack
angle<00:02:04.140> -<00:02:05.040> six<00:02:05.369> point<00:02:05.729> nine<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> driver<00:02:06.570> so

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
angle - six point nine with a driver so

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.680 
angle - six point nine with a driver so
that's<00:02:07.530> let's<00:02:08.429> round<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> off<00:02:08.910> against<00:02:09.239> seven

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
that's let's round it off against seven

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.780 
that's let's round it off against seven
down<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.770> we're<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.190> improve<00:02:11.580> these

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
down but we're going to improve these

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.740 
down but we're going to improve these
numbers

going off to the right because why

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.050 
going off to the right because why
that's<00:03:28.200> right<00:03:28.470> because<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.220> club<00:03:29.519> face<00:03:29.790> is

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
that's right because the club face is

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.080
