Ray Bradbury wrote this book in the late

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.010 
Ray Bradbury wrote this book in the late
40s<00:01:13.860> early<00:01:14.039> 50s<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.850> late<00:01:15.210> 40s<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.690> early<00:01:15.780> 50s

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
40s early 50s the late 40s and early 50s

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.630 
40s early 50s the late 40s and early 50s
were<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.410> about<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.800> American<00:01:17.310> dream<00:01:17.610> of

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
were all about the American dream of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.999 
were all about the American dream of
finding<00:01:18.240> comfort<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.200> success<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
finding comfort and success and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.370 
finding comfort and success and
affluence<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.479> basically<00:01:21.899> we<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
affluence and so basically we see a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.040 
affluence and so basically we see a
world<00:01:22.830> where<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.729> whole<00:01:23.880> turmoil<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.569> 60s

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
world where the whole turmoil of the 60s

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.870 
world where the whole turmoil of the 60s
never<00:01:25.380> happened<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.069> that<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.459> pseudo

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
never happened and that the pseudo

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.969 
never happened and that the pseudo
happiness<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.690> 50s<00:01:28.140> continued<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.770> into

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
happiness of the 50s continued on into

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.919 
happiness of the 50s continued on into
present<00:01:29.459> day<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.119> what<00:01:30.300> happens<00:01:30.660> when<00:01:30.810> that

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
present day so what happens when that

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.630 
present day so what happens when that
happens<00:01:30.990> we've<00:01:31.500> got<00:01:31.709> improvements<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.429> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
happens we've got improvements and the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.880 
happens we've got improvements and the
radio<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.420> television<00:01:33.780> media<00:01:34.289> people<00:01:34.770> are

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
radio and television media people are

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.440 
radio and television media people are
seeking<00:01:35.099> faster<00:01:35.789> more<00:01:35.970> accessible

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
seeking faster more accessible

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.150 
seeking faster more accessible
information<00:01:37.050> they're<00:01:37.229> seeking<00:01:37.470> ways<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.009> make

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
information they're seeking ways to make

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.070 
information they're seeking ways to make
their<00:01:38.310> lives<00:01:38.550> more<00:01:38.910> comfortable<00:01:39.599> and<00:01:39.810> happy

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
their lives more comfortable and happy

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.710 
their lives more comfortable and happy
and<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.800> basically<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.580> becomes<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.119> society

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and so basically this becomes a society

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.980 
and so basically this becomes a society
of<00:01:42.929> cheap<00:01:43.259> thrills<00:01:43.679> depth<00:01:44.550> is<00:01:44.970> frowned<00:01:45.569> upon

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
of cheap thrills depth is frowned upon

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.559 
of cheap thrills depth is frowned upon
why<00:01:46.349> because<00:01:47.130> depth<00:01:47.459> makes<00:01:47.729> certain<00:01:48.179> people

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
why because depth makes certain people

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.359 
why because depth makes certain people
uncomfortable<00:01:49.039> anything<00:01:50.039> that<00:01:50.220> could

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
uncomfortable anything that could

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.330 
uncomfortable anything that could
conceivably<00:01:50.819> cause<00:01:51.300> pain<00:01:51.869> or<00:01:52.200> discomfort<00:01:52.619> is

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
conceivably cause pain or discomfort is

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.080 
conceivably cause pain or discomfort is
done<00:01:53.970> away<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.810> books<00:01:55.560> fall<00:01:56.369> right<00:01:56.759> into

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
done away with and books fall right into

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.210 
done away with and books fall right into
that<00:01:57.209> category<00:01:57.630> because<00:01:58.319> books<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.099> this

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
that category because books in this
