00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.429 

this<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.270> probably<00:01:12.539> one<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.229> most

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
this is probably one of the most

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.889 
this is probably one of the most
important<00:01:14.009> tricks<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> master<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.810> it

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
important tricks to master because it

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:24.010 
important tricks to master because it
connect<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:16.649> other<00:01:16.770> tricks<00:01:17.130> together

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.620 

you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.170> try<00:01:25.380> sleep<00:01:25.740> by<00:01:26.640> applying<00:01:26.939> more<00:01:27.299> power

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
you can try sleep by applying more power

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.550 
you can try sleep by applying more power
on<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:28.140> lead<00:01:28.289> in<00:01:28.439> head

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
on the lead in head

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.120 
on the lead in head
like<00:01:30.040> that

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.040 

the<00:01:34.490> more<00:01:34.700> tire<00:01:34.910> you'll<00:01:35.120> apply<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.870> more

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
the more tire you'll apply the more

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.510 
the more tire you'll apply the more
sleep<00:01:36.320> again

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:02:04.550 

you<00:01:43.969> can<00:01:44.090> also<00:01:44.299> try<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.869> other<00:01:44.990> side

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.600
