00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.300 
saw that I decided I wanted to go gray
and<00:03:34.330> this<00:03:34.750> is<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:34.900> product<00:03:35.320> that<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.530> used<00:03:35.830> that<00:03:36.250> I

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
and this is a product that I used that I

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.210 
and this is a product that I used that I
really<00:03:36.730> liked<00:03:37.060> because<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:38.590> says<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:39.100> it

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
really liked because it says that it

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.550 
really liked because it says that it
washes<00:03:39.430> out<00:03:39.820> but<00:03:40.209> my<00:03:40.360> hair<00:03:40.570> just<00:03:40.750> grabs<00:03:41.140> stuff

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
washes out but my hair just grabs stuff

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.160 
washes out but my hair just grabs stuff
that's<00:03:42.489> what<00:03:42.610> happens<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.209> if<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:43.480> bleach

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
that's what happens to if you bleach

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.900 
that's what happens to if you bleach
your<00:03:44.380> hair<00:03:44.410> if<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.739> lighten<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.250> your<00:03:45.730> hair

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
your hair if you lighten it your hair

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.820 
your hair if you lighten it your hair
will<00:03:46.090> tend<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.360> grab<00:03:46.690> onto<00:03:46.930> some<00:03:47.290> colors<00:03:47.680> and

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
will tend to grab onto some colors and

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.800 
will tend to grab onto some colors and
you<00:03:47.890> put<00:03:48.100> a<00:03:48.130> color<00:03:48.370> over<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:48.910> every<00:03:49.150> individual

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
you put a color over it every individual

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.850 
you put a color over it every individual
hair<00:03:50.110> strand<00:03:50.920> has<00:03:51.519> layers<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:52.570> so<00:03:53.200> if<00:03:53.680> you

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
hair strand has layers to it so if you

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.759 
hair strand has layers to it so if you
break<00:03:54.190> those<00:03:54.459> layers<00:03:54.850> apart<00:03:55.600> and<00:03:55.900> put<00:03:56.500> color

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
break those layers apart and put color

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.160 
break those layers apart and put color
in<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.340> just<00:03:57.550> sucks<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.269> right<00:03:58.450> up<00:03:58.600> so

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
in it it just sucks it right up so

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.040 
in it it just sucks it right up so
that's<00:03:59.410> what<00:03:59.620> happened<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.100> my<00:04:00.250> hair<00:04:01.050> we

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
didn't really seal it that's what that

and it closes that shaft again so that

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.000 
and it closes that shaft again so that

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
didn't do that very well so this is what

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.789 
didn't do that very well so this is what
happened<00:04:18.720> this<00:04:19.720> is<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.959> temporary<00:04:20.350> rare<00:04:20.590> color
