the other sensors hope you could follow
that<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.410> only<00:02:58.560> time<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.860> really<00:02:59.130> get<00:02:59.370> good

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
that the only time I really get good

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.940 
that the only time I really get good
mileage<00:02:59.760> is<00:03:00.090> when<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.299> reset<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.019> ECU<00:03:01.260> back<00:03:01.769> to

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
mileage is when I reset the ECU back to

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.520 
mileage is when I reset the ECU back to
baseline<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.720> lasts<00:03:03.720> for<00:03:04.049> about<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.230> quarter

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
baseline that lasts for about a quarter

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.000 
baseline that lasts for about a quarter
tank<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.190> got<00:03:05.760> about<00:03:06.239> 35<00:03:06.750> miles<00:03:07.230> per<00:03:07.440> gallon<00:03:07.769> on

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
tank I got about 35 miles per gallon on

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.860 
tank I got about 35 miles per gallon on
that<00:03:08.250> quarter<00:03:08.670> tank<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.510> then<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.720> goes<00:03:09.810> back

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
that quarter tank and then it goes back

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.150 
that quarter tank and then it goes back
down<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.560> stock<00:03:10.950> 22<00:03:11.900> highway<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.230> city

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
down to the stock 22 highway and city

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.680 
down to the stock 22 highway and city
which<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:15.560> very<00:03:16.560> disappointing<00:03:16.769> after<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.640> 35

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
which is very disappointing after the 35

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.090 
which is very disappointing after the 35
go<00:03:20.690> back<00:03:20.900> out<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.140> show<00:03:21.440> you<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.710> unit<00:03:21.950> one

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
go back out and show you the unit one

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.190 
go back out and show you the unit one
last<00:03:22.310> time

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.880 

10<00:03:25.770> two<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.220> half<00:03:26.280> inch<00:03:26.670> PVC<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> tight

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
10 two and a half inch PVC it is a tight

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.710 
10 two and a half inch PVC it is a tight
fit<00:03:29.360> had<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.390> wreath<00:03:31.129> mantle<00:03:32.129> horn<00:03:32.370> off<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.629> the

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
fit had a wreath mantle horn off to the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:42.340 
fit had a wreath mantle horn off to the
side

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.910 

so<00:03:42.830> you<00:03:42.920> get<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.310> see<00:03:43.340> some<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.060> flow<00:03:44.920> right

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
so you get to see some of the flow right

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.510 
so you get to see some of the flow right
now<00:03:46.100> I'm<00:03:46.370> running

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
now I'm running

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.160 
now I'm running

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
distilled water and sodium hydroxide the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.650 
distilled water and sodium hydroxide the
unit<00:03:53.530> holds<00:03:53.890> about<00:03:54.070> six<00:03:54.400> cups<00:03:54.490> of<00:03:55.000> water<00:03:55.330> and

unit holds about six cups of water and

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.130 
unit holds about six cups of water and
I'm<00:03:56.320> running<00:03:56.500> about<00:03:56.890> half<00:03:57.580> a<00:03:57.970> teaspoon<00:03:58.140> full

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
I'm running about half a teaspoon full

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.680 
I'm running about half a teaspoon full
of<00:03:59.710> sodium<00:04:00.250> hydroxide

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.090 

and<00:04:09.390> into<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.020> engine

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
and into the engine

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.920 
and into the engine
next<00:04:12.790> thing<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.030> work<00:04:13.210> on<00:04:13.390> will<00:04:13.540> be<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.780> o2

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
next thing to work on will be the o2

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.470 
next thing to work on will be the o2
sensor<00:04:14.140> maybe<00:04:14.830> between<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.550> three<00:04:15.880> sensor

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
sensor maybe between the three sensor

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.990 
sensor maybe between the three sensor
adjusters<00:04:16.990> I'll<00:04:17.170> be<00:04:17.290> able<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.850> pull<00:04:18.850> the

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
adjusters I'll be able to pull the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.090 
adjusters I'll be able to pull the
computer<00:04:19.480> a<00:04:19.510> little<00:04:19.870> better<00:04:20.050> thank<00:04:20.950> goodness

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100

my<00:04:21.489> fart<00:04:22.030> o2<00:04:22.420> sensor<00:04:22.870> connector<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:25.000> right

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
my fart o2 sensor connector is right

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.660 
my fart o2 sensor connector is right
here<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.780> don't<00:04:26.680> have<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.950> go<00:04:27.070> digging<00:04:27.340> for

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.180 

so<00:04:32.210> anything<00:04:32.540> changes<00:04:33.050> keep<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.410> posted<00:04:33.830> just
