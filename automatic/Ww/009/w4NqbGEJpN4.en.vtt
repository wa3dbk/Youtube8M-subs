really<00:03:12.139> quick<00:03:12.379> and<00:03:12.680> now<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.370> have<00:03:13.579> a<00:03:13.609> fusion

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:13.969 
really quick and now you have a fusion

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.509 
really quick and now you have a fusion
drive<00:03:14.299> so<00:03:14.659> let's<00:03:15.079> go<00:03:15.650> ahead<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:15.950> exit<00:03:16.280> this

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519

and go into Disk Utility and make sure

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.069 
and go into Disk Utility and make sure
that<00:03:18.500> we<00:03:18.650> do<00:03:18.829> actually<00:03:19.159> have<00:03:19.729> one<00:03:20.329> physical

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
that we do actually have one physical

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.619 
that we do actually have one physical
drive<00:03:21.290> or<00:03:21.590> as<00:03:21.919> the<00:03:22.459> system<00:03:22.790> sees<00:03:22.970> if<00:03:23.150> one<00:03:23.389> drive

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.649 
drive or as the system sees if one drive
we<00:03:24.079> do<00:03:24.260> indeed<00:03:24.530> have<00:03:24.739> one<00:03:25.099> physical<00:03:25.849> drive<00:03:26.060> so

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
we do indeed have one physical drive so

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.929 
we do indeed have one physical drive so

seconds<00:03:55.989> with<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.109> reboot<00:03:57.439> we<00:03:57.650> have<00:03:57.859> to<00:03:58.069> do<00:03:58.189> a

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
seconds with the reboot we have to do a

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.369 
seconds with the reboot we have to do a
shutdown<00:03:58.549> so<00:03:59.180> here<00:03:59.780> we<00:03:59.870> go<00:03:59.989> we're<00:04:00.199> going<00:04:00.290> to

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
shutdown so here we go we're going to

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.099

start<00:04:00.650> this<00:04:00.799> out<00:04:01.069> and<00:04:01.280> this<00:04:01.759> is<00:04:01.819> quite<00:04:02.540> fast<00:04:02.870> I

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
start this out and this is quite fast I

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
of that nature so this is going to clock

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.410

this<00:05:42.820> fusion<00:05:43.240> drive<00:05:43.479> this<00:05:43.930> was<00:05:44.139> a<00:05:44.169> surprise<00:05:44.590> to

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
this fusion drive this was a surprise to

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.040 
this fusion drive this was a surprise to
me<00:05:44.800> because<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.310> thought<00:05:45.700> this<00:05:46.240> mechanical

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
me because I thought this mechanical

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.510 
me because I thought this mechanical
hard<00:05:47.200> drive<00:05:47.410> would<00:05:47.620> slow<00:05:47.860> down<00:05:48.039> the<00:05:48.220> speeds

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
hard drive would slow down the speeds

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.300 
hard drive would slow down the speeds
but<00:05:49.030> as<00:05:49.300> you<00:05:49.570> can<00:05:49.690> see<00:05:49.750> here<00:05:50.169> this<00:05:50.470> in<00:05:50.710> fact<00:05:51.010> is

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
but as you can see here this in fact is

here<00:05:57.430> it's<00:05:57.580> getting<00:05:57.880> around<00:05:58.090> 390<00:05:58.330> right<00:05:58.960> and

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
here it's getting around 390 right and

here it's getting around 390 right and
about<00:05:59.710> 475<00:06:00.669> 480<00:06:01.450> Reed<00:06:01.930> this<00:06:02.229> is<00:06:02.289> very

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
about 475 480 Reed this is very

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.150 
about 475 480 Reed this is very
impressive

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
impressive

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.010

this<00:06:03.370> is<00:06:03.490> a<00:06:03.550> game<00:06:03.729> changer<00:06:03.760> actually<00:06:04.570> you<00:06:04.840> can

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
this is a game changer actually you can

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.529 
this is a game changer actually you can
you<00:06:05.410> can<00:06:05.560> purchase<00:06:05.830> a<00:06:06.220> 256<00:06:06.910> like<00:06:07.090> I've<00:06:07.270> done

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
you can purchase a 256 like I've done

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.890 
you can purchase a 256 like I've done
and<00:06:07.810> in<00:06:08.530> addition<00:06:08.979> to<00:06:09.070> that<00:06:09.250> add<00:06:09.460> a<00:06:09.900> 750

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
and in addition to that add a 750

and in addition to that add a 750
gigabyte<00:06:11.410> hard<00:06:11.800> drive<00:06:11.919> and<00:06:12.400> essentially<00:06:13.330> have

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
gigabyte hard drive and essentially have

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.589 
gigabyte hard drive and essentially have
one<00:06:13.660> terabyte<00:06:14.200> of<00:06:14.470> SSD<00:06:15.400> space<00:06:16.090> with<00:06:16.419> that

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
one terabyte of SSD space with that

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.629 
one terabyte of SSD space with that
being<00:06:16.780> said<00:06:16.990> you<00:06:17.050> do<00:06:17.470> not<00:06:17.680> have<00:06:17.979> to<00:06:18.280> purchase

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
being said you do not have to purchase

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.820 
being said you do not have to purchase
through<00:06:19.360> Apple<00:06:19.690> to<00:06:19.840> do<00:06:19.960> this<00:06:20.169> I<00:06:20.349> think<00:06:20.500> this<00:06:20.770> is

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
through Apple to do this I think this is

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.510 
through Apple to do this I think this is
a<00:06:20.979> great<00:06:21.220> option<00:06:21.940> for<00:06:22.090> OS<00:06:22.780> X<00:06:22.990> users<00:06:23.380> and<00:06:23.620> I<00:06:24.070> only

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
a great option for OS X users and I only

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.310 
a great option for OS X users and I only
see<00:06:24.789> this<00:06:24.940> getting<00:06:25.180> better<00:06:25.450> the<00:06:25.840> only<00:06:25.900> thing

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
see this getting better the only thing

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.080 
see this getting better the only thing
is<00:06:26.530> is<00:06:26.740> that<00:06:26.830> I<00:06:26.889> wish<00:06:27.250> that<00:06:27.280> I<00:06:27.550> would<00:06:27.669> have<00:06:28.060> had

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
is is that I wish that I would have had

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.260 
is is that I wish that I would have had
a<00:06:28.690> 7200<00:06:29.620> rpm<00:06:30.010> hard<00:06:30.039> drive<00:06:30.280> maybe<00:06:30.849> that<00:06:31.120> would

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
a 7200 rpm hard drive maybe that would

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.670 
a 7200 rpm hard drive maybe that would
have<00:06:31.389> boosted<00:06:31.720> the<00:06:31.810> speed<00:06:32.050> a<00:06:32.080> little<00:06:32.410> bit<00:06:32.530> but

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
have boosted the speed a little bit but

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.529 
have boosted the speed a little bit but
I<00:06:32.710> don't<00:06:32.950> imagine<00:06:33.190> so<00:06:33.550> because<00:06:33.970> these<00:06:34.270> are<00:06:34.419> the

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:34.539 
I don't imagine so because these are the

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.089 
I don't imagine so because these are the
max<00:06:34.720> speeds<00:06:34.990> that<00:06:35.169> I'm<00:06:35.260> getting<00:06:35.530> on<00:06:35.650> the<00:06:35.770> SSD

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099 
max speeds that I'm getting on the SSD

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.880 
max speeds that I'm getting on the SSD
itself<00:06:36.659> that<00:06:37.659> concludes<00:06:37.990> my<00:06:38.110> video<00:06:38.229> the<00:06:38.710> last

itself that concludes my video the last

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.350 
itself that concludes my video the last
thing<00:06:39.099> to<00:06:39.190> do<00:06:39.310> is<00:06:39.430> break<00:06:39.640> this<00:06:39.820> fusion<00:06:40.090> thing

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
thing to do is break this fusion thing

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.070 
thing to do is break this fusion thing
apart

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
apart
