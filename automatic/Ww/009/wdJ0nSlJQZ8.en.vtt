00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.330
 girls play guitar on the ground 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.770
 lesson we will get acquainted with the guitar 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.520
 play 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.829
 I myself just started to play the guitar 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.590
 although I wanted to start so long ago 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:32.130
 we begin to deal with the actual 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.160
 top this here is pegs the amount of steps 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.950
 adjust the guitar itself 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.260
 they do not need to twist so you can 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.030
 break the string 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.010
 so the moment opinions to single strings 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.540
 and the thinnest but of course I am on time 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.100

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.259
 relied he has hold it fruit 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.600
 this is practically the most important part 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.140
 is it so full 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.540
 chords 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.610

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.200

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.660
 etc. is what I told you 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.030
 is on the flu and now we move on 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.290

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.220
 deck and here it is 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:40.610
 lower deck as you know normal 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.310
 guitarists there are more people who play 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.840
 here 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.840
 and even here 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:55.510
 in order for some feature but 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.820
 we will learn to play with the neckline 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:04.640
 will be more saturated and more beautiful 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.710
 here it is this lower threshold it exists 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.800
 for the same as the upper threshold 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.130
 but what does each k mean 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.930

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.930

 welcome and guitar strings total 6 and 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.710
 It is considered not the thinnest 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.410
 the thickest 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.680
 it will strengthen itself 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.480
 the first wall is the thickest 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.740
 accordingly, the first string 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.320
 has a note to me 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.260
