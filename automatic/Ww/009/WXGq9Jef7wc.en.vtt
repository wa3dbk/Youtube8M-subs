00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 and good kids here we are in a 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.560
 new video one thing that I wanted you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.270
 comment a tip that good 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.059
 just a tip a recommendation 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.469
 that I am going to do to you and as you already know 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 removed the players all 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.450
 consistent or as they are called that good 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.660
 it comes to those who do not have your letter 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.210
 there but they deserve let's say a top and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.250
 as you know, they have taken enough 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.080
 players and people are crazy about 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.789
 jackson martÃ­nez by nolito por 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.590
 marchisio but I think there is a 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.080
 player that has been overlooked in this 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.610
 list that is silver is not gold and that's why 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.079
 maybe it's not so flashy but in 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.120
 how much statistics is that they merge 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.950
 it is no longer that he founds the golds is that 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.329
 melts them the cover they find that the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.550
 is that the silvers are founded and the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.710
 gold and above is that because it has some 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.280
 brutal statistics and the price as 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.460
 you already know that the fifa has loaded the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.140
 market with this of the stripes then 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.969
 surely this player if he does not reach 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.649
 being by the fringes would be worth a million 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.590
 coins but how the prices puts them to 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.359
 it's worth a hundred thousand coins, that's why 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.710
 first it will cost you a lot and 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.449
 when I say a lot I mean the same 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.400
 that you have to be ten minutes there 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.950
 dale that I hit you to find the uncle for 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.090
 to sign him fast if they are not more equal 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.100
 you are lucky and nothing else to give you 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.170
 appears but well the logical thing would be that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.480
 I had a good time finding this 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.980
 player to be able to sign him but good 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.960
 that's what I tell you if you really 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.760
 you have time and they do not have enough 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.190
 coins to buy a player 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.260
 great because this player is a super 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.990
 crack since you good guys I'm going to put 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.580
 a comparison so you can see what 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.700
 compare this player 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.770
 dybala is called in case still not what 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.200
 had said well it's called dybala and here 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.690
 you have the comparison with neymar neymar 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.369
 in its normal version and you see as a 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.160
 player like neymar who is one of the most 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.320
 fifa states because you compare him with 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.090
 this guy that is silver and it really is not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.770
 that is similar is not that for me it is 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.869
 better has four points less than 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.280
 dribble and two more points of rhythm me 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.410
 he looks like a pretty pretty player 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.200
 good and good if you look at physics 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.390
 he takes out neymar eight points from physical and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.210
 because that also beats him in passing in 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.830
 defense this uncle is a super crack what 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.360
 only one that fails him I think it's the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.920
 legs commands that he has leg toes 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.460
 bad but good yet it's a piece of 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.140
 player 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.600
 and then I'm going to leave some clips here 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.490
 that I have been taking out I hope that the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.040
 good values and honestly brings me out 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.620
 pretty fast so do not wait 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.880
 golazos is simply that played what 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.400
 I have had time because it has left 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.500
 nothing to the tops played 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.849
 I know seven games and here what 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.780
 that I bring you I do not have much more but 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.010
 well really this is a player that 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.170
 I recommend you because it is that it has 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.209
 statistics that are already good for a 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.430
 gold imagine for a silver 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.840
 perhaps the handicap is suppressed a bit 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.629
 why it is all but good not 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.250
 stop being a silver player and I think 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.590
 that it is better to sign a player for 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.590
 one hundred thousand coins that is silver and everything 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.859
 to spend what's going on neymar that 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.510
 comes to be double 230,000 and also 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.980
 of extremes one thing that needs to be added 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.750
 is that being a forward player 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.060
 center that is not already know that the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.500
 extremes type hazard neymar royce has 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.720
 some brutal statistics but not 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.639
 let's say they do not appear so much in scene 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.190
 as a striker because then that because 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:10.130
 they do not have 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.510
 they do not have that position that you pass them on 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.000
 long they go to them such with 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.100
 this game you can use it 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.770
 You can also understand if you put 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.040
 meteo atv and a far right of 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.610
 You can buy the series enter the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.530
 perfectly our team to 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.230
 make a bundesliga team with 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.670
 this guy up and with tb dmt or is looking 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.830
 a little the players and well I think 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.600
 that there is no more to add that 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.210
 we recommend the player who is a piece 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.710
 of 80 2 let's see what players all 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.660
 they are going to be taking out because 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.570
 simply this is a setup we have already 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.400
 brought from the first touches have come out 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.410
 then they will leave the bv there who 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.730
 knows how to take out I already know that no but 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.950
 good to imagine that it brings out nothing of the ugly 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.240
 in blue it would be a set to vis and mono 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.470
 Surely with an ugly module 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.090
 sure there will be many players who do not 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.040
 they are very used that when they take it out 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.840
 so, yes, you can take it out 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.790
 much more performance than what is 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.170
 it's normal and good now, yes 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.040
 I hope you liked the 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.040
 video and until next time
