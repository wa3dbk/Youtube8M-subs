00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
cord we advise to do this that do a loop

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.010 
cord we advise to do this that do a loop
off<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:27.950> belt<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.550> then<00:02:29.000> hook<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.390> on<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.230 
off the belt and then hook it on to the
bank<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.070> will<00:02:31.580> stop<00:02:31.850> it

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
bank and that will stop it

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.030

pulling out when you're walking up and
down<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.340> race<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:39.640> just<00:02:40.640> like<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.970> cover<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.300> few

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
down the race I just like to cover a few

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.470 
down the race I just like to cover a few
specifics<00:02:42.080> about<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.440> battery<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.450> a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
specifics about that battery this is a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.410 
specifics about that battery this is a
12-volt<00:02:45.459> 12m<00:02:46.459> power<00:02:46.850> look--there<00:02:47.150> mine

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
12-volt 12m power look--there mine

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.160 
12-volt 12m power look--there mine
metric<00:02:47.900> it's<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.620> big<00:02:48.800> battery<00:02:50.019> when<00:02:51.019> you're

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
metric it's a big battery when you're

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.110 
metric it's a big battery when you're
charging<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.739> it<00:02:52.160> will<00:02:52.340> take<00:02:52.550> two<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.910> half

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
charging it it will take two and a half

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.979 
charging it it will take two and a half
hours<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.600> charge<00:02:53.840> from<00:02:54.110> fully<00:02:54.410> empty<00:02:55.630> now<00:02:56.630> it

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
hours to charge from fully empty now it

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.220 
hours to charge from fully empty now it
has<00:02:57.200> no<00:02:57.410> memory<00:02:57.830> so<00:02:58.300> what<00:02:59.300> that<00:02:59.420> means<00:02:59.690> is<00:02:59.930> if

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
has no memory so what that means is if

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.020 
has no memory so what that means is if
you<00:03:00.620> are<00:03:00.800> using<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.430> morning<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:01.820> say

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
partially empty it there's no problem to

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.460 
partially empty it there's no problem to
top<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:04.850> back<00:03:05.030> up<00:03:05.269> if<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:05.900> know<00:03:06.050> you've<00:03:06.230> got<00:03:06.440> a

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
top it back up if you know you've got a

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.690 
top it back up if you know you've got a
big<00:03:06.769> afternoon<00:03:08.290> alternatively<00:03:09.290> if<00:03:09.799> it's

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
big afternoon alternatively if it's

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.229 
big afternoon alternatively if it's

fully indeed in the morning and you put
it<00:03:14.330> on<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.510> charger<00:03:14.780> I've<00:03:15.049> only<00:03:15.200> got<00:03:15.410> an<00:03:15.530> hour

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
it on the charger I've only got an hour

only<00:03:18.380> about<00:03:18.530> half<00:03:19.010> charge<00:03:19.340> then<00:03:19.730> it's<00:03:19.880> okay

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
only about half charge then it's okay

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.580 
only about half charge then it's okay
also<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.810> use<00:03:21.080> it<00:03:21.230> again<00:03:22.630> their<00:03:23.630> battery<00:03:24.320> tends
