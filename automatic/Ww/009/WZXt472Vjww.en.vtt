00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.179
 vi and vii 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.429
 one step of time 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.429
 finally and by system 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.170
 I do not wait for you 'son of yours you have to be home 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.920
 we will finish doing the shopping and then we will go in agreement 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.570
 I missed 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.360
 fate will reach us money another day we buy it 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.330
 the plot is in a hurry and we're done buying and now we're leaving 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
 to home 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.740
 Take this quiet stay is fine 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.470
 this is far behind 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.600
 we go 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.500
 a very common scene true 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.010
 the boy came out winning 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.310
 and the mother missed a great opportunity to correct her son 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.310
 and contribute to a better formation of his character 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.480
 pedrito behaved badly and the mother disturbed with the scene 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.509
 penn are the immediate solution to the problem 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.710
 and reward the bad behavior of the son 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.520
 in the future even if she wants to correct the child it will be difficult for her 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.140
 and getting easier for him to get what he wants 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.990
 he will react in the same way because he knows it will work 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.990
 the outcome of our story could have been different 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.910
 no kid &amp; i think i ask 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.080
 it's useless to scandal because mom will not buy it 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.990
 pedrito already knows that when mom says no 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.299
 is not and accepts the decision and the authority of his mother assimilating a 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.360
 precious learning for future situations 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.470
 Many parents do not understand the importance of setting limits for 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.339
 children 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:14.999
 sometimes they try to make up for their own difficult childhood by acting 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.879
 in relation to the children in a contrary way 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.039
 everything is given everything is allowed they never say no 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.259
 many parents become totally dominated by the will of the children 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.569
 in an unacceptable investment of securities 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.000
 the result of such an education happily almost always will be 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.229
 disastrous 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:38.729
 the child as an adult will have many more difficulties to face a 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.849
 independent living away from home 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.789
 let's see what King Solomon says in proverbs 13 Persian the 24 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:52.079
 the one who now punishes his son does not want him who loves him is engaged 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.179
 straighten it 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:57.259
 who loves castilla 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.119
 who loves would make a son suffer 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:04.949
 the bible speaks of punishment but in reality it is not about attacking a 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:05.919
 boy 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.719
 there is a big difference between disciplining 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:09.869
 and assault 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:13.489
 attacking is something without control without aim 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.479
 it's just unleashing a rage a violent impulse in a moment of anger 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:23.249
 that is unfair and cause permanent damage to the child 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:28.319
 a correct discipline is also an act of love the correction teaches 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.339
 to the kid 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:30.220
 one day 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.350
 he will understand and be grateful to his parents, that is why it is important that 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.360
 parents are controlled when it comes to punishing the child 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.030
 the child has to know why he is being punished 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.359
 It is also important to maintain consistency 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.729
 it does not make sense to punish oo and to tolerate the same indiscipline tomorrow 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:55.049
 now pay attention to the most recommended and effective ways to apply the 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.639
 discipline 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.059
 some children will change the negative behavior with a simple and 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.569
 good dialogue without understanding who did what he did wrong 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.349
 can change attitude 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.069
 remember that the application of discipline always confidential 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.909
 never expose your child to an uncomfortable situation in front of other people 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.959
 unless you have committed a horror in public 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.810
 Alonist in depriving him 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.220
 temporarily of the things you like so you can reflect on your bad 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.520
 behavior 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.229
 and change attitude 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.499
 and finally there is the technique of logical consequences parents do not 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:37.979
 intervene that allow your child to suffer the natural consequences of his 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.309
 behavior 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:43.719
 For example, if the child did not do well in the end of the year exams, 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.979
 lose part of the vacation attending recovery classes 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.360
 correcting children is a must 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.569
 but a duty that must be exercised with love and prayer only so children 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:56.409
 will love 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:58.439
 and will respect their parents 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:59.810
 in the next election 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.480
 we will talk about separation 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.430
 and divorce 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.970
 see you
