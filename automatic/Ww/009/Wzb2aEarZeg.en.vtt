00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:13.909
 Botafogo 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.859
 lack of account of those cool games 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.200
 extremely demanding and captivating 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.919
 and we do not need corn production in the area 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.100
 and is already born with one of the best 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.189
 the games for psp 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.850
 as the rather original art direction 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.140
 which makes the game looked modern from Senator 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.210
 we are presented to the organ one of the few points a civilization of 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.310
 pine trees formed by picturesque figures 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.310
 of big eyes and legs and arms chest 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.670
 only the victories stayed in the past 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.199
 and now they need to regain their pride in their lands by 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.239
 in order to reach a consensus on the role of the player 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.549
 does not control any soldier directly 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:01.929
 indirectly it is necessary to start the battlefield through 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.290
 war songs 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.060
 it is a constant practice in the background the so-called cost of land 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.700
 and dictate the rhythm and you see in the figure of the powerful background 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.730
 boost your requests to perform tasks like running 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.680
 attack 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.660
 a trench of the drum stocks to match the 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.120
 consortium action 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.160
 with the face of being just another game of the last fourth against the show 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.150
 complexity in the first edition 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.930
 presenting more space and minimalist and competitive 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.400
 you get a few emotions and it will take a little while 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.110
 to get used to mechanics it works basically like a musical game 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.479
 but without the help of graphics that indicate the right time to press the buttons 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.820
 you are presented with a combination of four strong and determines some action 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.190
 the forward order for example 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.720
 so it is necessary to press these four commands at the right time guided 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.090
 just by sound 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.590
 If you do something stupid the characters warned us if everything 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.970
 sure your bosses will react by singing their respective notes while 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.719
 perform the action 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:13.489
 at the end of the field the real still other quickly 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:15.700
 to investigate 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.249
 pigeons the accumulation of ten of them trigger specials called fever 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.349
 really the firepower of the little heroes 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.429
 but in the game it's not just that 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:30.639
 mixing still elements of rpg and ian trillion strategy 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.539
 considerably its depth of difficulty 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:38.609
 in addition to providing a series of very creative minigames 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.499
 during the missions if the miners will collect managerial money 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.499
 and will serve to face the arsenal for future missions 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.989
 to enable new music 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.180
 and to create new units 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.359
 with different abilities 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.639
 the challenge is not restricted to the correct execution of the trainees in relation to the 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.989
 rhythm but also the ideal composition of the tests for each type of injury 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.289
 several times you will encounter enemies or obstacles 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:08.399
 incompatible 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:12.619
 and need to go back to being the oldest to get supplies 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.949
 needed to increase the power of your units and choose the right type 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.829
 to advance the game 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.699
 Too bad that this is not something unknown either. 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:26.539
 making the player - said athens 3 front that the team did not go well 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.629
 balanced 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.999
 What is not true 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:34.319
 the minimum dp ownership problems just left the game - birthday for the 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.999
 beginners what really bother is that of china in general 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:41.909
 seems not to care about the fact that the game works in a consortium 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.039
 portable 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:44.410
 the question here 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.640
 the mechanic is strongly based on pace and concentration 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.609
 you can hardly judge it with a low volume and in any type of 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.749
 environment with other distractions play for example 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:01.249
 a moving bus hundred reports can be with the other traffickers 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.539
 difficulty is key there is no way to pause the visions 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.749
 what can I play hard to plan well the success of the game preferably in 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.749
 peaceful surroundings without reference 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.479
 Spain 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.979
 No, it's not 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.979
 dr 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.499
 the score with the ducati per game that causes strangeness in the beginning 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:37.340
 but when least expected 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.440
 already dominated his mind with more charming 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.200
 and creative mechanics 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.360
 jean elements of a musical game suddenly and strategy 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.060
 although some small lapses design is one of the most original titles and 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.830
 of any consolidation 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.440
 and that surely is born as mandatory in the collection of ps3
