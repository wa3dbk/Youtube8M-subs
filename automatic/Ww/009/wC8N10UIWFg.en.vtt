00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
location on the actual board so it

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.620 
location on the actual board so it

loaded<00:02:09.890> up<00:02:09.979> perfectly<00:02:10.429> fine<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.700> can<00:02:10.970> see<00:02:11.120> how

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
loaded up perfectly fine you can see how

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.660 
loaded up perfectly fine you can see how
Drive<00:02:11.540> activity<00:02:11.959> light<00:02:12.190> display<00:02:13.190> was<00:02:13.520> all

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
Drive activity light display was all

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.480 
Drive activity light display was all
perfect<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.360> just<00:02:14.470> let<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.500> sat<00:02:15.800> for<00:02:16.370> like

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
perfect and just let it sat for like

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.399 
perfect and just let it sat for like
five<00:02:16.700> minutes<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.240> was<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.569> well<00:02:18.170> I

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
five minutes and that was that well I

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.509 
five minutes and that was that well I
guess<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.159> fixed<00:02:19.489> itself<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:21.340> not<00:02:22.340> sure

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
guess this is fixed itself so not sure

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.380 
guess this is fixed itself so not sure
what<00:02:22.670> else

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
what else

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.980

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
are at the top there they seem to be

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.920 
are at the top there they seem to be
something<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.489> don't<00:03:19.640> know<00:03:19.730> touching<00:03:20.600> any<00:03:20.750> of

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
something I don't know touching any of

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.650 
something I don't know touching any of
it<00:03:21.050> is<00:03:21.170> bad<00:03:21.440> in<00:03:21.650> general<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.130> tell<00:03:22.970> ya<00:03:23.510> it's

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
it is bad in general and tell ya it's

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.140 
it is bad in general and tell ya it's
probably<00:03:23.959> that's<00:03:24.320> why<00:03:24.560> Sony<00:03:24.860> is<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.820> made<00:03:26.030> it

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
probably that's why Sony is it made it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.600 
probably that's why Sony is it made it
so<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:26.450> it's<00:03:26.540> in<00:03:26.630> enclosure<00:03:27.100> but<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.340> reason

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
so that it's in enclosure but the reason

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.270 
so that it's in enclosure but the reason
why<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.730> opened<00:03:29.360> it<00:03:29.390> up<00:03:29.570> just<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.140> see<00:03:30.410> if<00:03:31.070> there

why I opened it up just to see if there

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.860 
why I opened it up just to see if there
was<00:03:31.340> any<00:03:31.489> parts<00:03:31.820> in<00:03:31.940> there<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:32.269> will<00:03:32.390> bust<00:03:32.720> it
