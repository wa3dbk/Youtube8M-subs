00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.109 

so<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.799> start<00:02:04.100> off<00:02:04.219> by<00:02:04.430> telling<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.850> just<00:02:05.030> a

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
so to start off by telling you just a

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.459 
so to start off by telling you just a
little<00:02:05.240> bit<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.630> foundation<00:02:06.109> it's<00:02:06.289> called

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
little bit of the foundation it's called

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:07.990 
little bit of the foundation it's called
nearly<00:02:06.679> naked<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.310> it's<00:02:07.429> supposed<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.820> look

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
nearly naked so it's supposed to look

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.609 
nearly naked so it's supposed to look
really<00:02:08.300> natural<00:02:08.450> but<00:02:08.929> still<00:02:09.170> give<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:09.410> really

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
really natural but still give you really

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.080 
really natural but still give you really
good<00:02:09.769> coverage<00:02:10.160> those<00:02:10.519> are<00:02:10.670> just<00:02:10.789> some<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
good coverage those are just some of the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.970 
good coverage those are just some of the
claims<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.599> read<00:02:11.780> on<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.019> display<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:12.709> then<00:02:12.860> it

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
claims I read on the display and then it

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.059 
claims I read on the display and then it
does<00:02:13.160> have<00:02:13.370> SPF<00:02:13.790> 20<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:15.019> this<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.709> what<00:02:15.980> it

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
does have SPF 20 so this is what it

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.619 
does have SPF 20 so this is what it
looks<00:02:16.280> like<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.760> color<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.090> got<00:02:17.450> was

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
looks like and the color I got was

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.710 
looks like and the color I got was
medium<00:02:18.019> beige<00:02:18.230> now<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.489> guess<00:02:20.090> I'll<00:02:20.360> start<00:02:20.480> off

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
medium beige now I guess I'll start off

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.059 
medium beige now I guess I'll start off
with<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.959> pros<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.500> then<00:02:21.590> I'll<00:02:21.680> do<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.830> cons

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
with the pros and then I'll do the cons

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.170 
with the pros and then I'll do the cons
because<00:02:22.190> there<00:02:22.370> are<00:02:22.489> some<00:02:22.700> constants

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
because there are some constants

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.910 
because there are some constants
foundation<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.019> there's<00:02:24.230> quite<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.709> lot<00:02:24.890> of

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
foundation so there's quite a lot of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.619 
foundation so there's quite a lot of
things<00:02:25.129> I<00:02:25.250> like<00:02:25.400> about<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.030> love<00:02:26.269> that

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
things I like about this I love that

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.330 
things I like about this I love that
it's<00:02:26.780> really<00:02:27.049> easy<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.319> blend<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:27.980> really

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
it's really easy to blend it's really

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.910 
it's really easy to blend it's really
light<00:02:28.640> coverage<00:02:29.599> like<00:02:30.049> it's<00:02:30.200> really<00:02:30.410> light<00:02:30.709> to

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
light coverage like it's really light to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.619 
light coverage like it's really light to
medium<00:02:31.069> coverage<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.849> it<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.060> buildable<00:02:32.420> so

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
medium coverage and it is buildable so

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.300 
medium coverage and it is buildable so
if<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.810> want<00:02:32.989> more<00:02:33.080> coverage<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.769> can<00:02:34.160> do

that too I was really impressed when I

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.620 
that too I was really impressed when I
first<00:04:04.010> noticed<00:04:04.400> that<00:04:04.519> I<00:04:04.549> wasn't<00:04:04.819> getting<00:04:05.090> oily

first noticed that I wasn't getting oily

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.990 
first noticed that I wasn't getting oily
like<00:04:05.780> in<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.380> places<00:04:06.739> I<00:04:06.859> normally<00:04:07.280> do<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:07.669> think

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
like in the places I normally do I think

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.690 
like in the places I normally do I think
this<00:04:08.150> would<00:04:08.329> be<00:04:08.359> good<00:04:08.690> if<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:08.959> had<00:04:09.220> like<00:04:10.220> oily

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
this would be good if you had like oily

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.879 
this would be good if you had like oily
skin<00:04:11.000> or<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.329> combination<00:04:11.600> skin<00:04:12.169> or<00:04:12.320> dry<00:04:12.470> skin

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
skin or a combination skin or dry skin

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.440 
skin or a combination skin or dry skin
because<00:04:13.009> even<00:04:13.459> if<00:04:13.549> you<00:04:13.639> have<00:04:13.759> dry<00:04:13.910> skin<00:04:13.940> it

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
because even if you have dry skin it

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.009 
because even if you have dry skin it
have<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.989> like<00:04:15.170> matte<00:04:15.560> dry<00:04:16.720> finish<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.930> know

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
it so you don't get it everywhere and it

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.980 
it so you don't get it everywhere and it
is<00:04:53.810> more<00:04:54.110> of<00:04:54.139> like<00:04:54.290> a<00:04:54.410> runny<00:04:54.830> kind<00:04:55.820> of<00:04:56.030> I<00:04:56.360> want

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
to say it's a thin foundation because

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.770 
to say it's a thin foundation because
it's<00:04:58.370> not<00:04:58.490> thin<00:04:58.790> but<00:04:59.060> it's<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.270> little<00:04:59.419> more<00:04:59.630> on

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780

foundations<00:05:27.320> with<00:05:27.470> like<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.620> yellow<00:05:27.979> undertone

you<00:05:28.520> know<00:05:28.820> so<00:05:29.479> this<00:05:30.020> is<00:05:30.200> like<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.560> closest<00:05:30.979> I

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
you know so this is like the closest I

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.040 
you know so this is like the closest I
can<00:05:31.340> match<00:05:31.490> to<00:05:31.700> my<00:05:31.820> skin<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:32.210> it<00:05:32.479> matches<00:05:32.690> me

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
okay I think it's still a teensy bit

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.219 
okay I think it's still a teensy bit
pink<00:05:36.950> which<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.610> would<00:05:37.850> normally<00:05:38.030> hate<00:05:38.510> but<00:05:38.930> the

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
pink which I would normally hate but the

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.900 
pink which I would normally hate but the
way<00:05:39.380> the<00:05:39.710> foundation<00:05:40.010> said<00:05:40.370> so<00:05:40.520> once<00:05:40.700> I<00:05:40.760> put

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
way the foundation said so once I put

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.640 
way the foundation said so once I put
all<00:05:41.000> of<00:05:41.030> my<00:05:41.270> other<00:05:41.360> makeup<00:05:41.720> it<00:05:41.840> just<00:05:42.020> works<00:05:42.350> so
