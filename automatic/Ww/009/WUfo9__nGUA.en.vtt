rooting<00:02:15.810> against<00:02:16.230> them<00:02:16.409> but<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.549> would<00:02:18.209> like<00:02:18.359> to

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
rooting against them but I would like to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.640 
rooting against them but I would like to
have<00:02:18.629> seen<00:02:18.780> myself<00:02:18.989> get<00:02:19.349> to

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
have seen myself get to

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.429 
have seen myself get to
bracelet<00:02:20.040> number<00:02:20.250> 12<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.730> didn't<00:02:21.000> do<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.239> so

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
bracelet number 12 and I didn't do it so

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.809 
bracelet number 12 and I didn't do it so
there's<00:02:22.439> some<00:02:22.650> disappointment<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.430> think<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.760> a

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
there's some disappointment I think in a

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.729 
there's some disappointment I think in a
week<00:02:24.000> or<00:02:24.150> two<00:02:24.359> or<00:02:24.689> a<00:02:24.719> month<00:02:24.840> or<00:02:25.260> two<00:02:25.409> I'll<00:02:25.560> feel

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
week or two or a month or two I'll feel

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.369 
week or two or a month or two I'll feel
better<00:02:26.010> because<00:02:26.849> winning<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.930> one<00:02:28.079> to<00:02:28.200> take

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
better because winning the one to take

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.679 
better because winning the one to take
history<00:02:29.069> by<00:02:29.459> yourself<00:02:29.939> is<00:02:30.090> not<00:02:30.269> an<00:02:30.389> easy<00:02:30.540> feat

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
history by yourself is not an easy feat

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.720 
history by yourself is not an easy feat
because<00:02:31.560> you're<00:02:31.709> staring<00:02:32.069> at<00:02:32.189> history<00:02:32.609> and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
because you're staring at history and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.610 
because you're staring at history and
you<00:02:32.790> know<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.389> know<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.170> I'm<00:02:34.230> trying<00:02:34.439> to<00:02:34.530> do

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
you know it I know that I'm trying to do

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.750 
you know it I know that I'm trying to do
something<00:02:34.859> no<00:02:35.099> one<00:02:35.250> else<00:02:35.370> has<00:02:35.519> done<00:02:35.549> before

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
something no one else has done before

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.050 
something no one else has done before
and<00:02:36.329> so<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:37.500> just<00:02:38.099> decided<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.579> it<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:38.819> time

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and so I just decided that it was time

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.770 
and so I just decided that it was time
for<00:02:39.329> me<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.450> be<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.719> man<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.540> played

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
for me to be the man and and I played

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.740 
for me to be the man and and I played
great<00:02:42.930> poker<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:43.859> did<00:02:44.010> win<00:02:44.189> one<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.730> well<00:02:45.720> I

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
great poker and I did win one so well I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.940 
great poker and I did win one so well I
really<00:02:46.019> wanted<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.290> go<00:02:46.409> deep<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.799> main

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
really wanted to go deep in the main

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.379 
really wanted to go deep in the main
event<00:02:47.099> you<00:02:47.340> know<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.489> mean<00:02:47.669> there's<00:02:47.819> no<00:02:47.970> reason

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
I made it deep every day after day after

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.949 
I made it deep every day after day after
day<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.739> know<00:02:52.919> exactly<00:02:53.340> what<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.790> do<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:54.900> just
