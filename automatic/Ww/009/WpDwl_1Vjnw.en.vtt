00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.450
 know the relationship that the models 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.610

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.390

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.940
 agency 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.060
 The function of the book at the moment is also 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.790
 take care of the agenda of the 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.250
 values ​​that the model wins is note 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.190
 contractual authorization of use of image 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.410
 all this is basically businessman of the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.239
 model advisor and Lucas was 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.570
 saying just before we started to 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.660
 interview about the role of 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.210
 psychologist because model also has the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.950
 your days Baixão actually that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.300
 need to do to convince the model 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.969
 that he is handsome that he is 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.000

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.889
 the robot that does best friend's work 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.479

 put in the clean let's do the job 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.420
 but I think you have to show the 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.909
 potential of the model because it is there 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.729

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.020
 Do you work with children with 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.300
 teens that you work the most 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.610
 of the adolescent children we have the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.340
 pulsations also that it is a market that 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.290
 grows more and more the marks end 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.780
 looking rather then that girl 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.550
 which is sometimes seen on the magazine cover 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.230
 said so I'm a little chubby not 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.690
 I'm a gisele. 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.940
 on the contrary have market for it can 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.910
 look for the agency comes to us we go 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.500
 give an advice we will prepare 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.620

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.090
 it does not matter if it's going to be a 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.500
 little chubby has a market for her 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.380
 so we have to really know 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.180
 all this is child and adolescent and 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.100
 adult has already a person a little over 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.160
 age and the site has to know how 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.690
 talk to know the right times 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.420
 I tried to do things 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.090
 and what then is the differential that is 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.880
 mega model with respect to your models 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.950
 since it tries to organize people from 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.680
 various ages 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.010

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:09.829
 it's commercial advertising is inclusive 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.090
 these models also beyond the fashions and 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.709
 commercial 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.450
 we may also be taking the model 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.150
 to são paulo 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.329
 you directly have the contacts of 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.069
 programs stations that come from the 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.950
 participation in programs and in 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.109
