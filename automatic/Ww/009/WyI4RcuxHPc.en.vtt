00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.540
 web video 9 for yourself the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.200
 This video is dedicated to the 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.480
 electronic keys of cars in 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.580
 concrete to a curiosity just like 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.420
 happens with the remote controls of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.000
 video tnt television or the controls of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.300
 garage that we can check the same 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.440
 with an average wave radio a radius of 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.360
 to m 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.160
 the keys of the cars the controls to 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.140
 distance we can check if the same 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.780
 is sharpening is initially 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.149
 emitting signal with a radio of am 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.260
 we put the radio dial on the 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:45.810
 lowest point on the left side in 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.829
 532 the highest is 1600 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.260
 we turn on the radio and 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.629
 we put the command in the most 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.949
 away from the speaker where would be the 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.949
 radio coil 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.409
 as you see by pressing the command 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.119
 that does have to be much closer 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.790
 of the radio for example that the command of 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.790
 garage or a third of a TV 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.770
 and depending on where we place it 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.770
 will emit a sound or other 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.340
 As you can see, we can check the charges 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.340
 of our car 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.130
 this emits less sr 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.780
 therefore as you see we did not see much 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.270
 less 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.330
 but continue today in the first 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.850
 corresponds to a world of opel 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.370
 the press concrete fira and the second 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.910
 is a command of that flight the command of 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.840
 chevrolet I already commented that you hear 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.840
 rather less than the other 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.930
 but as you can see you can basically 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.959
 do a little check to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.370
 know if the command is emitting and if 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.260
 we must face the same for 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.750
 check the battery or if it has been wet or 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.760
 see what problem can create because nothing 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.170
 it was just a small note that 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.879
 you do not have in mind what can be done 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.030
 this check with an aemme radio 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.410
 and I hope that I can be of help to you and 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.049
 You see that not all the commands are issued 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.040
 same but good if the controls work 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:39.799
 for example that of opel to 433 as 92 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.490
 megahertz is indicated on the side 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.590
 of the key 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.160
 you can barely see it but it's good 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.590
 in the same 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.620
 we can check it by a radio from there 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.780
 I greet and hope I get the help 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.290
 who keeps visiting the website and the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.250
 videos 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.250
 repair yourself
