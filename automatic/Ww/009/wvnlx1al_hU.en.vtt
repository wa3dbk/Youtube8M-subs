00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
study plan involves the charge as you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.869 
study plan involves the charge as you
can<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> need<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.850> heat<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.309> can

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
can see on the need is heat so it can

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.369 
can see on the need is heat so it can
get<00:00:51.030> quite<00:00:51.210> small<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.140> I've<00:00:52.230> only

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
get quite small as you can see I've only

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.900 
get quite small as you can see I've only
got<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.590> two<00:00:52.829> jumper<00:00:53.190> leads<00:00:53.370> going<00:00:53.610> down<00:00:53.789> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
got the two jumper leads going down to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.799 
got the two jumper leads going down to
one<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.120> those<00:00:54.210> batteries<00:00:54.750> there<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:56.690> do<00:00:57.690> you

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
one of those batteries there I do you

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.670 
one of those batteries there I do you
have<00:00:57.960> 2.3<00:00:58.469> 4<00:00:58.680> volts<00:00:59.609> charging<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.180> into<00:01:00.420> that

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.990 

not<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.250> see<00:01:05.400> what's<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.640> on

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
not so that we can see what's going on

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
not so that we can see what's going on
sort<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.510> spread<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.380> yields<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
sort of spread out of it down yields and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.399 
sort of spread out of it down yields and
leaders<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.430> stuff<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.659> let's<00:01:10.020> look<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.320> this

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
leaders and stuff so let's look at this

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.710 
leaders and stuff so let's look at this
one<00:01:10.470> which<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.830> adjustable<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.700> see<00:01:12.510> if<00:01:12.630> I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
one which is adjustable and see if I

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.160 
one which is adjustable and see if I
turn<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.080> potentiometer<00:01:13.530> down<00:01:15.020> there<00:01:16.020> does

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
turn this potentiometer down there does

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.789 
turn this potentiometer down there does
drop<00:01:16.439> things<00:01:16.619> off<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> bit<00:01:17.009> turn<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.939> back<00:01:17.970> up

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
drop things off a bit turn it back up

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
drop things off a bit turn it back up
not<00:01:19.799> me<00:01:20.460> delete<00:01:20.729> loose<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.119> my<00:01:21.240> cap<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:21.689> yeah

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
not me delete loose on my cap there yeah

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.039 
not me delete loose on my cap there yeah
so<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.310> see<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.060> voltage<00:01:24.360> in

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
so you see here this is the voltage in

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.520 
so you see here this is the voltage in
that<00:01:25.320> capacitor<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> voltage<00:01:28.020> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that capacitor this is the voltage in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.230 
that capacitor this is the voltage in
the<00:01:28.740> battery<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.369> charging<00:01:29.700> which<00:01:30.060> is

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the battery that it's charging which is

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.140 
the battery that it's charging which is
this<00:01:30.450> time<00:01:31.040> I'd<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.220> grainy<00:01:32.520> which<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.090> of

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
this time I'd be grainy which I kind of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.760 
this time I'd be grainy which I kind of
jazzed<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.600> bit<00:01:33.810> by<00:01:33.930> banging<00:01:34.170> across<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> 12

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
jazzed up a bit by banging across a 12

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.960 
jazzed up a bit by banging across a 12
volt<00:01:34.890> battery<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.460> an<00:01:35.520> hour<00:01:35.610> or<00:01:35.729> two<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
volt battery for an hour or two the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.749 
volt battery for an hour or two the
other<00:01:36.060> date<00:01:36.299> boards<00:01:36.570> buggery<00:01:36.930> out<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
other date boards buggery out of it and

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.190 
other date boards buggery out of it and
well<00:01:38.759> look<00:01:39.030> at<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.270> happened<00:01:39.570> inside<00:01:39.689> its

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
well look at what happened inside its

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.490 
well look at what happened inside its
top<00:01:40.409> angle<00:01:40.619> fluid<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.189> top<00:01:41.430> which<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.759> nice

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
top angle fluid on top which is nice

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.200 
top angle fluid on top which is nice
spit<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.560> top<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:44.490> hard<00:01:44.700> actually<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.149> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
spit on top really hard actually have to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.760 
spit on top really hard actually have to
drill<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> hole<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.229> more<00:01:46.350> water<00:01:46.530> in

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
drill a hole in it to get more water in

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.460 
drill a hole in it to get more water in
there<00:01:47.270> any<00:01:48.270> way<00:01:48.360> back<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> best<00:01:49.079> circuit

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
there any way back to the best circuit

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.050 
there any way back to the best circuit
so<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> basic<00:01:51.439> idea<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.850> use<00:01:53.850> an<00:01:53.970> LED

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
so this is the basic idea you use an LED

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.100 
so this is the basic idea you use an LED
or<00:01:54.600> regular<00:01:54.960> diodes<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.869> pretty

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
or regular diodes this is you see pretty

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.330 
or regular diodes this is you see pretty
clearly<00:01:58.200> what's<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.040> that's<00:01:59.189> my

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
clearly what's going on here that's my

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.280 
clearly what's going on here that's my
collector<00:01:59.820> base<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.630> emitter<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.140> my

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
collector base and emitter and my

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.240 
collector base and emitter and my
transistor<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.200> apply<00:02:04.439> voltage<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:05.040> hear

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
transistor so as I apply voltage to hear

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.270 
transistor so as I apply voltage to hear
it<00:02:05.369> needs<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.180> break<00:02:06.390> over<00:02:06.600> both<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
it needs the to break over both the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.750 
it needs the to break over both the
diode<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:08.520> well<00:02:08.910> as<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.450> point<00:02:09.720> 52.7<00:02:10.760> voltage

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
diode as well as the point 52.7 voltage

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.640 
diode as well as the point 52.7 voltage
drop<00:02:12.030> through<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.360> transistor

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
drop through the transistor

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.949 
drop through the transistor
so<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.730> case<00:02:14.970> i<00:02:15.209> can<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:15.480> about<00:02:15.569> three

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
so in this case i can get about three

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.399 
so in this case i can get about three
and<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.140> half<00:02:16.170> volts<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.310> voltage<00:02:17.730> drop<00:02:17.909> between

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
and a half volts a voltage drop between

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.720 
and a half volts a voltage drop between
going<00:02:19.409> through<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.739> LED<00:02:20.159> and<00:02:20.430> then<00:02:20.519> through

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
going through the LED and then through

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.819 
going through the LED and then through
the<00:02:20.760> transistor<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.659> emitter<00:02:21.689> but<00:02:22.680> that

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
the transistor the emitter but that

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.630 
the transistor the emitter but that
switches<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.370> transistor<00:02:23.939> on<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.680> then<00:02:26.489> you

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
switches the transistor on and then you

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.160 
switches the transistor on and then you
don't<00:02:26.819> have<00:02:26.879> any<00:02:27.120> voltage<00:02:27.360> drop<00:02:27.780> from<00:02:27.959> your

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
don't have any voltage drop from your

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.069 
don't have any voltage drop from your
collector<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.680> your<00:02:28.829> Emir<00:02:29.720> as<00:02:30.720> soon<00:02:30.930> as<00:02:31.019> it

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
collector to your Emir as soon as it

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.869 
collector to your Emir as soon as it
drops<00:02:31.290> down<00:02:31.379> below<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.890> volt<00:02:32.069> power<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.730> turn

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
drops down below the volt power to turn

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.030 
drops down below the volt power to turn
on<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.209> LED<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.750> switches<00:02:34.109> off<00:02:34.200> again<00:02:34.500> that's

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
on the LED and switches off again that's

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.940 
on the LED and switches off again that's
the<00:02:35.159> cap<00:02:35.340> charge<00:02:35.609> back<00:02:35.849> up<00:02:36.560> there<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.590> as<00:02:37.829> you

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
the cap charge back up there and as you

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.550 
the cap charge back up there and as you
can<00:02:38.069> see<00:02:38.099> from<00:02:38.340> these<00:02:38.519> constantly<00:02:39.060> loop<00:02:39.560> LEDs

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
can see from these constantly loop LEDs

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.319 
can see from these constantly loop LEDs
it<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:40.829> going<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.189> quite<00:02:41.400> fast<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.939> checked<00:02:42.180> on

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
it is going it quite fast I checked on

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.330 
it is going it quite fast I checked on
the<00:02:42.420> scope<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:43.409> will<00:02:43.590> sync<00:02:43.920> up<00:02:44.040> with<00:02:44.189> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
the scope it will sync up with the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.319 
the scope it will sync up with the
timing<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.909> oscillator<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:47.239> so<00:02:48.239> I'm

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
timing of the oscillator and so I'm

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.030 
timing of the oscillator and so I'm
running<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.870> full<00:02:49.170> Sun<00:02:49.409> here<00:02:49.620> at<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.739> moment

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
was and he's charged my battery is very

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.710 
was and he's charged my battery is very
well<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:57.060> let's<00:02:57.299> say<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:03.030> there<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.510> have<00:03:03.540> it

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
well and let's say so there you have it

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.849 
well and let's say so there you have it
and<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.109> other<00:03:04.170> thing<00:03:04.319> I'd<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.709> mention

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
and the other thing I'd like to mention

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.890 
and the other thing I'd like to mention
briefly<00:03:05.310> over<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.930> tip<00:03:07.470> 122<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:09.480> you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
briefly over here is the tip 122 but you

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.470 
briefly over here is the tip 122 but you
can<00:03:10.079> she<00:03:10.200> ometer<00:03:10.439> there<00:03:10.620> its<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.430> 50<00:03:11.579> K<00:03:11.909> 1<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.359> as

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
can she ometer there its a 50 K 1 and as

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.429 
can she ometer there its a 50 K 1 and as
you<00:03:12.629> saw<00:03:13.609> when<00:03:14.609> my<00:03:14.760> leads<00:03:14.970> don't<00:03:15.439> disconnect

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
you saw when my leads don't disconnect

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.949 
you saw when my leads don't disconnect
turning<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.400> down<00:03:17.459> will<00:03:17.849> turn<00:03:18.090> down<00:03:18.329> the

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.649 
do get less milliamps obviously wats law
applies<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.639> same<00:03:59.790> Watsa<00:04:00.180> going<00:04:00.449> through

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
applies the same Watsa going through

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.030 
applies the same Watsa going through
I've<00:04:00.750> worked<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.109> out<00:04:01.199> it's<00:04:01.440> very<00:04:01.620> close<00:04:01.859> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
I've worked it out it's very close the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.619 
I've worked it out it's very close the
same<00:04:02.250> walks<00:04:02.489> there<00:04:02.699> is<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.819> tiny<00:04:03.030> lost<00:04:03.329> to<00:04:03.540> make

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
same walks there is a tiny lost to make

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.409 
same walks there is a tiny lost to make
ninety<00:04:03.900> percent<00:04:04.019> efficient<00:04:05.150> but<00:04:06.150> are<00:04:06.239> pretty

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
ninety percent efficient but are pretty

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.909 
ninety percent efficient but are pretty
much<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.599> same<00:04:06.750> wats<00:04:07.139> goin<00:04:07.379> your<00:04:07.560> battery

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
much the same wats goin your battery

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.369 
much the same wats goin your battery
better<00:04:08.129> to<00:04:08.250> high<00:04:08.370> voltage<00:04:08.819> different'<00:04:09.419> mean

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
better to high voltage different' mean

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.569 
better to high voltage different' mean
if<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.560> just<00:04:10.739> hooked<00:04:10.919> it<00:04:11.010> straight<00:04:11.250> up<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.519> the

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
if you just hooked it straight up to the

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:12.979 
if you just hooked it straight up to the
capacitor<00:04:12.060> which<00:04:12.239> cells<00:04:12.449> still<00:04:12.659> charge<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
capacitor which cells still charge the

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.300 
capacitor which cells still charge the
battery<00:04:13.349> anyway<00:04:13.620> but<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:13.859> think<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.099> works

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
battery anyway but I think this works

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.740 
battery anyway but I think this works
better<00:04:15.470> sure<00:04:16.470> there<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:16.859> have<00:04:16.979> it<00:04:17.010> oh<00:04:17.599> it's<00:04:18.599> a

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
better sure there you have it oh it's a

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.770 
better sure there you have it oh it's a
sinus<00:04:19.019> transistor

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
sinus transistor

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.879 
sinus transistor
that's<00:04:21.739> an<00:04:21.950> 18<00:04:22.400> volt<00:04:22.639> and<00:04:25.030> there<00:04:26.620> with<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.740> tip

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
that's an 18 volt and there with the tip

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.010 
that's an 18 volt and there with the tip
122<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:30.350> power<00:04:30.530> supply<00:04:30.740> toroid<00:04:32.020> it

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
122 and that power supply toroid it

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.590 
122 and that power supply toroid it
still<00:04:33.800> works<00:04:34.040> at<00:04:34.639> zero<00:04:35.090> resistance<00:04:37.600> it's

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
still works at zero resistance it's

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.409 
still works at zero resistance it's
still<00:04:38.840> oscillates<00:04:40.840> which<00:04:41.840> is<00:04:41.990> pretty<00:04:42.200> good

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
still oscillates which is pretty good

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.000 
still oscillates which is pretty good
very<00:04:44.419> handy<00:04:44.750> for<00:04:44.780> this<00:04:44.960> time<00:04:45.200> to<00:04:45.320> set<00:04:45.530> up<00:04:45.650> and

very handy for this time to set up and

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.909 
very handy for this time to set up and
these<00:04:46.460> will<00:04:46.700> keep<00:04:46.880> charging<00:04:47.530> well<00:04:48.530> into<00:04:48.830> the

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
these will keep charging well into the

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.370 
these will keep charging well into the
evening<00:04:49.120> well<00:04:50.120> not<00:04:50.450> till<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:50.810> gets<00:04:50.960> dark<00:04:51.139> this

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
evening well not till it gets dark this

evening well not till it gets dark this
one<00:04:51.560> will<00:04:51.680> drop<00:04:51.830> out<00:04:51.980> be<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.250> first<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.580> drop

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
one will drop out be the first to drop

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.570 
one will drop out be the first to drop
it<00:04:52.880> up<00:04:52.970> without<00:04:53.780> four<00:04:54.200> in<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.440> afternoon

completely dark outside well after

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.870 
completely dark outside well after
sunset<00:05:23.320> this<00:05:24.320> little<00:05:24.560> panels<00:05:25.010> bit<00:05:25.700> more

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
sunset this little panels bit more

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.870 
sunset this little panels bit more
pathetic<00:05:26.860> it'll<00:05:27.860> go<00:05:27.979> at-bat<00:05:28.160> three<00:05:28.640> o'clock

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880

in the afternoon little go well past
after<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.700> sun's<00:05:31.910> gone<00:05:32.090> at<00:05:32.240> the<00:05:32.419> other<00:05:32.570> side

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
after the sun's gone at the other side

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.800 
after the sun's gone at the other side
of<00:05:32.810> it<00:05:33.370> so<00:05:34.370> yeah<00:05:34.520> that's<00:05:34.640> about<00:05:34.910> it<00:05:34.940> thanks<00:05:35.690> for
