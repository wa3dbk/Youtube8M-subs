filtered<00:00:20.140> is<00:00:20.350> good<00:00:20.590> because<00:00:20.770> filtered<00:00:21.310> oils

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
filtered is good because filtered oils

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.640 
filtered is good because filtered oils
are<00:00:21.850> made<00:00:22.060> at<00:00:22.270> a<00:00:22.300> lower<00:00:22.570> temperature<00:00:22.840> so<00:00:23.350> they

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
are made at a lower temperature so they

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.260 
are made at a lower temperature so they
retain<00:00:23.830> all<00:00:24.190> of<00:00:24.220> their<00:00:24.490> vitamins<00:00:25.060> and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
retain all of their vitamins and

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.720 
retain all of their vitamins and
minerals<00:00:25.690> and<00:00:25.869> the<00:00:26.410> fatty<00:00:26.710> acid<00:00:27.160> bond<00:00:27.430> doesn't

course<00:00:32.349> all<00:00:32.619> of<00:00:32.650> the<00:00:32.860> vitamins<00:00:33.280> and<00:00:33.430> minerals

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
course all of the vitamins and minerals

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.580 
course all of the vitamins and minerals
are<00:00:33.850> lost<00:00:34.120> because<00:00:34.510> it's<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:34.930> process<00:00:35.260> which

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
are lost because it's a process which

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.439 
are lost because it's a process which
takes<00:00:35.770> place<00:00:36.040> at<00:00:36.280> a<00:00:36.309> much<00:00:36.370> higher<00:00:36.550> temperature

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
takes place at a much higher temperature

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.180 
takes place at a much higher temperature
and<00:00:39.480> fatty<00:00:40.480> acid<00:00:40.840> bonds<00:00:41.230> can<00:00:41.470> break<00:00:41.890> and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
and fatty acid bonds can break and

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.890 
and fatty acid bonds can break and
become<00:00:42.760> toxic<00:00:43.300> to<00:00:43.960> your<00:00:44.350> heart<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.780> other

difference<00:00:47.379> between<00:00:47.739> filtered<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.420> refined

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
difference between filtered and refined

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.660 
difference between filtered and refined
is<00:00:49.629> that<00:00:49.809> filtered<00:00:50.260> will<00:00:50.500> retain<00:00:51.160> its<00:00:51.190> taste

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
is that filtered will retain its taste

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.000 
is that filtered will retain its taste
and<00:00:51.910> flavor<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.570> refine<00:00:53.200> will<00:00:53.410> lose<00:00:53.649> all<00:00:53.950> of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
and flavor the refine will lose all of

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.450 
and flavor the refine will lose all of
its<00:00:54.370> taste<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:54.910> flavor<00:00:55.210> as<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.620> manufacturer

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
its taste and flavor as a manufacturer

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.389 
its taste and flavor as a manufacturer
you<00:00:57.790> should<00:00:58.390> prefer<00:00:58.809> refined<00:00:59.320> over<00:00:59.649> filtered

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
you should prefer refined over filtered

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.000 
you should prefer refined over filtered
because<00:01:01.270> in<00:01:01.480> when<00:01:01.809> you<00:01:01.960> use<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.500> process<00:01:02.739> of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
because in when you use the process of

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.930 
because in when you use the process of
refining<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:04.210> can<00:01:04.420> use<00:01:04.660> any<00:01:05.050> grade<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:06.190> seed

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
refining you can use any grade of seed

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.450 
refining you can use any grade of seed
it<00:01:07.240> need<00:01:07.539> not<00:01:07.780> be<00:01:07.840> good<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.800> could<00:01:09.039> even<00:01:09.220> be

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
it need not be good it could even be

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.249 
it need not be good it could even be
something<00:01:09.490> which<00:01:10.000> has<00:01:10.119> gone<00:01:10.330> completely<00:01:10.990> bad

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
something which has gone completely bad

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.960 
something which has gone completely bad
because<00:01:11.710> you're<00:01:11.950> going<00:01:12.160> to<00:01:12.250> be<00:01:12.369> extracting

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
because you're going to be extracting

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.660 
because you're going to be extracting
oil<00:01:13.119> at<00:01:13.360> such<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.660> high<00:01:13.960> temperature<00:01:13.990> that<00:01:14.950> it's

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
oil at such a high temperature that it's

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.460 
oil at such a high temperature that it's
not<00:01:15.910> going<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.240> retain<00:01:16.539> any<00:01:16.690> taste<00:01:17.020> flavor

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
not going to retain any taste flavor

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.639 
not going to retain any taste flavor
aroma<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:18.100> its<00:01:18.369> own<00:01:18.550> that's<00:01:19.420> one<00:01:19.660> the<00:01:20.200> second

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
aroma of its own that's one the second

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.770 
aroma of its own that's one the second
thing<00:01:20.860> is<00:01:21.039> that<00:01:21.509> refining<00:01:22.509> gives<00:01:23.260> you<00:01:23.590> almost

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
thing is that refining gives you almost

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.740 
thing is that refining gives you almost
hundred-percent<00:01:25.780> extraction<00:01:26.470> almost<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.659> it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
hundred-percent extraction almost so it

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.350 
hundred-percent extraction almost so it
makes<00:01:28.990> much<00:01:29.200> more<00:01:29.229> sense<00:01:29.439> for<00:01:29.830> you<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:29.979> be<00:01:30.360> pro

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
makes much more sense for you to be pro

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.870 
makes much more sense for you to be pro
refining<00:01:32.110> if<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.770> are<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.890> manufacturer<00:01:33.430> if

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
refining if you are a manufacturer if

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.510 
refining if you are a manufacturer if
you<00:01:34.479> are<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.600> consumer<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:35.950> should<00:01:36.189> look<00:01:36.310> at

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
you are a consumer you should look at

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.969 
you are a consumer you should look at
filter<00:01:37.030> because<00:01:37.479> filtered<00:01:37.990> means<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.770> I

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
filter because filtered means that I

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.800 
filter because filtered means that I
will<00:01:39.310> be<00:01:39.520> forced<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.960> get<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.200> good<00:01:41.590> grade<00:01:41.979> seed

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
will be forced to get a good grade seed

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.060 
will be forced to get a good grade seed
because<00:01:43.810> it's<00:01:43.990> going<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.380> retain<00:01:44.560> everything

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
because it's going to retain everything

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.219 
because it's going to retain everything
the<00:01:45.490> taste<00:01:45.729> flavor<00:01:46.060> aroma<00:01:46.330> because<00:01:46.750> it's<00:01:47.049> at<00:01:47.200> a

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
the taste flavor aroma because it's at a

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.410 
the taste flavor aroma because it's at a
lower<00:01:47.439> temperature<00:01:47.650> that's<00:01:48.250> one<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.939> second

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
lower temperature that's one the second

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.039 
lower temperature that's one the second
thing<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:51.009> happens<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:51.759> that<00:01:52.000> you<00:01:52.270> cannot

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
thing that happens is that you cannot

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.010 
thing that happens is that you cannot
even<00:01:53.229> extract<00:01:53.860> all<00:01:54.100> of<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.400> oil<00:01:54.900> so<00:01:55.900> as<00:01:55.990> a

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
even extract all of the oil so as a

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.899 
even extract all of the oil so as a
manufacturer<00:01:56.650> is<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:56.950> bad<00:01:57.220> deal<00:01:57.460> but<00:01:57.700> as<00:01:57.880> a

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
manufacturer is a bad deal but as a

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.300 
manufacturer is a bad deal but as a
consumer<00:01:58.540> it's<00:01:58.869> good<00:01:59.140> because<00:01:59.470> only<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.920> good

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
consumer it's good because only the good

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.670 
consumer it's good because only the good
quality<00:02:00.970> comes<00:02:01.299> out<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:02.140> know<00:02:02.259> what<00:02:02.500> they

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
quality comes out you know what they

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.149 
quality comes out you know what they
call<00:02:02.950> what<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.780> Italians<00:02:05.350> sell<00:02:05.740> as<00:02:05.920> the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
call what the Italians sell as the

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.289 
call what the Italians sell as the
Virgin<00:02:06.759> oil<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:08.380> first<00:02:08.709> one<00:02:09.130> only<00:02:10.000> that

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
Virgin oil the first one only that

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.540 
Virgin oil the first one only that
nothing<00:02:11.079> else

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.740 

so<00:02:14.270> Phil<00:02:14.510> Todd<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.930> better

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.170 

now<00:02:19.680> whether<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.100> should<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.430> eating<00:02:20.670> seeds

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
now whether you should be eating seeds

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.220 
now whether you should be eating seeds
like<00:02:21.680> peanut<00:02:22.680> or<00:02:22.980> thin<00:02:23.490> or<00:02:23.880> mustard<00:02:24.540> over

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
like peanut or thin or mustard over

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.010 
like peanut or thin or mustard over
vegetable<00:02:25.860> like<00:02:26.460> safflower<00:02:27.030> sunflower<00:02:27.450> or

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
vegetable like safflower sunflower or

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.270 
vegetable like safflower sunflower or
corn<00:02:28.620> or<00:02:28.830> soya<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:32.960> rice<00:02:33.960> bran<00:02:34.320> rice<00:02:34.770> bran<00:02:35.100> has

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
corn or soya and rice bran rice bran has

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.490 
corn or soya and rice bran rice bran has
been<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> new<00:02:35.760> entrant<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.340> what<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.520> better

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
and all of those things yes you can

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.270 
and all of those things yes you can
but<00:04:03.080> again<00:04:04.080> try<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.350> look<00:04:04.590> for<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.830> filtered

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
but again try and look for a filtered

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.800 
but again try and look for a filtered
source<00:04:05.580> but<00:04:05.820> very<00:04:06.030> difficult<00:04:06.270> to<00:04:06.600> get<00:04:06.750> a

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
source but very difficult to get a

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.390 
source but very difficult to get a
filtered<00:04:07.230> source<00:04:07.530> for<00:04:07.800> that<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.010> think<00:04:08.310> you

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
filtered source for that I think you

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.920 
filtered source for that I think you
almost<00:04:08.700> don't<00:04:08.910> get

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.830 

a<00:04:12.959> lot<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.909> nutrition<00:04:14.909> beliefs<00:04:15.299> are<00:04:15.569> also

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
a lot of nutrition beliefs are also

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.740 
a lot of nutrition beliefs are also
industry<00:04:16.769> or<00:04:16.949> profit-driven<00:04:17.459> so<00:04:18.449> there<00:04:18.600> was<00:04:18.720> a

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
industry or profit-driven so there was a

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.270 
industry or profit-driven so there was a
proper<00:04:22.669> almost<00:04:23.669> like<00:04:23.970> a<00:04:24.000> kind<00:04:24.360> of<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:25.280> don't

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
proper almost like a kind of I don't

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.189 
proper almost like a kind of I don't
really<00:04:26.520> know<00:04:26.970> what<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.479> right<00:04:27.720> word<00:04:28.139> but

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
really know what is the right word but

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.070 
really know what is the right word but
there<00:04:28.650> was<00:04:28.740> this<00:04:28.949> huge<00:04:29.340> almost<00:04:30.030> movement<00:04:30.900> kind

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
there was this huge almost movement kind

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.150 
there was this huge almost movement kind
of<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.410> thing<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:32.190> downgrade<00:04:32.490> coconut<00:04:33.330> oil<00:04:34.160> to

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
thing and it increases cholesterol and

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.030
