00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
there it is in the bottom of that cell

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.820 
there it is in the bottom of that cell
that<00:00:09.000> we<00:00:09.150> saw<00:00:09.330> beforehand<00:00:09.900> well<00:00:10.110> what<00:00:10.769> you

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
have to do is get this cell to come down

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.099 
have to do is get this cell to come down
but<00:00:13.080> there's<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.710> pipe<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.580> has<00:00:14.820> been<00:00:15.089> put<00:00:15.990> in

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the way it's kind of inserted in where

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.630 
the way it's kind of inserted in where
the<00:00:18.270> piston<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.770> can't<00:00:20.070> move<00:00:20.310> down

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the piston is and it can't move down

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.040

moves<00:00:24.449> down<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> switched<00:00:25.140> my<00:00:25.289> pistol<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.010> have

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
moves down I switched my pistol I have

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.890 
moves down I switched my pistol I have
an<00:00:26.400> SMG<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.180> pretty<00:00:27.330> much<00:00:27.420> shoot<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.779> with

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
an SMG you can pretty much shoot it with

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.870 
an SMG you can pretty much shoot it with
every<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.410> anything<00:00:28.890> but<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.429> does<00:00:29.580> take

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
every for anything but it does take

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.790 
every for anything but it does take
quite<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.179> bit<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.449> ammo<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.320> thing<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
quite a bit of ammo to get this thing to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.190 
quite a bit of ammo to get this thing to
push<00:00:32.160> through<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.910> don't<00:00:33.420> know<00:00:33.540> how<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:34.050> it's

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
push through I don't know how like it's

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.959 
push through I don't know how like it's
got<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.829> head<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.760> don't<00:00:35.820> know

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
got that that head on it I don't know

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.389 
got that that head on it I don't know
how<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.329> gets<00:00:36.480> through<00:00:36.780> there<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.710> does<00:00:37.920> ok

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
how it gets through there but it does ok

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.090 
how it gets through there but it does ok
so<00:00:39.030> once<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> way<00:00:40.260> then<00:00:41.070> we

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
so once that's out of the way then we

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.819 
so once that's out of the way then we
can<00:00:41.399> actually<00:00:41.969> push<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.840> cell<00:00:43.170> down<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
can actually push this cell down and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.889 
can actually push this cell down and
that'll<00:00:44.010> pop<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.520> other<00:00:44.550> one<00:00:44.850> up<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.390> give

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that'll pop the other one up and give

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.170 
that'll pop the other one up and give
you<00:00:46.020> enough<00:00:46.320> time<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.219> doesn't<00:00:47.550> last<00:00:47.789> for

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
you enough time and it doesn't last for

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.090 
you enough time and it doesn't last for
too<00:00:48.390> long<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.140> it'll<00:00:49.350> give<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.559> enough<00:00:49.829> time

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
too long but it'll give you enough time

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.639
