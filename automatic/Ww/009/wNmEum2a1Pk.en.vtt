00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 there are very good here yes friends fans of 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.550
 batman welcome though in play for 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.110
 touch of the playstation 4 version 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.760
 where will I give my opinion about the game 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.750
 as a fan that I am 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.780
 very important rocksteady returns 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.260
 a batman from the arcum origins that no 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.790
 he does it from the arkham city 'sorry that 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.240
 it's great news since the previous 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:31.650
 the origin reaped a lot of criticism 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.989
 by continuist it was very similar to 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.420
 the city and there is not anything so 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.070
 come back in theory they go back to making a 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.200
 Novelty game of sneakers is already seen alone 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.020
 in the graphics 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.780
 talking a bit about the iut system what 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.950
 we see very similar I did not want not to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.640
 see the map and did not want either 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.800
 show it by pressing the button the button 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.620
 start I suppose it is not to receive 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.540
 criticisms about 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.070
 on the scale of the map 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.290
 we have to say that the flight is 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.520
 improved the hook the same here you will see a 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.310
 new animation 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.890
 how it does and most interestingly the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.390
 interaction with the stage very but 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.630
 that much improved 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.300
 and apparently there are no charges when entering 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.979
 as it happens with the witcher although in 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.000
 this is to see because maybe there's 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.000
 zones that if others that do not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.430
 and to see the combat is very very very 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.070
 similar but very much to the previous ones 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.189
 as now very used and such 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.940
 as we liked the others that follows 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.280
 present in this 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.990
 a year new combos like this one that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.210
 when they grab us from behind some 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.830
 new animations some gadgets 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.800
 new 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.300
 the eliminations are still some 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.390
 they have varied like this from the hook 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.000
 when it catches you it ends with a kick and this 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.350
 for me it's more interesting the video is 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.120
 like when he's going to fall, he picks up again 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.120
 and continue with the combo 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.450
 and ending uncle this is a pro 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.450
 we will try to be at the height 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.690
 also to say that the guide seems that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.030
 is improved compared to previous 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.110
 this is due as the graphics 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.470
 for the new engine 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.360
 and that the game is also not layered is 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.030
 say do not cover the previous ones 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.440
 generations of consoles as only 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.490
 will go to the current s 4 xbox juan and pc 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.860
 well 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.210
 schneier in every rule that is what 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.210
 and touches my opinion 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.520
 very good that you have borrowed 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.210
 speaking a little bit of the story the 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.580
 final enemy a main enemy will be 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.350
 scarecrow 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.430
 but as you have seen here there are also 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.850
 a soldier of arkham that means 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.490
 that there will be a new commanded army 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.550
 by the new enemy of the arkham game 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.470
 night is a new enemy 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.590
 of this game he has made 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.129
 especially for the game 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.480
 and we'll see if it's a character already seen in 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.690
 previous 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.489
 behind the hood or an example my 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.280
 theory that the same is the second 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.280
 robin hayes on top red hood 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.580
 or we will not see 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.810
 also talking about the robbins 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.810
 included 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:50.170
 of the saga of batman arkham city example 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.519
 will help us in the battle only 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.810
 we will see in place that I will upload 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.209
 later 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.950
 and will also help us nightwing the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.750
 first of the roben remember dick 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.800
 grayson 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.470
 and that these three will have help during 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.130
 all the game and in gameplay the 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.530
 cooperative 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.920
 with the cpu will not be cooperative in two 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.920
 people 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.660
 this very much thank you very much because in a 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.000
 beginning when I saw the video I thought good 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.110
 has here as a kind of prison 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.570
 on your mobile website but you do not see what the 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.950
 7 passengers because as you will see now the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.950
 batmobile is a single-seater 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.419
 and now yes 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.879
 let's see one of the great news 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.639
 of the game where I think they have put 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:48.919
 more resources than it is in driving in 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.960
 the evil mobile all the referents for 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.569
 attack from the batmobile 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.900
 As you can see there is a button that is ready 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.830
 for him 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.280
 is a destroyer destroying everything 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.240
 He passed 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.240
 by his side 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.139
 we can even fight 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.969
 with missiles 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.160
 I hope these are robots and not 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:16.060
 human because if they are human in there 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.340
 between the army of arkham the truth 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.860
 break a bit the schemes of the of 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.880
 the batman sagas because we remember 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.880
 that he never killed 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:29.779
 as we see is going to have the gameplay 

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:29.779
 varied 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:36.130
 between driving and 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:39.130
 It's going to be great. I'm looking forward to what 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.130
 here 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.080
 how cool 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:50.490
 the wounds of destruction wounds better 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.490
 said of the batmobile 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.070
 a pass here right now a load is 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.010
 car 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.140
 tutorials should have people 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.250
 inside so I do not know what role it is going to 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.250
 develop the wonderful 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.050
 the video will end compression and I saw 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.160
 being arrested at the police station 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:21.449
 here they show us a commission already ultra 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:24.800
 fortified does not have I do not know how many 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:28.340
 I do not know how many places here in the parking 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.340
 of depth 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:36.070
 and nothing more here to remind you that 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:38.800
 also videos of these batman 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.560
 where will I show another type of gameplay and 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.780
 other kind of characters that someone 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.810
 taking out 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.350
 and new reminders to follow us in the 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:54.130
 social networks twitter facebook google + 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:55.870
 the game comes out on the 23rd of this month and 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.680
 for that reason it is necessary to be warming up 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.660
 engines 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.660
 see you next thing is chao 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.080
 brother 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:21.919
 but not
