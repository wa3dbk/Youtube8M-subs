the next thing we need to do is make a
brake<00:01:04.019> pedal<00:01:04.409> adjusting<00:01:05.189> board<00:01:06.439> here<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
brake pedal adjusting board here is a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.740 
brake pedal adjusting board here is a
picture<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.159> what<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.970> board<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.450> look<00:01:09.479> like

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
picture of what the board will look like

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.990 
picture of what the board will look like
and<00:01:10.760> it<00:01:11.760> has<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> bunch<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.299> steps<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
and it has a bunch of steps on it and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.910 
and it has a bunch of steps on it and
right<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.479> reference<00:01:16.259> line<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
right here is the reference line and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.330 
right here is the reference line and
that<00:01:17.820> will<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.330> distance<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.979> front

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that will be the distance from the front

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.730 
that will be the distance from the front
seat<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> pedal<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:22.439> from<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
seat to the pedal and then from the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.149 
seat to the pedal and then from the
reference<00:01:23.250> line<00:01:24.080> it's<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.500> inch<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
reference line it's one inch to the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.830 
reference line it's one inch to the
first<00:01:26.460> step<00:01:28.700> then<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.810> half

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
first step then it is one and a half

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.840 
first step then it is one and a half
inches<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> next<00:01:34.229> step<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:35.520> two

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
inches to the next step and then two

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.310 
inches to the next step and then two
inches<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.710> next<00:01:38.250> step<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.640> they're<00:01:38.970> all

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
inches to the next step and they're all

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.630 
inches to the next step and they're all
1/2<00:01:40.320> inch<00:01:40.740> down<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> step<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> need<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
1/2 inch down on the step so you need to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.789 
1/2 inch down on the step so you need to
make<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.479> now<00:01:48.200> now<00:01:49.200> we're<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> put

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
make that now now we're going to put

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.499 
make that now now we're going to put
this<00:01:49.950> adjuster<00:01:50.490> into<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> first<00:01:51.149> notch

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
this adjuster into the first notch

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.910 
this adjuster into the first notch
against<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> pedal<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:54.299> seat<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.590> push

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
against the pedal and the seat so push

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.600 
against the pedal and the seat so push
the<00:01:56.070> pedal<00:01:56.369> down<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.649> hits<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> pedal<00:01:59.310> in

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the pedal down so it hits the pedal in

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.030 
the pedal down so it hits the pedal in
this<00:01:59.880> case<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> pedal<00:02:00.750> pad<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.530> what

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
this case I have a pedal pad and what

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.149 
this case I have a pedal pad and what
I'm<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.670> next<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.950> turn<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
I'm going to do next is turn the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.479 
I'm going to do next is turn the
adjusting<00:02:05.640> Ridge<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.299> rear<00:02:06.509> wheels

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
adjusting Ridge and the rear wheels

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.940 
adjusting Ridge and the rear wheels
clockwise<00:02:08.720> till<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.840> brakes<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.440> begin<00:02:10.830> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
clockwise till the brakes just begin to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.650 
clockwise till the brakes just begin to
hold

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
hold

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.200 
hold
then<00:02:12.930> we're<00:02:13.770> going<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.100> turn<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.550> adjuster

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
then we're going to turn this adjuster

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.400 
then we're going to turn this adjuster
in<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:16.410> clockwise<00:02:16.710> direction<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:18.230> tell<00:02:19.230> this

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
in a clockwise direction and tell this

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:37.289 
in a clockwise direction and tell this

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.940 

now<00:02:38.299> it's<00:02:38.510> dragging<00:02:39.280> okay<00:02:41.739> we're<00:02:42.739> going<00:02:42.890> to

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
now it's dragging okay we're going to

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.330 
now it's dragging okay we're going to
move<00:02:43.069> this<00:02:43.310> board<00:02:43.579> now<00:02:43.849> to<00:02:43.909> the<00:02:44.239> next<00:02:44.569> step

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
move this board now to the next step

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.360 
move this board now to the next step
which<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.370> an<00:02:47.060> inch<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.510> half<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:48.260> I've<00:02:49.159> got

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
which is an inch and a half and I've got

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.210 
which is an inch and a half and I've got
to<00:02:49.519> adjust<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.959> two<00:02:51.170> rear<00:02:51.440> bags<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:52.040> they're

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
to adjust the two rear bags so they're

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.420 
to adjust the two rear bags so they're
very<00:02:52.430> tight<00:02:52.760> but<00:02:53.180> not<00:02:53.209> locked<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.799> adjust<00:02:55.280> the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
very tight but not locked and adjust the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.420 
very tight but not locked and adjust the
front<00:02:55.640> braking<00:02:56.180> wedge<00:02:57.099> until<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.189> front

brakes<00:02:58.670> just<00:02:59.060> be<00:02:59.299> in<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.569> home<00:02:59.780> like<00:03:00.079> I<00:03:00.230> did<00:03:00.409> on

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 
brakes just be in the home like I did on

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.479 
brakes just be in the home like I did on
the<00:03:00.739> Grizz<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.810> after<00:03:03.290> you're<00:03:03.560> on<00:03:03.590> step<00:03:04.220> 2<00:03:04.459> of

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
the Grizz so after you're on step 2 of

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.199 
the Grizz so after you're on step 2 of
the<00:03:04.640> board<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:06.170> rear<00:03:06.590> brakes<00:03:06.950> won't<00:03:07.760> turn

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
the board the rear brakes won't turn

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.330 
the board the rear brakes won't turn
very<00:03:09.170> tightly<00:03:09.790> but<00:03:10.790> they<00:03:10.940> will<00:03:11.150> not<00:03:11.329> be<00:03:11.389> locked

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
very tightly but they will not be locked

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.770 
very tightly but they will not be locked
this<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.579> the<00:03:13.639> way<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.819> should<00:03:14.030> be<00:03:14.060> very<00:03:14.480> tight

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
this is the way it should be very tight

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.599 
this is the way it should be very tight
but<00:03:15.319> not<00:03:15.349> locked<00:03:18.010> we're<00:03:19.010> going<00:03:19.159> to<00:03:19.220> turn<00:03:19.459> the

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
but not locked we're going to turn the

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.930 
but not locked we're going to turn the
adjuster<00:03:20.120> clockwise<00:03:20.799> till<00:03:21.799> this<00:03:21.980> just<00:03:22.609> begins

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
adjuster clockwise till this just begins

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.630 
adjuster clockwise till this just begins
to<00:03:23.060> hold

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.200 

now<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.570> just<00:03:30.600> beginning<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.230> hold<00:03:32.090> so<00:03:33.090> we

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
now this is just beginning to hold so we

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.660 
now this is just beginning to hold so we
have<00:03:33.330> to<00:03:33.420> do<00:03:33.570> both<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.320> front<00:03:34.560> ones<00:03:34.740> do<00:03:35.460> both

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
have to do both the front ones do both

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.660 
have to do both the front ones do both
front<00:03:36.000> ones<00:03:36.210> right<00:03:36.420> now<00:03:36.450> same<00:03:36.780> way<00:03:36.960> okay<00:03:37.670> now

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
front ones right now same way okay now

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.610 
front ones right now same way okay now
we're<00:03:38.910> going<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.210> move<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.690> board<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.380> two

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
we're going to move the board to the two

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.160 
we're going to move the board to the two
inch<00:03:40.830> position<00:03:41.460> that<00:03:42.300> would<00:03:42.450> be<00:03:42.570> step<00:03:42.870> three

he'll<00:04:51.419> probably<00:04:51.600> take<00:04:51.870> about<00:04:52.169> one<00:04:53.160> click<00:04:53.490> one

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
he'll probably take about one click one
