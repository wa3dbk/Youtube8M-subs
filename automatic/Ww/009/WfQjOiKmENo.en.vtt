00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hi guys, How are you 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.410
 My name is Thaisa. I'm 22 years old and today. 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.820
 I'm going to start recording some videos about 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.120
 the preparations for my surgery 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.730
 in today's video I'm going to talk 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.369
 about the exams I've done and about the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.949
 doctors I went through so I'll start 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.810
 by the missang urine which were the two 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.720
 first exams I did 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.699
 they were a really the tip toe 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.230
 This is because all physicians 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.539
 that I would have to pass 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.880
 they wanted to take a look at this exam 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.190
 urine test to be able to 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.820
 start asking for other years, right? 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.399
 then it is a very simple example as it is 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.399
 done all at once in this 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.039
 Years here on the day I did I did not 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.930
 16 tubes of blood that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.690
 I took it because each one has a 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.090
 purpose then several 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.670
 same time right for you to have an idea 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.370
 what was asked because they asked 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.070
 to analyze here I'll read a little bit 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.560
 you are the profile of pitico 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:13.049
 total protein is uric acid calcium 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:20.490
 creatine glycemia fasting hdl phosphatase 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:24.210
 and ldl coagulogram hemoglobin hiv and beta 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.460
 hcg so it's the perfect psg for the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.950
 women is not because we can not 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.860
 run I chose to operate on it being 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.680
 pregnant and even the doctor recommended 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.259
 what next surgery I re-done exam 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.900
 beta hcg to make sure it will not 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.780
 have no problem and the urine test 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.509
 is also here so these were the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.090
 two first exams I did another 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.570
 The exam I did was the ultra 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.659
 sonography of the total abdomen she is 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:00.560
 more accurate look at the anatomy right 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:03.229
 organs on May 15 and see them all feel 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.530
 in the right place and have no problem 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.390
 hiss fields are in the correct position 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.569
 another exam you have here is a 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.819
 upper digestive endoscopy 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.349
 she is very important, she promises to 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.050
 look inside and see how our 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:22.940
 stomach or thin red 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.010
 but that's the way it is and they also do not 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.620
 digestive tract to take advantage of 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.410
 collect material to make the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.290
 orelinha ase walking test diesel 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.120
 and in my negative gave all right 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.160
 For those who did not like to have a 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.620
 treatment that is done before the time you 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.200
 have the bacteria released to 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.220
 do the surgery 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.830
 other years I have here 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.810
 polysomnography that he knows that the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.170
 people sleep in the clinic right? 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.060
 so they evaluate in our soil in the case 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.060
 mine indicated that I have 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.320
 is the first of degree 3 the name of the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.230
 problem I had during the show and 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.730
 this pan is dangerous because it makes 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.340
 stop breathing while you are sleeping 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.950
 surgery is indicated for 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.470
 patients who have apnea are independent 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.980
 of her degree is already an indicator of up 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.010
 of bariatric surgery because it helps 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.050
 much in our inspiration is very 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.580
 dangerous 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.390
 another exam I have here was done 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.860
 the mapping of my pressure during 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.560
 I was really four works with 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.560
 clique and was measuring the attention 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.850
 they still have everything in them. 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.290
 moments that the pressure rose when she 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:54.590
 has lowered the average I have on the trading floor, 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.230
 so it's ok I think every year 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.510
 This one is the most annoying thing to do. 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.400
 it is that neither a report as well as 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.010
 was my pressure 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.530
 he is the most annoying because the stigma 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.470
 moment here in our arm 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.959
 so it's all over the air inflating and going 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.500
 hurting thus gets very sore 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:20.090
 after doing this here is a 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:23.030
 transvaginal ultrasound that is my 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.340
 gynecologist asked because I already had 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.919
 I had some cysts in the 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.010
 and how it is necessary to 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:34.880
 release of the agreement because mc is not 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:38.360
 above 40 I have to submit two 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.370
 risk factors, because obesity 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.780
 then that will help a 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.169
 little on release 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.530
 another exam I have here is an exam 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.410
 gu is a third doctor, and it's 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.750
 evaluate the conditions of our heart 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.600
 so in case mine I could not 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.990
 take the full exam in it turns in 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.650
 around 15 minutes 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.220
 I could only take seven minutes 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:08.670
 but has already given pro-doctor to evaluate another 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.250
 exam that is the echo of bpi that who goes 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.920
 look at that examination that it does not 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.530
 vascular surgeon who is to avoid 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.940
 clan thrombosis risk being well 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.700
 assured 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.830
 so here are the pictures in the 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.050
 my introductions I did not know that I am 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.020
 with varicose veins in the leg then several 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.670
 small yet so there 's no problem 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.670
 do the surgery the doctor said that is 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:37.290
 released even so from there the last exam 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:41.160
 which is a chest x -ray that they use 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.020
 to check the lung of the agency for 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.150
 see if the respiratory conditions are 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:50.250
 good and that will go through the tire right then 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:54.660
 these tests are there is that I have here 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:06:00.990
 it's already the releases that I 'm going to have here 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:03.300
 the endocrinologist's statement that he 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.420
 He released me and said that I have an indication. 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:10.080
 of bariatric surgery and give a series of 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:12.120
 explanations for why here's request 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.370
 surgery is beneficial in my case 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.460
 hence another request that is mine 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.960
 nutritionist because she is me too. 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.980
 for some time, then the 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.960
 Mozambique 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.010
 I already tried other ways to lose weight 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.860
 and did not work in another the release 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:33.270
 here is the vascular surgeon, right? 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.940
 the other is the cardiologist all of them 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:39.390
 after that much exams later in 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.240
 evaluate and do several is to consult me 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.430
 released to be him or the other award 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.140
 that I have here is my psychologist's 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.480
 I did ten therapy sessions with 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.570
 her to see if I really was in 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:55.590
 conditions to do this surgery 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.840
 and the latter here is the fat that PT 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.090
 He also released me for surgery. 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.610
 indicated the surgery for the pains in the 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.860
 back I have 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.330
 So this is it from exams were not even if the 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.340
 more annoying than I even said it was 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.380
 mapping 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.010
 the pressure to get the little 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:15.949
 arm, but other than that, all exams are 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:19.310
 super quiet has none so 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:22.790
 ours is boring to do or that 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:25.940
 bothered you wrong and do it again 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:28.729
 He had no problem with that and 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.800
 and that's it for now, I'll do it 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:33.410
 other videos to talk about 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.389
