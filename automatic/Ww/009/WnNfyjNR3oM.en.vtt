saw<00:00:08.140> a<00:00:08.170> picture<00:00:08.200> in<00:00:08.560> a<00:00:08.680> magazine<00:00:08.800> of<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:10.450> guitar

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
saw a picture in a magazine of a guitar

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.710 
saw a picture in a magazine of a guitar
that<00:00:11.350> I<00:00:11.380> wanted<00:00:11.920> but<00:00:12.160> certainly<00:00:13.000> had<00:00:13.180> did<00:00:13.690> not

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:13.720 
that I wanted but certainly had did not

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.380 
that I wanted but certainly had did not
have<00:00:13.960> the<00:00:14.110> funds<00:00:14.640> to<00:00:15.640> go<00:00:15.760> and<00:00:15.910> buy<00:00:16.090> such<00:00:16.360> a

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
have the funds to go and buy such a

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.680 
have the funds to go and buy such a
guitar<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:18.520> the<00:00:18.580> idea<00:00:18.910> came<00:00:19.180> into<00:00:19.210> my<00:00:19.510> head

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
guitar but the idea came into my head

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.350 
guitar but the idea came into my head
that<00:00:19.900> after<00:00:20.230> looking<00:00:20.530> at<00:00:20.680> it<00:00:20.830> it<00:00:21.039> was<00:00:21.160> not<00:00:22.090> much

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
that after looking at it it was not much

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
that after looking at it it was not much
more<00:00:22.630> than<00:00:22.840> a<00:00:23.340> slab<00:00:24.340> of<00:00:24.550> wood<00:00:24.730> with<00:00:24.910> some<00:00:25.090> holes

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
more than a slab of wood with some holes

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.320 
more than a slab of wood with some holes
you<00:00:26.380> know<00:00:26.699> strategically<00:00:27.699> placed<00:00:27.970> in<00:00:28.150> order

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
you know strategically placed in order

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.090 
you know strategically placed in order
to<00:00:28.449> make<00:00:28.570> it<00:00:28.690> function<00:00:29.020> as<00:00:29.109> a<00:00:29.170> guitar<00:00:29.500> and<00:00:29.800> I

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
to make it function as a guitar and I

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.320 
to make it function as a guitar and I
looked<00:00:30.279> at<00:00:30.400> it<00:00:30.520> long<00:00:30.640> enough<00:00:30.789> and<00:00:31.000> figured<00:00:31.270> out

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
looked at it long enough and figured out

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.939 
looked at it long enough and figured out
that<00:00:31.539> I<00:00:31.720> think<00:00:32.019> I<00:00:32.259> could<00:00:32.409> give<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.559> shot<00:00:32.800> at

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
that I think I could give a shot at

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:48.100 
that I think I could give a shot at
making<00:00:33.039> it

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.450 

making<00:00:49.110> guitar<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.590> guitar<00:00:49.650> is<00:00:50.370> really<00:00:52.460> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
making guitar a guitar is really the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.360 
making guitar a guitar is really the
Assembly<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.570> collection<00:00:55.380> of<00:00:55.620> parts<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
Assembly of a collection of parts and

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.160 
Assembly of a collection of parts and
more<00:00:59.370> than<00:00:59.610> anything<00:00:59.880> I<00:01:00.210> think<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.810> a<00:01:00.840> lot<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
more than anything I think with a lot of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.740 
more than anything I think with a lot of
it<00:01:01.440> sometimes<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.850> toughest<00:01:03.270> part<00:01:03.540> can<00:01:03.720> be

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
it sometimes the toughest part can be

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.070 
it sometimes the toughest part can be
how<00:01:04.620> to<00:01:04.680> make<00:01:04.949> those<00:01:05.129> parts<00:01:05.960> putting<00:01:06.960> them

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
how to make those parts putting them

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.370 
how to make those parts putting them
together<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.900> this<00:01:09.900> way<00:01:10.140> or<00:01:10.260> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
together you know in this way or that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.190 
together you know in this way or that
way<00:01:10.500> isn't<00:01:11.340> always<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.640> difficult<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:13.050> it's

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
way isn't always that difficult but it's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320 
way isn't always that difficult but it's
more<00:01:13.410> of<00:01:13.590> sort<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.950> an<00:01:14.070> order<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.550> operation<00:01:15.180> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
more of sort of an order of operation I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.540 
more of sort of an order of operation I
guess<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.110> can't<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.100> before

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
guess you can't really do this before

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:28.550 
guess you can't really do this before
you<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.980 

there<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.700> folks<00:01:30.119> who<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> can

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
there are folks who think that I can

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.600 
there are folks who think that I can
pull<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> guitar<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.829> over<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> weekend

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
pull the guitar like over a weekend

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.889 
pull the guitar like over a weekend
that's<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> tell<00:01:33.210> someone<00:01:33.479> well<00:01:33.659> yeah

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
that's what I tell someone well yeah

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.749 
that's what I tell someone well yeah
there's<00:01:34.170> about<00:01:34.229> 80<00:01:34.500> hours<00:01:34.979> into<00:01:35.310> making<00:01:35.490> an

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
there's about 80 hours into making an

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.779 
there's about 80 hours into making an
acoustic<00:01:36.149> guitar<00:01:36.950> like<00:01:37.950> oh<00:01:38.100> great<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.610> it'll

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
acoustic guitar like oh great so it'll

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.999 
acoustic guitar like oh great so it'll
be<00:01:38.880> ready<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.240> couple<00:01:39.270> weeks<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
be ready in a couple weeks and it

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.560 
be ready in a couple weeks and it
doesn't<00:01:41.369> really<00:01:41.549> work<00:01:41.789> that<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.119> at<00:01:42.210> least<00:01:42.299> I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
doesn't really work that way at least I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.429 
doesn't really work that way at least I
don't<00:01:42.750> work<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.930> way

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
don't work that way

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.980 
don't work that way
I<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:43.770> folks<00:01:44.159> who<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.490> basically<00:01:45.210> start<00:01:45.929> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
I know folks who can basically start to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.590 
I know folks who can basically start to
finish<00:01:46.229> put<00:01:46.560> something<00:01:46.890> together<00:01:47.030> over<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
finish put something together over the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.289 
finish put something together over the
course<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.990> made<00:01:49.170> me<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.289> couple<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.740> months<00:01:50.299> but

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
course of made me a couple of months but

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.029 
course of made me a couple of months but
you<00:01:51.420> spend<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.780> lot<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.049> time<00:01:52.259> prepping

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
you spend a lot of time prepping

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.529 
you spend a lot of time prepping
something<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.670> then<00:01:53.789> gluing<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.450> then

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
something and then gluing it and then

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.389 
something and then gluing it and then
setting<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.960> aside<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.530> letting<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> cure

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
setting it aside and letting it cure

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.300 
setting it aside and letting it cure
overnight<00:01:57.170> or<00:01:58.170> things<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.250> you

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
overnight or things like that so you

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.889 
overnight or things like that so you
know<00:01:59.429> you<00:01:59.520> may<00:01:59.789> only<00:01:59.939> work<00:02:00.149> an<00:02:00.329> hour<00:02:00.479> one<00:02:00.869> day

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
know you may only work an hour one day

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.230 
know you may only work an hour one day
and<00:02:01.289> then<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:01.979> nothing<00:02:02.159> done<00:02:02.459> till<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and then you get nothing done till the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.870 
and then you get nothing done till the
next<00:02:03.360> day<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:05.069> just<00:02:05.190> sort<00:02:05.429> of<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.580> slower

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
next day so it's just sort of a slower

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.320 
next day so it's just sort of a slower
process<00:02:10.130> when<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.250> tools<00:02:11.519> are<00:02:11.760> performing

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
process when the tools are performing

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.960 
process when the tools are performing
for<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.590> way<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.739> you're<00:02:14.489> hoping<00:02:14.819> they

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
for you the way that you're hoping they

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.339 
for you the way that you're hoping they
will<00:02:15.090> they're<00:02:15.269> not<00:02:15.390> ruining<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.019> piece<00:02:16.200> of

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
will they're not ruining the piece of

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.650 
will they're not ruining the piece of
wood<00:02:16.500> you're<00:02:17.040> working<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.420> good

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
wood you're working on it's a good

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.470 
wood you're working on it's a good
feeling<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.200> guess<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.580> sort<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.910> get<00:02:21.420> into

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
feeling I guess and you sort of get into

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.930 
feeling I guess and you sort of get into
what<00:02:22.049> you're<00:02:22.200> doing

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940
