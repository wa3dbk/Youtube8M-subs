 It will be a small window that's it 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.829
 there will be a little bit of wrong over three 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.969

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.530
 this other question is in another video we 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.950
 On video lessons to watch today we 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.260
 consider only drawing with a pencil 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:18.030
 then go insert the ace click 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.180

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:28.710
 tick ok here we see 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:31.590
 there was such a window effect here 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.970
 click pencil here and it appears 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.750
 choose if here's a pencil and you can 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:44.090
 highlight something you can write some 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.090
 text is what we need to tell 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.759
 give our viewers more internet 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.759
 move on 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.350
 and in order to disable the pencil 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.760
 you need to look for a click like this 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:21.690
 let's go online and for example we need 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.690
 select this block 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.140
 here we type and select this area 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:40.420
 you can take a pencil and write something 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:44.310
 To emphasize this, we do what 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.430
 where we need to focus 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.930
 viewers 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:55.930
 Here it is possible to allocate where of us 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:59.350
 troechki can change the thickness of the lines so 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.220
 will be fat if you choose dvoechka 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:08.410
 there will be a thinner pencil too 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:14.560
 You can change the color of the selection here is one of 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:22.000

 You can change it, choose, choose, then 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.550
 what we need to highlight 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.550
 oval can choose 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.950
 Well, in principle, I repeat once again that 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.680
 to remove the inscription you need to press 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.690
