00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
took into installing this skin was to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.410 
took into installing this skin was to
clean<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.739> back<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.039> my<00:00:50.070> pad<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.670> any<00:00:50.820> dirt<00:00:51.390> and

dust using a cleaning agent so uh that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.439 
dust using a cleaning agent so uh that
was<00:00:56.340> obviously<00:00:56.610> simple<00:00:56.940> enough<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.270> mean

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
was obviously simple enough I mean

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.180 
was obviously simple enough I mean
obviously<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.289> use<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:59.660> simple<00:01:01.190> like

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
obviously you can just use a simple like

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.369 
obviously you can just use a simple like
cleaning<00:01:02.820> cloth<00:01:03.030> or<00:01:03.210> whatever<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.110> just

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
cleaning cloth or whatever but I just

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.120 
cleaning cloth or whatever but I just
prefer<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.650> youth<00:01:04.890> fluid<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> yeah<00:01:07.680> that

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
prefer to youth fluid so yeah that

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730 
prefer to youth fluid so yeah that
didn't<00:01:08.430> take<00:01:08.610> any<00:01:09.119> time<00:01:09.420> whatsoever<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
didn't take any time whatsoever so it

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:21.860 
didn't take any time whatsoever so it
just<00:01:10.890> got<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.220> done

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.630 

so<00:01:22.870> then<00:01:22.990> I<00:01:23.080> took<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.440> skin<00:01:23.710> peeled<00:01:24.370> it<00:01:24.490> off

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
so then I took the skin peeled it off

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.300 
so then I took the skin peeled it off
the<00:01:24.910> backing<00:01:25.150> and<00:01:25.510> then<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:25.950> placed<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.100> back

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
the backing and then I placed it back

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.440 
the backing and then I placed it back
onto<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:28.680> backing<00:01:29.680> part<00:01:29.980> like<00:01:30.700> so<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.440> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
onto the backing part like so so the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.310 
onto the backing part like so so the
undock<00:01:34.450> connector<00:01:35.100> were<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:37.420> visible<00:01:38.050> so

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
undock connector were like visible so

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.640 
undock connector were like visible so
then<00:01:38.440> I<00:01:38.530> could<00:01:38.740> install<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:40.090> skin<00:01:40.660> as<00:01:41.080> best<00:01:41.440> as

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
then I could install the skin as best as

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.090 
then I could install the skin as best as
I<00:01:41.740> could<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:43.270> now<00:01:43.450> I'm<00:01:43.869> just<00:01:44.080> getting<00:01:44.380> on<00:01:44.470> with

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
I could so now I'm just getting on with

00:01:45.100 --> 00:02:36.509 
I could so now I'm just getting on with
the<00:01:45.369> installation

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.369 

now<00:02:37.519> when<00:02:37.670> doing<00:02:37.939> the<00:02:38.030> corners<00:02:38.420> of<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.989> skin

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
now when doing the corners of this skin

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.390 
now when doing the corners of this skin
you<00:02:39.530> actually<00:02:39.799> have<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:39.980> use<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.159> hair<00:02:40.370> dryer

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
you actually have to use a hair dryer

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.580 
you actually have to use a hair dryer
because<00:02:40.879> the<00:02:41.299> sides<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.110> ipad<00:02:42.409> are

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
because the sides of the ipad are

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.160 
because the sides of the ipad are
tapered<00:02:43.159> so<00:02:43.879> basically<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.360> hair<00:02:44.510> dryer<00:02:44.750> sort

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
tapered so basically the hair dryer sort

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.039 
tapered so basically the hair dryer sort
of<00:02:45.700> softens<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.879> skin<00:02:47.000> stony<00:02:47.420> can<00:02:47.629> mold<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:48.019> to

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
of softens the skin stony can mold it to

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.369 
of softens the skin stony can mold it to
the<00:02:48.500> corner<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:50.180> process<00:02:50.510> was<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.959> pretty

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
the corner that process was a pretty

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.940 
the corner that process was a pretty
easy<00:02:52.120> had<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.299> repeal<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.230> skin<00:02:54.590> up<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.769> couple

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
easy had to repeal the skin up a couple

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.099 
easy had to repeal the skin up a couple
times<00:02:55.069> to<00:02:55.519> then<00:02:55.640> re<00:02:55.849> push<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.209> down<00:02:56.359> a<00:02:56.569> but

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
times to then re push it down a but

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:05.940 
times to then re push it down a but
after<00:02:57.349> that<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.620> was<00:02:57.680> absolutely<00:02:58.069> fine

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.790 

you

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.410 

so<00:03:10.800> for<00:03:11.129> installing<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.760> front<00:03:12.000> portion<00:03:12.239> of
