offers everything that the 6300 does but

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.350 
offers everything that the 6300 does but
it<00:00:40.030> is<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.180> lot<00:00:40.510> cheaper<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.829> 6300<00:00:42.579> currently

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.349 
money you might expect the answer is not
a<00:00:55.210> lot<00:00:55.570> but<00:00:56.079> in<00:00:56.199> fact<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.670> 2700<00:00:57.670> s<00:00:57.730> feature<00:00:57.969> set
