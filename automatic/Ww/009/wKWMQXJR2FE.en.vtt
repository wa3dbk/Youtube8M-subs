review of transformers Autobots you see
I<00:00:12.650> have<00:00:13.650> beaten<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.130> game<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> fact<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
I have beaten the game on the fact I

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.679 
I have beaten the game on the fact I
have<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.020> maintenance<00:00:16.500> truck<00:00:20.570> knowing<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
have the maintenance truck knowing the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.599 
have the maintenance truck knowing the
faster<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.590> not<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> very<00:00:23.279> hard<00:00:23.519> game

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
faster that this is not a very hard game

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.999 
faster that this is not a very hard game
I<00:00:24.060> mean<00:00:24.590> um<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:26.750> think<00:00:28.460> Joshua's<00:00:29.460> Zimmerman

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
I mean um I think Joshua's Zimmerman

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.380 
I mean um I think Joshua's Zimmerman
actually<00:00:32.009> said<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.579> actually<00:00:33.090> like

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
actually said that was actually like

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.900 
actually said that was actually like
grand<00:00:34.260> theft<00:00:34.610> transformer

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.790 

he<00:00:38.910> actually<00:00:39.480> hit<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> nail<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> head<00:00:40.379> I

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
he actually hit the nail on the head I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.910 
he actually hit the nail on the head I
think<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.489> would<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.910> great<00:00:42.570> thing<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.530> for

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
think this would be a great thing to for

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.330 
think this would be a great thing to for
rockstar<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.520> look<00:00:44.670> at<00:00:45.800> seeing<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.039> switch

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
rockstar to look at seeing the switch

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.310 
rockstar to look at seeing the switch
that<00:00:47.370> um<00:00:48.320> if<00:00:50.090> rockstar<00:00:51.090> games<00:00:51.629> wants<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.170> make

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
that um if rockstar games wants to make

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.740 
that um if rockstar games wants to make
a<00:00:52.500> dumb<00:00:55.129> transformers<00:00:56.129> simulation<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.059> mean<00:00:57.719> I

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
a dumb transformers simulation I mean I

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.479 
a dumb transformers simulation I mean I
um<00:00:58.109> dama<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.100> um<00:01:00.170> Grand<00:01:01.170> Theft<00:01:01.320> Auto<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
um dama for a um Grand Theft Auto on the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.579 
um dama for a um Grand Theft Auto on the
DS<00:01:02.670> they<00:01:03.449> need<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> look<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.260> hard<00:01:04.439> at

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
DS they need to look really hard at

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
DS they need to look really hard at
transformers<00:01:05.129> autobus<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:06.000> they<00:01:06.119> made<00:01:06.299> a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
transformers autobus because they made a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.469 
transformers autobus because they made a
great<00:01:06.750> improvement<00:01:07.320> status<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.479> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
great improvement status of this it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.649 
great improvement status of this it
really<00:01:09.689> did<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.130> I've<00:01:14.880> actually<00:01:15.090> figured<00:01:15.450> out

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
really did and I've actually figured out

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.260 
really did and I've actually figured out
something<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.640> if<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.850> want<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.240> a

lot of fun beat up on some trance beat
up<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:21.990> some<00:01:22.170> Decepticons<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.240> half<00:01:24.840> all

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
up on some Decepticons and like half all

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.560 
up on some Decepticons and like half all
the<00:01:25.350> armies<00:01:26.340> come<00:01:26.580> at<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:30.420> know

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the armies come at you like you know

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.160 
the armies come at you like you know
just<00:01:31.670> beat<00:01:32.670> them<00:01:32.820> down<00:01:33.030> until<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> get<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
just beat them down until you get to the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.450 
just beat them down until you get to the
fourth<00:01:34.470> um

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
fourth um

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.120 
fourth um
bar<00:01:36.229> once<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> fourth

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
bar once you get to like the fourth

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.749 
bar once you get to like the fourth
level<00:01:38.420> then<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:40.130> if<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.340> bring<00:01:41.460> them<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
level then like if you bring them out to

level then like if you bring them out to
the<00:01:41.939> longest<00:01:42.420> extent<00:01:42.869> it'll<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.560> it'll<00:01:43.860> stay

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the longest extent it'll go it'll stay

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.639 
the longest extent it'll go it'll stay
on<00:01:44.220> threat<00:01:44.850> neutralized<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.960> it'll<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.500> all

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
on threat neutralized and it'll go all

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.859 
on threat neutralized and it'll go all
the<00:01:46.770> way<00:01:46.799> back<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.280> zero<00:01:47.610> that's<00:01:48.509> about<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the way back to zero that's about the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.139 
the way back to zero that's about the
best<00:01:49.049> fun<00:01:49.350> I've<00:01:49.470> had<00:01:49.770> ever<00:01:50.490> since<00:01:50.579> beating<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
best fun I've had ever since beating the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.260 
best fun I've had ever since beating the
game<00:01:51.380> other<00:01:52.380> than<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.790> well<00:01:53.790> there's<00:01:54.149> not

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
