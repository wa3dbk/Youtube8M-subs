need to replace inter tie rods or if you

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.519 
need to replace inter tie rods or if you
want<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.220> replace<00:00:20.460> your<00:00:20.640> whole<00:00:20.820> steering<00:00:21.090> rack

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
want to replace your whole steering rack

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.359 
want to replace your whole steering rack
these<00:00:22.550> 93<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.640> 98<00:00:23.939> Jettas<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.689> gulfs<00:00:25.050> they<00:00:26.039> had

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
these 93 to 98 Jettas and gulfs they had

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.660 
these 93 to 98 Jettas and gulfs they had
two<00:00:26.849> different<00:00:27.180> possible<00:00:27.750> steering<00:00:28.349> racks

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
two different possible steering racks

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.070 
two different possible steering racks
and<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.730> believe<00:00:29.970> most<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.510> has<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:30.900> with

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and I believe most of it has to do with

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.850 
and I believe most of it has to do with
the<00:00:31.470> engine<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.859> transmission<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.640> believe

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
the engine and transmission I believe

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.010 
the engine and transmission I believe
most<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> 2.0<00:00:35.610> liter<00:00:36.020> Magnum

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
most of the 2.0 liter Magnum

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.470 
most of the 2.0 liter Magnum
transmissions<00:00:37.530> had<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> TRW<00:00:38.820> rack<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.300> think

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
transmissions had a TRW rack and I think

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.889 
transmissions had a TRW rack and I think
the<00:00:39.600> v6<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.530> automatic<00:00:40.829> transmission<00:00:41.430> had<00:00:41.899> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the v6 with automatic transmission had a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.130 
the v6 with automatic transmission had a
ZF<00:00:43.710> rack<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.160> I'm<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:44.610> 100%<00:00:45.120> sure<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.629> so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
ZF rack but I'm not 100% sure on that so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.200 
ZF rack but I'm not 100% sure on that so
it<00:00:46.410> doesn't<00:00:46.440> really<00:00:46.770> matter<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:48.000> figure

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
it doesn't really matter you can figure

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.170 
it doesn't really matter you can figure
out<00:00:48.360> which<00:00:49.140> rack<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.739> by<00:00:50.700> coming<00:00:51.059> into

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
out which rack you have by coming into

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.400 
out which rack you have by coming into
the<00:00:51.270> engine<00:00:51.510> compartment<00:00:51.750> you'll<00:00:52.230> need<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the engine compartment you'll need a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.260 
the engine compartment you'll need a
flashlight<00:00:53.270> okay<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:55.739> gonna<00:00:56.000> let's<00:00:57.000> see

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
again this is a TRW so this body is

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.499 
again this is a TRW so this body is
smooth<00:01:50.399> right<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.090> were<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.240> clean

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
smooth right here if I were to clean

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.340 
smooth right here if I were to clean
this<00:01:51.630> all<00:01:51.810> off<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.140> nice<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.470> smooth<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:54.320> ZF

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
this all off it's nice and smooth the ZF

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.590 
this all off it's nice and smooth the ZF
rack<00:01:55.740> when<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> look<00:01:56.969> down<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.180> you'll<00:01:57.509> see

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
rack when you look down here you'll see

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.749 
rack when you look down here you'll see
it<00:01:57.869> want<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.829> aluminum<00:01:59.280> but<00:01:59.460> it'll<00:01:59.670> be

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
it want to be aluminum but it'll be

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.520 
it want to be aluminum but it'll be
dirty<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.299> it'll<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.509> hard<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.350> hard

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
dirty so it'll be hard to kind of hard

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.469 
dirty so it'll be hard to kind of hard
to<00:02:01.619> tell<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:01.979> aluminum<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:03.149> then<00:02:03.270> it'll

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
to tell it's aluminum and then it'll

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.219 
to tell it's aluminum and then it'll
have<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> crosshatch<00:02:05.119> raised<00:02:06.119> pattern<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.079> it

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
have a crosshatch raised pattern on it

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.369 
have a crosshatch raised pattern on it
and<00:02:07.550> I<00:02:08.550> don't<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:10.020> show<00:02:10.050> you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
and I don't have one here to show you

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.480 
and I don't have one here to show you
but<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.340> show<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.730> kind<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.060> exam

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
but I can show you kind of exam

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.100 
but I can show you kind of exam
people<00:02:12.780> here<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.110> aluminum<00:02:14.680> here<00:02:16.110> okay

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
people here on this aluminum here okay

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.270 
people here on this aluminum here okay
let's<00:02:18.070> see<00:02:18.370> where<00:02:18.580> was<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:20.100> there's<00:02:21.100> actually

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
let's see where was it there's actually

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.270 
let's see where was it there's actually
some<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:21.940> cross-hatching<00:02:22.570> yeah<00:02:23.020> it's

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
some of that cross-hatching yeah it's

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.180 
some of that cross-hatching yeah it's
really<00:02:24.280> tough<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.730> see<00:02:24.940> okay<00:02:25.780> but<00:02:26.500> here<00:02:26.860> you

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
really tough to see okay but here you

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.370 
really tough to see okay but here you
can<00:02:27.340> see<00:02:27.370> where<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.730> kind<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.270> cleaned<00:02:28.930> off<00:02:29.170> with

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
can see where I kind of cleaned off with

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.470 
can see where I kind of cleaned off with
my<00:02:29.700> finger<00:02:30.700> there's<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.660> crosshatch<00:02:32.500> pattern

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
my finger there's a crosshatch pattern

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.840 
my finger there's a crosshatch pattern
now<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.870> very<00:02:35.080> small<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:36.280> crosshatch

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
now this is very small the crosshatch

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.200 
now this is very small the crosshatch
pattern<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.510> ZF<00:02:37.900> on<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.230> body<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:42.210> of

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
pattern on the ZF on the body of the of

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.480 
pattern on the ZF on the body of the of
the<00:02:43.330> rack<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:44.380> crosshatch<00:02:44.860> pattern<00:02:44.920> will<00:02:45.430> be

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
the rack the crosshatch pattern will be

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.720 
the rack the crosshatch pattern will be
much<00:02:45.640> larger<00:02:45.910> where<00:02:46.690> these<00:02:46.870> are<00:02:47.110> probably

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
much larger where these are probably

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.920 
much larger where these are probably
well<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.820> don't<00:02:49.000> know<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.300> quarter<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.870> a

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
well I don't know a quarter of a

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.230 
well I don't know a quarter of a
centimeter<00:02:50.230> by<00:02:50.680> maybe<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.460> half<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.820> centimeter

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
centimeter by maybe a half a centimeter

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.360 
centimeter by maybe a half a centimeter
the<00:02:52.840> crosshatch<00:02:53.320> pattern<00:02:53.350> on<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.830> body<00:02:54.010> here

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
the crosshatch pattern on the body here

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.960 
the crosshatch pattern on the body here
will<00:02:54.970> be<00:02:55.120> over<00:02:56.020> a<00:02:56.050> centimeter<00:02:56.560> or<00:02:56.680> or<00:02:57.580> probably

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
will be over a centimeter or or probably

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.660 
will be over a centimeter or or probably
more<00:02:58.390> like<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.570> half<00:02:58.900> an<00:02:59.050> inch<00:02:59.170> by<00:03:00.130> 1/2<00:03:00.250> an<00:03:00.580> inch

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
more like a half an inch by 1/2 an inch

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.740 
more like a half an inch by 1/2 an inch
okay<00:03:01.620> exactly<00:03:02.620> as<00:03:03.100> well<00:03:03.360> you'll<00:03:04.360> see<00:03:04.720> a

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
okay exactly as well you'll see a

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.080 
okay exactly as well you'll see a
crosshatch<00:03:05.230> pattern

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
crosshatch pattern

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.750 
crosshatch pattern
yeah<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.510> doesn't<00:03:07.780> look<00:03:07.870> but<00:03:08.610> kind<00:03:09.610> of<00:03:09.670> like

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
yeah that doesn't look but kind of like

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.800 
yeah that doesn't look but kind of like
that<00:03:12.060> not<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.240> can<00:03:13.360> really<00:03:13.510> tell<00:03:13.690> what

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
that not that you can really tell what

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.600 
that not that you can really tell what
that<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:14.080> but<00:03:14.860> like<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.130> said<00:03:15.190> there'll<00:03:15.460> be<00:03:15.490> a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
that is but like I said there'll be a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.060 
that is but like I said there'll be a
large<00:03:15.930> crosshatch<00:03:16.930> pattern<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.560> if<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.010> were

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
large crosshatch pattern and if you were

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.430 
large crosshatch pattern and if you were
to<00:03:18.160> clean<00:03:18.370> this<00:03:18.460> off<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:19.390> would<00:03:19.570> be<00:03:19.720> aluminum

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
to clean this off it would be aluminum

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.910 
to clean this off it would be aluminum
which<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.820> more<00:03:21.820> gray<00:03:22.030> or<00:03:22.210> silver<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.920> as

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
which is more gray or silver and as

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.100 
which is more gray or silver and as
opposed<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.490> this<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:24.970> black<00:03:25.240> underneath

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
opposed to this this is black underneath

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.070 
opposed to this this is black underneath
okay<00:03:26.710> so<00:03:27.460> again<00:03:27.610> TRW<00:03:28.540> smooth<00:03:29.380> black<00:03:30.330> ZF<00:03:31.330> you

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
okay so again TRW smooth black ZF you

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.020 
okay so again TRW smooth black ZF you
clean<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.440> off<00:03:32.560> it'll<00:03:32.950> be<00:03:33.070> silver<00:03:33.610> or<00:03:33.790> gray

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
clean it off it'll be silver or gray

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.580 
clean it off it'll be silver or gray
with<00:03:34.570> a<00:03:34.840> raised<00:03:35.250> crosshatch<00:03:36.250> pattern<00:03:36.280> on<00:03:36.880> it

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
with a raised crosshatch pattern on it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.100 
with a raised crosshatch pattern on it
okay<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.800> again<00:03:38.890> just<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.340> reiterate<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:40.780> can

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
okay and again just to reiterate you can

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.880 
okay and again just to reiterate you can
see<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:42.310> rack<00:03:42.550> from<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.030> top<00:03:43.530> okay<00:03:44.530> looking

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
see the rack from the top okay looking

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.300 
see the rack from the top okay looking
down<00:03:45.100> right<00:03:45.130> through<00:03:45.640> here<00:03:46.090> okay<00:03:47.280> you'll<00:03:48.280> see

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
down right through here okay you'll see

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.910 
down right through here okay you'll see
it<00:03:48.580> right<00:03:48.760> there<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:50.080> again<00:03:50.440> right<00:03:50.710> there

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
it right there and again right there

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.310 
it right there and again right there
where<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.190> arrow<00:03:51.310> is<00:03:51.400> pointing<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:52.660> is<00:03:52.930> the

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
where the arrow is pointing that is the

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.110 
where the arrow is pointing that is the
part<00:03:53.740> of<00:03:53.920> your<00:03:54.160> rack<00:03:54.550> you<00:03:54.580> want<00:03:54.820> to<00:03:54.880> look<00:03:55.000> at
