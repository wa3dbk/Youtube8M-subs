00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060

 more characters will be available in the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.579
 later and each wrestler order a 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.160

 costumes and the recreational one that is the version 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.690
 original arcade what we still do not know is 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.940
 the contract will be the old mystic and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.430
 glory of which this one seems to be 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.949
 completely stripped 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.020
 of facebook for the world as it happened with 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.060
 bill gates when at the end of the 90s it 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.430
 moved away from Microsoft to devote to the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.620
 philanthropy gives the impression that mark 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.510
 zuckerberg is increasingly away from the 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.430
 day to day facebook and your interests 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.560
 they are in much larger projects and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.840
 honestly much more interesting the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.850
 most recent of this is internet point 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.710
 org a group that has the only 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.869
 purpose of making the internet reach 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.300
 everyone no matter where they are and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.100
 no matter your social classes in this 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.960
 moment only one third of the planet has 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.720
 Reliable internet access and group 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.720
 internet dot org formed by ericsson 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.850
 samsung nokia qualcomm and of course 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.590
 Facebook plans to face this challenge to 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.110
 along three key points the most 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.580
 important is to create a standard 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.290
 economically accessible from reuters 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.390
 even new smartphones to which 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.369
 anyone in the world can access the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.990
 second point is efficiency and it 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.910
 will seek to improve the compression so that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.280
 the basic applications use less 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.380
 data transfer finally the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.940
 third point is access and on that side 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.100
 the group will work with local companies 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.290
 from each country with low access to 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.920
 offer alternatives that connect to the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.680
 more people 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.840
 he is not so alone, you take guasch alone 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.400
 the minimalist design game with 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.380
 characters that are simple figures 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.720
 geometric hides under its gameplay 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.580
 of platforms an interesting story 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.230
 narrated by danny wallace got 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.720
 exceed 700 thousand units sold 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.250
 this figure is the sum of the sales of the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.890
 game across multiple platforms 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.170
 in which it is sold as mac windows 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.120
 linux and also station 3 and 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.480
 playstation vista the little ones are 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.459
 bigger and bigger 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.890
 pokémons spicy the supposed new 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.930
 pokémon paraguay game would be a game 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.959
 of fights that could be called poker 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.280
 tournament of poker fighters the rumors 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.989
 they arose through a sequence in 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.970
 a video that was shown in the pokemon 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.370
 Tokyo game show event that took place 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.590
 a couple of weeks ago in said video it 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.420
 I could see an Aryan mega look and a mega 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.489
 vlasic in in clear pose of 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.560
 confrontation in an urban environment with 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.600
 a three-dimensional graphic engine whose 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.970
 technical aspect puts it in what up to 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.040
 now we saw paraguay now it was discovered 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.500
 that nintendo registered these two names 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.200
 rumored as brands in usa through 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.430
 of the pokémon company international la 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.560
 Serbian request 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.469
 August and the only information attached 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.510
 appeal to the fighting genre if we see a 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:26.030
 fighting game or just a new delivery 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.420
 from pokemon stadium yesterday nothing is still 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.310
 to be seen the telefonito that could not 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.260
 people who have some rejection 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.540
 the big corporations that instead of 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.000
 well-known brands leans for things 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.889
 more artisanal or by local production and 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.530
 that on your computer does not have windows 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.719
 but the free operating system linux the 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.819
 most popular linux variant is called 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.129
 ubuntu and in recent years several 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.290
 hackers have tried to use ubuntu in 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.079
 smartphones with more or less success 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.819
 until a group of them had enough and 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.430
 he started dreaming about a phone born 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.069
 to use linux his name would be ubuntu 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.060
 edge and with the design in hand the group of 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.430
 engineers and started looking 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.219
 meat financing with a goal almost 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.040
 ridiculously high to 32 million 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:12.379
 dollars edge is a true beast with 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.790
 4 gigabytes of ram compared to the 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.090
 2 that usually have the smartphone 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.500
 stereo speakers and 128 gb of memory 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.019
 internal storage 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.460
 the final price was 700 dollars and 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.790
 sent to everyone and in those 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.190
 first 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.440
 day the answer was ultra fast three 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.390
 million and a half dollars in 24 hours 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.700
 they almost guaranteed that the goal was 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.190
 would reach but the collection went down and the 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.800
 last week ubuntu et fell short 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.070
 by almost 22 million although the team 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.080
 plans to resurrect the new villain of 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.970
 disney the first patch released for 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.740
 disney infinite and is causing that 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.200
 American users of precision 3 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.760
 experience crashes when they play after 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.700
 multiple complaints in the official forums 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.770
 of playstation are worthy and producer of 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.720
 game announced by twitter that they are at 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.340
 current problem and working in 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.930
 a new patch that will fix it 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.790
 moment the temporary solution that has 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.680
 proposed is to erase the patch and not 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.420
 reinstall the casita 4.0 if 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.430
 you thought that the last entertaining thing that 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.440
 could offer you electronic arts with the 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.030
 sims was to take the stairs to the 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.980
 pools to drown you're 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.290
 very wrong on this occasion the 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.360
 company announced that the sims 4 will count 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.250
 with new creation tools that 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.260
 will allow us to build houses with greater 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.450
 Easy to customize the characters 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.250
 much more than usual and control 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.820
 the whole look like the emotions of 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.280
 our 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.290
 in fact electronic arts stressed the 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.210
 importance that the emotions of 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.100
 our characters in the development of 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.990
 your odds the sims 4 is 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.060
 being developed by maxis and we can 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.770
 play without needing to be connected 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.260
 to the internet so it will not follow the 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.700
 initial steps of sims and its launch 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.500
 is planned for next year in 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.420
 exclusive for pc although we do not 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.180
 I would be surprised to have them spinning around 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.800
 the consoles of the new generation 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.870
 accompanying movies since the web was 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.970
 popularized in the mid- 90s the 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.970
 film marketing departments have 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.890
 prepared sites for each and every one 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.870
 of the movies that are released some 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.510
 they are simple with a trailer and a tab 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.340
 technique and others are more elaborate with 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.290
 horrible little games done in flash and 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.300
 wallpapers and occupying megas 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.890
 Until now there are few movies 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.870
 that have harnessed the power of the internet 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.940
 to continue his spell in the mind 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.820
 of the viewer and a great example is the 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.640
 imminent wars at the end of the world the 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.680
 third movie in the so-called trilogy 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.990
 Cornet of the English team of Simon Pegg 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.670
 edward wright and nick frost without placing 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.590
 the names sure place the first 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.410
 two movies of the trilogy the parody of 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.390
 zombies dead laughing or sounders and the 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.190
 great police comedy hot fast that 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.380
 you can watch on cable almost every day 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.480
 with the name of fatal weapon while 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.430
 we hope the third the team gave us 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.990
 a great gift illustrated versions of 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.000
 the scripts of the first two movies 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.040
 fully interactive full of 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.080
 anecdotes details and designs of 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:59.120
 production that you can see on the web or 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:02.180
 download complete in pdf and free 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.610
 and there's still more is sony introduced the first 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.440
 fez trailer for playstation vita una 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.720
 portable version of the platform that 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.449
 he knew how to innovate with the dimensions and that 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.400
 it was one of the joys of game with 2013 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:15.500
 fes was originally launched as a 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.240
 Exclusive to xbox live barker and it comes 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.040
 of a platform game and puzzles in 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.900
 2d in which we will have to change the 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.150
 perspective of the funds to be able 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.430
 to advance always had the air of a game to 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.240
 laptop and now luckily it was made 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.570
 Justice 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.940
 mazda is at www.ader.es and on Tuesdays and 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.620
 Wednesday at 23 in fucking nerf here

 in vorterix rock in connection with 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:39.320
 vorterix dotcom the misfits
