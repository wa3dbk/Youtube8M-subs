is on the $205,000 on I might be to
$200,000<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.960> pretty<00:00:31.800> shorts<00:00:32.040> 205<00:00:32.519> it<00:00:32.699> up<00:00:32.820> and

$200,000 one pretty shorts 205 it up and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.799 
$200,000 one pretty shorts 205 it up and
this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.470> where<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:35.010> located<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.360> Los

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
this is where it's located on in Los

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.350 
this is where it's located on in Los
Santos<00:00:37.220> it's<00:00:38.220> pretty<00:00:38.430> close<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:38.850> beach<00:00:39.120> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
Santos it's pretty close to the beach I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.880 
Santos it's pretty close to the beach I
actually<00:00:39.510> think<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.500> probably<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.860> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
actually think this is probably one of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.740 
actually think this is probably one of
the<00:00:41.010> best<00:00:41.160> departments<00:00:41.699> in<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> game<00:00:42.089> it's

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the best departments in the game it's

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.759 
the best departments in the game it's
right<00:00:43.790> in<00:00:44.790> front<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> Bahamas<00:00:45.839> Bahama

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
right in front of the Bahamas Bahama

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.930 
right in front of the Bahamas Bahama
club<00:00:47.129> or<00:00:47.280> whatever<00:00:47.400> that<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.760> over<00:00:48.000> there<00:00:48.320> and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
club or whatever that is over there and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.450 
club or whatever that is over there and
and<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.030> my<00:00:51.180> opinion<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:52.050> another<00:00:52.260> video<00:00:52.500> I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and in my opinion I have another video I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.639 
and in my opinion I have another video I
have<00:00:54.449> two<00:00:54.629> characters<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.260> male<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.620> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
have two characters of a male and a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.020 
have two characters of a male and a
female<00:00:55.680> Kurt<00:00:56.160> earnest<00:00:56.399> game<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.789> my<00:00:56.879> male

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
female Kurt earnest game and my male

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.720 
female Kurt earnest game and my male
character<00:00:57.449> has<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.070> another<00:00:59.070> apartment<00:00:59.640> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
character has the another apartment it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.529 
character has the another apartment it
was<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.680> $223,000<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> think<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
was like the $223,000 one I think or the

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.990 
was like the $223,000 one I think or the
$217,000<00:01:03.539> one<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.580> liked<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.970> too

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
$217,000 one I liked that one too

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.160 
$217,000 one I liked that one too
because<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.450> was<00:01:06.539> actually<00:01:06.869> near<00:01:07.050> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
because it was actually near the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.700 
because it was actually near the
insurance<00:01:07.530> place<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.979> here<00:01:09.229> well<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.649> one

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
insurance place on here well on this one

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
insurance place on here well on this one
I<00:01:10.920> kind<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> location<00:01:11.910> better<00:01:12.450> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
I kind of like the location better it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.359 
I kind of like the location better it
seen<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.990> seems<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.410> I'm<00:01:13.560> away<00:01:13.920> from<00:01:14.130> players

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369

the tiers are the same but this has a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.230 
the tiers are the same but this has a
spectacular<00:01:36.479> view<00:01:37.579> in<00:01:38.579> my<00:01:38.700> opinion<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
spectacular view in my opinion this is a

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.719 
spectacular view in my opinion this is a
really<00:01:39.479> nice<00:01:39.630> view<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:41.040> I'm<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.400> zoom<00:01:41.610> in

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
really nice view and if I'm a zoom in

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.300 
really nice view and if I'm a zoom in
here<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.890> what<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.130> and

here you can see what it's like and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.300 
here you can see what it's like and
broadly<00:01:44.670> daylight<00:01:45.560> of<00:01:46.560> course<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.979> don't<00:01:47.040> think

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
broadly daylight of course I don't think

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
broadly daylight of course I don't think
many<00:01:47.460> people<00:01:47.720> some<00:01:48.720> people<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:49.079> really

many people some people don't really

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.060 
many people some people don't really

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
same so I'm actually just want to say

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.819 
same so I'm actually just want to say
that<00:02:12.329> you<00:02:12.420> have<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.930> most<00:02:13.110> expensive<00:02:13.440> place

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
that you have the most expensive place

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.120 
that you have the most expensive place
and<00:02:14.299> if<00:02:15.299> you<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.010> location<00:02:17.010> in

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
and if you just like that location in

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.650 
and if you just like that location in
the<00:02:17.220> rock<00:02:17.400> board<00:02:17.700> he<00:02:17.880> rolls<00:02:18.060> tickets<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.600> the

the rock board he rolls tickets in the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.140 
the rock board he rolls tickets in the
rock<00:02:18.840> for<00:02:19.380> girls<00:02:19.709> I'm<00:02:19.829> pretty<00:02:20.010> sure<00:02:20.130> but<00:02:21.120> I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
rock for girls I'm pretty sure but I

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.550 
rock for girls I'm pretty sure but I

those<00:02:23.970> buildings<00:02:24.389> are<00:02:24.449> kind<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.870> way

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
those buildings are kind of in a way

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.820 
those buildings are kind of in a way
but<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:26.860> mean<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:28.200> don't<00:02:29.200> I'm<00:02:29.410> not<00:02:29.440> really<00:02:29.620> sure

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
but I mean I don't I'm not really sure

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.110 
but I mean I don't I'm not really sure
what<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.040> hell<00:02:30.190> Rockstar<00:02:30.670> was<00:02:30.790> thinking

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
what the hell Rockstar was thinking

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.980 
what the hell Rockstar was thinking
because<00:02:31.270> they<00:02:31.510> made<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.690> lot<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.930> these

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
because they made a lot of these

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.660 
because they made a lot of these
interiors<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.500> same<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.070> am<00:02:33.100> you<00:02:33.340> ever<00:02:33.460> become

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
interiors the same I am you ever become

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.950 
interiors the same I am you ever become
more<00:02:33.880> interesting<00:02:34.210> if<00:02:34.360> some<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.630> them

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
more interesting if some of them

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.870 
more interesting if some of them
we're<00:02:35.950> different<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.340> mean<00:02:36.430> there<00:02:36.580> are<00:02:36.640> other

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
we're different I mean there are other

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.670 
we're different I mean there are other
ones<00:02:37.300> that<00:02:37.450> look<00:02:37.720> different<00:02:38.080> but<00:02:38.170> they're<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
ones that look different but they're the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.500 
ones that look different but they're the
ones<00:02:38.890> are<00:02:39.070> cheaper<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.700> don't<00:02:39.970> have<00:02:40.090> 10<00:02:40.300> car

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
ones are cheaper that don't have 10 car

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.490 
ones are cheaper that don't have 10 car
garages

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.330 

and<00:02:48.740> there's<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:50.530> pretty<00:02:51.530> much<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.920> almost<00:02:52.190> the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
and there's a pretty much to almost the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:01.530 
and there's a pretty much to almost the
same<00:02:52.550> view<00:02:52.820> here<00:02:53.060> just<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.930> view<00:02:54.920> lower<00:02:59.950> and

behind the building you'll see when I

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
know if I really like it because kind of

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.260 
know if I really like it because kind of
it's<00:03:40.490> kind<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:40.700> farther<00:03:41.150> away<00:03:41.270> from<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:43.270> from

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
it's kind of farther away from the from

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.670 
it's kind of farther away from the from
where<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:44.480> enter<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.720> house<00:03:44.930> out<00:03:45.200> compared

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.699 
to the 223,000 $217,000 apartment
because<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.300> don't<00:03:50.630> know<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:51.290> other<00:03:51.380> one<00:03:51.560> kind

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
because I don't know the other one kind

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.960 
because I don't know the other one kind
of<00:03:51.800> like<00:03:51.920> went<00:03:52.100> down<00:03:52.250> into<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.580> ground<00:03:52.790> this

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
of like went down into the ground this

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.080 
of like went down into the ground this
one<00:03:53.150> just<00:03:54.310> its<00:03:55.310> own<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.580> opposite<00:03:55.910> side<00:03:56.060> of

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
one just its own the opposite side of

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.300 
one just its own the opposite side of
the<00:03:56.239> building<00:03:56.390> from<00:03:56.750> where<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:57.019> enter

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.910 

yeah<00:04:02.970> guys<00:04:03.210> hope<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.540> enjoyed<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:03.900> video<00:04:04.080> I

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
yeah guys hope you enjoyed this video I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.360 
yeah guys hope you enjoyed this video I
think<00:04:05.520> this<00:04:05.610> is<00:04:05.730> probably<00:04:05.850> one<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.240> best

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
think this is probably one of the best

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.300 
think this is probably one of the best
safe<00:04:08.370> houses<00:04:08.690> in<00:04:09.770> here<00:04:10.770> even<00:04:11.010> though<00:04:11.100> it's<00:04:11.220> not

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
safe houses in here even though it's not

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.110 
safe houses in here even though it's not
the<00:04:11.430> most<00:04:11.550> expensive

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
the most expensive

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.770 
the most expensive
you<00:04:12.540> still<00:04:12.750> get<00:04:12.900> 10<00:04:13.050> car<00:04:13.260> garage<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:14.780> it's

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
you still get 10 car garage and it's

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.599 
you still get 10 car garage and it's
it's<00:04:16.019> it's<00:04:16.350> closer<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.010> beach<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.519> I

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
it's it's closer to the beach and I

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.509 
it's it's closer to the beach and I
think<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:19.709> might<00:04:19.890> keep<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> little<00:04:20.430> bit

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
think it might keep you a little bit

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.790 
think it might keep you a little bit
safer<00:04:21.000> I'm<00:04:21.329> at<00:04:21.480> least<00:04:21.600> when<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.870> exit<00:04:22.650> that

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
safer I'm at least when you exit that

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.780 
safer I'm at least when you exit that
part<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.160> don't<00:04:23.280> have<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.580> worry<00:04:23.730> about
