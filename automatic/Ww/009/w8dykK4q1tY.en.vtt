not played in what like two months or

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.830 
not played in what like two months or
something<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.909> was<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> really<00:01:30.270> long<00:01:30.360> time<00:01:30.570> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
something it was a really long time that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.050 
something it was a really long time that
I<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.320> took<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.500> break<00:01:31.740> from<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.369> although

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I just took a break from it and although

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.609 
I just took a break from it and although
I<00:01:33.090> built<00:01:33.329> my<00:01:33.450> channel<00:01:33.810> off<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.049> game<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
I built my channel off this game I

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.130 
I built my channel off this game I
really<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.220> feel<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:35.970> dying<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.750> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
really do feel that it is dying and I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.950 
really do feel that it is dying and I
guess<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.500> should<00:01:37.850> appreciate<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.360> final<00:01:39.750> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
guess I should appreciate the final and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.230 
guess I should appreciate the final and
last<00:01:40.200> breaths<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.920> game<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:42.060> guess

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.160 
through the spawn like I am right now
there's<00:03:21.090> nothing<00:03:21.299> like<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.840> in<00:03:21.900> any<00:03:22.079> other

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
there's nothing like it in any other

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.599 
there's nothing like it in any other
first-person<00:03:22.709> shooter<00:03:23.220> game<00:03:23.400> I've<00:03:23.579> ever

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
first-person shooter game I've ever

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.280 
first-person shooter game I've ever
played<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.359> can<00:03:24.690> tell<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.049> much<00:03:25.109> right

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
played I can tell you that much right

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.440 
played I can tell you that much right
now<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.459> know<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:26.850> thought<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.269> there

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
now and you know I thought that there

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.210 
now and you know I thought that there
would<00:03:27.570> be<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.750> game<00:03:27.989> that<00:03:28.500> would<00:03:28.620> deliver<00:03:28.890> such

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
would be a game that would deliver such

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.069 
would be a game that would deliver such
an<00:03:29.340> adrenaline<00:03:29.609> pumping<00:03:30.239> experience<00:03:30.900> that

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
an adrenaline pumping experience that

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.080 
an adrenaline pumping experience that
this<00:03:31.200> game<00:03:31.440> did<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.549> thought<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.880> would<00:03:32.970> be

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
this game did and I thought it would be

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.240 
this game did and I thought it would be
warfighter<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:33.870> wasn't<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.350> thought<00:03:34.980> it

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
warfighter but it wasn't I thought it

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.099 
warfighter but it wasn't I thought it
could<00:03:35.459> be<00:03:35.489> battlefield<00:03:36.150> 3<00:03:36.359> but<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.630> wasn't<00:03:36.989> I

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
could be battlefield 3 but it wasn't I

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.020 
could be battlefield 3 but it wasn't I
mean<00:03:37.320> these<00:03:37.650> are<00:03:37.829> good<00:03:38.010> games<00:03:38.310> or<00:03:38.609> at<00:03:38.700> least<00:03:38.880> I

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
mean these are good games or at least I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.460 
mean these are good games or at least I
think<00:03:39.090> battlefield<00:03:39.600> 3<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.870> an<00:03:39.959> awesome<00:03:40.290> game

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
think battlefield 3 is an awesome game

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.330 
think battlefield 3 is an awesome game
or<00:03:40.950> fighter<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.579> an<00:03:41.700> ok<00:03:42.000> game<00:03:42.410> but<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.590> mean<00:03:44.130> none

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
or fighter is an ok game but I mean none

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.789 
or fighter is an ok game but I mean none
of<00:03:44.370> them<00:03:44.579> have<00:03:45.359> even<00:03:45.570> gotten<00:03:45.900> me<00:03:46.440> close<00:03:46.769> to

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
of them have even gotten me close to

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.289 
of them have even gotten me close to
experiencing<00:03:47.760> such<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.090> freakin<00:03:48.950> rush<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.370> mean

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
experiencing such a freakin rush I mean

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.970 
experiencing such a freakin rush I mean
that<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.600> literally<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.019> only<00:03:52.260> term<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.709> I

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
that is literally the only term that I

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.759 
that is literally the only term that I
could<00:03:53.220> use<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.519> define<00:03:54.299> so<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.230> speak<00:03:55.500> the

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
could use to define so to speak the

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.680 
could use to define so to speak the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
experience and it is an experience it

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.050 
experience and it is an experience it
really<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:00.630> i<00:04:00.660> mean<00:04:01.079> i<00:04:01.109> could<00:04:01.319> never<00:04:01.709> even<00:04:02.130> seen

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
really is i mean i could never even seen

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.809 
really is i mean i could never even seen
anything<00:04:03.630> like<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:03.840> before<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.620> i<00:04:05.519> haven't

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
anything like it before and i haven't

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.559 
anything like it before and i haven't
seen<00:04:05.970> anything<00:04:06.180> since<00:04:06.510> it's<00:04:07.440> just<00:04:07.769> crazy<00:04:08.310> and

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
seen anything since it's just crazy and

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.580 
seen anything since it's just crazy and
you<00:04:09.569> know<00:04:09.600> i<00:04:09.690> guess<00:04:09.930> i'll<00:04:10.049> have<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.200> get<00:04:10.350> into

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
you know i guess i'll have to get into

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.039 
you know i guess i'll have to get into
the<00:04:10.709> bitter<00:04:10.889> part<00:04:11.160> now<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:12.510> know<00:04:12.630> i<00:04:12.660> think

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
the bitter part now and you know i think

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.530 
the bitter part now and you know i think
it<00:04:13.290> could<00:04:13.859> have<00:04:13.950> been<00:04:14.100> a<00:04:14.160> lot<00:04:14.250> better<00:04:14.430> but<00:04:15.359> this

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
it could have been a lot better but this

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.210 
it could have been a lot better but this
experience<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:16.380> good<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.829> only<00:04:16.979> way

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
experience is so good and the only way

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.440 
experience is so good and the only way
that<00:04:17.400> they<00:04:17.519> could<00:04:17.579> have<00:04:17.760> made<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.090> better<00:04:18.209> in

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
that they could have made it better in

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.690 
that they could have made it better in
my<00:04:18.630> opinion<00:04:18.660> is<00:04:19.320> cutting<00:04:20.039> down<00:04:20.190> on<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.430> spawn

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
my opinion is cutting down on the spawn

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.290 
my opinion is cutting down on the spawn
trapping<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.660> whole<00:04:22.580> just<00:04:23.580> absolutely

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
trapping and the whole just absolutely

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
trapping and the whole just absolutely
no<00:04:24.720> mercy

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
no mercy

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.590 
no mercy
for<00:04:25.890> killing<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.310> enemy<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.820> their<00:04:26.940> spawn<00:04:27.270> I

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
for killing the enemy and their spawn I

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.120 
for killing the enemy and their spawn I
think<00:04:28.230> they<00:04:28.320> should<00:04:28.470> have<00:04:28.560> cut<00:04:28.680> down<00:04:28.710> on<00:04:28.980> that

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
think they should have cut down on that

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.880 
think they should have cut down on that
a<00:04:29.160> little<00:04:29.340> bit<00:04:29.550> but<00:04:30.510> more<00:04:30.720> importantly<00:04:31.260> they

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
a little bit but more importantly they

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.380 
a little bit but more importantly they
just<00:04:32.130> needed<00:04:32.310> more<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.760> this<00:04:32.880> game<00:04:33.000> this<00:04:33.330> game

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
just needed more to this game this game

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.840 
just needed more to this game this game
needed<00:04:33.990> more<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:34.530> that's<00:04:35.400> where<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.670> bitter

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
needed more and that's where the bitter

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.580 
needed more and that's where the bitter
part<00:04:36.030> comes<00:04:36.300> in<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.660> think<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.080> gameplay<00:04:37.560> of

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
part comes in I think the gameplay of

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.040 
part comes in I think the gameplay of
this<00:04:38.010> game<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.520> certain<00:04:39.000> situations<00:04:39.180> at<00:04:39.870> least

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
this game in certain situations at least

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.190 
this game in certain situations at least
occasionally<00:04:40.440> becomes<00:04:41.400> very<00:04:41.640> stale<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.540> it's

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
occasionally becomes very stale and it's

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.630 
occasionally becomes very stale and it's
kind<00:04:43.410> of<00:04:43.440> like<00:04:43.560> when<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.830> bite<00:04:44.040> into<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.400> really

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
kind of like when you bite into a really

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.460 
kind of like when you bite into a really
old<00:04:44.910> potato<00:04:45.270> chip<00:04:45.570> that's<00:04:45.780> been<00:04:45.930> sitting<00:04:46.170> out

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
old potato chip that's been sitting out

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.600 
old potato chip that's been sitting out
at<00:04:46.980> a<00:04:47.040> party<00:04:47.160> for<00:04:47.790> like<00:04:47.820> over<00:04:48.210> a<00:04:48.720> day<00:04:49.170> and<00:04:49.610> you

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
at a party for like over a day and you

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.160 
at a party for like over a day and you
just<00:04:50.760> bite<00:04:50.940> into<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.300> and<00:04:51.510> it's<00:04:51.660> really<00:04:51.870> just

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
just bite into it and it's really just

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.620 
just bite into it and it's really just
tastes<00:04:53.040> terrible<00:04:53.430> it<00:04:53.820> tastes<00:04:54.060> really<00:04:54.180> bland

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
tastes terrible it tastes really bland

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.590 
tastes terrible it tastes really bland
it<00:04:54.900> could<00:04:55.020> be<00:04:55.170> like<00:04:55.350> too<00:04:55.950> chewy<00:04:56.420> that's<00:04:57.420> what

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
it could be like too chewy that's what

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.930 
it could be like too chewy that's what
it's<00:04:57.720> like<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.380> Medal<00:04:58.620> of<00:04:58.680> Honor<00:04:58.940> 2010

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
it's like the Medal of Honor 2010

happen it's kind of boring that's just

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.730 
happen it's kind of boring that's just
how<00:05:34.650> I<00:05:34.740> feel<00:05:35.180> so<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.690> could<00:05:36.990> be<00:05:37.020> bland<00:05:37.410> but<00:05:37.620> at

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
how I feel so it could be bland but at

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.580 
how I feel so it could be bland but at
the<00:05:37.830> same<00:05:38.040> time<00:05:38.250> I<00:05:38.520> think<00:05:38.820> that<00:05:39.000> rush<00:05:39.270> of<00:05:39.600> the

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
the same time I think that rush of the

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.320 
the same time I think that rush of the
high<00:05:40.740> score<00:05:41.040> chain<00:05:41.340> of<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.610> cruise<00:05:41.940> missile

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
high score chain of the cruise missile

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.060 
high score chain of the cruise missile
that<00:05:42.420> ultimate<00:05:42.840> goal<00:05:43.020> is<00:05:43.200> still<00:05:43.470> there<00:05:43.710> and<00:05:43.740> it

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
that ultimate goal is still there and it

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.420 
that ultimate goal is still there and it
has<00:05:44.190> been<00:05:44.430> there<00:05:44.610> since<00:05:44.880> day<00:05:45.000> one<00:05:45.420> and<00:05:45.630> it

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
has been there since day one and it

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.350 
has been there since day one and it
hasn't<00:05:47.430> gone<00:05:47.520> anywhere<00:05:47.700> so<00:05:48.060> that's<00:05:48.240> an
