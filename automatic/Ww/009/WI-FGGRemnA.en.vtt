you well bottom line is we didn't have

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.940 
you well bottom line is we didn't have
kids<00:01:49.970> on<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.450> prepared<00:01:50.840> for<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.229> game<00:01:51.409> but<00:01:51.680> by

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
kids on the prepared for the game but by

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.100 
kids on the prepared for the game but by
the<00:01:52.009> results<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.670> that's<00:01:52.759> all<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.119> that<00:01:53.300> give

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
the results and that's all of that give

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.290 
the results and that's all of that give
up<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.440> an<00:01:54.560> AVR<00:01:55.009> Russian<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.880> don't<00:01:56.060> deserve

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
up to an AVR Russian you don't deserve

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.010 
up to an AVR Russian you don't deserve
to<00:01:56.540> win<00:01:57.280> that's<00:01:58.280> what<00:01:58.430> we<00:01:58.520> did<00:01:58.670> he<00:01:59.659> had<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.810> hard

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
to win that's what we did he had a hard

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.139 
to win that's what we did he had a hard
time<00:02:00.080> stopping<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.799> run<00:02:00.920> we<00:02:01.640> knew<00:02:01.790> that<00:02:01.820> was

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
time stopping the run we knew that was

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.639 
time stopping the run we knew that was
the<00:02:02.270> number<00:02:02.509> one<00:02:02.540> thing<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:02.930> had<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.110> do<00:02:03.290> coming

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
the number one thing we had to do coming

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.960 
the number one thing we had to do coming
in<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.860> game<00:02:04.009> we<00:02:04.280> didn't<00:02:04.549> get<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.729> job<00:02:04.909> done

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
in the game we didn't get the job done

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.550 
in the game we didn't get the job done
so<00:02:05.299> obviously<00:02:05.600> what<00:02:05.810> we<00:02:05.930> plan<00:02:06.200> didn't<00:02:06.530> work

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
so obviously what we plan didn't work

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.620 
so obviously what we plan didn't work
were<00:02:07.280> they<00:02:07.430> doing<00:02:07.460> things<00:02:07.909> something

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
were they doing things something

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.270 
were they doing things something
different<00:02:08.810> than<00:02:09.289> what<00:02:09.320> you'd<00:02:09.590> seen<00:02:09.860> they<00:02:10.070> play

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
different than what you'd seen they play

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.080 
different than what you'd seen they play

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
it off it's all say the same runs we

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.880 
it off it's all say the same runs we
looked<00:02:14.300> at<00:02:14.480> prepared<00:02:14.900> for<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.350> same<00:02:15.560> same

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
looked at prepared for the same same

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.520 
looked at prepared for the same same
basic<00:02:16.280> things<00:02:16.489> we<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:16.700> go<00:02:17.080> take<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:18.290> one

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
basic things we just go take this one

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.250 
basic things we just go take this one
and<00:02:18.610> improve<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.880> find<00:02:20.120> out<00:02:20.300> what<00:02:20.780> we<00:02:20.959> need<00:02:20.989> to

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
and improve and find out what we need to

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.740 
and improve and find out what we need to
do<00:02:21.380> better<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:22.310> execute<00:02:22.880> better<00:02:23.060> on<00:02:23.330> details

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
do better to execute better on details

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.360 
do better to execute better on details
oh<00:02:25.720> we<00:02:26.720> were<00:02:26.870> pathetic<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.769> mean<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> second

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
bats too many bad down at distances and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.780 
bats too many bad down at distances and
then<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:39.980> know<00:02:40.100> any<00:02:40.220> time<00:02:40.430> you're<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.700> that

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
receiver is not hold the ball a lot to

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.530 
receiver is not hold the ball a lot to
stop<00:02:49.220> doing<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.519> play<00:02:49.730> yeah<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.209> they<00:02:50.329> play

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540

a<00:02:50.570> lot<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.900> press-man<00:02:51.320> coverage<00:02:51.350> and

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
a lot of press-man coverage and

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.699 
a lot of press-man coverage and
sometimes<00:02:52.519> it<00:02:52.640> takes<00:02:52.790> another<00:02:53.120> beat<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:54.560> get

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
sometimes it takes another beat to get

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.949 
sometimes it takes another beat to get
free<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.370> sometimes<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.299> know<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.660> have<00:02:56.900> to

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
so you know it was just one of those

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.620 
so you know it was just one of those
games<00:03:03.470> where<00:03:03.769> you<00:03:04.519> know<00:03:04.640> again<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.030> know<00:03:05.120> you

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
games where you know again you know you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.000 
games where you know again you know you
don't<00:03:05.780> have<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.989> deal<00:03:06.230> with<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.500> as<00:03:06.620> much<00:03:06.829> if

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
and longs a year ago we didn't have that

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.610 
and longs a year ago we didn't have that
problem<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.269> year<00:03:11.600> we<00:03:11.930> did<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.380> showed

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
problem this year we did and it showed

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
never one thing and it wasn't in this

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.620 
never one thing and it wasn't in this
game<00:04:20.350> if<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.739> wasn't<00:04:21.160> getting<00:04:21.910> open<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.450> was

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
protecting if it wasn't protecting it

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.860 
protecting if it wasn't protecting it
was<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.460> inability<00:04:24.640> to<00:04:25.030> make<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.330> throw<00:04:25.540> so

was the inability to make the throw so

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.380 
was the inability to make the throw so
you<00:04:26.560> know<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:26.860> was<00:04:26.920> just<00:04:27.010> a<00:04:27.250> combination<00:04:27.490> it's

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
you know it was just a combination it's

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.860 
you know it was just a combination it's
your<00:04:28.480> tail<00:04:28.690> beat<00:04:28.930> that's<00:04:29.110> usually<00:04:29.440> what<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.620> is
