00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello girls how are you today I have a hall 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.779
 for you some things that I bought myself 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.389
 in the pharmacy other things that I bought 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.630
 in h &amp; m and I 'm also going to show you that 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.429
 I received for Christmas and then nothing like no 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.710
 I think the video is very long 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.380
 let's start what we're going to start 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.020
 by the pharmacy the first thing I bought 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.600
 in this gernika tint called 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.400
 color paper and it's because he's going to paint me 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.820
 the hair is my same color nothing 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.160
 what is the color of my natural hair 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.579
 because I'm sick of the wicks 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.040
 California no longer fits all a 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.620
 bit 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.730
 down and I think so, remove it again 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.890
 cut a little hair and I'm going to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.350
 think about it then I bought nothing 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.850
 this let's see how it works I think 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.130
 I'm going to paint it next week 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.640
 and in a video so nothing is 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:04.390
 earrings of that because surely ok 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.950
 then I bought this day cream 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.540
 l'oréal that took like two weeks 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.090
 using it but rope the box to 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.939
 show up better 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.049
 If I liked it, I did not buy it because only 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.759
 warrior recommended her and she was 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.729
 saying that being an explore 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.200
 terrific great come but not me 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.329
 buy students or because I buy anything 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.399
 more the cream and I must tell you that I 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.649
 like but it 's a bit greasy then 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.390
 for now I have a skin 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.280
 little bit closer to all of these maybe if 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.030
 it works but I do not know for summer like 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.920
 I will go with her but in general not 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.259
 I know is I have to try a little more to 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.290
 see if I really like it but already 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.320
 we will see also I bought myself 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.360
 this one is the same because it's another 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.190
 line but it's the night cream and these 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.990
 and the times that I love I get 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.240
 using it also like two weeks or something 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.450
 so I love how I get back the super 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.190
 cool and you see that we use a lot 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.110
 I love packaging is super 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.729
 I think not elegant looks like 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.800
 something that is long ago and cost a 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.760
 17 I think and 14 the other I do not know but I think 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.640
 this 17 franc and then nothing I like this 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.830
 very much is absorbed the very fast where 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.300
 you feel greasy on your skin I do not know 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.310
 really like that it 's like that 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.830
 I recommend that she still touch you 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.060
 as well as to try it a bit more but 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.240
 this really was love at first 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.870
 sight I love 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.000
 to see that you buy us always buy this 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.540
 meat cleaner that is called two in 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.310
 one make-up remover and gijón and I love 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.920
 the concept because I am one of those girls 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.660
 that grabs the soap and once 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.910
 removes makeup with everything 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.440
 and I love the concept but the only thing 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.900
 that I do not like is that it does not smell 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.330
 so if you have smells nothing 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.370
 absolutely nothing has no fragrance if 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.660
 it's something that you like about that if 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.040
 you have sensitive skin the 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.960
 fragrance and all this maybe it's going to 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.640
 love but I liked that the 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.880
 products a little something that fly or 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.350
 cool that smell something and this as not 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.070
 it smells nothing I do not think it's going to be 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.350
 buy because if I do not know I do not like a 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.780
 little simpleton but it does the work me 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.100
 Remove the makeup so I liked it that way 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.390
 which I think will last me long because 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.610
 Usually these products last a long time 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.410
 it's a little more liquid 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.410
 what I'm really used to 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.120
 but to follow me I like but not what 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.230
 I'm going to buy again that's why I 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.430
 I say because I like it better than me 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.060
 let the skin cool is half an hour 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.060
 normal 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.190
 after I bought I did not answer I won 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.990
 a contest blessed a brand I do not know of 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.160
 where is the brand but it's a brand with 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.340
 the one that I made a collaboration that 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.200
 time already and I love that brand because 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.560
 a very natural brand very video and everything 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.360
 this and they sent me an email telling me 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.600
 that he had a contest on facebook and what 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.940
 I got the contest and then I won 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.750
 This oil is called oil 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.910
 Orobio has five precious oils is 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.450
 a dry oil and I love marketing 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.180
 it's like a super thing I do not know how very of 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.360
 I love luxury is quite expensive 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.800
 it costs I think 40 and something frank like that 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.750
 that does not happen, I would always buy it 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.850
 but it came to me I know I'm half done 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.890
 nothing and I have to use it but what 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.950
 you can use on the face in the hair and 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.980
 in the hair so give your face because 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.130
 fits on the face and body and on the 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.060
 hair so I do not know anymore I'll tell you in a 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.730
 video if I liked it and all that 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.850
 that I bought the leader and bought my 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.950
 acetone favorite is the acetone of 100 is 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.550
 very cheap and I love the father link 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.280
 because you give him here and the product comes out and 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.130
 It is very comfortable to know that many people have you 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.720
 gone wrong for example to esther de coty 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.570
 makeup then surely it's going to 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.070
 know I'm going to leave the link below 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.840
 she told me once that good said in 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.970
 a video that had gone wrong 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.860
 little boat to me in the previous one that I had 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.729
 this also came out bad to me so it's 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.949
 something very cheap but when it goes well 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.719
 really that 's great I love me 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.610
 love it and I'll keep buying it 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:10.249
 because super cheap and it's also free 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.770
 make very very recommended in lidl the 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:14.509
 you can find ok now let's go with the 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.449
 girl m in gossip but in things 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.800
 that I am I can not believe yet the 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.779
 first is a little normal are some 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.189
 Stockings are medium and soft companies 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.289
 dating for the winter that I love 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.580
 that I loved the color these colors of 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.469
 which represent me a lot because I 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.870
 love things you 'll be like this with a 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:31.789
 little gray a little cream 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.620
 that's two pairs of media for five 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:37.990
 francs so I thought I was 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.699
 very well and that more than more 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.529
 Well, I did not like the detail of the 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.629
 tape and that you can use it for something else 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:46.759
 decorating something like that so I liked it because 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:50.089
 originally that was at 15 is the 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:53.149
 buy because I feel and this my god 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:54.710
 guys I bought these shoes tell me 

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:57.110
 if not I loved the truth that I 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.029
 it seems super summery I love the 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.830
 sure and they're super comfortable because you're 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:02.590
 platforms like that are super as it is because 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.010
 the truth is with the gesture 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:09.100
 and then nothing I'm in love with I love 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:12.010
 that just as the finger is shown and 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.750
 these shoes originally that are 50 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.889
 francs and guess how many the 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.099
 purchases 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:21.189
 one franc one franc 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:23.259
 5 1 10 1 is the cheapest thing that I 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:24.999
 they bought life a pair of shoes that 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:27.449
 like 50 francs eat less for a 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:29.889
 Frank 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:33.120
 I love them they are beautiful after being 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.120
 very much because right now 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.290
 domina eats makeup by the way this 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.700
 tutorial what film is going to be the next 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.590
 Friday because they are that Fridays are 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.810
 the days when your tutorials well 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.550
 Well, now nothing is going to show you 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.230
 the two little things that they gave me for 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.960
 Christmas the first according to two clays of 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.090
 leftovers that my mother gave me her 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.440
 sometimes sometimes bad is not served at all 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.440
 the videos I think so sometimes 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:11.930
 gave me these simple ones are the ones that 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.930
 I love them, they are like 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:15.619
 with 6 this 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:23.330
 rings two rings so they are much 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.070
 because I love things that shine 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.380
 and they are tiny because I like them 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.990
 very large streams so I love them 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.480
 really that super cute and the other 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:37.190
 what I had I was paid for Christmas in 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:42.260
 this set of the war and shop in it the smell 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:44.990
 Vanilla please bring a butter 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:48.139
 body a super beautiful soap in the form 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:50.479
 an exfoliating heart and a woman 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:52.310
 right so I love divine ballet 

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:55.550
 so when you want to give me means and style 

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.570
 It's for the right and I love the 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.210
 box because I'm going to use it 

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:01.570
 surely so, well, nothing, that girls 

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.570
 It has been everything 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:10.750
 except them early moves 

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:10.750
 2014 has to tell you 

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:16.160
 I hope that 

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.570
 that nothing that have a nice day and until 

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.570
