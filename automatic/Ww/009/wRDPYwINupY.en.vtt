like them and think they're really a
great<00:00:29.050> value<00:00:29.380> this<00:00:30.059> particular<00:00:31.059> one<00:00:31.329> is<00:00:31.719> a<00:00:32.140> pen

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
great value this particular one is a pen

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:40.049 
great value this particular one is a pen
light<00:00:32.649> and<00:00:33.250> it's<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:36.180> ti4<00:00:37.290> penlight<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.940> has

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
light and it's the ti4 penlight it has

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.770 
light and it's the ti4 penlight it has
four<00:00:40.390> different<00:00:40.629> modes<00:00:41.079> so<00:00:41.710> we<00:00:41.860> have<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.100> I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
four different modes so we have a I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.419 
four different modes so we have a I
think<00:00:43.780> this<00:00:43.870> is<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.460> third<00:00:45.460> of<00:00:45.879> a<00:00:46.390> loom<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:48.070> have

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
think this is a third of a loom we have

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.220 
think this is a third of a loom we have
one<00:00:49.210> that's<00:00:49.390> 24<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.379> then<00:00:50.859> one<00:00:51.159> that's<00:00:52.230> 252

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
one that's 24 and then one that's 252

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.869 
one that's 24 and then one that's 252
looms<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:54.280> then<00:00:55.059> finally<00:00:55.589> we<00:00:56.589> have<00:00:56.890> a<00:00:57.159> stroke

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
looms and then finally we have a stroke

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:04.560 
looms and then finally we have a stroke
function<00:00:58.420> if<00:00:58.510> I<00:00:58.629> can<00:00:58.809> get<00:00:58.929> it<00:00:59.079> on<00:00:59.199> here<00:01:03.360> so<00:01:04.360> in

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
function if I can get it on here so in

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.170 
function if I can get it on here so in
this<00:01:04.720> very<00:01:05.170> small<00:01:05.710> package<00:01:06.370> here<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:06.909> I<00:01:07.000> mean

another week we're going to compare it
to<00:01:42.400> a<00:01:42.940> similar<00:01:43.750> product<00:01:44.170> by<00:01:44.290> streamlight<00:01:44.950> and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
to a similar product by streamlight and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
two of them in comparison they're

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.120 
two of them in comparison they're
similar<00:01:49.630> price<00:01:50.050> points<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.650> think<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.890> price

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
similar price points I think the price

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.130 
similar price points I think the price
point<00:01:51.340> for<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.880> around<00:01:52.680> $25<00:01:53.680> $23<00:01:55.140> retail

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
point for this is around $25 $23 retail

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.360 
point for this is around $25 $23 retail
list<00:01:56.650> and<00:01:58.080> so<00:01:59.080> Amazon<00:01:59.530> some<00:01:59.800> other<00:01:59.920> people<00:02:00.250> may

have a slightly lower price on it but

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.260 
have a slightly lower price on it but
anyway<00:02:02.530> takes<00:02:03.190> double<00:02:03.640> life<00:02:03.790> I'm<00:02:04.060> sorry
