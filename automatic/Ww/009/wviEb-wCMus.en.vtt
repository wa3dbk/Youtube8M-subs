00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
wanted to do that to be honest i think

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
wanted to do that to be honest i think
when<00:00:50.100> i<00:00:50.129> started<00:00:50.610> i<00:00:50.700> think<00:00:50.930> you<00:00:51.930> know<00:00:51.960> there

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
when i started i think you know there

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.660 
when i started i think you know there
wasn't<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.680> coaching<00:00:53.129> badges<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.550> things

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
wasn't the coaching badges and things

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.000 
wasn't the coaching badges and things
like<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.820> said<00:00:54.059> possibly<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.199> mind<00:00:55.469> would

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
like that said possibly in my mind would

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.799 
like that said possibly in my mind would
have<00:00:56.039> been<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.120> that's<00:00:57.329> maybe<00:00:57.570> just

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
have been the you know that's maybe just

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990 
have been the you know that's maybe just
a<00:00:57.899> natural<00:00:58.260> progression<00:00:58.350> when<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.920> finish<00:00:59.340> I

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
a natural progression when you finish I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.180 
a natural progression when you finish I
think<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:01.140> most<00:01:01.500> people<00:01:01.800> finished<00:01:02.039> in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
think then most people finished in

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.640 
think then most people finished in
probably<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.760> their<00:01:02.879> early<00:01:02.910> 30s<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.110> think

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
probably in their early 30s but I think

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.740 
probably in their early 30s but I think
down<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.610> foreign<00:01:05.939> influence<00:01:06.450> that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
down to the the foreign influence that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.270 
down to the the foreign influence that
that's<00:01:07.140> come<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> Premier<00:01:08.070> League<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that's come to the Premier League and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.340 
that's come to the Premier League and
the<00:01:09.150> way<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.420> players<00:01:09.720> now<00:01:09.930> conduct

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the way that players now conduct

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.020 
the way that players now conduct
themselves<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.040> look<00:01:11.189> after<00:01:11.369> themselves<00:01:11.610> off

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
themselves and look after themselves off

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.789 
themselves and look after themselves off
the<00:01:12.180> pitch<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.510> their<00:01:12.750> diet<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> things

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the pitch with their diet and things

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.260 
the pitch with their diet and things
like<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> games<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:14.939> players<00:01:15.180> are

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
like that and the games your players are

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
like that and the games your players are
a<00:01:15.360> lot<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.509> fit<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.740> was

because of the way I improved from 16 to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.929 
because of the way I improved from 16 to

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
haven't had a career yet and I just

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.460 
haven't had a career yet and I just
think<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:41.600> know<00:04:41.720> for<00:04:41.930> me<00:04:42.230> it<00:04:42.320> was<00:04:42.380> always

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
think you know for me it was always

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.740 
think you know for me it was always
about<00:04:42.710> wait<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.250> end<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.430> my<00:04:43.490> career<00:04:43.750> and

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
about wait to the end of my career and

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.100 
about wait to the end of my career and
if<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:44.960> were<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.290> do<00:04:45.410> it<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:45.680> was<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.160> time<00:04:46.400> and

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
if I were to do it that was the time and

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.840 
if I were to do it that was the time and
so<00:04:48.110> that's<00:04:48.350> exactly<00:04:48.500> what<00:04:48.740> I<00:04:48.770> did<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.010> even<00:04:49.100> my

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
so that's exactly what I did and even my

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.790 
so that's exactly what I did and even my
dad<00:04:50.000> said<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.270> me<00:04:50.480> before<00:04:50.660> he<00:04:50.870> passed<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.620> you

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
and the fact that they didn't do things

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.880 
and the fact that they didn't do things
correctly<00:05:44.180> in<00:05:44.540> my<00:05:44.570> opinion<00:05:44.960> when<00:05:45.320> it<00:05:45.350> came<00:05:45.710> to

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
correctly in my opinion when it came to

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.010 
correctly in my opinion when it came to
the<00:05:46.010> end<00:05:46.160> that<00:05:46.310> you<00:05:46.730> know<00:05:46.850> maybe<00:05:47.060> maybe<00:05:47.840> it

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
the end that you know maybe maybe it

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.180 
the end that you know maybe maybe it
would<00:05:48.140> have<00:05:48.230> been<00:05:48.290> better<00:05:48.350> to<00:05:48.770> have<00:05:48.800> gone<00:05:49.040> on

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
would have been better to have gone on

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.000 
would have been better to have gone on
and<00:05:49.400> tried<00:05:50.060> at<00:05:50.210> other<00:05:50.360> places<00:05:50.630> when<00:05:51.050> you<00:05:51.890> know

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
and tried at other places when you know

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.470 
and tried at other places when you know
when<00:05:52.250> it<00:05:52.370> went<00:05:52.700> someone<00:05:52.970> I'd<00:05:53.060> mass<00:05:53.210> you<00:05:53.360> know

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
when it went someone I'd mass you know

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.990 
when it went someone I'd mass you know
it<00:05:53.660> comes<00:05:54.169> knocking<00:05:54.650> most<00:05:54.890> people<00:05:55.220> would

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
it comes knocking most people would

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.670 
it comes knocking most people would
probably<00:05:56.030> have<00:05:56.510> gone<00:05:56.690> but<00:05:56.930> you<00:05:57.200> know<00:05:57.290> I<00:05:57.320> felt<00:05:57.560> a
