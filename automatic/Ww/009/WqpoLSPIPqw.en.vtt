pretty<00:00:16.710> big<00:00:16.920> map<00:00:17.190> but<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.940> did<00:00:18.119> actually<00:00:18.240> make

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
pretty big map but it did actually make

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.150

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
me play much more defensively which was

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.029 
me play much more defensively which was
surprisingly<00:00:20.820> effective<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.710> you<00:00:22.710> can<00:00:22.830> get<00:00:23.010> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
surprisingly effective and you can get a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.259 
surprisingly effective and you can get a
lot<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.250> kills<00:00:23.550> when<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:23.939> wait<00:00:24.060> for

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
lot of kills when you just wait for

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.609 
lot of kills when you just wait for
people<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.539> come<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.960> rather<00:00:25.199> than<00:00:25.350> kind

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
people to come to you rather than kind

360 one near my brothers bought an xbox

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.359 
360 one near my brothers bought an xbox
360<00:01:12.299> literally<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> play<00:01:13.110> halo<00:01:13.470> 3<00:01:13.799> which

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
360 literally just to play halo 3 which

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850 
360 literally just to play halo 3 which
was<00:01:14.580> an<00:01:14.729> incredible<00:01:15.270> game<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.810> I've<00:01:16.680> pretty

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
was an incredible game and I've pretty

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.530 
was an incredible game and I've pretty
much<00:01:16.950> stuck<00:01:17.280> with<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.490> since<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> ps3

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
much stuck with it since I do have a ps3

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.570 
much stuck with it since I do have a ps3
although<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.110> use<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.650> much<00:01:19.830> just

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
although I don't use it that much just

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.370 
although I don't use it that much just
because<00:01:20.759> I'm<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> fan<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.689> interface<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
because I'm not a fan of the interface I

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.910 
because I'm not a fan of the interface I
think<00:01:22.560> Xbox<00:01:22.890> Live<00:01:23.130> runs<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:24.030> smoothly

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
think Xbox Live runs more smoothly

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.170 
think Xbox Live runs more smoothly
however<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.220> next-gen<00:01:26.670> consoles<00:01:27.060> the

however with the next-gen consoles the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450 
however with the next-gen consoles the
ps4<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> xbox<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.470> will<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:29.040> picking<00:01:29.250> up

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460

both of them when they come out and it's

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.690 
both of them when they come out and it's
interesting<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.540> terms<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.960> games<00:01:34.740> Xbox<00:01:35.490> does

whole<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.460> stream<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.030> mean<00:01:54.479> they<00:01:54.570> covered

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
whole of the stream I mean they covered

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.780

the<00:01:55.079> console<00:01:55.590> itself<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.310> looks<00:01:56.549> like

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the console itself what it looks like

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.760 
the console itself what it looks like
they<00:01:57.600> actually<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.439> were<00:01:58.500> much

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
they actually I think they were much

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
they actually I think they were much
more<00:01:59.040> straight<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> point<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.570> xbox

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
more straight to the point with the xbox

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.399 
more straight to the point with the xbox
reveal<00:02:01.640> compared<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> ps4<00:02:03.030> reveal<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.780> it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
reveal compared to the ps4 reveal and it

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.830 
reveal compared to the ps4 reveal and it
was<00:02:04.619> very<00:02:04.909> entertainment-based<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.509> wasn't

was very entertainment-based it wasn't

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.600 
was very entertainment-based it wasn't
so<00:02:07.020> much<00:02:07.049> based<00:02:07.469> around<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.770> gameplay<00:02:08.250> until

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
so much based around the gameplay until

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.639 
so much based around the gameplay until
kind<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.879> towards<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.390> end<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.140> guys<00:02:10.349> are

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
to skip through all the entertainment

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.330 
to skip through all the entertainment
stuff<00:02:15.060> about<00:02:15.300> TV<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:15.810> demand<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.440> using

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
different programs and that kind of

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.240 
different programs and that kind of
stuff<00:02:18.680> interesting<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.800> skype<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.220> being

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
stuff interesting that skype is being

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.560 
stuff interesting that skype is being
added<00:02:20.610> into<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.660> new<00:02:22.110> xbox<00:02:22.680> I'm<00:02:22.920> not<00:02:23.430> too<00:02:24.360> sure

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
added into the new xbox I'm not too sure

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.820 
added into the new xbox I'm not too sure
what<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.810> think<00:02:24.840> about<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:25.410> skype

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
what to think about that because skype

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.910 
what to think about that because skype
does<00:02:26.070> present<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.910> lot<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.270> issues<00:02:28.020> at<00:02:28.800> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
does present a lot of issues at the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.530 
does present a lot of issues at the
moment<00:02:28.980> with<00:02:29.660> no<00:02:30.660> security<00:02:31.080> at<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.620> moment<00:02:32.040> so

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
moment with no security at the moment so

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.000 
moment with no security at the moment so
whether<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.690> will<00:02:33.840> all<00:02:33.990> change<00:02:34.230> with<00:02:34.500> Xbox

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
whether this will all change with Xbox

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.550 
whether this will all change with Xbox
nobody<00:02:35.790> really<00:02:36.030> knows<00:02:36.210> but<00:02:36.570> anyway<00:02:37.350> the

is just around the corner which I could

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.210 
is just around the corner which I could
be<00:02:48.780> going<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.410> unfortunately<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:50.070> the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
be going to but unfortunately it's the
