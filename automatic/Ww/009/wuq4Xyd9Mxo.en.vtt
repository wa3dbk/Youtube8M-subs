the<00:00:31.500> bike<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.610> make<00:00:32.790> sure<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.239> well

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the bike how can I make sure that well

the bike how can I make sure that well
there's<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.750> couple<00:00:33.780> different<00:00:34.260> ways<00:00:34.579> you<00:00:35.579> can

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
there's a couple different ways you can

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.240 
there's a couple different ways you can
fill<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:36.239> water<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.980> see<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.070> there's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
fill it up with water and see if there's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.000 
fill it up with water and see if there's
anything<00:00:38.489> leaking<00:00:38.940> out<00:00:39.230> but<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> normal

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
anything leaking out but a normal

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.740 
anything leaking out but a normal
coolant<00:00:41.430> system<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> get<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> little

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
coolant system is going to get a little

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.030 
coolant system is going to get a little
bit<00:00:42.930> pressurize<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> get

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
bit pressurize it's going to get

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.700 
bit pressurize it's going to get
pressurized<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.670> maybe<00:00:44.850> 12<00:00:45.210> or<00:00:45.450> 15<00:00:45.660> psi<00:00:46.469> or

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
pressurized to maybe 12 or 15 psi or

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.069 
pressurized to maybe 12 or 15 psi or
whatnot<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.300> filling<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:48.930> water

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
whatnot so just filling it up with water

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.560 
whatnot so just filling it up with water
isn't<00:00:49.410> necessarily<00:00:50.370> enough<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.059> see<00:00:51.300> if

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
isn't necessarily enough to see if

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.720 
isn't necessarily enough to see if
there's<00:00:51.899> any<00:00:52.020> leaks<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.430> might<00:00:53.579> have

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
there's any leaks because you might have

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.970 
there's any leaks because you might have
no<00:00:53.910> leaks<00:00:54.210> at<00:00:54.629> zero<00:00:55.020> pressure<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.680> once<00:00:55.829> you

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
no leaks at zero pressure but once you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160 
no leaks at zero pressure but once you
start<00:00:56.250> getting<00:00:56.370> pressurized<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.750> might<00:00:57.899> find

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
start getting pressurized you might find

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.450 
start getting pressurized you might find
you<00:00:58.320> guys<00:00:58.590> you've<00:00:58.829> got<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> little<00:00:59.219> bit<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you guys you've got a little bit of a

blow<00:01:53.240> into<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:53.660> top<00:01:53.930> end<00:01:54.140> here<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.650> see<00:01:55.550> if

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
blow into this top end here and see if

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.800 
blow into this top end here and see if
the<00:01:55.910> smoke<00:01:56.620> poops<00:01:57.620> out<00:01:57.920> of<00:01:58.070> any<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.520> the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
the smoke poops out of any of the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.360 
the smoke poops out of any of the
potential<00:01:59.810> holes<00:01:59.960> in<00:02:00.140> this<00:02:00.230> radiator<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.220> here

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
potential holes in this radiator so here

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:22.450 
potential holes in this radiator so here
we<00:02:01.460> go

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:32.170 

oh<00:02:25.450> no<00:02:26.450> leaks<00:02:29.470> remember<00:02:30.470> also<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:31.180> your

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
oh no leaks remember also that your

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.540 
oh no leaks remember also that your
average<00:02:32.360> um<00:02:32.960> coolant<00:02:33.560> system<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.190> car<00:02:34.520> or

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
average um coolant system on a car or

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.160 
average um coolant system on a car or
motorcycle<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.420> really<00:02:35.660> only<00:02:35.870> going<00:02:36.110> to

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
motorcycle is really only going to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.360 
motorcycle is really only going to
pressurize<00:02:36.730> your<00:02:37.960> radiator<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.170> maybe<00:02:39.380> 13<00:02:39.950> psi

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
pressurize your radiator to maybe 13 psi

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.270 
pressurize your radiator to maybe 13 psi
while<00:02:40.910> your<00:02:41.900> lungs<00:02:42.590> can<00:02:42.920> really<00:02:43.160> only

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
while your lungs can really only

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.340 
while your lungs can really only
pressurize<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.270> air<00:02:44.420> coming<00:02:44.750> out<00:02:44.960> of<00:02:45.080> them<00:02:45.200> to

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
pressurize the air coming out of them to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.430 
pressurize the air coming out of them to
maybe<00:02:45.500> 1<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.980> 3<00:02:46.280> psi<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.150> this<00:02:47.180> test<00:02:47.600> while

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
maybe 1 to 3 psi so this test while

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.410 
maybe 1 to 3 psi so this test while
really<00:02:48.980> indicative<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.610> any<00:02:49.790> holes<00:02:50.090> it's

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
really indicative of any holes it's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.030 
really indicative of any holes it's
really<00:02:50.750> good<00:02:50.930> way<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.110> find<00:02:51.410> any<00:02:51.590> holes<00:02:51.800> in

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
really good way to find any holes in

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.770 
really good way to find any holes in
your<00:02:52.190> radiator<00:02:52.520> it's<00:02:53.090> not<00:02:53.300> entirely

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
your radiator it's not entirely

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.050 
your radiator it's not entirely
conclusive<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:56.290> obviously<00:02:57.290> after<00:02:57.530> you

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
conclusive so obviously after you

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.220 
conclusive so obviously after you
install<00:02:59.060> your<00:02:59.270> radiator<00:02:59.690> you're<00:03:00.020> going<00:03:00.170> to

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
install your radiator you're going to

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.930 
install your radiator you're going to
want<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.500> check<00:03:00.680> again<00:03:00.980> for<00:03:01.010> leaks<00:03:03.610> yeah<00:03:04.610> you

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
want to check again for leaks yeah you

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.460 
want to check again for leaks yeah you
can<00:03:05.120> do<00:03:05.240> that<00:03:05.270> in<00:03:05.570> front<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.990> mirror<00:03:06.320> or

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
can do that in front of a mirror or

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.010 
can do that in front of a mirror or
whatever<00:03:06.890> just<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.520> UM<00:03:07.700> look<00:03:08.420> for<00:03:08.630> these<00:03:08.720> leaks

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
whatever just to UM look for these leaks

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.540 
whatever just to UM look for these leaks
a<00:03:09.260> lot<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.530> times<00:03:09.770> you're<00:03:09.980> going<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.160> get<00:03:10.310> leaks

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
a lot of times you're going to get leaks

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.870 
a lot of times you're going to get leaks
down<00:03:11.300> in<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.570> corners<00:03:12.020> right<00:03:12.050> here<00:03:12.290> like<00:03:12.880> I'm

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
down in the corners right here like I'm

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.120 
down in the corners right here like I'm
not<00:03:14.180> sure<00:03:14.390> exactly<00:03:14.690> how<00:03:15.050> this<00:03:15.260> radiator<00:03:15.860> is

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
not sure exactly how this radiator is

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.890 
not sure exactly how this radiator is
oriented<00:03:16.760> on<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.970> bike<00:03:17.180> just<00:03:17.510> yet<00:03:17.660> because<00:03:17.750> I

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
oriented on the bike just yet because I

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.210 
oriented on the bike just yet because I
haven't<00:03:18.020> installed<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.470> yet<00:03:18.560> but<00:03:18.950> if<00:03:19.100> the

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
haven't installed it yet but if the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.580 
haven't installed it yet but if the
radiator<00:03:19.610> sits<00:03:19.910> up<00:03:20.090> like<00:03:20.150> this<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.750> lot<00:03:21.440> of

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
radiator sits up like this a lot of

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.800 
radiator sits up like this a lot of
times<00:03:21.800> rain<00:03:22.160> will<00:03:22.370> get<00:03:22.460> down<00:03:22.700> here<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.330> just

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
times rain will get down here and just

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.120 
times rain will get down here and just
sort<00:03:23.960> of<00:03:23.990> collect<00:03:24.380> here<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.770> it<00:03:24.830> will<00:03:24.920> rust

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
sort of collect here and it will rust

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.790 
sort of collect here and it will rust
away<00:03:25.460> you'll<00:03:26.300> get<00:03:26.450> leaks<00:03:26.690> in<00:03:26.870> here<00:03:27.230> in<00:03:27.380> here

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
away you'll get leaks in here in here

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.020 
away you'll get leaks in here in here
obviously<00:03:28.010> if<00:03:28.490> there's<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.760> puncture

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
obviously if there's a puncture

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.500 
obviously if there's a puncture
somewhere<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:31.430> got<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.670> see<00:03:31.790> them<00:03:31.850> around

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
somewhere you got to see them around

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.440 
somewhere you got to see them around
these<00:03:32.750> um<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.890> edges<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.460> the<00:03:34.550> neck<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:35.000> some

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
these um the edges of the neck of some

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.530 
these um the edges of the neck of some
of<00:03:35.510> these<00:03:35.600> pipes<00:03:36.760> all<00:03:37.760> kinds<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:38.180> places<00:03:38.510> you

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
of these pipes all kinds of places you

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.300 
of these pipes all kinds of places you
can<00:03:38.630> get<00:03:38.870> leaks<00:03:39.110> but<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:39.800> is<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:39.950> really<00:03:40.130> good

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
can get leaks but this is a really good

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.560 
can get leaks but this is a really good
way<00:03:40.460> to<00:03:40.520> test<00:03:40.820> it<00:03:41.000> before<00:03:41.240> you<00:03:41.330> put<00:03:41.420> on<00:03:41.480> your

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
way to test it before you put on your

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.300 
way to test it before you put on your
bike<00:03:41.870> so<00:03:42.170> if<00:03:42.290> you<00:03:42.380> need<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.620> return<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.100> your

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
bike so if you need to return it to your

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.790 
bike so if you need to return it to your
eBay<00:03:43.550> seller<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.840> get<00:03:45.050> a<00:03:45.080> refund<00:03:45.320> or<00:03:45.680> get

another one this is a really good way to

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.010 
another one this is a really good way to
do<00:03:47.600> that<00:03:47.780> before<00:03:48.700> before<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:49.730> Boyd<00:03:50.000> your<00:03:50.300> you
