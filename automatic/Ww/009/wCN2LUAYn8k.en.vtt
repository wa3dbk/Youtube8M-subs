 chip bestlist the new sony xperia z4 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.400
 has everything a modern tablet can offer 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.890
 must with its ultra-compact design 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.430
 it is even thinner and lighter than that 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.109
 current ipad r2 and linz still 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.870
 through an extremely high quality 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.750
 processing 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.120
 with its super sharp resolution 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.550
 delivers the 10.1 inch display brilliant 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.190
 colors and class readings also the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.640
 equipment convinced faster wlan ac 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.250
 and lte radio nfc as well as a usb to go 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.710
 currently offers hardly any other device in 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.030
 this flat design 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.580
 only minus point are the terms 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.950
 not even six hours stops the z4 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.020
 with a charge through and the charging time 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.559
 is just about five hours long 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.300
 too long 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.579
 that can make the competition better 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.129
 that of google nexus 9 is one of the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.530
 Currently the fastest tablets it will be from 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.600
 smartphone specialists htc made 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.409
 and offers the brand new as standard 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.180
 Android 5.0 lollipop hardware goes 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.820
 the manufacturer makes no compromises and 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.880
 donates the 8 9 inch tablet the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.619
 probably the strongest system-on-a-chip basis that 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.259
 display is a maximum of 2048 x 1536 pixels in the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.920
 4 3 format to the equivalent of one 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.020
 pixel density of 288 ppi but there are 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.930
 also weak points the google nexus 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.149
 new does not own any micro sd slot 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.009

 Powerful tablet is possible 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.979

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.280
 The price is for the offered service 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.220
 The dell venue proves to be a fair test 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.259
 8 as a real surprise that 8.4 inches 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.170
 tablet scores with an amoled display 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.759
 brisk handling and great mobility 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.750
 keeps a battery in the cut around 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.310

 evaluation very good in our price 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.459
 Performance category nice extra

 a total of four cameras installed dell im 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.289
 Eight alone three of them on the 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.599
 backside are needed for intel 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.130
 to real sense technique when recording 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.599
 a photo with several cameras 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.400

 capture and so the sharpness of photos in the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.489
