00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:13.889
 may one or the other think that 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.480
 Kenner of course tries now I am 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.950
 disabled to recognize in the air 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.950
 Foreigners come out afford 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.500
 and at that time there was either only one half 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.430
 running mobile continues like that but not 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.850
 there but despite this size is 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.620
 this track operated electrically so 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.320
 look now was exactly in the red 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 mind is already considerable 2 beta 64 of 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.970
 to grasp it 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.240
 that's no pictures 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:56.240
 he wins directly but was then 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.250
 he knows pads 20 kilograms of hair lives 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.990
 lifted and that is meanwhile 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.450
 possible that is of course possible 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.890
 electrically even such big models 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.870
 We start working out for everyone 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.320
 Tech-interested twice twelve it 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.320
 batteries are 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.860
 currently modern electronics has us 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.590
 of course made possible there is a lot 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.040
 powerful calculator now more beautiful 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.040
 space 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.030
 that this is possible is not yet 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.459
 too many years of the fall 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.900
 The model flying became a bit 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.120
 I'll say six seven eight 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.930
 years revolutionized after the advent 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.430
 the modern battery this all by now 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.319
 in her smartphone to have her 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.620
 tablets or wherever their laptops 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.720
 The lithium polymer battery technology, the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.700
 Lithium ion sits at your home 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.819
 in smartphones or laptops and 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.650
 finally fits the right ones are the 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.900
 ergo here are the world lie 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.310
 simple, the record is 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.620
 much stronger weight high 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.720
 high power and many very high 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.769
 award tax that is of course ideal 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.659
 then there are fits to expect fairly 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.750
 per engine these are in principle 33 per 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.819
 Motor again work the model and 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.400
 which are very powerful 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.920
 silent and they have the card 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.340
 directly profifereich large course 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.340
 some gram answer revolutionized 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.780
 styrofoam leadership and that, too 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.630
 Electrically this has proved us 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.580
 with a roseanne the trailer and 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.300
 Esther Schipper technically still with 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.069
 number browser 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.849
 showing us have the very first 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.849
 yes, it's already here in front
