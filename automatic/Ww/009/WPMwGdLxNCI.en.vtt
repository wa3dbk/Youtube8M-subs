first was the motorola backflip which
wasn't<00:00:16.949> all<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.220> great<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.180> far<00:00:18.359> the

aria is a huge improvement take a look
at<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> design<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:22.080> as<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.039> see<00:00:23.189> it's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
at the design first as you can see it's

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.340 
at the design first as you can see it's
quite<00:00:23.519> small<00:00:23.850> especially<00:00:24.390> when<00:00:24.720> compared<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
quite small especially when compared to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.439 
quite small especially when compared to
something<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.920> evo<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:26.970> cute<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
something like the evo but it's cute and

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.150 
something like the evo but it's cute and
definitely<00:00:27.810> easier<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.320> slip<00:00:28.529> into<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.859> pants

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
definitely easier to slip into a pants

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.980 
definitely easier to slip into a pants
pocket<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.699> more<00:00:29.849> comfortable<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.570> hold<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
pocket and more comfortable to hold as a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.139 
pocket and more comfortable to hold as a
phone<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.590> even<00:00:32.340> though<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.610> small<00:00:32.759> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
phone and even though it's small it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.700 
phone and even though it's small it
feels<00:00:33.390> quite<00:00:33.570> solid<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.079> has<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> soft<00:00:34.530> touch

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
feels quite solid and has a soft touch

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
finish here on the back one kind of cool

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840 
finish here on the back one kind of cool
but<00:00:37.410> totally<00:00:37.829> superficial<00:00:38.250> thing<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.730> that

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
but totally superficial thing is that

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.250

when<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> take<00:00:39.270> off<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> back<00:00:39.750> cover<00:00:40.020> you'll

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
when you take off the back cover you'll

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
when you take off the back cover you'll
see<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.739> inside<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.340> phone<00:00:41.520> is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
yellow now the one downside of the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.369 
yellow now the one downside of the
smaller<00:00:44.250> size<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> smaller<00:00:45.300> display<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
smaller size is a smaller display the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260

diagonally and it's got a hvd a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.819 
diagonally and it's got a hvd a
resolution<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> sharpest<00:00:51.930> but

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
resolution so it's not the sharpest but

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.229 
resolution so it's not the sharpest but
i<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> say<00:00:53.250> overall<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> smaller<00:00:54.000> size

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
