and<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.480> these<00:00:36.660> these<00:00:36.989> corners<00:00:37.469> that

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
and you get these these corners that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.440 
and you get these these corners that
really<00:00:37.860> don't<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.340> great<00:00:38.520> bottom<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
really don't look that great bottom of

really don't look that great bottom of
course<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.809> also<00:00:40.050> not<00:00:40.410> very<00:00:40.440> paintable<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.730> if

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
course is also not very paintable so if

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.979 
course is also not very paintable so if
you<00:00:41.910> decide<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> don't<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.480> your<00:00:42.719> frame

right<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.420> actually<00:01:30.570> does<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.229> some

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
right here so it actually does have some

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.039 
right here so it actually does have some
vinyl<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.970> mixed<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.600> wood

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
vinyl in it but it's mixed with wood

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.109 
vinyl in it but it's mixed with wood
fibers<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> ends<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> product

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
fibers so it ends up with a product

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
fibers so it ends up with a product
that's<00:01:36.270> similar<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> trex<00:01:37.470> deck<00:01:37.770> not

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
that's similar to like a trex deck not

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.179 
that's similar to like a trex deck not
quite<00:01:39.090> as<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:40.049> quite<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.560> strong<00:01:40.920> as

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
quite as not quite as strong as

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.620 
quite as not quite as strong as
fiberglass<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.000> still<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.299> good

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
fiberglass but still a really good

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
fiberglass but still a really good
choice<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.680> Marvin<00:01:44.070> makes<00:01:44.280> an

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
choice and then Marvin makes an

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.399 
choice and then Marvin makes an
integrity<00:01:44.790> line<00:01:45.180> that's<00:01:45.840> meant<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.200> compete

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
integrity line that's meant to compete

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.200 
integrity line that's meant to compete
with<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.979> more<00:01:47.189> expensive<00:01:47.460> wood<00:01:47.820> windows

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
with the more expensive wood windows

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 
with the more expensive wood windows
where<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.960> fiberglass<00:01:49.500> frame<00:01:49.860> but

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
where it's a fiberglass frame but

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.350 
where it's a fiberglass frame but
they're<00:01:50.189> actually<00:01:50.340> cladding<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:50.970> inside

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
they're actually cladding the inside

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.359 
they're actually cladding the inside
with<00:01:51.540> wood<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.439> get<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> really<00:01:52.979> pretty

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
with wood so you get a really pretty

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.560 
with wood so you get a really pretty
window<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.880> looks<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> very

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
window that looks like a very

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.330 
window that looks like a very
traditional<00:01:54.899> window<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.979> inside

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
traditional window that on the inside

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
traditional window that on the inside
but<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.939> still<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.479> impervious

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
but you still have that impervious

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
but you still have that impervious
fiberglass<00:01:58.740> frame<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.640> little<00:01:59.820> bit<00:01:59.939> lower

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
fiberglass frame and a little bit lower

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.810 
fiberglass frame and a little bit lower
price<00:02:00.450> point<00:02:00.750> as<00:02:00.869> well<00:02:01.579> there's<00:02:02.579> two

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
price point as well there's two

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.459 
price point as well there's two
different<00:02:02.969> types<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.570> aluminum<00:02:03.810> windows<00:02:04.320> that

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
different types of aluminum windows that

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.440 
different types of aluminum windows that
you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.740> buy<00:02:04.890> there's<00:02:05.549> kind<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.939> lower-cost

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
you can buy there's kind of a lower-cost

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.270 
you can buy there's kind of a lower-cost
aluminum<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.649> course<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:08.160> can

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
aluminum and then of course you can

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.680 
aluminum and then of course you can
spend<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> lot<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.879> money<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.179> similar<00:02:09.539> MO

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
spend a lot of money on similar MO

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.930 
spend a lot of money on similar MO
windows<00:02:10.080> but<00:02:10.770> no<00:02:10.950> matter<00:02:11.099> which<00:02:11.340> aluminum

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
windows but no matter which aluminum

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.430 
windows but no matter which aluminum
you're<00:02:12.060> thinking<00:02:12.450> about<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.900> really<00:02:13.200> want

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
you're thinking about you really want

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.140 
you're thinking about you really want
get<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.560> thermally<00:02:13.980> broken<00:02:14.130> don't<00:02:14.880> even

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
get a thermally broken don't even

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.790 
get a thermally broken don't even
consider<00:02:15.420> aluminum<00:02:15.930> if<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.170> can't<00:02:16.410> find<00:02:16.620> one

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
consider aluminum if you can't find one

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.170 
consider aluminum if you can't find one
that<00:02:16.980> doesn't<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.550> thermal<00:02:17.940> break

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that doesn't have this thermal break

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.450 
that doesn't have this thermal break
right<00:02:18.390> here<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:19.080> little<00:02:19.260> plastic<00:02:19.980> spacer

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
right here that little plastic spacer

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.250 
right here that little plastic spacer
that's<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.790> there<00:02:21.000> some<00:02:21.630> type<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.960> composite

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
that's in there some type of composite

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.720 
that's in there some type of composite
material<00:02:22.860> that's<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.160> there<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.460> don't<00:02:23.580> know

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
material that's in there I don't know

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.700 
material that's in there I don't know
exactly<00:02:23.910> but<00:02:24.300> it's<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.630> plastic<00:02:25.110> it's

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
exactly but it's a plastic it's

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.710 
exactly but it's a plastic it's
separating<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.490> outside<00:02:26.910> aluminum<00:02:27.360> from<00:02:27.600> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
separating the outside aluminum from the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.780 
separating the outside aluminum from the
inside<00:02:28.140> aluminum<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.770> what<00:02:29.190> that's<00:02:29.370> doing<00:02:29.550> is

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
inside aluminum and what that's doing is

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.280 
inside aluminum and what that's doing is
of<00:02:29.970> course<00:02:30.180> aluminum<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.720> great<00:02:31.050> conductor

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
of course aluminum is a great conductor

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.830 
of course aluminum is a great conductor
of<00:02:31.590> heat<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.460> electricity<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:33.390> used<00:02:33.630> for

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
of heat and electricity it's used for

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.560 
of heat and electricity it's used for
wiring<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.070> spacer<00:02:35.610> is<00:02:35.790> keeping<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.390> two

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
wiring so that spacer is keeping the two

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.720 
wiring so that spacer is keeping the two
layers<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.230> aluminum<00:02:37.350> away<00:02:38.250> from<00:02:38.460> each<00:02:38.580> other

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
layers of aluminum away from each other

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.880 
layers of aluminum away from each other
so<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.360> can<00:02:39.600> get<00:02:39.720> some<00:02:39.930> okay<00:02:40.470> performance

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
so you can get some okay performance

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.650 
so you can get some okay performance
thermally<00:02:41.490> from<00:02:41.670> these<00:02:41.820> not<00:02:42.060> as<00:02:42.240> good<00:02:42.390> as<00:02:42.540> some

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
thermally from these not as good as some

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.320 
thermally from these not as good as some
of<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.840> others<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:43.200> okay<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.920> then<00:02:44.850> lastly

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
of the others but okay and then lastly

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.900 
of the others but okay and then lastly
is<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.780> wood<00:02:46.200> window<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.800> love<00:02:47.280> wood<00:02:47.520> windows

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
is a wood window a love wood windows

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.700 
is a wood window a love wood windows
I've<00:02:48.180> used<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.570> lot<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.870> Marvin<00:02:49.200> windows<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.650> my

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
I've used a lot of Marvin windows and my

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.050 
I've used a lot of Marvin windows and my
houses<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.280> past<00:02:50.490> there's<00:02:50.790> some<00:02:50.910> other

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
houses in the past there's some other

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.970 
houses in the past there's some other
good<00:02:51.240> brands<00:02:51.540> out<00:02:51.750> there<00:02:51.930> as<00:02:52.050> well<00:02:52.260> but<00:02:52.920> a

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
good brands out there as well but a

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.910 
good brands out there as well but a
modern<00:02:53.460> wood<00:02:53.730> window<00:02:54.120> has<00:02:54.390> things<00:02:54.990> done<00:02:55.890> a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
modern wood window has things done a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.680 
modern wood window has things done a
little<00:02:56.340> bit<00:02:56.490> differently<00:02:56.880> from<00:02:57.060> construction

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
little bit differently from construction

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.050 
little bit differently from construction
of<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:58.020> last<00:02:58.620> from<00:02:59.250> your<00:02:59.400> grandfather's<00:02:59.880> wood

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
of a last from your grandfather's wood

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.270 
of a last from your grandfather's wood
window<00:03:00.360> let's<00:03:00.600> say<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:01.470> look<00:03:01.620> at<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:01.890> cross

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
window let's say so look at this cross

window let's say so look at this cross
section<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.820> Marvin<00:03:03.210> we've<00:03:03.360> got<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.570> wood

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
section of this Marvin we've got a wood

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.110 
section of this Marvin we've got a wood
frame<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.440> here<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.310> inside<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.880> very

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
frame on here so the inside is very

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.110 
frame on here so the inside is very
traditional<00:03:06.450> very<00:03:07.200> pretty<00:03:07.500> wood<00:03:07.770> but<00:03:08.700> look<00:03:09.000> at

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
traditional very pretty wood but look at

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.810 
traditional very pretty wood but look at
the<00:03:09.210> outside<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:09.870> been<00:03:10.130> it's<00:03:11.130> been<00:03:11.220> bonded

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
the outside it's been it's been bonded

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.870 
the outside it's been it's been bonded
to<00:03:12.330> an<00:03:12.450> aluminum<00:03:12.750> outside<00:03:13.500> skin<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.370> that

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
to an aluminum outside skin and that

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.490 
to an aluminum outside skin and that
aluminum<00:03:15.300> is<00:03:15.450> typically<00:03:15.900> either<00:03:16.080> powder

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
aluminum is typically either powder

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.949 
aluminum is typically either powder
coated<00:03:16.980> or<00:03:17.100> painted<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.180> we've<00:03:18.360> got<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.720> finish

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
coated or painted so we've got to finish

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.720 
coated or painted so we've got to finish
on<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.320> outside<00:03:19.680> here<00:03:19.890> that's<00:03:20.100> been<00:03:20.250> factory

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
on the outside here that's been factory

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.520 
on the outside here that's been factory
finished<00:03:21.180> basically<00:03:21.660> it's<00:03:22.080> going<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.320> last

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
finished basically it's going to last

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.800 
finished basically it's going to last
almost<00:03:23.010> forever<00:03:23.489> this<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.270> really<00:03:24.660> good

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
almost forever this is a really good

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.600 
almost forever this is a really good
product<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.770> course<00:03:25.980> has<00:03:26.160> great<00:03:26.430> thermal

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
product and of course has great thermal

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.270 
product and of course has great thermal
performance<00:03:26.940> it's<00:03:27.780> probably<00:03:28.380> besides<00:03:29.010> some

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
performance it's probably besides some

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.530 
performance it's probably besides some
of<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.400> high<00:03:29.610> end<00:03:29.640> aluminum<00:03:30.150> it's<00:03:30.239> probably

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
of the high end aluminum it's probably

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.150 
of the high end aluminum it's probably
the<00:03:30.630> most<00:03:31.110> expensive<00:03:31.530> window<00:03:31.920> you're<00:03:32.040> going
