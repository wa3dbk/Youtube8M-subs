that's<00:00:37.500> fun<00:00:37.980> i<00:00:38.010> guess<00:00:38.489> i<00:00:38.700> actually<00:00:39.120> cook<00:00:39.300> for

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that's fun i guess i actually cook for

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.990 
that's fun i guess i actually cook for
the<00:00:39.540> volt<00:00:39.750> switch<00:00:40.160> because<00:00:41.160> i<00:00:41.399> felt<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.700> from

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the volt switch because i felt like from

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.490 
the volt switch because i felt like from
that<00:00:42.149> range<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.780> know<00:00:42.870> volts<00:00:43.170> which<00:00:43.320> would

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that range you know volts which would

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.990 
that range you know volts which would
have<00:00:43.559> been<00:00:43.620> able<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.980> kill<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.610> works<00:00:44.850> out

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
have been able to kill that works out

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.029 
have been able to kill that works out
perfectly<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.660> me<00:00:45.899> even<00:00:46.500> though<00:00:46.680> i<00:00:46.770> didn't

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
perfectly for me even though i didn't

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.840 
perfectly for me even though i didn't
predict<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.730> all<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.930> that's<00:00:49.110> fine<00:00:49.850> ivory

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
predict that at all so that's fine ivory

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.889 
predict that at all so that's fine ivory
and<00:00:51.000> scissor<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.309> scissor<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:54.480> just

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
and scissor now and scissor is just

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.209 
and scissor now and scissor is just
going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> try<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.739> ball<00:00:55.890> punch

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
going to try and go for the ball punch

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.150 
going to try and go for the ball punch

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
want to like date and go for the utrom

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.569 
want to like date and go for the utrom
when<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.590> thing<00:01:01.620> could<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.010> easily<00:01:02.219> gone

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
when that thing could have easily gone

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.640 
when that thing could have easily gone
for<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.300> served<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.140> something<00:01:04.470> or<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
hydro pump and do a lot of damage and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.000 
hydro pump and do a lot of damage and
possibly<00:01:06.630> knocked<00:01:06.869> me<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> want<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010

there so now I'm just gonna go to
metagross<00:04:01.200> that's<00:04:02.200> fine<00:04:02.500> I<00:04:02.530> guess<00:04:02.860> as<00:04:03.100> I<00:04:03.940> just

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
metagross that's fine I guess as I just

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.580 
metagross that's fine I guess as I just
decided<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.690> go<00:04:04.780> for<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:04.989> rights<00:04:05.200> because<00:04:05.440> I

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
decided to go for the rights because I

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.700 
decided to go for the rights because I
was<00:04:05.680> predicting<00:04:06.160> him<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.340> go<00:04:06.459> for

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
was predicting him to go for

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.160 
was predicting him to go for
you<00:04:06.830> turn<00:04:07.070> anyways<00:04:07.400> because<00:04:07.610> there<00:04:07.820> isn't<00:04:08.240> too

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
you turn anyways because there isn't too

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.230 
you turn anyways because there isn't too
much<00:04:09.230> he<00:04:09.680> could<00:04:09.920> have<00:04:10.010> done<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.250> me<00:04:10.580> and<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:10.940> felt

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
much he could have done to me and I felt

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.090 
much he could have done to me and I felt
pretty<00:04:11.480> safe<00:04:11.780> just<00:04:12.020> going<00:04:12.290> for<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.500> rest<00:04:12.740> and

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
pretty safe just going for the rest and

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.670 
pretty safe just going for the rest and
now<00:04:13.730> better<00:04:14.390> grosses<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:14.990> Metagross<00:04:15.410> is<00:04:15.560> like

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
now better grosses and Metagross is like

now better grosses and Metagross is like
huge<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:17.080> gigantic<00:04:18.080> pair<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:18.740> wrote<00:04:19.040> him<00:04:19.190> I

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
huge a gigantic pair to wrote him I

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.260 
huge a gigantic pair to wrote him I
believe<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.590> goes<00:04:21.770> for<00:04:22.250> those<00:04:22.550> own<00:04:22.730> head<00:04:23.000> but

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
believe it goes for those own head but

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.080 
believe it goes for those own head but

was pure just able to burn this thing so
i<00:04:28.910> have<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.180> worry<00:04:29.690> about<00:04:29.780> too<00:04:30.410> much<00:04:30.680> later<00:04:31.040> on

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
i have to worry about too much later on

i have to worry about too much later on
um<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:32.390> then<00:04:32.750> made<00:04:33.620> just<00:04:33.920> a<00:04:34.070> little<00:04:34.550> bit

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
um and then made just a little bit

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.100 
um and then made just a little bit
easier<00:04:35.120> to<00:04:35.240> get<00:04:35.360> rid<00:04:35.510> of<00:04:35.540> I<00:04:35.750> don't<00:04:35.870> know<00:04:35.930> why

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
easier to get rid of I don't know why

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.290 
easier to get rid of I don't know why
you<00:04:36.170> went<00:04:36.320> for<00:04:36.530> rock<00:04:36.650> slide<00:04:36.920> I<00:04:37.040> mean<00:04:37.280> maybe<00:04:38.000> he

you went for rock slide I mean maybe he

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.880 
you went for rock slide I mean maybe he
should<00:04:38.570> just<00:04:38.690> try<00:04:39.170> to<00:04:39.230> flinch<00:04:39.530> me<00:04:39.710> at<00:04:39.800> this

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
should just try to flinch me at this

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.800 
should just try to flinch me at this
point<00:04:40.100> which<00:04:40.400> is<00:04:40.430> like<00:04:40.760> okay<00:04:41.120> whatever<00:04:41.330> I<00:04:41.570> just

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
point which is like okay whatever I just

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.200 
point which is like okay whatever I just
go<00:04:41.930> for<00:04:41.960> hydro<00:04:42.320> pump<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:43.490> does<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:43.670> decent<00:04:43.910> body

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
go for hydro pump it does a decent body

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.240 
go for hydro pump it does a decent body
damage<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:45.260> looks<00:04:45.500> like<00:04:45.590> actually

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
damage and it looks like actually

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.890 
damage and it looks like actually
metagross<00:04:46.670> is<00:04:46.820> gonna<00:04:47.000> die<00:04:47.210> after<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:47.750> burn

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
metagross is gonna die after the burn

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.030 
metagross is gonna die after the burn
damage<00:04:48.140> so<00:04:48.380> I<00:04:48.410> don't<00:04:48.530> have<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.680> worry<00:04:48.920> about

not<00:05:30.560> exactly<00:05:31.130> sure<00:05:31.370> as<00:05:31.670> to<00:05:31.700> why<00:05:32.000> he<00:05:32.330> didn't

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
not exactly sure as to why he didn't

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.390 
not exactly sure as to why he didn't
just<00:05:32.570> go<00:05:32.780> for<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:33.020> waterfall<00:05:33.440> or<00:05:33.470> anything<00:05:33.920> but

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
just go for a waterfall or anything but

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.830 
just go for a waterfall or anything but
this<00:05:34.550> thing<00:05:34.730> actually<00:05:34.820> turns<00:05:35.150> to<00:05:35.330> be<00:05:35.420> physical

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
this thing actually turns to be physical

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.430 
this thing actually turns to be physical
too<00:05:36.050> so<00:05:36.500> I<00:05:37.220> guess<00:05:37.430> I<00:05:37.790> was<00:05:37.910> thinking<00:05:37.940> just

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
too so I guess I was thinking just

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.890 
too so I guess I was thinking just
thinking<00:05:39.440> of<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.770> because<00:05:40.280> uh<00:05:40.660> well<00:05:41.660> he

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
thinking of that because uh well he

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.590 
thinking of that because uh well he
knows<00:05:42.080> I'm<00:05:42.290> prankster<00:05:42.860> but<00:05:43.520> if<00:05:43.970> I<00:05:44.270> wanted<00:05:44.540> to

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
knows I'm prankster but if I wanted to

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.750 
knows I'm prankster but if I wanted to
go<00:05:44.780> for<00:05:44.990> physical<00:05:45.500> move<00:05:45.710> I<00:05:45.980> probably<00:05:46.460> would

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
go for physical move I probably would

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.100 
go for physical move I probably would
have<00:05:46.820> got<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.120> foul<00:05:47.300> play<00:05:47.540> and<00:05:47.750> that<00:05:47.870> still

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
have got the foul play and that still

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.090 
have got the foul play and that still
goes<00:05:48.260> after<00:05:48.410> protein<00:05:49.480> so<00:05:50.480> I<00:05:51.080> mean<00:05:51.380> it's<00:05:51.980> not

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
goes after protein so I mean it's not

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.190 
goes after protein so I mean it's not
like<00:05:52.190> it<00:05:52.370> matters<00:05:52.400> now<00:05:52.820> but<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:54.080> would<00:05:54.170> have

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
like it matters now but that would have

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.390 
like it matters now but that would have
been<00:05:54.320> a<00:05:54.410> little<00:05:54.500> bit<00:05:54.680> of<00:05:54.800> closer<00:05:55.070> King

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
been a little bit of closer King

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.050 
been a little bit of closer King
obviously<00:05:56.060> and<00:05:56.830> you<00:05:57.830> know<00:05:57.980> I<00:05:58.460> don't<00:05:58.850> know<00:05:59.030> I

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
obviously and you know I don't know I

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.150 
obviously and you know I don't know I
mean<00:05:59.360> it<00:05:59.810> was<00:06:00.050> a<00:06:00.110> 20<00:06:00.320> still<00:06:00.680> and<00:06:00.890> it<00:06:01.010> was<00:06:01.100> a

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
mean it was a 20 still and it was a

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.280 
mean it was a 20 still and it was a
quick<00:06:01.340> game<00:06:01.520> that's<00:06:01.910> fine<00:06:02.180> and<00:06:02.990> I<00:06:03.230> still

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
quick game that's fine and I still

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.670 
quick game that's fine and I still
believe<00:06:03.740> I<00:06:04.010> had<00:06:04.310> a<00:06:04.520> reuniclus<00:06:05.060> left<00:06:05.600> but<00:06:06.350> other

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
believe I had a reuniclus left but other

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.050 
believe I had a reuniclus left but other
than<00:06:06.860> that<00:06:06.920> I<00:06:07.100> didn't<00:06:07.370> really<00:06:07.490> have<00:06:07.670> much<00:06:07.700> else

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
than that I didn't really have much else

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.160 
than that I didn't really have much else
left<00:06:08.330> stuff<00:06:08.630> died<00:06:08.990> quickly<00:06:09.470> very<00:06:10.250> quickly<00:06:10.340> um

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
left stuff died quickly very quickly um

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.830 
left stuff died quickly very quickly um
but<00:06:12.170> from<00:06:12.920> that<00:06:12.950> range<00:06:13.280> you<00:06:13.760> know<00:06:13.910> clucky
