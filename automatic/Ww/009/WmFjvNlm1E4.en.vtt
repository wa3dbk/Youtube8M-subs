start<00:02:09.539> messing<00:02:09.869> around<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.769> width<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
start messing around with the width and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.039 
start messing around with the width and
height<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:11.790> picture<00:02:12.299> you're<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:12.959> to

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
height of your picture you're going to

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.630 
height of your picture you're going to
skew<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:13.769> going<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> look<00:02:14.190> really

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
skew it and it's going to look really

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.229 
skew it and it's going to look really
weird

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
weird

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.080 
weird
so<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.959> first<00:02:16.200> thing<00:02:16.409> that<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.620> do<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:17.849> take

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
so the first thing that I do is I take

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.070 
so the first thing that I do is I take
the<00:02:18.299> lowest<00:02:18.750> number<00:02:19.730> which<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.910> 340<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.690> I'm

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
the lowest number which is 340 and I'm

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.680 
the lowest number which is 340 and I'm
going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.260> turn<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.680> into<00:02:22.740> 115<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.510> what

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
going to turn that into 115 and so what

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.430 
going to turn that into 115 and so what
that<00:02:24.840> does<00:02:25.080> is

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
that does is

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.050 
that does is
that's<00:02:25.650> going<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.980> reduce<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.460> image<00:02:26.700> but

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
that's going to reduce the image but

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.880 
that's going to reduce the image but
it's<00:02:27.210> going<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.420> keep<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.930> dimensions<00:02:28.650> so

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
it's going to keep the dimensions so

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.240 
it's going to keep the dimensions so
you'll<00:02:29.400> see<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.210> height<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.540> now<00:02:31.020> 180<00:02:31.680> so

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
you'll see that the height is now 180 so

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.200 
you'll see that the height is now 180 so
we'll<00:02:32.430> click<00:02:32.640> OK

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
we'll click OK

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.920 
we'll click OK
and<00:02:33.710> now<00:02:34.710> you'll<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.490> photo<00:02:35.760> here<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.600> a

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and now you'll see the photo here is a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.470

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
look at the Navigator here on the right

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.810 
look at the Navigator here on the right
hand<00:03:18.630> side<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.500> will<00:03:20.070> notice<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.610> width

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
hand side and you will notice the width

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.150 
hand side and you will notice the width
and<00:03:21.060> height<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:22.080> first<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.650> all<00:03:22.770> we<00:03:22.980> know<00:03:23.130> that

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
and height so first of all we know that

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.420 
and height so first of all we know that
the<00:03:23.340> width<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.850> 118<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.140> can<00:03:25.620> just<00:03:25.860> put<00:03:26.280> my

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
the width is 118 so I can just put my

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.940 
the width is 118 so I can just put my
cursor<00:03:26.940> anywhere<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.960> drag<00:03:28.380> all<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.920> way

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
across as far as it will go and if you

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.990 
across as far as it will go and if you
look<00:03:31.770> over<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.250> right<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.640> look<00:03:32.730> at<00:03:32.910> the

look over to the right and look at the
Navigator<00:03:33.570> you'll<00:03:33.870> see<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.470> width<00:03:34.680> is

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
Navigator you'll see that the width is

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.449 
Navigator you'll see that the width is
115<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.570> don't<00:03:36.720> have<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.989> worry<00:03:37.230> about<00:03:37.459> the
