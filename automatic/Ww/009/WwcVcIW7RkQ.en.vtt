00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.900
 who has done anything 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.760
 almost full 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.449
 I am going to start 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:09.579
 with Isabel 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.719
 quickly 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.039
 I want to congratulate 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.829
 to your singing teacher, who is the Montesan bighead 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.869
 and his excellent work 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.249
 because this topic is difficult to be able to buy it. Mr. 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.279
 Sitges mentioned it to him that is of love, we say montesano cabezón never 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 has highlighted 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.930
 ferreri or jorge montesano cabezón montesano rienzi we both refer to 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.480
 do with the human torch that people will see that march I had so clear 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.019
 prob yes yes yes 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.019
 I wanted Jorge Bolzano 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.520
 quickly 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.120
 this tragic tuning in some parts when I was going up the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.900
 stairs only the monitoring was not correct when another state came out at 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.690
 stage she 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.170
 the year leaves the monitoring 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.970
 but they are things that happen 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.080
 I tried to get used to 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.100
 of the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.100
 Benjamin 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.930
 things correctly 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.159
 I congratulate you on tuning the performance square above the stage 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.159
 Alicia 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.310
 still when before singing 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.060
 I had to try to take things slowly, I think you were 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.180
 excellent percent in a matter of after excellent actress but I think that 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.979
 in which you could also do better on a subject that is not difficult to sing 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.660
 because Solomon is hard to sing 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.880
 neuquen then percent isabel 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.630
 as Chávez says that song is not easy to sing that's why it's not 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.909
 easy to sing and yet 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.310
 well, having been a little bit after a lot of strength and with both 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.720
 they had a lot of strength 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.720
 sanitation level a lot of citizens 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.819
 the Union 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.619
 the unstoppable disaster is true 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.349
 ep is very difficult for them to remember 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.689
 a number on the street where they have sung comes packed well joel 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.689
 gonzález 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.599
 unfortunately with you the possible 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.959
 the charming 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.679
 that would have sustained the song until the end 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:39.659
 and you had three quarters of the song well sung and well danced from a 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.249
 moment that you did not know you have certified the big stage 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:44.709
 especially 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.659
 Well, that's why I'm looking at that because here 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.439
 you have to do it right until the end 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.999
 not half 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.249
 we'll see 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.409
 the energy that they spread 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.099
 predictably with individual visits of the song very well and if you did not know 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.159
 and then 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.559
 guillén has sentenced 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:09.089
 in 2010 Spain
