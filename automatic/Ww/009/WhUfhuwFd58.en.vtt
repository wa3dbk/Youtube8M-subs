00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
washing my hair out and I washed my hair

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.679 
washing my hair out and I washed my hair
about<00:01:56.270> not<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.390> two<00:01:57.570> weeks<00:01:57.719> ago<00:01:59.540> it<00:02:00.540> was

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
about not like two weeks ago it was

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.139 
about not like two weeks ago it was
really<00:02:01.170> dirty<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.520> don't<00:02:02.670> think<00:02:02.880> it's

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
really dirty and I I don't think it's

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.060 
really dirty and I I don't think it's
because<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.509> washed<00:02:04.049> my<00:02:04.259> hair<00:02:04.380> two<00:02:04.590> weeks<00:02:04.770> ago<00:02:05.040> I

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
because I washed my hair two weeks ago I

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.850 
because I washed my hair two weeks ago I
think<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.579> because<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.860> detergent

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
think it was because the detergent

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.119 
think it was because the detergent
because<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.670> degreaser<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.500> took<00:02:10.920> out

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
because the degreaser it just took out

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.570 
because the degreaser it just took out
all<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
all of the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.230 
all of the
grease<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.060> gunk<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.700> buildup<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.060> was

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
grease and gunk and buildup but that was

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.560 
grease and gunk and buildup but that was
in<00:02:17.450> my<00:02:17.630> locks<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.790> felt<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.210> huge

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
in my locks and I just felt that a huge

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.830

like<00:03:54.560> kind<00:03:54.800> of<00:03:54.860> hard<00:03:55.040> at<00:03:55.280> times<00:03:55.459> but<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.239> realize

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
like kind of hard at times but I realize

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.020 
like kind of hard at times but I realize
now<00:03:57.080> that<00:03:57.110> it<00:03:57.739> was<00:03:57.890> just<00:03:58.160> because<00:03:58.489> like<00:03:58.730> the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
now that it was just because like the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.570 
now that it was just because like the
shampoo<00:03:59.480> that<00:03:59.630> I<00:03:59.750> was<00:03:59.930> using<00:04:00.320> all<00:04:01.100> there<00:04:01.400> was<00:04:01.519> a

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
shampoo that I was using all there was a

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.670 
shampoo that I was using all there was a
clarifying<00:04:02.180> shampoo<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:03.080> really<00:04:03.440> wasn't

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
clarifying shampoo it really wasn't

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.449 
clarifying shampoo it really wasn't
getting<00:04:03.980> in<00:04:04.780> my<00:04:05.780> lock<00:04:06.350> like<00:04:06.769> in<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.160> middle

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
getting in my lock like in the middle

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.180 
getting in my lock like in the middle
and<00:04:07.820> that's<00:04:08.810> something<00:04:09.110> that<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.470> really

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
and that's something that I really

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.070 
and that's something that I really
realized<00:04:10.670> with<00:04:11.120> locks<00:04:11.510> in<00:04:11.750> general<00:04:12.170> is<00:04:12.350> that

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
realized with locks in general is that

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.759 
realized with locks in general is that
people<00:04:15.080> at<00:04:15.230> locs

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.120 
people at locs
I<00:04:16.359> personally<00:04:17.359> don't<00:04:17.900> think<00:04:17.989> that<00:04:18.440> we<00:04:18.650> can<00:04:18.859> use

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
I personally don't think that we can use

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.300 
I personally don't think that we can use
the<00:04:19.400> same<00:04:19.750> shampoo<00:04:20.750> as<00:04:21.260> people<00:04:21.830> lose<00:04:22.070> heat

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
the same shampoo as people lose heat

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.219 
the same shampoo as people lose heat
like<00:04:23.090> we<00:04:23.240> really<00:04:23.479> mean<00:04:23.750> something<00:04:24.140> that's

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
like we really mean something that's

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.390 
like we really mean something that's
gonna<00:04:24.440> be<00:04:24.620> strong<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:25.130> know
